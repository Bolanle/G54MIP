&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc ONXX.O, whose cancer drugs promise a strong revenue stream, is attracting preliminary buyout interest from several large pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), two people familiar with the matter said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onyx, a biotechnology company with a market value of around $9.5 billion, put itself up for sale on Sunday, citing "expressions of interest" from unnamed companies. It also said it had rejected a recent $8.7 billion offer from larger biotech Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) as too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which is due to pay Onyx royalties on a promising experimental breast cancer drug, and Novartis, with a strong franchise of cancer medicines, are among the parties interested in Onyx and its portfolio of marketed cancer treatments, the two sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen's $120-per-share offer in June was its first and the company did not indicate if it was the best and final, according to a third person familiar with the matter, who expected Amgen to participate in the auction process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer represented a 38 percent premium to Onyx's Friday closing share price of $86.82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onyx surged 51.3 percent to close at $131.33 on Nasdaq on Monday, well above Amgen's offer, suggesting investors expect bids to go much higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Onyx could appeal to a wider group of large biotech and pharmaceutical companies, including Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and Merck &amp; Co (MRK.N), several people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the sources in this story were not authorized to speak with the media and asked not to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Onyx spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's statement on Sunday that it would reach out to potential buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen, Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer and Merck declined to comment. AstraZeneca did not immediately return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of other mid-size biotech companies that have long been rumored as potential takeover targets also rose on Monday, as takeover interest in Onyx underscored the sector's attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large pharmaceutical and biotech companies have been looking to acquire smaller biotech firms to gain access to new drugs, often high-priced cancer treatments, as they face significant revenue losses stemming from expired patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA.O) jumped 11.7 percent to $19.53, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc (ISIS.O) rose 5.95 percent to $28.47 and Seattle Genetics Inc (SGEN.O) climbed 3.97 percent to $32.71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onyx sells Nexavar, a treatment for liver and kidney cancer, and the new colon cancer drug Stivarga - both in partnership with Germany's Bayer. Onyx last year began selling Krypolis, which some analysts estimate will reach peak annual sales of $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to very high prices - some new oncology medicines can cost more than $100,000 per patient - cancer drugs are desirable because they require relatively small sales forces and tend to be covered by medical insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onyx is particularly attractive because it has three cancer drugs on the market - two of which are new with their best sales days ahead, while the third - Nexavar - is firmly established and being tested for additional uses. It has other promising drugs in its pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMGEN ON PROWL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen has faced growing pressure to beef up its drug development pipeline as safety concerns trimmed sales of its flagship anemia drugs. The company is best known for these and other medicines used in supportive care of cancer patients. Patents on four of Amgen's five top-selling drugs will expire, starting in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen Chief Executive Bob Bradway, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, took over from Kevin Sharer just over a year ago. Amgen shares have risen more than 30 percent since then as investors applauded the company's higher dividends and share repurchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen's late-stage pipeline has several cancer drug candidates, including some acquired through takeovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which held more than $21 billion in cash at the end of March, has not done a deal for more than $1 billion since its buyout in 2006 of Abgenix for $2.2 billion. Amgen's largest acquisition so far is Immunex Corp, which was valued at about $10 billion when completed in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Adds dropped word, "Onyx", in seventh paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Soyoung Kim and Jessica Toonkel in New York, additional reporting by Bill Berkrot in New York and Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Gerry Shih and Malathi Nayak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 1 (Reuters) - Games publisher Zynga Inc
 has replaced chief executive Mark Pincus with Don
Mattrick, the Microsoft Corp executive who headed the
critical Xbox business, Zynga announced on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news, reported first by AllThingsD, sent Zynga shares up
more than 11 percent earlier in the day. The shares rose a
further 3 percent to $3.17 when Zynga confirmed the appointment

statement. "He can execute in multiple domains - hardware,

game franchises like 'Need for Speed,' 'FIFA' and 'The Sims.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zynga's business model, which relied heavily on selling
virtual goods to gamers on Facebook Inc's platform, began
to disintegrate a year ago as users tired of Facebook games and
shifted to playing on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares have hovered at just 25 percent of its
$10 initial offering price in December 2011 as Pincus has
struggled to turn around the company named after his pet
bulldog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick's new role leading a game maker that publishes
social media-based titles and smartphone games will be a marked
departure from the world of big-budget, packaged console games
embodied by the Xbox and Electronic Arts Inc, the game
publishing firm where he had worked for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Mattrick emphasized that Pincus willingly
recruited him and described their working relationship as that

EA, where he worked under Bing Gordon, a well-known gaming
industry executive who went on to join venture capital firm
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pincus and Gordon, who sits on Zynga's board, led the effort
beginning this spring to recruit Mattrick, who had expressed an
interest in leaving Microsoft to lead a company, according to
people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pincus, who joins Groupon's Andrew Mason among high-profile
tech entrepreneurs who have relinquished their jobs as chief
executives, publicly backed Mattrick's appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've always said to Bing and our Board that, if I could

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co on Monday extended Bob Iger's tenure as its chief executive by 15 months, allowing him to remain both CEO and chairman through June 30, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, 62, had planned to step down as CEO on April 1, 2015, and assume the single role as executive chairman through the end of his existing contract on June 30, 2016, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since taking over as CEO in 2005, Iger has overseen acquisitions of film studios Pixar and Marvel, two hit makers for Disney, as well as last year's purchase of "Star Wars" creator Lucasfilm. The company also invested in theme parks and expanded the Disney brand into international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has delivered a total shareholder return of 193 percent during Iger's tenure, exceeding the 54 percent from the S 500, Orin Smith, Disney's independent lead director, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of Iger's existing contract remain in place, Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares rose 1.2 percent to close at $63.93 on the New York Stock earlier on Monday before the news of Iger's extended CEO contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ronald Grover and Lisa Richwine; Editing by Gary Hill, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

			The Walt Disney Company Board of Directors Extends Robert A. Iger&#8217;s 
      Tenure As CEO And Chairman Through the Expiration of His Contract on 
      June 30, 2016
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) Board of Directors announced today 
      that it has extended Robert A. Iger&#8217;s tenure as CEO and Chairman through 
      the expiration of his contract on June 30, 2016 under his existing 
      contractual terms as CEO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For nearly eight years as chief executive officer, Bob Iger has proven 
      he has the unique ability to drive creative and financial success at the 
      world&#8217;s preeminent entertainment company,&#8221; said Orin C. Smith, 
      Independent Lead Director of the Disney Board. &#8220;Disney has hit new 
      heights during Mr. Iger&#8217;s tenure, with total shareholder return of 193% 
      that dramatically exceeds the SP 500s 54%, and a market capitalization 
      that has risen to $113.7 billion from $48.4 billion when he became CEO 
      in 2005. Mr. Iger&#8217;s ability to consistently deliver against a strategy 
      of producing high-quality branded content, technological innovation and 
      international expansion has repeatedly resulted in record revenue, net 
      income, and earnings per share for the company.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Smith continued: &#8220;Given his outstanding leadership, and to provide 
      continuity of Disney&#8217;s corporate strategy to create long-term value for 
      shareholders, the board has asked Mr. Iger to remain CEO and chairman 
      until the expiration of his contract on June 30, 2016 under his existing 
      annual compensation terms as CEO, under which 92% of his pay was 
      performance-based in fiscal 2012. Originally, Mr. Iger was to have 
      relinquished his CEO position and transitioned to the role of executive 
      chairman on April 1, 2015 for 15 months. Now, Disney will continue to 
      have the full benefit of Mr. Iger&#8217;s leadership as CEO and chairman for 
      the duration of his tenure. The board remains focused on effective 
      succession planning, and will continue to develop a sound and 
      appropriate process for ensuring a smooth management transition.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I sincerely appreciate this vote of confidence by the Board of 
      Directors, and will continue to work with our talented and dedicated 
      management team to drive creative excellence, innovation and continued 
      growth,&#8221; Mr. Iger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since Mr. Iger, 62, was named chief executive on September 30, 2005, he 
      has led the company to record financial results and significant 
      strategic growth with the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, 
      major investments in the company&#8217;s Parks and Resorts business, and 
      expansion into key international markets. During Mr. Iger&#8217;s tenure, The 
      Walt Disney Company has repeatedly been recognized as one of the 
      &#8220;World&#8217;s Most Respected Companies&#8221; by Barron's, ranking No. 2 in the 
      magazine's just-released 2013 survey; one of the &#8220;World&#8217;s Most Admired 
      Companies&#8221; by Fortune; and No. 1 among &#8220;America&#8217;s Most Reputable 
      Companies&#8221; in a 2013 independent survey conducted by consulting firm 
      Reputation Institute and published by Forbes.

      basic level, we&#8217;re able to expand our mobility portfolio beyond iOS and

			Baker to Provide CEI Services for TDOT SR 32/US 25-E Walter&#8217;s Bridge
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Michael Baker Jr., Inc., an engineering unit of Michael Baker 
      Corporation (NYSE MKT:BKR), has been awarded a four-year, $2.12 million 
      construction engineering and inspection (CEI) contract by the Tennessee 
      Department of Transportation (TDOT) for the replacement of Walter&#8217;s 
      Bridge on State Route 32/U.S. 25-East over the French Broad River in 
      Jefferson and Cocke counties in eastern Tennessee.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Specifically, Baker will provide CEI and surveying services for the 
      concrete bridge project which will include grading, drainage, 
      construction of a retaining wall, utility relocations, erosion and 
      sediment control and paving. The addition of the new structure will 
      improve traffic pattern safety by eliminating the current narrow truss 
      structure.

      Baker&#8217;s Chadwick D. Huffines, P.E., regional construction services 
      manager, said, &#8220;We are pleased with the selection for this challenging 
      project and look forward to continuing our relationship with TDOT. The 
      replacement structure for this existing 1930s bridge will be a valuable 
      asset to the eastern Tennessee communities of Dandridge, Newport and 
      Morristown.&#8221;

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/xktpf5/global_public) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global

      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global Public Cloud Market In Small And Medium-Sized Businesses 
      Expected To Grow At A CAGR Of 24.6 Percent Over The Period 2012-2016
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The "Global Public Cloud Market in Small and Medium-sized Businesses 
      2012-2016" report has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis 
      with inputs from industry experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Data Center team 
      said: ''Many countries across the globe are witnessing the introduction 
      of high-bandwidth communication services such as 3G and 4G. With the 
      increased bandwidth support, advanced applications such as G-talk, 
      Skype, and BB Messenger are being widely used by end-users. These 
      applications are also supported on smartphones and tablets, which 
      creates a need to implement high-speed communication networks. Many 
      end-users are storing their data in the cloud infrastructure and 
      accessing voice- and video-based applications through the cloud, which 
      is one of the major trends in the market.''
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the reduced investment cost is one of the major 
      drivers in the Global Public Cloud market in Small and Medium-sized 
      Businesses. The cloud service providers are providing solutions to small 
      and medium-sized businesses at a lower cost than that needed for 
      internal provisioning of the services in order to boost the growth of 
      the market during the forecast period.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola and the Mexican National Team Celebrate 30 Years in New 
      Marketing Campaign
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Soccer passion and long standing partnership brought to life in TV 
      spot
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Passion. Pride. Love. That's what Mexican soccer fans feel for their 
      team. Each match brings millions of people together year after year, 
      generation after generation. Coca-Cola shares that same unconditional 
      commitment, captured in a new Hispanic marketing campaign that 
      celebrates the passion for the sport, the fans and the 30-year 
      relationship with the Mexican National Team (MNT).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The campaign includes a new television commercial titled &#8220;Wave,&#8221; that 
      speaks to fans who share the love for the sport and the traditions that 
      bring people together match after match.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Seventy percent of the 52 million Hispanics in the U.S. today are 
      Mexican or of Mexican descent, and many continue to follow their team,&#8221; 
      said Lauventria Robinson, VP Multicultural Marketing, Coca-Cola North 
      America Group. &#8220;Coca-Cola&#8217;s involvement in this campaign hits very close 
      to home because we understand the feeling, the excitement, the hope, and 
      the need to cheer and follow the Mexican National Team.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mexican soccer matches in the United States can be considered home games 
      for the MNT. Coca-Cola understands that passionate 'home field' 
      advantage for Mexico &#8211; even against the United States &#8211; and the 
      importance of passing it on to future generations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shot on location in Mexico City&#8217;s fabled Estadio Azteca, &#8220;Wave&#8221; shows 
      Mexico fans&#8217; unrelenting support for the Mexican National Team. The film 
      starts in 1986, when an avid fan accidentally starts a wave, or &#8220;Ola,&#8221; 
      after a near miss by Mexico. The wave then travels around the stadium, 
      and also through time. We follow it as it goes through all the decades, 
      taking us into the future, to 2014, where we reconnect with the avid fan 
      from the beginning. Only this time, the fan has his son with him, 
      keeping the support alive. They celebrate a goal with an ice-cold 
      Coca-Cola as it ends with the message, &#8220;never stop believing.&#8221; &#8220;Wave&#8221; 
      was created by Ogilvy  Mather.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola has been a proud supporter and partner of the MNT for more 
      than 30 years in Mexico and 10 in the U.S. as part of the Mexican 
      National Team&#8217;s annual tour. With Mexico&#8217;s triumph at the London 
      Olympics 2012 and the excitement building up around the 2014 FIFA World 
      Cup, passion is at an all-time high for soccer fans, while expectations 
      from both the team and the brand have increasingly grown.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola has always been part of our fans' soccer viewing events - 
      it&#8217;s simply a natural element of their soccer celebrations,&#8221; said Anali 
      Cabrera, Brand Director Multicultural Marketing, Coca-Cola North America 
      Group. &#8220;This new spot highlights our commitment to the Latino community, 
      letting them know that we have and will continue to celebrate and 
      support their team.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The creative will premiere July 1 on Univision Deportes. &#8220;Wave&#8221; hits 
      billboards July 15 and print Aug. 14. The &#8220;Wave&#8221; spot is available for 
      viewing at http://youtu.be/B_ko1hZ0Kog.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola will activate &#8220;Plaza Coca-Cola,&#8221; a year-round events-driven 
      program during MNT tour matches across the U.S., and a summer retail 
      program that includes point of sale, My Coke Rewards experience and 
      sweepstakes for Coca-Cola fans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Before the U.S. tour matches, Coca-Cola will also bring to life Club 
      Bal&#243;n Rojo, experiential soccer workshops aimed to motivate teens to 
      engage in physical activity, and provide them with educational tools to 
      gain access to higher education and empower their communities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN RAFAEL, Calif., July 1, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:BMRN) today announced that it has submitted the Vimizim Marketing Application (MA) to the Ag&#234;ncia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria (ANVISA), or the National Health Surveillance Agency Brazil. Assuming priority review status, based on orphan drug status in the U.S. and EU, an approval decision from ANVISA is anticipated in mid 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Considering that Brazil, along with the U.S., are expected to be the largest market opportunities for Vimizim, the timely submission in this market is an important milestone in our efforts to bring the first therapeutic option to patients with Morquio A Syndrome," said Jean-Jacques Bienaim&#233;, Chief Executive Officer of BioMarin. "Along with orphan drug designation in the U.S. and EU, priority review status in the U.S. and accelerated assessment status in the EU, we are making good progress on a global basis. In the coming months, we will continue to work closely with regulatory authorities and prepare for the launch of Vimizim worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About MPS IVA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA, also known as Morquio A Syndrome) is a disease characterized by deficient activity of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) causing excessive lysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans such as keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. This excessive storage causes a systemic skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities, which limit mobility and endurance. Malformation of the chest impairs respiratory function, and looseness of joints in the neck cause spinal instability and potentially spinal cord compression. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, corneal clouding, and heart disease. Initial symptoms often become evident in the first five years of life. The disease substantially limits both the quality and length of life of those affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The rate of incidence of MPS IVA is as yet unconfirmed and varies among different populations but estimates vary between 1 in 200,000 live births and 1 in 250,000 live births. The estimated prevalence is approximately 3,000 patients in the developed world.&#160;Based on knowledge of the worldwide distribution of the MPS VI market and the more than 1,300 identified MPS IVA patients worldwide, the company estimates that approximately 20 percent of patients are in North America (15 percent in the U.S.) and approximately 50 percent of patients are in EUMEA.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOD, Israel, July 1, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AudioCodes (Nasdaq:AUDC), a leading provider of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) technologies, products and services, today announced that its SmartTAP for Microsoft Lync application has passed all testing requirements and is now a fully qualified call recording solution for Microsoft Lync 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Qualifying applications such as SmartTAP from AudioCodes, first for Lync 2010, and now Lync 2013, gives Lync customers an important option when it comes to meeting their call recording needs," said Jon Morrow Sr. Program Manager Partner Engineering at Microsoft. "When call recording is a requirement for an IT organization, a qualified application like SmartTAP can help make Lync adoption a seamless process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	SmartTAP for Lync addresses the growing requirement for voice recording in Unified Communications environments. It has been deployed at over 100 customers, including Gazprom Marketing  Trading, the trading arm of Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer and one of the world's largest energy companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	SmartTAP is a security&#8208;enhanced call recording solution that enables the recording of key business interactions within Microsoft Lync 2013 or 2010 environments. It is capable of recording any call type, including mobile, remote and conference calls. Built on proven technology and based on years of experience in developing and integrating call recording solutions, SmartTAP is also compatible with many other VoIP, TDM and hybrid telephony environments. The solution can be easily configured and centrally managed using an intuitive web-based interface, which simplifies system deployments and reduces support requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Nimrod Borovsky, VP Unified Communications, AudioCodes, commented, "SmartTAP has been widely adopted as a Lync call recording solution. It is an ideal solution for companies in the financial services, manufacturing, hospitality, medical and many other highly regulated industries. When combined with a survivable branch appliance (SBA), SmartTAP completes the solution for the branch office by offering full recording capabilities when the central site is offline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			Bioventus Acquires Exclusive Rights to Pfizer&#8217;s BMP Portfolio
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bioventus, a leader in active orthopaedic healing, today announced 
      agreement with Pfizer Inc. for an exclusive, worldwide license to 
      Pfizer&#8217;s bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) portfolio of development 
      programs and associated intellectual property. The portfolio includes a 
      next-generation BMP in development, designed to offer additional options 
      to currently-marketed BMP products, and the rights to rhBMP-2 in 
      indications and fields previously reserved to Pfizer. Bioventus has also 
      acquired an exclusive option to a BMP program for soft tissue 
      indications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has agreed to transfer to Bioventus all existing development work 
      for the BMP assets and to undertake certain early-development activities 
      relating to the next-generation BMP. Pfizer will also manufacture 
      rhBMP-2 and supply it to Bioventus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To lead the BMP programs, Bioventus has retained the services of 
      distinguished BMP scientists Dr. John Wozney and Dr. Howard Seeherman. 
      Bioventus is opening a research laboratory in Boston, MA to pursue 
      development and commercialization of the BMP assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the license agreement, Pfizer received an upfront 
      payment and will be eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties 
      on any sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Martin Sutter, founding partner and Managing Director of Essex 
      Woodlands, the lead investor in Bioventus, said &#8220;This licensing 
      agreement demonstrates the viability of the investment thesis underlying 
      our participation in Bioventus. Developing the next-generation BMP will 
      enable Bioventus to become a recognized leader in orthobiologics.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As Pfizer continues to prioritize and actively manage our dynamic 
      pipeline, we have looked for strong partners who are best suited to 
      advance programs outside our core focus areas,&#8221; said Jose Carlos 
      Gutierrez-Ramos, Ph.D., Group Senior Vice President and Head of 
      Biotherapeutics RD at Pfizer. &#8220;Given Bioventus&#8217; expertise and 
      commitment to orthopaedic healing, we believe it is well positioned to 
      advance important new options to orthopaedic patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This transaction strengthens our vision of Bioventus being a recognized 
      global leader in active orthopedic healing. BMPs are a class of 
      demonstrably potent biologics that will benefit from Bioventus' 
      commitment to developing clinically efficacious technologies in 
      partnership with world class physicians and the appropriate&#160;regulatory 
      agencies. The BMP programs will expand and complement Bioventus&#8217; ongoing 
      development in bone stimulation and injectable hyaluronic acid 
      therapies,&#8221; said Mark Augusti, CEO of Bioventus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Sonus has the industry&#8217;s broadest portfolio of Microsoft Lync 
        qualified SBCs, and is the only vendor in the market to offer 
        Microsoft Lync survivability either through a 3G/4G or public switched 
        telephone network (PSTN) connection to provide reliability in the 
        event of a wide area network (WAN) failure

			Sonus 
      Networks, Inc. (Nasdaq: SONS), a global 
      leader in SIP communications, today announced that its session 
      border controllers (SBCs) are being integrated into Microsoft Technology 
      Centers (MTCs) globally, as part of Microsoft Lync Unified 
      Communications (UC) demonstrations. This integration allows enterprises 
      to experience first-hand the powerful combination of Sonus SBCs in a 
      Lync Enterprise deployment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The MTCs are highly collaborative, world-class facilities that offer 
      businesses access to cutting-edge technologies and industry-leading 
      expertise. The new Toronto MTC is the first to feature Sonus SBCs with 
      the addition of the Sonus SBC 1000. Based in Microsoft Canada's 
      Mississauga headquarters, the Toronto MTC is the 31st in the world, in 
      addition to the 12 centers in the United States and 18 other 
      international locations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SBCs serve a critical role in enabling and activating UC platforms, such 
      as Microsoft Lync, across enterprise Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 
      networks. As a Microsoft Gold Communications Partner, Sonus helps 
      enterprises optimize Microsoft Lync voice deployments by securing SIP 
      trunking services at the network border and providing a seamless flow of 
      SIP-based multi-vendor media for UC deployments. Secure, resilient 
      access to UC applications such as instant messaging (IM), collaboration, 
      conferencing and voice empowers enterprises to communicate with speed 
      and simplicity. The SBC 1000 and the Sonus SBC 2000 SBCs are the only 
      SBC solutions available which offer Microsoft Lync survivability either 
      through a 3G/4G or PSTN connection to provide reliability in the event 
      of a wide area network (WAN) failure.

			Quotes:&#8220;The purpose of the Microsoft Technology Centers is 
      to enable businesses to envision, design and deploy innovative solutions 
      that will better meet their needs and goals. Demonstrating the

      see the value of integrating an SBC into Lync Enterprise Voice 
      deployments, enabling their Unified Communications vision to become a 
      reality,&#8221; said Chuck McCann, Worldwide MTC Alliances program director, 
      Microsoft. &#8220;We are proud to feature Sonus SBCs as an integral part of

			Ceiba Solutions Honored as Recipient of the 2013 Microsoft Life 
      Sciences Innovation Awards
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Life Sciences Company Recognized for its Successful Self-service 
      Analytics Work
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ceiba 
      Solutions, a provider of services, products, and information 
      analytics for life sciences, today announced it has been named a 
      recipient of the 2013 Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Life Sciences Innovation Awards. 
      The company was recognized in partnership with a major pharmaceutical 
      company for their work leveraging Ceiba&#8217;s self-service data exploration 
      and analysis software, Helium.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The awards, which were announced at the Drug Information Association&#8217;s 
      (DIA) 49th annual meeting in Boston, honor companies that are using 
      Microsoft solutions to realize business and information technology 
      benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today, the life sciences industry is tasked with not only bringing new 
      therapies to the market faster, but doing so at a lower cost,&#8221; said 
      Andrea McGonigle, managing director, Life Sciences, Microsoft Corp. &#8220;The 
      winners of this year&#8217;s Microsoft 
      Life Sciences Innovation Awards all faced that challenge head on, 
      demonstrating sustainable impacts to the life sciences industry through 
      the use of innovative technology.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Helium helps users address Big Data issues by connecting data and 
      analytical services across sources. This information is then made 
      available within Microsoft Office and Windows 8 apps. The pharmaceutical 
      company leveraged Helium to connect its customer relationship management 
      (CRM), medical professional, prescription, and multi-channel marketing 
      data. As a result, complex, cross-source data browsing and analysis that 
      previously took hours or days, or was impossible to do, can now be done 
      in minutes &#8211; all within well-known, easy-to-use Microsoft interfaces.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Helium's unique data-typing mechanism identifies selected data and 
      recommends meaningful ways to connect that data to related data and data 
      services across sources. This ability to explore a mesh of relationships 
      within popular user tools like Excel not only enhances productivity, but 
      drives innovative thinking around previously unrealized connections.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In any organization, the sheer volume of data is overwhelming. The 
      information available offers a huge opportunity for insightful analysis 
      &#8211; if you can just access it together,&#8221; said Tom Arneman, president, 
      Ceiba Solutions. &#8220;Helium is unique in how it seamlessly integrates 
      sources and makes data connections in a familiar tool, and it&#8217;s great to 
      be recognized by Microsoft as an innovative solution.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global E-Invoicing Market 2013 Report Featuring 
      Leading Players Ariba, Basware, Esker, IBM and Others
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/cdrv9p/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      E-invoicing Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global E-Invoicing Market Expected To Grow At A Cagr Of 24.2 Percent 
      Over The Period 2012-2016
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's report, the Global E-invoicing Market 2012-2016, has been 
      prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry 
      experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Enterprise 
      Computing team said: "Earlier, SMEs had limited options when seeking to 
      adopt a system that would ensure optimal business performance. This was 
      because they did not require, or could not afford, all the features of 
      enterprise-class systems. Their options were limited to freeware, 
      low-end or open-source solutions that mainly focused on server or 
      network monitoring. In the last few years, many SMEs have become 
      increasingly aware of the significance of having a solution that 
      preserves their brand reputation and enhances the business process. Some 
      new vendors in the e-invoicing space are aware of this opportunity, and 
      they have recently entered the market with offerings that are positioned 
      to capitalize on this trend. The combination of these new vendors' 
      pricing models and the capabilities and the ease of management that 
      their solutions offer makes these products appealing, especially to 
      SMEs."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in the market is the 
      need to automate the invoicing process and reduce the operational cost. 
      E-invoicing enables companies within or across organizations to automate 
      invoice generation and enhance the overall business process. It also 
      reduces the total operational cost and the time spent on the purchasing 
      process.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Jeanine Prezioso&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
closed its trading recommendation to buy U.S. crude oil and sell
Brent oil on Tuesday, as the closely watched spread between the
European and U.S. benchmarks reached its narrowest since early
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said in a report that it expected the spread to
narrow in the medium term as new pipelines help shift a growing
glut of U.S. light, sweet shale oil from the Cushing, Oklahoma,
physical delivery point down to the Houston trading hub, moving
pressure from the inland WTI contract to sea-borne Brent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cautioning that "the risks in the near term are
clearly to the upside," or a narrower WTI-Brent spread, analysts
said in the report that the risk/reward of the trading call for
a $5 spread, which it opened on Aug. 21, was "less attractive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front-month August spread between WTI and Brent narrowed to a new low of $4.15 per barrel on Tuesday, the
narrowest point between the two grades of crude since January
2011. It settled at $4.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman based its call on the September spread, which
settled on Monday at $4.61 per barrel, 39 cents below the firm's
target. The spread settled at $4.06 on Tuesday after narrowing
to $3.81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has not been an easy ride for Goldman's call. As recently
as March, the spread had ballooned to more than $15 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman expected an expansion of pipeline capacity to
reduce the bottleneck between Cushing and U.S. Gulf Coast (USGC)
refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the medium term, we expect the WTI-Brent differential
to widen again as the USGC becomes increasingly saturated in
light sweet crude oil," the analysts said in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in pipeline and rail capacity that will allow
U.S. refiners to draw crude out of Cushing has led traders to
bet on WTI as the go-to crude, rather than Brent imports from
the U.S. Gulf Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, BP Plc  said it completed the
start-up of a new 250,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) crude
distillation unit at its 413,000 bpd Whiting, Indiana, refinery.
 The start-up will help absorb Canadian crude
that might have otherwise pooled at Cushing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New lines out of the Permian Basin in West Texas, another
large oil-producing basin where output is booming, are also
helping relieve the build-up at Cushing by redirecting it to the
Gulf Coast. One of those lines, Sunoco Logistics Partners LP's
 90,000 bpd Permian Express, is due online in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planned new pipeline capacity from the Permian Basin in West
Texas "should comfortably handle output by the end of 2015,"
analysts at RBN Energy, LLC said in a note on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other banks chimed in later in the day with forecasts for
the Brent/WTI spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG revised higher its long-term
forecast for the differential between the two crudes to $15 per
barrel by 2016 compared with an earlier forecast of $11.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its 2013 forecast was revised lower to around $10 per barrel
versus a previous forecast of $13.30. The Brent/WTI spread will
fall to $5/bbl by 2018, then dip to around $4/bbl in 2019 and
2020, the bank said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS AG said in a report that it expects WTI's
discount to Brent to widen to $12 in the third quarter and then
narrow slightly to $10 in the fourth quarter and $6 per barrel
from the second quarter of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Front-month U.S. crude oil futures settled $1.61 per
barrel higher at $99.60 after trading at a nine-month high near
$100 per barrel. Brent crude oil futures ended the day
$1 per barrel higher at $104.&lt;/p&gt;

			SYNNEX Corporation Announces Its Involvement in the Microsoft Devices 
      Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SYNNEX 
      Corporation (NYSE:&#160;SNX), a leading distributor of IT products and 
      services, today announced its participation in the Microsoft Devices 
      Program, empowering the organization to resell Surface Pro and Surface 
      RT to commercial customers. The goal of the Microsoft Devices Program is 
      to serve customers by activating Microsoft&#8217;s channel of partners to 
      resell its devices to businesses of all sizes, from the classroom to the 
      boardroom.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s Devices Program dovetails into SYNNEX&#8217; Microsoft Global 
      Business Unit&#8217;s larger end-to-end strategy. SYNNEX created this specific 
      business unit not only to align better to Microsoft&#8217;s service and device 
      strategy, but to better serve the needs of the greater Microsoft partner 
      ecosystem. SYNNEX&#8217; Microsoft Global Business Unit is a fully dedicated, 
      authorized and comprehensive Microsoft team comprised of tenured product 
      category specialists, retail specialists, TPAMs, and qualified licensing 
      experts in the US, Canada and Japan. SYNNEX&#8217; full-time dedication of a 
      business unit to Microsoft products equates to a better approach for 
      strategic launches such as Surface, bringing more value to its resellers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s decision to bring Surface to the IT channel is very timely 
      as the market shifts to where business customers increasingly seek 
      devices that can span both work and personal needs,&#8221; said Rob Moyer, 
      Vice President, Microsoft Global Business Unit, SYNNEX Corporation. 
      &#8220;SYNNEX is very well positioned to help bring solutions that matter to 
      Microsoft and our partners to market. We are totally behind Microsoft 
      through our core business and are able to bring opportunities to our 
      solution providers, whether through our strong vertical practices or 
      technology solutions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Bringing Surface Pro and Surface RT to the U.S. commercial channel 
      through distributors extends the reach of our devices-and-services 
      strategy, delivering our family of devices enabled by cloud services to 
      more organizations than ever before,&#8221; said Eric Martorano, Senior 
      Director U.S. SMB Channel Group for Microsoft Corp. &#8220;We look forward to 
      working closely with our Microsoft devices authorized distributors to 
      better serve their partners and create compelling solutions together.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Microsoft Partner Network is designed to equip organizations that 
      deliver products and services through the Microsoft platform with the 
      training, resources and support they need to provide their customers 
      superior experience and outcomes. Launching first in the U.S., Microsoft 
      Devices Program creates a two-tier distribution model with authorized 
      partners to enable commercial customers to purchase Surface Pro and 
      Surface RT.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) named Jeff Katz and Mitch Rubinstein to run its global oil operation after the division's previous chief Jeff Frase left the bank after five years for Noble Group (NOBG.SI), industry website SparkSpread.com reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frase's departure from one of Wall Street's biggest commodity players was announced to JPMorgan staff this morning, SparkSpread said, citing an unnamed source. The website later said that Katz and Rubinstein were named co-heads of global oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Noble officials were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frase, one of just over half a dozen senior traders who report to JPMorgan commodities chief Blythe Masters, is one of the most senior departures since the bank expanded dramatically with the purchase of the former Sempra Commodities energy and metals divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He worked for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) for 17 years, rising to run one of the largest and most prestigious oil and derivatives trading operations in the world. He then took a one-year turn at Lehman Brothers before the bank collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of traders have moved recently from jobs on Wall Street, once considered the pinnacle of a commodities career, to privately held trading houses or hedge funds, lured by incentive plans and trading books unconstrained by new financial market regulations affecting banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jeff has built his name in banking, which is a relatively constrained market. Moving into a trading house will relieve him of those constraints and allow him to build a business as he sees fit," said Peter Henry, senior consultant at Commodity Search Partners in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noble Americas, the Stamford, Connecticut-based U.S. arm of Singapore-listed Noble Group, has grown rapidly over the last six years, expanding tenfold to more than 14,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also seen some turnover at the top of its oil business. Former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) trader Olav Refvik, dubbed the "King of New York Harbor" for his skill in playing the U.S. fuel market, stepped down from his position running Noble's oil book last October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katz has been at JP Morgan for eight years in various divisions including oil, foreign exchange options and derivatives, SparkSpread reported, citing an internal memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubinstein joined the bank last year after a variety of roles, including three years as global head of oil at Bank of America and most recently a one-year stint at China oil giant Sinopec Group's Unipec arm. He spent the first 18 years of his career at Chevron and Texaco, according to the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Jonathan Leff and Jeanine Prezioso; Editing by John Wallace and Alden Bentley)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Zynga Inc's decision to bring in the head of Microsoft Corp's Xbox business to replace founder Mark Pincus is a bold stroke that was hailed on Wall Street, but it still leaves questions as to who is ultimately in charge at the troubled game-maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Mattrick was personally recruited by Pincus. But Pincus holds on to 61 percent of the voting rights due to a two-tiered stock structure and will remain Zynga's chairman and its chief product officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick, who is credited with building Microsoft's Xbox business into a gaming powerhouse, hesitated before agreeing to take the job, people with knowledge of the events said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His doubts finally faded during a grueling bike ride through the Santa Cruz mountains one recent weekend, when Pincus opened up to Mattrick about how he had come to terms emotionally with relinquishing the reins at the company he founded in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Wall Street cheered Mattrick's appointment, sending Zynga's shares up more than 10 percent and another 3 percent after hours, some analysts questioned whether the shake-up would change Zynga's performance in a significant way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bringing in someone who has worked at a larger company to assist in management duties I think is a relief right now," said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But Pincus is still the chief product officer. So the question is, what's actually changed day to day in terms of making hit games?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick will hold the final say in day-to-day matters, including green-lighting new games, people familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zynga's business model, which relied heavily on selling virtual goods to gamers on Facebook Inc's platform, began to disintegrate in mid-2012 as users tired of Facebook games and shifted to playing on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pincus, who has long wanted to turn the firm he named after his pet bulldog into a large Internet company, privately acknowledged in recent months that he has lacked the ability to manage such a company, said a person familiar with his thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring, Bing Gordon, the Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers investor and an active member of its board, floated the idea of recruiting Mattrick, whom Gordon had known from their years together at game publisher Electronic Arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pincus quickly agreed to help woo Mattrick, and the two had a series of meetings in California and Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued Monday, Mattrick emphasized Pincus's role as a visionary and described their working relationship as that of partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I joined Zynga because I believe that Mark's pioneering vision and mission to connect the world through games is just getting started," Mattrick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pincus praised his successor without reservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've always said to Bing and our Board that, if I could find someone who could do a better job as our CEO, I'd do all I could to recruit and bring that person in," Pincus said in a statement. "I'm confident that Don is that leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STELLAR TRACK RECORD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of Mattrick's appointment, reported first by AllThingsD, sent Zynga shares up more than 11 percent earlier in the day. The shares rose a further 3 percent to $3.17 when Zynga confirmed the appointment after the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, the company's value has fallen to just 25 percent of its $10 initial offering price in December 2011 as Pincus struggled keep his company out of free-fall despite multiple waves of layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick's new role leading a game maker that publishes social media-based titles and smartphone games will be a marked departure from the world of big-budget, packaged console games where he spent most of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick headed successful franchises like "FIFA" in his 15 years at EA, where he first worked under Gordon before later supervising Gordon. He joined Microsoft in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once there, Mattrick helped turn the Xbox business into a profitable venture after years of losses, eventually propelling it into the No.1 selling console in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICROSOFT RESTRUCTURING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick's departure comes just as Microsoft gears up to launch the third version of its console, called the Xbox One. Unveiled in May and scheduled to hit stores later this year, the machine has already stirred controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gamers attacked the high price, Microsoft's plan to require an Internet connection at least once a day and attempts to limit the sharing of used games. Last month, Microsoft reversed its position on the Internet connection and said it would allow game sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick was known to be very hard on his employees but still well-liked within the gaming division at Microsoft, said one former Xbox employee. Still, his power did not extend much beyond his own unit in a company that is still essentially driven by its two main businesses, Windows and Office, and that may have contributed to his desire to leave, observers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had a good sense of humor, a pretty compelling vision of gaming, and a hard-nosed business sense," said one former Xbox employee, who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick had been rumored to be considering leaving for months. After EA's CEO stepped down in March, industry sources speculated he was in the running to lead the top games publisher, where he previously held numerous leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick's departure takes place against the backdrop of a broader re-shaping of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer is expected to announce a broad restructuring in the next few weeks that moves the company closer to his previously stated vision of becoming a devices and services company - much like Apple - rather than primarily a software company. There has been talk that Ballmer will create a &#8216;devices' unit, moving the Xbox, Surface tablets and possibly the phone unit into one business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Alexei Oreskovic in San Francisco and Bill Rigby in Seattle.

with Heritage's oil exploration programme, to an advisor to
companies with interests in Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he has said his emails were too general to constitute

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) head of global oil trading, Jeff Frase, is leaving the bank to run Noble Group's (NOBG.SI) oil business, industry website SparkSpread.com reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frase's departure after almost five years at one of Wall Street's biggest commodity players was announced to JPMorgan staff this morning, SparkSpread said, citing an unnamed source. JPMorgan and Noble officials were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frase, one of just over half a dozen senior traders who report to JPMorgan commodities chief Blythe Masters, is one of the most senior departures since the bank expanded dramatically with the purchase of the former Sempra Commodities energy and metals divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He worked for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) for 17 years, rising to run one of the largest and most prestigious oil and derivatives trading operations in the world. He then took a one-year turn at Lehman Brothers before the bank collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noble Americas, the Stamford, Connecticut-based U.S. arm of Singapore-listed Noble Group, has grown rapidly over the last six years, expanding tenfold to more than 14,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also seen some turnover at the top of its oil business. Former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) trader Olav Refvik, dubbed the "King of New York Harbor" for his skill in playing the U.S. fuel market, stepped down from his position running Noble's oil book last October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Jonathan Leff and Jeanine Prezioso; Editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) closed its trading recommendation to buy U.S. crude oil and sell Brent oil on Tuesday as the closely watched spread between the European and U.S. benchmarks reached its narrowest since early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it expected the spread to narrow in the medium term as new pipelines help shift a growing glut of U.S. light, sweet shale oil from the Cushing, Oklahoma, physical delivery point down to the Houston trading hub, moving pressure from the inland WTI contract to sea-borne Brent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cautioning that "the risks in the near term are clearly to the upside," or a narrower WTI-Brent spread, analysts said the risk/reward of the trading call for a $5 spread - which it opened on August 21 - was "less attractive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front-month August spread between WTI and Brent narrowed to a new low of $4.54 per barrel on Tuesday, the narrowest point between the two grades of crude since January 10, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman based its call on the September spread, which settled on Monday at $4.61 per barrel, 39 cents below the firm's target. It narrowed further on Tuesday to $4.18 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It hasn't been an easy ride for Goldman's call. As recently as March, the spread had ballooned to more than $15 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman said it expected a build out in pipeline capacity to reduce the bottleneck between Cushing and U.S. Gulf Coast (USGC)refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the medium term, we expect the WTI-Brent differential to widen again as the USGC becomes increasingly saturated in light sweet crude oil," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in pipeline and rail capacity that will allow U.S. refiners to draw crude out of Cushing has seen traders betting on WTI as the go-to crude, rather than Brent imports from the U.S. Gulf Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) said it completed the startup of a new 250,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) crude distillation unit at its 413,000 bpd Whiting, Indiana, refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The start-up will help absorb Canadian crude that may have otherwise pooled at Cushing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New lines out of the Permian Basin in West Texas, another large oil-producing basin where output is booming, are also helping relieve the build-up at Cushing by redirecting it to the Gulf Coast. One of those lines, Sunoco Logistics Partners LP's (SXL.N) 90,000 bpd Permian Express, is due online in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planned new pipeline capacity out of the Permian Basin in West Texas "should comfortably handle output by the end of 2015," analysts at RBN Energy, LLC said in a note on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Front-month U.S. crude oil futures were trading up 94 cents a barrel at $98.93 at 11:20 a.m. EDT (1520 GMT), after touching a peak of $99.17, the highest since September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent crude oil futures were last trading 54 cents higher at $103.54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jeanine Prezioso; Editing by Bernadette Baum)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details from complaint)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, July 2 (Reuters) - Media mogul Barry Diller
agreed to pay $480,000 in civil penalties for allegedly failing
to notify the government about his purchase of Coca-Cola Co
 stock, two U.S. agencies said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diller, chairman of Internet media conglomerate IAC /Inter
Active Corp, bought 120,000 shares of Coca-Cola on Nov.
1, 2010, bringing his holdings at the time to more than $63.4
million, the Justice Department said in its complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He bought additional shares in the next year and a half but
did not file required documentation with the Federal Trade
Commission, which works with the Justice Department to enforce
antitrust law, the FTC said, adding that Diller later made
corrective filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under antitrust law, individuals or companies who buy more
than a certain amount of shares of a company must notify
antitrust authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IAC spokeswoman Justine Sacco said Diller had no comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diller had failed to file notice with the FTC in 1998, when
his USA Networks Inc did not inform antitrust authorities about
a purchase of CitySearch stock, the Justice Department said in a
complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is United States of America v. Barry Diller and is
No. 13-01002 at the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia.

      assigned to City of Houston, Texas public improvement refunding bonds, 
      series 2013A (rated 'AA', Stable Outlook) that have been deposited in 
      the series 4338 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4343 
      PUTTERs and DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has assigned 
      Massachusetts School Building Authority senior dedicated sales tax 
      refunding bonds, 2012 series A (rated 'AA+', Stable Outlook) that have 
      been deposited in the series 4343 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs is based on the 
      liquidity facilities provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 'A+/F1', 
      Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4336 and 4338 
      PUTTERs will expire on June 30, 2014 and the 'F1' rating assigned to the 
      4343 PUTTERs will expire on July 1, 2014, the expiration dates of the 
      liquidity facilities, unless such dates are extended or earlier 
      terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Ian Hannam, one of London's most prominent bankers who is fighting to clear his name after a 2012 fine for market abuse, was disciplined by his bank four years ago over his working practices, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam's employer at the time JP Morgan Cazenove, a JP Morgan (JPM.N) joint-venture, imposed "very significant and extensive restrictions" on Hannam after a disciplinary inquiry in 2009, documents released by Britain's financial regulator showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-profile case, which began in a London court on Tuesday, tests the mettle of the three-month-old Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a revamped regulator determined to hold to account senior bankers and their employers for market abuse or sloppy controls. It will also fuel a debate about what constitutes inside, or market-moving, information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCA documents said Hannam was banned from December 2009 from initiating or soliciting new business or attending meetings without an "approved person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was forced to resign from the JP Morgan Cazenove board and had emails and phone calls monitored, according to the documents. JP Morgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannam, an ex-special forces soldier known for multi-billion-dollar deals that transformed Britain's blue-chip share index, and links to U.S. generals and Iraqi ministers, wants to restore his reputation and overturn the 450,000 pound ($685,100) fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCA documents said that 57-year-old Hannam had a "relaxed" attitude to disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Boulton, the leading lawyer for the FCA, told the court that inside information should be easy to spot.

The first, which referred to a potential offer for Heritage and a price, did not name a buyer. The second mentioned an oil find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCA documents alleged that Heritage was forced to issue an announcement about bid talks nine days after the September email because the UK Takeover Panel regulator noticed "untoward movement" in Heritage's share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also noted that JP Morgan Cazenove told Hannam in 2009 that he had "conducted business communications with third parties in a manner falling below the standard expected of you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannam has admitted that he made a mistake when he blind copied his October email, disclosing information about progress with Heritage's oil exploration program, to an advisor to companies with interests in Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he has said his emails were too general to constitute inside information and that he was acting in his client's interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also has said no one made any personal gain from the information in his emails and has noted that his honesty and integrity were not questioned by the regulator, who also did not remove his "fit and proper" status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding his reputation is critical for Hannam, who is building up a gold venture in Afghanistan and an advisory firm Strand Partners, which includes some of the JP Morgan team that were among the most influential in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.6568 British pounds)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Kirstin Ridley.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - Ian Hannam, one of London's most
prominent bankers who is fighting to clear his name after a 2012
fine for market abuse, was disciplined by his bank four years
ago over his working practices, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam's employer at the time JP Morgan Cazenove, a JP
Morgan joint-venture, imposed "very significant and
extensive restrictions" on Hannam after a disciplinary inquiry
in 2009, documents released by Britain's financial regulator
showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-profile case, which began in a London court on
Tuesday, tests the mettle of the three-month-old Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA), a revamped regulator determined to hold
to account senior bankers and their employers for market abuse
or sloppy controls. It will also fuel a debate about what
constitutes inside, or market-moving, information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCA documents said Hannam was banned from Dec. 2009 from
initiating or soliciting new business or attending meetings
without an "approved person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was forced to resign from the JP Morgan Cazenove board
and had emails and phone calls monitored, according to the
documents. JP Morgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannam, an ex-special forces soldier known for
multi-billion-dollar deals that transformed Britain's blue-chip
share index, and links to U.S. generals and Iraqi ministers,
wants to restore his reputation and overturn the 450,000 pound
($685,100) fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCA documents said that 57-year-old Hannam had a
"relaxed" attitude to disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Boulton, the leading lawyer for the FCA, told the
court that inside information should be easy to spot. "If it
looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it is
a duck."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINESE WALLS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannam, in court for the opening of his case a day before he
takes the stand, said he did not believe he broke any rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The case raises questions about the definition, and
treatment of, inside information on the corporate finance side
of the "Chinese Wall" and clarification by the Upper Tribunal is
important for London as a global financial centre," he said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Upper Tribunal hears appeals on cases brought by the
regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannam resigned from JP Morgan Cazenove last year, leaving
his position as global chairman of equity capital markets after
two decades at the firm, to pursue his appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCA's predecessor, the Financial Services Authority
(FSA), alleged Hannam sent two emails on behalf of a client,
Heritage Oil, in September and October 2008, which
included potential inside information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both emails were sent to Kurdish oil minister Ashti Hawrami.
 The first, which referred to a potential offer for Heritage and
a price, did not name a buyer. The second mentioned an oil find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCA documents alleged that Heritage was forced to issue
an announcement about bid talks nine days after the September
email because the UK Takeover Panel regulator noticed "untoward
movement" in Heritage's share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also noted that JP Morgan Cazenove told Hannam in 2009
that he had "conducted business communications with third
parties in a manner falling below the standard expected of you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannam has admitted that he made a mistake when he blind
copied his October email, disclosing information about progress
with Heritage's oil exploration programme, to an advisor to
companies with interests in Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he has said his emails were too general to constitute
inside information and that he was acting in his client's
interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also has said no one made any personal gain from the
information in his emails and has noted that his honesty and
integrity were not questioned by the regulator, who also did not
remove his "fit and proper" status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding his reputation is critical for Hannam, who is
building up a gold venture in Afghanistan and an advisory firm
Strand Partners, which includes some of the JP Morgan team that
were among the most influential in the sector.

      Mobile healthcare leader AirStrip

      AppsForSurface program. As part of the program, the company will 
      launch and make available AirStrip 
      ONETM Cardiology not only on Windows 8.1-enabled mobile 
      devices, but also on laptops and desktops.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;This program highlights Microsoft&#8217;s commitment to supporting the 
      mHealth space with solutions that are proven to drive clinical 
      transformation,&#8221; AirStrip 
      CEO Alan Portela noted. &#8220;Thanks to this program, AirStrip will give 
      healthcare providers a seamless user experience regardless of whether 
      they are using AirStrip solutions on their Windows-enabled mobile 
      devices, a Surface tablet, a laptop, or a desktop. The look, feel and 
      depth of user experience will remain consistent for clinicians, 
      regardless of the device they use. We are proud that Microsoft has 
      recognized AirStrip ONE Cardiology as a pioneering mobile clinical 
      application in the AppsForSurface program,&#8221; Portela added.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coinciding with the Microsoft announcement, AirStrip is finalizing plans 
      for expanded functionality for AirStrip ONE Cardiology that will support 
      mobility throughout the entire cardiology care continuum. Portela 
      indicated that a formal announcement detailing these added features will 
      be released in the near future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;We are delighted that AirStrip is coming to the Windows platform, and 
      are looking forward to their applications delivering better care across 
      the continuum using devices like Surface,&#8221; said Neil Jordan, Worldwide 
      General Manager - Health. &#8220;Doctors are telling us they love these 
      Windows tablets, and we know that the industry- leading apps from 
      AirStrip, combined with secure and compelling devices, will see the 
      unlocking of a truly enterprise-class mobile experience for clinicians.&#8221;

      Today&#8217;s announcement marks the latest in a series of firsts for 
      AirStrip&#8217;s patent-protected

      Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) security requirements. In

			Dynamics Group for the Executors of Gunter Sachs - Announcement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In various Swiss and German media, articles have been published 
      suggesting that Gunter Sachs, deceased on May 6, 2011, had declared his 
      income and property incorrectly to the Swiss Tax Administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We, in our capacity as executors of Gunter Sachs, have emphasized that 
      this does not correspond to the truth and that the income and property 
      as well as the estate of Gunter Sachs have been properly declared.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Tax Administration of the Canton of Bern has conducted an internal 
      reexamination due to the appeared articles and data published in the 
      context of offshore leaks. It has concluded that the provided documents 
      and explanations have revealed no indications of irregularities (see 
      Confirmation of the Tax Administration of the Canton of Bern).

&lt;p&gt;* Mattrick turned around Microsoft's Xbox business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Zynga business model flailing due to rise of mobile games&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Founder Pincus to remain chairman, chief product officer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Zynga shares shoot up on news of Mattrick's appointment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Mattrick departure comes amid broad reshaping at Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Gerry Shih and Malathi Nayak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 1 (Reuters) - Zynga Inc's 
decision to bring in the head of Microsoft Corp's Xbox
business to replace founder Mark Pincus is a bold stroke that
was hailed on Wall Street, but it still leaves questions as to
who is ultimately in charge at the troubled game-maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don Mattrick was personally recruited by Pincus. But Pincus
holds on to 61 percent of the voting rights due to a two-tiered
stock structure and will remain Zynga's chairman and its chief
product officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick, who is credited with building Microsoft's Xbox
business into a gaming powerhouse, hesitated before agreeing to
take the job, people with knowledge of the events said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His doubts finally faded during a grueling bike ride through
the Santa Cruz mountains one recent weekend, when Pincus opened
up to Mattrick about how he had come to terms emotionally with
relinquishing the reins at the company he founded in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Wall Street cheered Mattrick's appointment, sending
Zynga's shares up more than 10 percent and another 3 percent
after hours, some analysts questioned whether the shake-up would
change Zynga's performance in a significant way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bringing in someone who has worked at a larger company to
assist in management duties I think is a relief right now," said
Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But Pincus is still the chief product officer. So the
question is, what's actually changed day to day in terms of
making hit games?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick will hold the final say in day-to-day matters,
including green-lighting new games, people familiar with the
situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zynga's business model, which relied heavily on selling
virtual goods to gamers on Facebook Inc's platform, began
to disintegrate in mid-2012 as users tired of Facebook games and
shifted to playing on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pincus, who has long wanted to turn the firm he named after
his pet bulldog into a large Internet company, privately
acknowledged in recent months that he has lacked the ability to
manage such a company, said a person familiar with his thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring, Bing Gordon, the Kleiner Perkins Caufield and
Byers investor and an active member of its board, floated the
idea of recruiting Mattrick, whom Gordon had known from their
years together at game publisher Electronic Arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pincus quickly agreed to help woo Mattrick, and the two had
a series of meetings in California and Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued Monday, Mattrick emphasized Pincus's
role as a visionary and described their working relationship as
that of partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I joined Zynga because I believe that Mark's pioneering
vision and mission to connect the world through games is just
getting started," Mattrick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pincus praised his successor without reservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've always said to Bing and our Board that, if I could
find someone who could do a better job as our CEO, I'd do all I
could to recruit and bring that person in," Pincus said in a
statement. "I'm confident that Don is that leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STELLAR TRACK RECORD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of Mattrick's appointment, reported first by
AllThingsD, sent Zynga shares up more than 11 percent earlier in
the day. The shares rose a further 3 percent to $3.17 when Zynga
confirmed the appointment after the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, the company's value has fallen to just
25 percent of its $10 initial offering price in December 2011 as
Pincus struggled keep his company out of free-fall despite
multiple waves of layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick's new role leading a game maker that publishes
social media-based titles and smartphone games will be a marked
departure from the world of big-budget, packaged console games
where he spent most of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick headed successful franchises like "FIFA" in his 15
years at EA, where he first worked under Gordon before later
supervising Gordon. He joined Microsoft in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once there, Mattrick helped turn the Xbox business into a
profitable venture after years of losses, eventually propelling
it into the No.1 selling console in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICROSOFT RESTRUCTURING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick's departure comes just as Microsoft gears up to
launch the third version of its console, called the Xbox One.  
Unveiled in May and scheduled to hit stores later this year, the
machine has already stirred controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gamers attacked the high price, Microsoft's plan to require
an Internet connection at least once a day and attempts to limit
the sharing of used games. Last month, Microsoft reversed its
position on the Internet connection and said it would allow game
sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick was known to be very hard on his employees but
still well-liked within the gaming division at Microsoft, said
one former Xbox employee. Still, his power did not extend much
beyond his own unit in a company that is still essentially
driven by its two main businesses, Windows and Office, and that
may have contributed to his desire to leave, observers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had a good sense of humor, a pretty compelling vision of
gaming, and a hard-nosed business sense," said one former Xbox
employee, who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick had been rumored to be considering leaving for
months. After EA's CEO stepped down in March, industry sources
speculated he was in the running to lead the top games
publisher, where he previously held numerous leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattrick's departure takes place against the backdrop of a
broader re-shaping of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer is expected to announce a broad restructuring in the
next few weeks that moves the company closer to his previously
stated vision of becoming a devices and services company - much
like Apple - rather than primarily a software company. There has
been talk that Ballmer will create a 'devices' unit, moving the
Xbox, Surface tablets and possibly the phone unit into one
business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Customers of MF Global's MF.MU failed broker-dealer unit and the trustee overseeing its liquidation won court approval on Wednesday for a $546 million settlement with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, announced in March, resolved claims levied by James Giddens, the trustee winding down MF's broker-dealer unit MF Global Inc, and by the broker's former customers, who are pursuing a federal class action over MF Global's collapse in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MF Global, the commodities brokerage headed by ex-New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, filed for bankruptcy amid concerns by investors about its exposure to $6.3 billion in sovereign debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approval of the JPMorgan settlement comes a week after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Corzine over the collapse and announced a $100 million settlement with MF's broker-dealer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a rare joint hearing in Manhattan, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn, who is overseeing the liquidation, and U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero, who presides over the class action, approved the JPMorgan accord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I find the proposal fair, reasonable and in the best interests of the class," Marrero said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giddens has said the settlement will allow him to eventually return 100 percent of customers' money, which was frozen when MF Global went bankrupt. Most customers have already recovered around 90 percent of their funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had been the lead on a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility to MF Global's parent and one of its primary clearing banks leading up to its bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the settlement, JPMorgan will pay $100 million to benefit former customers. It has also agreed to return more than $29 million in brokerage funds and to release claims on $417 million it earlier returned to Giddens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest settlement also ties up a loose end in Giddens' settlement with MF Global's UK unit, announced earlier this year. That settlement, expected to bring in $500 million to $600 million for the broker-dealer's estate, required a resolution of JPMorgan's claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The overall settlement unlocks over $1 billion for customers and other creditors," James Kobak, the lead attorney for Giddens, said at Wednesday's court hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank will make a seperate $7.5 million payment for attorneys' fees and expenses to lawyers representing the customers in the class action, court papers show. Marrero approved the fees Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are In re: MF Global Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-2790, and Deangelis v. Corzine, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-7866.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Gary Hill and David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The SEC has ended a probe of a central witness it intends to call at this month's fraud trial against former Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president Fabrice Tourre for his role in a notorious 2007 debt instrument that hedge fund billionaire John Paulson successfully shorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission to drop the investigation of former ACA Financial Guaranty Corp employee Laura Schwartz was confirmed by a letter filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unresolved investigation could have damaged the SEC's case against Tourre, whose lawyers have been seeking details about Schwartz that could hurt her credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz could help establish at Tourre's trial, scheduled to begin on July 15, how he misled investors in a complex collateralized debt obligation called ABACUS 2007-AC1 in 2007, according to court filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Schwartz had received a "Wells notice," indicating that SEC staff could recommend that the commission bring civil charges against her, as part of a probe of ACA's role as collateral manager for a different CDO, ACA ABS 2007-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wells notice had been disclosed in a broker report, filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter dated June 27 and made public Wednesday from Lara Shalov Mehraban, a SEC assistant regional director in New York, to Schwartz's lawyer said the SEC's staff did "not intend to recommend any enforcement action by the commission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre was accused of misleading investors by failing to disclose that the hedge fund operated by Paulson was involved in selecting mortgage securities behind the Abacus CDO, and was betting against the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle related charges in 2010. Paulson was not charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin Alperstein, a lawyer for Schwartz, declined to comment on Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - The SEC has ended a probe of a
central witness it intends to call at this month's fraud trial
against former Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president
Fabrice Tourre for his role in a notorious 2007 debt instrument
that hedge fund billionaire John Paulson successfully shorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission to
drop the investigation of former ACA Financial Guaranty Corp
employee Laura Schwartz was confirmed by a letter filed
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unresolved investigation could have damaged the SEC's
case against Tourre, whose lawyers have been seeking details
about Schwartz that could hurt her credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz could help establish at Tourre's trial, scheduled
to begin on July 15, how he misled investors in a complex
collateralized debt obligation called ABACUS 2007-AC1 in 2007,
according to court filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Schwartz had received a "Wells notice,"
indicating that SEC staff could recommend that the commission
bring civil charges against her, as part of a probe of ACA's
role as collateral manager for a different CDO, ACA ABS 2007-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wells notice had been disclosed in a broker report,
filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter dated June 27 and made public Wednesday from Lara
Shalov Mehraban, a SEC assistant regional director in New York,
to Schwartz's lawyer said the SEC's staff did "not intend to
recommend any enforcement action by the commission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre was accused of misleading investors by failing to
disclose that the hedge fund operated by Paulson was involved in
selecting mortgage securities behind the Abacus CDO, and was
betting against the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle related charges
in 2010. Paulson was not charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin Alperstein, a lawyer for Schwartz, declined to comment
on Wednesday. A spokesman for Tourre's lawyer, Pamela Chepiga,
also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SHADE" TESTIMONY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers had been seeking to subpoena documents
regarding the investigation of Schwartz to call into question
her credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a June 10 hearing, Sean Coffey, a lawyer for Tourre, said
the investigation could provide Schwartz a "motive for her to
shade her testimony to support the merits of her own case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffey had at that time said if the SEC dropped the probe
into Schwartz, it would raise questions about "what she was
willing to do at trial in order to avoid being charged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a motion Wednesday, Schwartz's lawyer said no
cooperation agreement existed with the SEC as a result of the
investigation being dropped, and there is now no potential her
client would bias her testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The potential lines of inquiry about which Tourre seeks to
cross-examine her at trial, and for which he purportedly seeks
the Wells materials, are similarly moot," Schwartz's lawyers
wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The status of the SEC's review of the ACA ABS 2007-2 CDO is
unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS AG, which sold more than $748 million in notes
tied to ACA ABS 2007-2, has said it is in talks with the SEC
over its "structuring and underwriting of one CDO in 2007."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Nester, an SEC spokesman, declined to comment. A UBS

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and officials at Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) on Wednesday won the dismissal of lawsuits accusing them of overcharging clients for trading currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - The SEC has ended a probe of a
central witness it intends to call at this month's fraud trial

Fabrice Tourre for his role in a notorious 2007 debt instrument

regulator had finished its probe of her client, and "does not

selecting mortgage securities behind the Abacus CDO, and was

in 2010. Paulson was not charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alperstein declined to comment on Wednesday. A spokesman for
Tourre's lawyer, Pamela Chepiga, also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The status of the SEC's review of the ACA ABS 2007-2 CDO is
unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS AG, which sold more than $748 million in notes
tied to ACA ABS 2007-2, has said it is in talks with the SEC
over its "structuring and underwriting of one CDO in 2007."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Nester, an SEC spokesman, declined to comment. A UBS
spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A lawyer for ACA did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern

      Fitch Downgrades 1 Class of JPMCC 2004-C2; Upgrades 5 Rake Classes
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded one distressed class and upgraded the five 
      rake classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2004-C2. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrade to class M reflects an increase in actual and expected 
      losses across the pool since last review. The upgrades to the rake 
      classes are due to the defeasance of the subordinate note secured by the 
      Republic Plaza, which is represented by the RP certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 2.91% of the remaining pool; expected losses of 
      the original pool total 3.92%, including $12 million (1.17% of the 
      original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 
      21 loans (23.18%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes two 
      specially serviced loans (2%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the July 2012 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 24% to $783.45 million from $1.03 billion at 
      issuance. Per the servicer reporting, 19 loans (28.93%) in the trust 
      have defeased since issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently 
      affecting classes N through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investment grade classes A-2 through E are expected to remain stable 
      based on sufficient credit enhancement and expected paydown from 
      imminent defeasance proceeds. The Negative Outlooks on classes F, G and 
      H reflect the thin supporting tranches, as well as the concentration of 
      upcoming loan maturities over the next 12 to 18 months, which make these 
      bonds susceptible to downgrade should loans not refinance or if losses 
      exceed Fitch expectations. The distressed classes (those rated below 
      'Bsf') are subject to further downgrades as losses are realized or if 
      realized losses to specially serviced loans exceed Fitch's expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the Gateway Chula Vista 
      loan (2.18% of the pool balance) which is collateralized by a 100,321 
      square foot (sf) office property located in Chula Vista, CA. The 
      property had experienced cash flow issues due to occupancy declines in 
      2011, and had transferred to special servicing in March 2012 due to 
      payment default. The loan was modified in January 2013, and was recently 
      returned to the master servicer in May 2013. The net operating income 
      (NOI) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for year end (YE) 2012 reported 
      at 0.75 times (x). NOI is expected to improve due to a significant 
      increase in occupancy which reported at 85% as of May 2013, compared to 
      51% at YE 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to expected losses is collateralized by a 
      159,043sf retail property located in Stuart, FL. The property has 
      experienced cash flow issues since 2009 due to major tenant vacancies 
      and rent reductions stemming from the economic downturn. The property is 
      currently 99% occupied, however, NOI DSCR remains low at 0.65x as of YE 
      2012 due to significantly lower rents and increased expenses compared to 
      underwriting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch downgrades the following class and assigns Recovery

      The class A-1 certificate has paid in full. Fitch does not rate the 
      class NR certificate. The RP certificates represent an interest in a 
      subordinate note secured by the Republic Plaza property. Fitch 
      previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X certificate.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, July 3 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's 
big-budget Western "The Lone Ranger," starring Johnny Depp as
Native American sidekick Tonto, rode off with $2 million in U.S.
and Canadian ticket sales during its first shows on Tuesday
night, trotting well behind animated "Despicable Me 2."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both films are fighting for audiences heading into the U.S.
Independence Day holiday on Thursday, one of the biggest movie
going periods of the year. "Despicable Me 2" took in $4.7
million in its Tuesday night preview shows, according to
distributor Universal Pictures, a unit of Comcast Corp
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animated movie, featuring the voice of Steve Carell, is
expected to rule the box office through Sunday, with domestic
ticket sales of more than $110 million, industry forecasters
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lone Ranger" is projected to capture $60 million to $70
million during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Tuesday night sales, "both films are solid enough to
make the projected numbers, pretty much on the money," said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com's box office division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lone Ranger" would ultimately generate $180 million in
domestic ticket sales, according to Tony Wible, managing
director of Janney Montgomery Scott, who follows Disney. He
estimated that at those levels, the movie would generate $370
million for Disney in revenues from foreign, video and other
sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That total would give Disney a modest profit, based on
estimated production costs of $225 million and more than $100
million for marketing. Wible's numbers don't include merchandise
sales, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film is the latest entry in Disney's strategy of
spending more on fewer films and trying to build franchises that
can generate continued revenues from sequels, merchandise and
outlets like its theme parks and TV properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company found such success with Marvel superhero films
"The Avengers" and "Iron Man 3," but wrote down $200 million
when sci-fi epic "John Carter" flopped last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lone Ranger" is an action remake of a 1930s radio show
and television series in the 1950s. Armie Hammer plays John
Reid, the lawman who dons a mask to fight injustice in the Old
West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics have not embraced the movie. Among 110 reviews
compiled on the Rotten Tomatoes website on Wednesday, just 25
percent recommended the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big-budget Westerns have failed to grab mass audiences,
which could hurt "The Lone Ranger," said Jeff Bock, box office
analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. But, he added, that pirate
movies were also a tough sell in Hollywood before Depp made
"Pirates of Caribbean" a global hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think that many people remember 'The Lone Ranger,'"
Bock said, "But they know Johnny Depp. He connects with
audiences."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - "The Lone Ranger," Walt Disney Co's big-budget western starring Johnny Depp, performed below expectations on Wednesday night, raising the possibility that the movie could saddle the media giant with a loss on the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film, which cost an estimated $225 million to produce, generated $9.7 million during Wednesday showings, falling well behind "Despicable Me 2" from Comcast's Universal Pictures, which sold $34.3 million at the domestic box office, according to studio estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both films opened with limited showings on Tuesday. For the two-day period, "Despicable Me 2" generated $39 million and "The Lone Ranger" saw $11.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney estimates "The Lone Ranger" will sell $45 million for the Wednesday through Sunday July Fourth holiday weekend, below industry experts' initial forecasts of $60 million to $70 million over the five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it does end up grossing less than $50 million over the five-day stretch, it will most certainly go down as a misfire," said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst for Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie box office prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film's poor opening is a black eye for producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski and star Depp, the trio behind Disney's ultra-successful "Pirates of the Caribbean" series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney made their prior success a key part of marketing the current film, and Depp's international appeal still could help the film's overseas box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lone Ranger" is an action remake of a 1930s radio show and television series in the 1950s. Armie Hammer plays John Reid, the lawman who dons a mask to fight injustice in the Old West. This time, though, it is the Lone Ranger's Native American sidekick Tonto, played by Depp, who takes center stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics have not embraced the movie.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, July 4 (Reuters) - "The Lone Ranger," Walt
Disney Co's big-budget western starring Johnny Depp,
performed below expectations on Wednesday night, raising the
possibility that the movie could saddle the media giant with a

million over the five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it does end up grossing less than $50 million over the
five-day stretch, it will most certainly go down as a misfire,"
said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst for Exhibitor

Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski and star Depp, the trio
behind Disney's ultra-successful "Pirates of the Caribbean"
series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney made their prior success a key part of marketing the
current film, and Depp's international appeal still could help
the film's overseas box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lone Ranger" is an action remake of a 1930s radio show

$100 million to market it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney spokesperson was not available for comment on the
studio's outlook for the film's profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lone Ranger" is the latest entry in Disney's strategy
of spending more on fewer films to build franchises from big
budget movies that can generate continued revenues from sequels,
merchandise and outlets like its theme parks and TV properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company found such success with Marvel superhero films
"The Avengers" and "Iron Man 3," and with Pixar's "Monsters
University," but wrote down $200 million when sci-fi epic "John
Carter" flopped last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studios will update the box office results over the
weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			Research and Markets: Global Software Testing System Integrator 
      Market 2012-2016 with Capgemini S.A., TCS Ltd., and IBM Corp. Dominating
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/rjwb6q/global_software) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Software Testing System Integrator Market 2012-2016" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Software Testing System Integrator 
      market to grow at a CAGR of 21.15 percent over the period 2012-2016. One 
      of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the increased 
      availability of testing applications. The Global Software Testing System 
      Integrator market has also been witnessing the shift in focus toward 
      cloud-based testing. However, the difficulty in protecting intellectual 
      property could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this market space are Accenture plc, 
      Capgemini S.A., TCS Ltd., and IBM Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in the report are: Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd, 
      Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, CGI (Logica plc), HP Co., Software 
      Quality Systems AG, Tech Mahindra Ltd, Amdocs Ltd, Computer Sciences 
      Corp, Atos S.A., and UST Global Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the IT Services team said: 
      'The Global Software Testing System Integrator market is witnessing a 
      trend of vendors offering cloud-based testing solutions. Cloud computing 
      offers an opportunity to access testing tools and test environments from 
      anywhere around the world. By moving IT infrastructure to the cloud, 
      organizations reduce the capital investment as well as the cost of 
      maintenance, security, and infrastructure. Furthermore, with the testing 
      taking place over the cloud, testers can work independently to decrease 
      the testing time by accessing the tested software on the cloud even in 
      the product development stage. Cloud-based solutions also remove the 
      delay factor due to overriding the issues between the product 
      development and the testing, as the software testing team can work 
      independently and in synchronization with the product development team.'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the Global Software Testing System Integrator 
      market is witnessing increasing demand for testing software from 
      companies because the quality of applications is highly dependent upon 
      testing. Hence, to avoid poor execution, slow test turnaround or 
      excessive costs in the software's lifecycle, companies are relying more 
      on testing services, thereby increasing the adoption of software testing 
      services.

Bankia and Barcelona-based CaixaBank have
asked JP Morgan to explore the sale of more than 30 percent of
olive oil company Deoleo, two sources close to the
deal said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanish banks are selling assets to boost their capital and
clean their balance sheets following a 41 billion euro ($53
billion) European bail-out of the sector last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankia and CaixaBank are pooling their shareholdings in the
bottled olive oil manufacturer with stakes held by other former
unlisted savings banks, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CaixaBank, Bankia and other shareholders have grouped
together their stakeholdings to look at a possible joint sale,
that could get a better price," said the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not a placement in the market, it's a mandate to
explore a possible sale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankia is the biggest stakeholder in Deoleo with a stake of
18.2 percent, while CaixaBank holds nearly 6 percent. Other
shareholder banks are Unicaja, Kutxabank and Banco Mare Nostrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankia, the biggest recipient in the international aid
package last year, is on a drive to shed industrial holdings and
sold its stake in airline group IAG last month. Bankia also sold
U.S.-based City National Bank of Florida earlier this year, and
portfolios of properties and troubled loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankia and its parent company BFA also hold stakes in
utility Iberdrola and technology company Indra

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Investors who wrongly called time on U.S. economic supremacy during the financial crisis are set to pay a hefty price for betting too much on the developing world, according to a top Goldman Sachs strategist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. investment bank helped inspire a twenty-fold surge in financial investment in China, India, Russia and Brazil over the past decade, its chief economist popularizing the term BRICs in a 2001 research paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, in charge of shaping the portfolios of the bank's rich private clients, has been arguing against that trend for four years, however, trying to persuade investors and colleagues they were safer sticking with the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past six months has substantially vindicated that view. China's boom is finally wobbling under the weight of economic imbalances including an undervalued currency, and emerging stock markets are down 13 percent compared to an 11 percent rise in the U.S. S 500 .SPX index over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many investors and market commentators have been too euphoric about China over the last decade and this euphoria is finally abating. Many just followed the herd into emerging markets and over-allocated to many of the key countries," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is easier to be part of the herd even if one is wrong, than stay apart from the herd and be right in the long run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The net gains for U.S. stock markets may just be a taste of the reassertion of western dominance that may emerge in the next few years, Mossavar-Rahmani argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural advantages like abundant mineral wealth, positive demographics and, most importantly, inclusive, well-run political and economic institutions make the United States the best bet going forward, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(Emerging market) investors are taking on so many risks compared with the U.S. where the risk is largely cyclical rather than structural," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the cyclical issues affecting the U.S. such as high levels of debt, are also on their way to being resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One thing that normally puts investors off from increasing their U.S. holdings is the long term debt profile, but we think the magnitude of the work done to address this has been underappreciated by investors," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEST IS BEST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that authoritarian countries are less effective than open economies like the U.S. at incentivizing entrepreneurship and innovation is long accepted in academia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson laid out the case for doubting the emerging power of China and others in a book 'Why Nations Fail' last year, arguing poor institutions that entrench inequality will hamper a country's path to prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this view was largely put aside by professional investors who allowed themselves to be swept up in a "mania" about the rewards up for grabs in emerging markets, especially China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The widely held position, enhanced by the crisis of 2007-8, was that the developed world was entering a long decline and the best prospects for investors would be found in emerging markets, particularly in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That prompted a boom in emerging market themed equity funds, which in Europe multiplied from 13 in 2002 to 67 in 2012 according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company that tracks the funds industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipper data also shows the balance of money flowing into emerging market themed equity funds globally, including those focused on the BRICs, soared from 2.42 billion euros in 2008 to 51.23 billion euros in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, equity funds overall lost 21.5 billion euros in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNREST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's efforts to rebalance its economy from an export dependent to consumer-led model is likely to bring slower growth, more market volatility and greater potential for social unrest - a worrying trinity of red flags for foreign investors who have poured cash into China in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, mass protests are causing political crisis in Brazil and investors are fretting about ponderous, economically stifling bureaucracy in India.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - Investors who wrongly called time
on U.S. economic supremacy during the financial crisis are set
to pay a hefty price for betting too much on the developing
world, according to a top Goldman Sachs strategist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. investment bank helped inspire a twenty-fold surge
in financial investment in China, India, Russia and Brazil over
the past decade, its chief economist popularising the term BRICs
in a 2001 research paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, in charge of shaping the
portfolios of the bank's rich private clients, has been arguing
against that trend for four years, however, trying to persuade
investors and colleagues they were safer sticking with the
developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past six months has substantially vindicated that view.
China's boom is finally wobbling under the weight of economic
imbalances including an undervalued currency, and emerging stock
markets are down 13 percent compared to an 11 percent rise in
the U.S. S 500 index over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many investors and market commentators have been too
euphoric about China over the last decade and this euphoria is
finally abating. Many just followed the herd into emerging
markets and over-allocated to many of the key countries," she
says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is easier to be part of the herd even if one is wrong,
than stay apart from the herd and be right in the long run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The net gains for U.S. stock markets may just be a taste of
the reassertion of western dominance that may emerge in the next
few years, Mossavar-Rahmani argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural advantages like abundant mineral wealth, positive
demographics and, most importantly, inclusive, well-run
political and economic institutions make the United States the
best bet going forward, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(Emerging market) investors are taking on so many risks
compared with the U.S. where the risk is largely cyclical rather
than structural," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the cyclical issues affecting the U.S. such as high
levels of debt, are also on their way to being resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One thing that normally puts investors off from increasing
their U.S. holdings is the long term debt profile, but we think
the magnitude of the work done to address this has been
underappreciated by investors," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEST IS BEST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that authoritarian countries are less effective
than open economies like the U.S. at incentivising
entrepreneurship and innovation is long accepted in academia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson laid out the case for
doubting the emerging power of China and others in a book 'Why
Nations Fail' last year, arguing poor institutions that entrench
inequality will hamper a country's path to prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this view was largely put aside by professional
investors who allowed themselves to be swept up in a "mania"
about the rewards up for grabs in emerging markets, especially
China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The widely held position, enhanced by the crisis of 2007-8,
was that the developed world was entering a long decline and the
best prospects for investors would be found in emerging markets,
particularly in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That prompted a boom in emerging market themed equity funds,
which in Europe multiplied from 13 in 2002 to 67 in 2012
according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company that tracks the
funds industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipper data also shows the balance of money flowing into
emerging market themed equity funds globally, including those
focused on the BRICs, soared from 2.42 billion euros in 2008 to
51.23 billion euros in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, equity funds overall lost 21.5 billion euros in
2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNREST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's efforts to rebalance its economy from an export
dependent to consumer-led model is likely to bring slower
growth, more market volatility and greater potential for social
unrest - a worrying trinity of red flags for foreign investors
who have poured cash into China in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, mass protests are causing political crisis in
Brazil and investors are fretting about ponderous, economically
stifling bureaucracy in India. South Africa, sometimes called a
fifth BRIC, is also struggling with a tide of labour unrest and
infrastructure and social problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from fund tracker EPFR Global shows investors pulled
out a record $10 billion from emerging markets debt and equity
funds in the week to June 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mossavar-Rahmani argues investors should not base decisions
so heavily on which countries post the most impressive economic
growth numbers, a temptation to which she says many succumbed
when overallocating money to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when countries enjoy rapid economic growth, the
increases in GDP do not equate to similar jumps in investment
returns, she says, citing a study published in 2005 by the
London Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you rank the world's economies from fastest to slowest
in terms of growth, the fastest-growing quintile actually
generate the lowest investment return while the slowest third
deliver the highest," she said.

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman becomes only second broker with 'buy' rating&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* High profile upgrade catches short-sellers off guard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS, July 4 (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen's 
stock won a rare vote of confidence from a major broker on
Thursday, surging nearly 8 percent after Goldman Sachs 
recommended buying shares in the troubled car maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said a Reuters report that the Peugeot family
might be willing to cede control of the company could shift the
market's focus to a "sum of the parts" valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank lifted its rating on the stock to 'buy'
from 'neutral' and added it to its 'conviction list' with a
share price target of 9 euros, making it one of only two bullish
analyst recommendations among the 24 broker ratings on Peugeot
tracked by Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 0900 GMT, the stock was up 7.8 percent in brisk volume,
trading at 6.71 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from Goldman, only one broker has a 'buy' rating on
the stock - Juergen Pieper from Germany's Metzler Equities -
while 11 have 'sell' ratings and 11 have 'hold' ratings,
according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have long seen PSA as a poorly positioned,
Europe-centric autos maker needing a strategic solution,"
Goldman analysts wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recent Reuters reports that the Peugeot family might be
willing to cede control of PSA point to a potential catalyst
that might encourage the market to focus on a SOTP (sum of the
parts) valuation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, sources told Reuters the Peugeot founding family
had offered to give up control of the French automaker as it
tries to revive plans for a closer tie-up with U.S. carmaker
General Motors Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that a clear plan to restructure the business
would allow the market to revalue PSA's automotive business to
15 percent EV/sales (enterprise value-to-sales) from 3 percent
currently," the Goldman analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peugeot has been hit hard by a slump in European car sales,
burning 3 billion euros ($3.89 billion) in operating cash last
year while asset writedowns swelled its net loss to 5 billion
euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders said on Thursday Goldman's upgrade caught hedge
funds off guard, triggering a wave of short covering on the
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds have been betting on falls in Peugeot's shares,
making it one of the biggest short-selling targets in Europe in
the past year. According to data from Markit, 10.2 percent of
Peugeot shares outstanding are out on loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in French car maker Faurecia - in which
Peugeot has a controlling stake - were up 5.3 percent on
Thursday, a rally fuelled by Goldman analysts' comments about a
potential spin-off.

&lt;p&gt;July 5 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co Inc has
requested a rehearing of a ruling by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) that it and other power traders
benefited from a flaw in the California electricity market. 
    The FERC ruled in June in favor of the California grid
operator and said the traders would need to reimburse $52
million in excess profits made from 2009 through 2011. 
    The California Independent System Operator (ISO), which
operates the state's power system, changed its market rules in
2011 to cut off the loophole that the grid operator said the
bank used to disrupt the power market.

JPMORGAN TIMELINE     
July 2013 - JP Morgan asks for a rehearing of the June order,
saying the regulator made "two fundamental errors" and also
ignored evidence that directly contradicted some of its own
findings.    
        
June 2013 - FERC approves California ISO request to force power
sellers, including JPMorgan, to reimburse $16.7 million to
California electricity distributors for disruptive bidding
practices between April 2009 and March 2011. FERC also
signed-off on the $35.3 million reimbursement the ISO already
forced the sellers to pay in April 2011.
    The ruling marked a victory for the Californian grid
operator, and came as JPMorgan may face more serious charges
related to power market manipulation in California and Michigan.

May 2013 - JPMorgan reduces presence in California power market,
selling the right to market electricity from three power plants.
 
    
May 2013 - JPMorgan tells shareholders FERC may take action
against bank for certain power market bidding activities.
 
    
May 2013 - An internal FERC document leaked to the New York
Times says the regulator may charge JPMorgan with power market
manipulation. The document also says JPMorgan's commodities
chief, Blythe Masters, may have made "false and misleading
statements," to the regulator under oath. 
    
April 2013 - JPMorgan six-month ban on selling power at market
based rates starts.
        
Jan 2013 - FERC appeals magistrate's November 2012 ruling
blocking FERC from seeing JPMorgan emails.
    
Nov 2012 - Federal magistrate rules that JPMorgan does not need
to hand over emails FERC sought in July 2012 as part of the
regulator's power market manipulation investigation.
        
Nov 2012 - FERC suspends JPMorgan's authority to sell power at
market based rates for six months for making factual
misrepresentations during an investigation into market
manipulation. The ban is to start in April 2013.  
 
        
Sep 2012 - FERC directs JPMorgan to show why regulators should
not suspend its authority to sell power at market rates, after
it says the bank submitted misleading information to the
Commission during the market manipulation investigation.
 
    
July 2012 - FERC subpoenas JPMorgan in federal court to provide
emails as part of its investigation into market manipulation in
California and the Midwest. This is when JPMorgan is publicly
named as the party that allegedly manipulated the California
market. 
    
June 2012 - California ISO asks FERC to approve its plan to
force power sellers to reimburse money earned from exploitive
bidding practices to electricity distributors from April 2009 to
March 2011. The ISO had already forced power sellers to
reimburse $35.3 million in April 2011 for the period between
August 2010 and March 2011. 
        
Feb-June 2012 - California ISO imposes a non-public $486,000
penalty against JPMorgan in February for failing to submit all
information the grid operator sought as part of its
investigation. JPMorgan appeals the penalty in March and FERC in
April rejected the bank's appeal.
    JPMorgan filed a complaint with FERC in May that the fine
was unjust, but withdrew its complaint in June after the FERC
Office of Enforcement said the bank and its lawyers were not
adequately responding to numerous requests for information from
the ISO and FERC.
    
May 2011 - FERC approves California ISO's request to fix flaw in
the bidding mechanism, effective March 26, 2011. 
    
April 2011 - California ISO forces power sellers to reimburse
$35.3 million to electricity distributors from trades executed
from August 2010 to March 2011 due to effect of exploitive
bidding practices. 
            
March 2011 - California ISO informs JPMorgan the grid operator
reviewed the bank's bidding activities and intends to refer the
matter to the FERC Office of Enforcement, which was the start of
FERC's non-public investigation.
    
March 2011 - California ISO files with FERC to fix a loophole in
the power market bidding mechanism after a party's behavior
"aggravated the market impact of the flaw." That party was later
identified as JPMorgan.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - "The Lone Ranger," Walt Disney Co's big-budget Western starring Johnny Depp, wrangled just $19.5 million in ticket sales in its first two full days at U.S. and Canadian movie theaters, trailing far behind the $59.5 million racked up by animated sequel "Despicable Me 2."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tally for "Lone Ranger," which included receipts starting on Tuesday night through Thursday's U.S. Independence Day holiday, put the film on pace to miss, by a long haul, industry forecasts for the holiday period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film about the masked man who fights injustice was likely to finish with about $45 million at domestic theaters through Sunday, Disney said. That was far below the $60 million to $70 million predicted ahead of the film's opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it does end up grossing less than $50 million" by Sunday, "it will most certainly go down as a misfire," said Jeff Bock, a senior analyst for Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie box office prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney spent an estimated $225 million to make "Lone Ranger" and more than $100 million to market the film, an action remake of a 1930s radio show and a 1950s TV series. Armie Hammer plays the masked man who fights injustice with help from Tonto, his Native American companion played by Depp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film's poor opening is a black eye for producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski and Depp, the trio behind Disney's ultra-successful "Pirates of the Caribbean" series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despicable Me 2," produced for $76 million, pulled in family audiences to dominate ticket sales over one of the year's biggest movie-going periods, the days around the July Fourth holiday.

			Enhanced Xsuite Federates and Audits All Privileged Access to 
      Microsoft Online Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Xceedium, 
      Inc., the premier provider of privileged identity management for the 
      hybrid-cloud, today announced its flagship product Xsuite&#174; 
      will include protection for Microsoft online services including Office 
      365&#174;, Exchange, Lync&#174;, and SharePoint&#174;. 
      With this extension to the platform, Xsuite now secures and audits all 
      privileged access to Microsoft online services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The additional protection for Microsoft online services complements 
      Xsuite&#8217;s existing hybrid-cloud security and compliance capabilities. 
      Xsuite federates privileged access and provides secure single sign-on to 
      web applications and IT infrastructure running on premise or in the 
      cloud. It enables organizations to enforce fine-grained access controls 
      and to monitor, record, and audit everything privileged users do &#8211; 
      regardless of where systems reside.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Combining a comprehensive set of privileged user controls with unified 
      policy management, Xsuite enables organizations to seamlessly manage and 
      enforce policy &#8211; improving security and streamlining compliance tasks. 
      Xsuite enables federal government and commercial customers to comply 
      with new &#8220;insider threat&#8221; requirements found in security and privacy 
      mandates such as FISMA, PCI-DSS, and NERC-CIP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Xsuite for Microsoft Online Services highlights:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Multi-factor authentication for all access to Microsoft online 
        services &#8211; including logical (PIV/CAC) smartcard access to federal 
        agency systems as required under HSPD-12
      
			
        Separation of duties for administrative access to Microsoft online 
        services (Office 365, Exchange, Lync, and SharePoint)
      
			
        Single sign-on to Microsoft online services using federated Active 
        Directory&#174; or LDAP credentials &#8211; including SSO access from 
        multiple clients (Windows&#174;, Mac&#174;, Unix&#174;)
      
			
        Recording of privileged user sessions &#8211; for comprehensive audit and 
        forensics and to simplify compliance with Federal Government 
        Continuous Monitoring mandates
      
			
        Enforce and proxy privileged access to Microsoft online services 
        through a US Federal Government Trusted Internet Connection (TIC)
      
			
        Address dozens of new systems administrator control requirements found 
        in the recently updated NIST Special Publication 800-53 (R4)

      &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s Federal government customers continue to extend their

      online services. Working with partners like Xceedium will help to ensure 
      that there are solutions like Xsuite for customers who seek to enable a

      &#8220;Since our initial push into the cloud over two years ago, we continue 
      to address our customer&#8217;s rapidly evolving cloud security requirements. 
      We are delighted to be working with Microsoft to extend Xsuite&#8217;s 
      federated identity and privileged user security capabilities to 
      Microsoft online services. This announcement underpins our commitment to 
      delivering a &#8216;Next Generation&#8217; privileged identity management platform

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, July 8 (Reuters) - General Electric Co 
will miss its growth target for its German business after
Europe's biggest economy suffered a slump in industrial orders
last year, the U.S. conglomerate's European head said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are growing very well. But due to last year's economic
weakness we will not manage to double sales from 2011 to 2015,"
Ferdinando Beccalli-Falco told German newspaper Die Welt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany's industrial sector - which includes companies such
as General Electric (GE), Siemens or GEA -
has for months suffered weak orders both domestically and from
euro zone countries held back by austerity measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has underscored fragility in the country's economy and
disappointed hopes it might support regional growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE has about 7,500 employees in Germany, where it focuses on
green technology, medical technology, research and development
as well as financial services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beccalli-Falco said orders had bottomed out at the end of
last year, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the first half of the year, orders in Europe picked up
again, especially in Germany," Die Welt quoted him as saying in
an excerpt of an article to be published on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His comments came after GE celebrated the 130-year
anniversary of its German operations on Monday in a ceremony in
Berlin attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and GE Chief
Executive Jeff Immelt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beccalli-Falco also said that GE had held takeover talks
with a number of medium-sized companies whose technology would
have fit GE's portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't reach any agreement, but if there was another
opportunity we would take it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

			Parallels&#174; Expands the Broadest Portfolio of Microsoft Cloud 
      Offerings for Cloud Service Providers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Unveils support for Microsoft Azure Pack for Hosting Providers and 
      updates solutions for Microsoft Lync 2013 Hosting Pack, Microsoft 
      Exchange 2013, and Microsoft Office 365
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parallels, 
      a leading hosting and cloud services enablement provider, today unveiled 
      support for a Microsoft Azure Pack for Hosting Providers and updates to 
      a collection of cloud service delivery solutions for Microsoft partners 
      at Microsoft&#8217;s 
      Worldwide Partner Conference. The solution, developed in 
      collaboration with Microsoft&#8217;s server and tools business group, is in 
      addition to the new support of Microsoft Azure Pack for Hosting. 
      Parallels has also updated its support for Microsoft Lync 2013 Hosting 
      Pack, Microsoft Exchange 2013 and Microsoft Office 365. The new product 
      and updated features help make Parallels, a Microsoft Global ISV and 
      Gold Certified Partner, a leading company in enabling Microsoft Cloud 
      solutions via cloud distribution channels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To help address small and medium businesses&#8217; growing need for robust 
      cloud solutions, Parallels has been collaborating with Microsoft since 
      2007 to enable the delivery of cloud services for telecom companies, 
      domain hosting providers, distributors, managed service providers and 
      VARs. This has helped Parallels develop services with value-added 
      support to help its service provider partners drive more revenue faster 
      by offering essential solutions for specific SMB workloads. These 
      solutions include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft Azure Pack for Hosting Providers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With this new product announced today, Parallels now helps bring the 
      power of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure platform into a domain hosting provider&#8217;s 
      datacenter for sales to service provider&#8217;s SMB customers. Service 
      providers can now speed their time to market and deliver the latest 
      innovations from Microsoft ahead of their competitors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft Office 365
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parallels simultaneously shipped an upgrade to the latest Microsoft 
      Office 365 release, allowing service providers to stay up to date with 
      the latest Microsoft releases. Among the new features included is 
      multi-language support to help address differing regional needs. 
      Parallels now supports more than one third of the Microsoft Office 
      Hosted 365 partners around the globe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft Lync Hosting Pack
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With an increasing amount of SMBs taking advantage of the benefits that 
      instant, collaborative and unified communication brings them, Parallels 
      simultaneously shipped availability for Microsoft Hosting Pack for Lync. 
      Made available to customers in May, solution providers can now add this 
      market changing technology to their overall cloud services portfolio 
      easily and quickly. Parallels partners have more than tripled the number 
      of hosted Microsoft Lync seats in the past year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft Exchange 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parallels helps service providers stay current and competitive with 
      Microsoft Exchange through multiple upgrades. Parallels partners 
      continue to grow hosted Exchange at over 40 percent year-over-year. 
      Parallels builds on its longstanding partnership with Microsoft Exchange 
      by supporting more than 750,000 hosted email subscribers under 
      management, with more than 75 hosting providers around the globe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Application Packing Standard
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parallels has been partnering with Microsoft to support the growing Application 
      Packing Standard (APS) ecosystem that helps package and deliver 
      critical services quickly. This includes solutions like email migration, 
      hosted desktop services on Windows Server from Dell, white glove email 
      migration services from Mural, automated email services from BitTitan, 
      security and archiving services from Symantec, McAfee and SpamExperts, 
      and Windows based backup services form BackupAgent. By being a part of 
      the Parallels APS ecosystem, ISVs can help service providers launch 
      services faster to market with lower deployment cost and superior 
      customer experiences. Parallels partners are selling upsell and cross 
      sell services of Microsoft core services at an average growth rate of 
      over a 100 percent year-over-year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

			Bluetooth SIG Announces Record Growth in Device Qualifications 
      Spurred by OS Support for Bluetooth&#174; Smart 
      Ready from Apple, Google and Microsoft
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			YoY Growth in End Product Listings for Bluetooth Smart Ready and 
      Bluetooth Smart Devices Tops 186 Percent for H1 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A string of moves to add increasing levels of Bluetooth 
      Smart Ready and Bluetooth Smart technology integration by leading OS 
      providers like Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, and most recently, Google, 
      sets the stage for extraordinary growth of Bluetooth Smart devices. 
      Apple, Google and Microsoft released upgrades from their respective 
      developer conferences making it easier for developers to build 
      appcessory devices. The potential for Bluetooth Smart is virtually 
      unlimited as soccer balls, tennis shoes, watches, keyless entry systems, 
      and even beds already utilize the ultra-low power technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The explosion of Bluetooth Smart devices we are currently seeing &#8211; from 
      huge brands like Nike, Adidas and Qwikset, to innovative startups like 
      Tethercell, Hipkey, 94Fifty, and Pebble &#8211; is really just the tip of the 
      iceberg,&#8221; said Suke Jawanda, Bluetooth SIG CMO. &#8220;Driven by OS support 
      from all the major providers, analysts project a ten-fold shipment 
      increase. Our focus must now turn to providing developers the tools to 
      make it simple to create Bluetooth Smart products and companion 
      applications.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on record membership and Bluetooth End Product Listing (EPL) 
      growth trends, the Bluetooth 
      SIG fully expects continued growth in the sports and fitness market, 
      along with significant development in home automation and home 
      entertainment, consumer electronics, automotive, and health and medical 
      markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lisa Arrowsmith, associate director for connectivity at IHS,&#160;commented, 
      &#8220;The announcement of native Bluetooth Smart support in the upcoming 4.3 
      release for Android adds to the growing list of operating systems 
      supporting this technology, following earlier announcements from Apple, 
      Microsoft and Blackberry. This has a major impact on Bluetooth Smart 
      adoption in smartphone accessories, such as sports and fitness 
      monitoring devices. According to IHS&#8217;s Low-Power Wireless Intelligence 
      Service, over 7 million Bluetooth Smart ICs were estimated to have 
      shipped for use in sports and fitness devices in the first half of 2013 
      alone. Overall, annual shipments of Bluetooth Smart ICs are projected to 
      grow more than ten-fold from this year to 2018, as the technology gains 
      growing traction within a broad range of other applications.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Added Jawanda, &#8220;Achieving connectivity across all of these markets is no 
      easy task. To realize the potential of the Internet of Everything, we 
      need a ubiquitous wireless standard with the flexibility to unite new 
      players, new companies and new products never before imagined. Bluetooth 
      is that technology. Quite frankly, I cannot wait to see what comes next.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			For Developers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Bluetooth SIG launched a developer enablement initiative on the 
      Bluetooth Developer Portal featuring resources shortening the 
      time-to-market for product and app developers building with Bluetooth. 
      The site contains comprehensive tools and information and a developer 
      forum. Additionally, the Bluetooth SIG announced the Bluetooth 
      Application Accelerator for Android, Apple and Microsoft, consisting of 
      an application and corresponding commented source code, documentation 
      describing major areas of functionality, and overview videos. To learn

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, July 8 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank has
hired former Goldman Sachs managing director Boon Kee Tan
to be its head of client coverage for Southeast Asia, a source
familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan, who will be based in Singapore, will also cover
Southeast Asian financial institutions. She will also head the
bank's corporate finance operations in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tan is the latest hire in the region for Deutsche Bank as it
expands in Asian operations. In May, the bank hired former JP
Morgan executive Philip Lee as chief country officer for
Singapore and former Bank of America executive Sung Eun Ahn as
its new chief in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said hackers have attacked some computers by exploiting a bug in Windows first disclosed two months ago by a Google Inc researcher, who came under fire at the time for publicizing the flaw without going to the software company first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Walton Big Lake Development L.P. Announces Increase in Loan Amount 
      from Walton Affiliate
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Big Lake Development L.P. (the "Partnership") and its 
      general partner, Walton Big Lake Development Corporation (the "General 
      Partner") announce that the board of directors of the General 
      Partner has approved an increase in its loan amount from a Walton 
      affiliate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further to the Partnership's announcement on November 30, 2012, the 
      Partnership borrowed $5 million from an affiliate of Walton Global 
      Investments Ltd. (the "Walton Lender") at an annual interest 
      rate of up to 10.5%, from which the Partnership used $4,806,114.60 to 
      make a distribution to limited partners. The additional $193,885.40 was 
      used to pay down a portion of the Phase 1 construction loan. The amount 
      outstanding on the loan from the Walton Lender on June 30, 2013 was 
      $5,289,110,
			including principal and accrued interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The board of directors has approved an increase in the loan amount of 
      $900,000 (the "Walton Loan Increase") for the purpose of 
      paying a portion of the expenses related to construction of 215 Street 
      in Edmonton, which provides access to the property. The remainder of the 
      terms of the loan are unchanged. The original development plan provided 
      for improvements to 215 Street to be carried out in Phase 2 of the Big 
      Lake development. However, the Partnership has determined that it would 
      be prudent to complete the improvements to 215 Street in Phase 1 to 
      assist third-party sales efforts for single-family, multi-family and 
      mixed-use sites in the property. The remainder of the costs to improve 
      215 Street, which are estimated to be approximately $9,400,000 (before 
      recoveries to be received at a later date), are proposed to be borrowed 
      from the current Phase 1 construction lender (the "Phase 1 Lender"). 
      It was determined by the Partnership that it would be prudent to 
      implement the Walton Loan Increase to facilitate the further borrowing 
      from the Phase 1 Lender. It is anticipated that the repayment of the 
      loan from the Walton Lender will continue to be subordinate to the 
      repayment of the funds owing to the Phase 1 Lender.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan from the Walton Lender is a demand loan secured by, among other 
      things, a second mortgage on the Partnership's property. The principal 
      and interest thereunder (including the additional amount) will be due on 
      December 12, 2015, with the option of the Partnership to extend that 
      loan a further three years provided that the Partnership has not been in 
      default of any of the terms thereof. The loan may be repaid by the 
      Partnership prior to the due date without bonus or penalty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Loan Increase is a "related-party transaction" under Canadian 
      Securities Regulators Multilateral Instrument 61-101 ("MI 61-101"). 
      The Partnership is exempt from the formal valuation requirements 
      contained in MI 61-101 pursuant to Section 5.5(b) thereof because the 
      Units are not listed on a stock exchange. The Partnership is exempt from 
      the minority approval requirements contained in MI 61-101 because the 
      board of directors of the General Partner has determined that, pursuant 
      to Section 5.7(1)(f) of MI 61-101, the loan from the Walton Lender is on 
      reasonable commercial terms that are not less advantageous to the 
      Partnership than if the loan were obtained from a party dealing at arm's 
      length with the Partnership.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership was established in September 2010 to allow limited 
      partners to participate in the development of the Big Lake Property 
      comprising 135.5 acres of land in Edmonton, Alberta. Marketed under the 
      name "Hawks Ridge at Big Lake", the property is a three-phase 
      residential development located in northwest Edmonton.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Group of Companies is a multinational group of real estate 
      investment and development companies headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, 
      Canada. As one of North America&#8217;s leading land-based real estate 
      investment and development firms, its expertise is in the research, 
      acquisition, management and development of strategically located land in 
      major growth corridors throughout Canada and the U.S. Walton currently 
      manages over 74,000 acres, laying the foundation for communities where 
      people can live, work and play, and creating wealth for our clients 
      around the globe. Since 1979, Walton has returned over $1.4 billion CAD* 
      in client distributions.

&lt;p&gt;Within months of Jetter's arrival, IBM Japan fired a group of workers deemed to be underperforming in the kind of restructuring common in many Western countries but rare in Japan, where the most sought-after jobs have carried a promise of lifetime employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines is now being sued for wrongful termination in what is shaping up as a legal test case in one of the most divisive and politically charged issues facing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - whether to make it easier for companies operating in Japan to fire workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of economic stagnation, the prime minister hopes to shift Japan away from an employment system that prioritizes stability to focus on growth. On a Sunday television show, Abe said he wanted more hiring based on specialization or location - jobs that would offer benefits closer to full-time positions but be easier to cut if deemed no longer necessary - as one of his planned labor market reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates say these reforms would spur hiring and create opportunity for women and younger workers more likely to be stuck in lower-paid contract jobs without legal protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to move away from this notion of lifetime employment. That means all the Japanese individuals should be more independent," said Hiroshi Mikitani, chief executive of internet shopping firm Rakuten Inc and a member of an industrial competitiveness panel that advised Abe on economic reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But critics say the proposals are ill-timed. They would risk putting large numbers of mostly middle-aged men near peak earnings out of work just as the administration is trying to lift Japan from two decades of deflation and stagnant growth. The fired IBM workers are also middle aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What the Abe administration is trying to do with labor reform is extremely dangerous," said Kensaku Sugino, secretary general of JMIU, the union representing dismissed IBM workers. "What is happening at IBM Japan shows what is at stake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jetter, a German national and the first foreigner to head IBM Japan in nearly six decades, pushed ahead with a restructuring that led to the firing of more than two dozen IBM employees who were judged to be underperforming, union officials say.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, July 10 (Reuters) - When 27-year IBM veteran Martin
Jetter came to Tokyo last year, the new president of the
technology giant's Japanese arm had a radical idea: hold workers
accountable for performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within months of Jetter's arrival, IBM Japan fired a group
of workers deemed to be underperforming in the kind of
restructuring common in many Western countries but rare in
Japan, where the most sought-after jobs have carried a promise
of lifetime employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines is now being sued
for wrongful termination in what is shaping up as a legal test
case in one of the most divisive and politically charged issues
facing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - whether to make it easier for
companies operating in Japan to fire workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of economic stagnation, the prime minister hopes
to shift Japan away from an employment system that prioritises
stability to focus on growth. On a Sunday television show, Abe
said he wanted more hiring based on specialisation or location -
jobs that would offer benefits closer to full-time positions but
be easier to cut if deemed no longer necessary - as one of his
planned labour market reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates say these reforms would spur hiring and create
opportunity for women and younger workers more likely to be
stuck in lower-paid contract jobs without legal protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to move away from this notion of lifetime
employment. That means all the Japanese individuals should be
more independent," said Hiroshi Mikitani, chief executive of
internet shopping firm Rakuten Inc and a member of an
industrial competitiveness panel that advised Abe on economic
reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But critics say the proposals are ill-timed. They would risk
putting large numbers of mostly middle-aged men near peak
earnings out of work just as the administration is trying to
lift Japan from two decades of deflation and stagnant growth.
The fired IBM workers are also middle aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What the Abe administration is trying to do with labour
reform is extremely dangerous," said Kensaku Sugino, secretary
general of JMIU, the union representing dismissed IBM workers.
"What is happening at IBM Japan shows what is at stake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jetter, a German national and the first foreigner to head
IBM Japan in nearly six decades, pushed ahead with a
restructuring that led to the firing of more than two dozen IBM
employees who were judged to be underperforming, union officials
say. Five workers are suing IBM for wrongful termination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM declined to comment specifically on the court case or
make Jetter available for an interview. But in a statement, it
said that as a company investing in growth areas, such as big
data and cloud computing, "we need to remix our skills within
the context of a high performance work culture".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan ranked 134th out of 144 countries on the ease of
hiring and firing, a World Economic Forum report showed in 2012,
a rigidity many economists and executives believe has stifled
growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT 'CUT AND DRY'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives say vague wording in Japanese labour law gives
judges broad discretion in settling cases and puts a relatively
heavy burden on managers to prove they have made a concerted
effort to avoid cutting staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not cut and dry in the way it is in many other
countries," said Jonathan Sampson, regional director at Hays
Specialist Recruitment Japan, a recruiting firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only real option for companies looking to make large
cuts has been a voluntary retirement scheme, the method applied
to all 180,000 layoffs announced by Panasonic Corp and
other Japanese technology companies since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downside of such schemes is that companies are forced to
offer buyouts widely. In many cases, the most talented employees
take the severance package and go to work at a rival firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM case has garnered attention in part because union
officials say the company is targeting union members who have
received below-average appraisals and giving them short notice
to chose between resigning with a payout or being fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is not uncommon for companies in Japan to manage
out poorly performing staff, it is rare to do so in groups at
the same time. According to JMIU, IBM has fired 26 union members
since Jetter took the helm, including a dozen last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to lawsuits from three of the five workers suing
the company, IBM Japan said in court papers filed in 2012 it had
dismissed them only after a concerted effort to help them do
better at their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BACKLASH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasuchika Hasegawa, CEO of Takeda Pharmaceuticals,
created a stir in March when he proposed clarifying firing rules
and introducing the option of making cash compensation to
employees that have prevailed in wrongful termination cases,
rather than reinstating them at their old jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea triggered an immediate backlash from labour
supporters worried it would establish an easy way for companies
to cut staff. The head of Japanese Trade Union Confederation
said the emphasis should be to improve the plight of
"non-regular" employees with little job security, a sector that
has grown steadily and accounts for more than a third of workers
in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health ministry also challenged the notion it is
difficult to cut staff, citing data showing that companies win
as many as they lose in wrongful termination cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abe administration officials stepped back from the
contentious firing issue in April, indicating it needed further
debate. But Abe has pledged to return to the question of
deregulation and other reforms to spur growth after the July 21
upper house election, which his party and its coalition partner
are expected to win easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, analysts have cited the backpedalling as one of the
key disappointments in Abe's growth strategy announced in June.
Robert Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG, gave Abe
a "D plus" grade on labour market reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant reform will require a major change in mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stigma of cutting staff has driven many companies to
shuffle employees to divisions where they perform menial work or
are told their job is to search for work outside the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some employees stay in those posts for years, reflecting
both the difficulty of switching companies mid-career and the
enduring sense of corporate loyalty in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one example, an engineer at copier maker Ricoh Co
 who earned the distinction of "patent master" for
registering more than 100 patents during his career, says he was
banished to a logistics subsidiary after refusing to retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worker, who asked not to be named, says his job now
consists of loading and moving cardboard boxes at a warehouse.
He won an arbitration case last year, but the company appealed
and the case is now in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Ricoh spokesman said it was the company's policy not to
comment on an ongoing case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I were younger maybe I would try to go to another
company," the worker said, adding that a clause in the buyout
offered to him prevented him from joining rivals like Canon Inc
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just want to be able to return to my division or to
leverage my skills and experience somehow."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will unveil on Thursday its biggest management reorganization in at least five years, to better compete in a world of mobile devices and Web-based services, according to the technology blog AllThingsD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes will shift the duties and responsibilities of many top Microsoft executives and are intended to eliminate overlap within the 98,000-employee company, AllThingsD reported on Monday, citing anonymous sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new cloud computing and business-focused products unit would be headed by Satya Nadella, who currently oversees Microsoft's server business, according to a Bloomberg report last week.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
will unveil on Thursday its biggest management reorganization in
at least five years, to better compete in a world of mobile
devices and Web-based services, according to the technology blog
AllThingsD.&lt;/p&gt;

up Microsoft's presence on mobile devices as the computer
industry steadily declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer announced in his annual letter to shareholders last
October that Microsoft now sees itself as a "devices and
services" company, rather than a software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's last significant reorganization came in July
2008 when Ballmer split Microsoft's Platforms &amp; Services
Division into three units - Windows, Online Services and Server

helped by a rally that began in late April when the company
released strong revenue and earnings in what was one of the
worst quarters for PC sales on record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But consumers are increasingly turning to mobile devices

&lt;p&gt;WARSAW (Reuters) - Energy major Chevron (CVX.N) said on Tuesday it was committed to shale gas exploration in Poland though it wanted more consultation with the government on draft amendments to rules before they are adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three foreign firms - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Talisman (TLM.TO) and Marathon (MRO.N) - have pulled out of Polish shale gas, citing difficult geology and short-comings in the regulatory environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry lobby groups say the draft amendments to the hydrocarbons law, though better than previous versions, do not create the right conditions for firms to invest in Poland, which is seen by some in the industry as Europe's best shale gas hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John P. Claussen, Chevron's country manager for Poland, said the industry's dialogue with the government on the shale gas rules had been positive, but there were still issues with the draft to talk about. The environment ministry has submitted the draft to the cabinet for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would like the opportunity to continue to have dialogue about some of the issues that are going forward in the bill," Claussen told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There has been good consultation between the ministry of environment and the industry and there is more opportunity for that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claussen would not specify which areas of the draft his company wanted changed. Industry groups have said they want more assurances that they can convert exploration permits into production licenses if they hit gas, more time to explore if needed, and lighter penalties if they miss deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXPLORATION WELL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has four concessions in southeastern Poland, which represent its first shale gas presence in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claussen said that after drilling an exploration well on one of the concessions, Frampol, the company did not plan any further work on that particular well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to say if that decision was made because data from the well showed there were no commercial reserves. He did say though that Chevron was planning more work on other wells, and was not ruling out more wells on the Frampol concession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where the industry is right now is evaluation of potential resources .... It's still very preliminary in terms of the results that we have," Claussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still committed to the work that we are doing in Poland. We still have work to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At another of its Polish shale gas concessions, near the village of Zurawlow, local people occupied a work site when contractors started trying to erect a fence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claussen said the company was working with local authorities to try to resolve that issue. He said the company was committed to operating in a safe and responsible way, and was bringing real benefits to communities where it operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campaigners say extracting shale gas, which involves pumping liquid at high pressure into the earth to fracture rock formations that trap natural gas, is harmful to the environment, something the industry denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jeff Coelho)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM, July 9 (Reuters) - Philips aims to
offset weakness in street and home lighting systems by
partnering with Walt Disney Co to sell Mickey and Minnie
Mouse night lamps for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest lighting maker is feeling the impact of
fragile consumer demand, weak construction markets and
government budget cuts in Europe which have translated into
lower demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither company disclosed financial details at the product
launch but they demonstrated a child's bedroom where the typical
 overhead lamp was replaced by multiple coloured lights and
imitation candles, including under the bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lights are either decorated with or in the shape of
various Disney characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Philips launched "hue", a home lighting system 
controlled via a smartphone app and sold through Apple's stores,
as it tries to reinvent its range of consumer lighting products
and spur demand for LED bulbs which last several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philips' earnings before interest, tax and amortisation
(EBITA) at its lighting division more than halved last year to
188 million euros on sales of 8.44 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philips and Disney said the new children's lights would go
on sale in Europe and the United States from September, followed
by Asia and Canada later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Higher profit offsets worries over increased competition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Content division revenue rises 5.1 pct from yr ago quarter

 (Adds comments from conference call, updates share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, July 9 (Reuters) - Shares in Mexican media
company Grupo Televisa climbed more than 4 percent
on Tuesday after the company posted a higher second-quarter
profit that helped offset worries over the potential for
increased competition under an impending telecommunications
reform in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares of Mexico's No. 1 broadcaster have fallen almost
9 percent this year through Monday on concern that sweeping
changes to telecommunications and broadcasting rules could eat
into Televisa's revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa, the world's biggest producer of Spanish-language
content, said late on Monday lower financing costs helped boost
its profit nearly 31 percent from the same year-ago
period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales from the company's content division, which includes
advertising as well as licensing for Televisa's soap operas and
other programming, increased 5.1 percent from the year-earlier
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on a conference call on Tuesday questioned Televisa
executives about the potential impact of reforms that will
introduce two new television networks, greater foreign
investment and create a more powerful regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa's executive vice president, Alfonso de Angoitia,
declined to comment in detail about the reforms, noting that the
secondary laws that will guide their implementation have yet to
be written. That process should begin in September, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa shares were up 3.50 percent at 64.42 pesos at 1420
GMT.

			The Coca-Cola Company and World Wildlife Fund 
      Expand Global Partnership, Announce New Environmental Goals
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Partnership and Company set ambitious global Water, Climate, 
      Packaging and Agriculture performance goals
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) are working to 
      advance the Coca-Cola system&#8217;s sustainability stewardship with the 
      announcement today of new, bold global environmental goals and an 
      expanded global partnership.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These ambitious goals, which complement other Coca-Cola well-being and 
      community commitments, focus on sustainable management of water, energy, 
      and packaging use as well as sustainable sourcing of agricultural 
      ingredients through 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Building on the initial successes of their nearly decade-long 
      partnership, Coca-Cola and WWF have agreed to extend their efforts by 
      meeting ambitious new conservation and performance targets, promoting 
      the integration of nature&#8217;s value into decision-making processes and 
      convening influential partners to help solve shared global environmental 
      challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At Coca-Cola, we are deeply committed to working with partners to 
      address our collective environmental challenges and responsibly manage 
      the planet&#8217;s resources,&#8221; said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive 
      Officer, The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;As we face a resource-stressed world 
      with growing global demands on food and water, we must seek solutions 
      that drive mutual benefit for business, communities and nature. Working 
      with WWF will continue to challenge our Company to advance our 
      sustainability programs, and WWF&#8217;s expertise will be instrumental in 
      reaching our environmental performance goals, some of which they help us 
      set.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are witnessing unprecedented demands on natural resources around the 
      world. Continuing with business as usual puts everything at risk, 
      including the viability of business,&#8221; said Carter Roberts, President and 
      CEO, World Wildlife Fund. &#8220;These problems can only be solved by working 
      together, and our work with Coca-Cola has proven that collaboration can 
      amplify and accelerate the impact we need.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the renewed and expanded partnership, Coca-Cola and WWF jointly 
      developed new 2020 environmental sustainability goals for the Coca-Cola 
      system &#8211; the Company and its nearly 300 bottling partners in more than 
      200 countries. These goals include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      1. Improve water efficiency by 25%. 
      Coca-Cola will improve its water use efficiency per liter of product 
      produced through operational advancements throughout the Coca-Cola 
      system. This target complements the 21.4 percent improvement in water 
      use efficiency achieved from 2004 through 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      2. Help ensure healthy, resilient freshwater 
      systems. Coca-Cola and WWF will expand their joint 
      conservation efforts to 11 key regions across five continents, including 
      river basins of the Amazon, Koshi, Mekong, Rio Grande/Bravo, Yangtze and 
      Zambezi; the catchments of the Great Barrier Reef and Mesoamerican Reef; 
      and key regions in the Amur-Heilong, Atlantic Forests and Northern Great 
      Plains.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      3. Reduce CO2 
      emissions embedded in &#8216;the drink in your hand&#8217; by 25%. Coca-Cola 
      will work to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions across its entire value 
      chain, making comprehensive carbon footprint reductions across its 
      manufacturing processes, packaging formats, delivery fleet, 
      refrigeration equipment and ingredient sourcing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      4. Responsibly source material for PlantBottle&#8482; 
      packaging.&#160;Coca-Cola will work with WWF to assess 
      the environmental and social performance of plant-based materials for 
      potential use in its PlantBottle&#8482; packaging. This will enable the 
      Company to meet its goal to use up to 30 percent plant-based material 
      for all its PET plastic bottles by 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      5. Sustainably source key agricultural 
      ingredients. Coca-Cola will work to sustainably source 
      its key ingredients, including sugarcane, sugar beet, corn, tea, coffee, 
      palm oil, soy, pulp and paper fiber, and orange. Coca-Cola also has 
      established Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles and will work 
      with WWF to implement the guidelines throughout the Coca-Cola system for 
      these commodities. In addition, Coca-Cola is also working to sustainably 
      source lemon, grape, apple and mango.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the goals jointly developed and announced with WWF, 
      Coca-Cola has reaffirmed its water replenishment goal and evolved its 
      package recovery goal through 2020 to include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      6. Replenish 100% of water used. Coca-Cola 
      will return treated water from its manufacturing processes back to the 
      environment at a level that supports aquatic life, and replenish the 
      water used in its finished beverage products through continuing its 
      community water projects with partners in more than 100 countries. To 
      date, Coca-Cola&#8217;s replenishment work has balanced an estimated 52 
      percent of product volume through 468 projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      7. Reach a 75% recovery rate of bottles and 
      cans in developed markets. Coca-Cola will work with 
      the beverage industry and local organizations to establish baseline 
      information and work to increase recovery and recycling in developing 
      markets. The Company will continue to reduce the amount of material and 
      energy used in its packaging as well as continue to use both recycled 
      and renewable content.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since 2007, The Coca-Cola Company and WWF have worked together to 
      conserve and protect freshwater resources around the world while helping 
      to improve the efficiency of Coca-Cola&#8217;s global operations. To date, the 
      partnership has led to major conservation gains, including helping to 
      improve the ecological health of seven of the world&#8217;s most important 
      freshwater basins across five continents, helping improve the Coca-Cola 
      system&#8217;s water efficiency by 20 percent, working to prevent 5 million 
      metric tons of CO2 emissions across Coca-Cola&#8217;s global 
      manufacturing operations, and promoting more sustainable agricultural 
      practices in the Company&#8217;s supply chain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WARSAW, July 9 (Reuters) - Energy major Chevron is
not planning any more work on a shale gas exploration well at
its Frampol concession in south-eastern Poland, but is still
working on other wells and is committed to Polish exploration,
its country manager said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We got enough information on one particular well, at
Frampol, and we are not planning additional work there, but on
some of the other wells we have, we are planning more work,"
John P. Claussen told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about draft amendments to Poland's hydrocarbon law
which the environment ministry has submitted to the cabinet for
approval, Claussen said the firm wanted the opportunity to
continue dialogue with the government on the draft.&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Adds Third Group II Base Oil Hub in Europe
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			UK Tankage Augments Supply Reliability Of Premium Base Oil
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Lubricants
			today announced that it will be adding an 
      additional storage facility for Group II base oil in Eastham, England. 
      This is Chevron&#8217;s third Group II supply hub in Europe in addition to 
      storage facilities in Antwerp, Belgium and Hamburg, Germany. A complete 
      product line will be inventoried at the facility, including Group II 
      grades, 100R, 220R, 600R and Group II+, 110RLV.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s growing Group II base oil presence in Europe will give 
      lubricant marketers more formulating flexibility in meeting tightening 
      specifications for better fuel economy and reduced tailpipe emissions. 
      Historically European lubricants have been formulated with some 
      combination of Group I and Group III base oils plus additives that were 
      readily available in the European market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Performance specifications are tightening in Europe to the point that 
      Group II quality base oil will advantage many formulations,&#8221; said Cary 
      Knuth, General Manager, Base Oils, Chevron Lubricants. &#8220;This new supply 
      hub highlights Chevron&#8217;s commitment to providing reliable supply to 
      European lubricant producers as they transition to new formulations."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The latest specifications call for formulations that have low to medium 
      amounts of Sulphated Ash, Phosphorus and Sulphur (SAPS). Meeting those 
      specifications has lead to a base oil supply gap for producers of 10W-XX 
      and 15W-XX multigrade lubricants, which account for more than 85% of the 
      Heavy-Duty Motor Oil (HDMO) market in Europe. Group III alone has 
      insufficient viscometrics to meet the performance requirements for 
      heavier motor oil grades and Group I has too much sulphur for the new 
      specifications. Heavy-duty engines require lubricants that provide 
      sufficient high temperature/high shear (HTHS) characteristics to ensure 
      adequate wear protection and maximize engine durability. Blending with 
      Group II base oil, whose primary difference from Group III is higher 
      viscosity, is the proven way to deliver adequate engine protection while 
      meeting Medium and Low SAPS specifications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s growing network of hubs in Europe will be supplied with base 
      oil from Chevron&#8217;s new state of the art base oil plant that is nearing 
      completion in Pascagoula, Mississippi. When it starts-up, it will be one 
      of the largest base oil plants in the world and is expected to produce 
      25 kBD (1250 kMT) of premium Group II base oil. It is the third plant 
      where Chevron premium base oils are produced for the company&#8217;s global 
      supply chain. With the addition of the Pascagoula barrels, Chevron will 
      become the world's largest producer of premium base oil and the only 
      Group II producer with multiple plants producing fungible base oils.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      of Victoria has won the MathWorks modeling award as part of the 
      EcoCAR 2 student competition. The award recognizes the team&#8217;s use of MATLAB 
      and Simulink 
      for Model-Based 
      Design during the three-year competition to reengineer a 2013 
      Chevrolet Malibu to improve its fuel efficiency. Other schools to place 
      included Ohio 
      State University and Mississippi 
      State University, winning second and third place respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Eleven EcoCAR 2 teams participated in the MathWorks Modeling Award 
      competition. The teams demonstrated their innovative use of modeling and 
      simulation through a presentation and QA session coinciding with the 
      end of Year Two of the three-year challenge. Winners were assessed on 
      how well they applied Model-Based Design concepts using MathWorks tools, 
      including the key areas of plant modeling, control design and tuning, 
      data analysis, industrial grade Model-Based Design development process 
      elements, and lessons learned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Student competitions are a great way to inspire our next generation of 
      engineers while giving them an appreciation for working toward greater 
      causes,&#8221; said Paul Smith, Director, Consulting Services Group, 
      MathWorks. &#8220;These competitions also give students real-world engineering 
      experience with the hardware and software used in professional 
      environments. MathWorks was very impressed with the enthusiasm and 
      professionalism of the student presenters.&#8221;

			AIMS Innovation Launches Multi-Tenant Capability for its Intelligent 
      Monitoring Solution for Microsoft BizTalk
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Opens Door for Enterprise System Integrators to Increase Service 
      Revenue
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft WPC &#8211; AIMS Innovation, a Microsoft&#174; BizSpark&#174; One 
      partner, announced the first multi-tenant capability for its intelligent 
      monitoring solution AIMS for BizTalk at the 2013 Microsoft Worldwide 
      Partner Conference. This new feature helps those working with system 
      integrations to improve productivity and efficiency by monitoring their 
      clients&#8217; BizTalk systems using an Azure hosted, web-based dashboard. By 
      cutting down on monitoring and troubleshooting time, the solution frees 
      up integrators to create high-value services with recurring revenue 
      streams.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With unplanned outages costing more than $5,000 per minute1, 
      system integrators can no longer afford to use inefficient monitoring 
      tools for their customers,&#8221;&#160;said Ivar Sagemo, CEO of AIMS 
      Innovation.&#160;&#8220;AIMS Innovations&#8217; solution virtually eliminates downtime 
      related to integrated platforms.&#160;This saves everyone money and gives 
      third-party consultants the time and tools to increase their revenue on 
      higher-margin services.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Benefits of AIMS Multi-Tenant Capability
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Decreases monitoring time. With this solution, IT 
        administrators don&#8217;t need to log onto remote client systems or VPNs. 
        Plus, they don&#8217;t need to determine each client&#8217;s operational threshold.
      
			
				Minimizes downtime. It is the only solution in the market today 
        that sends early warning alerts before downtime occurs and pinpoints 
        the problem&#8217;s exact location through a color-coded graphical interface.
      
			
				Learns and adapts to systems&#8217; behavior. The solution learns 
        enterprise systems&#8217; normal behavior and modifies alerts, so it becomes 
        more accurate over time.
      
			
				Easy and fast to install: The solution can be installed through 
        Microsoft Azure cloud in five minutes or through local install without 
        any special training.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Traditional enterprise software-monitoring tools require IT staff to 
      select parameters to monitor and guesstimate alert thresholds. As 
      a result, traditional tools send too many or too few alerts, making it 
      hard for integrators to know when to take action.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - JP Morgan has appointed
Achintya Mangla as co-head of equity capital markets (ECM) for
Europe, Middle East and Africa, according to an internal memo
seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangla, who joined the bank in 2002, was most recently
co-head of ECM for Asia excluding Japan and Australia and will
relocate to London from Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He replaces Ina De, who was recently appointed co-head of UK
investment banking, and will work alongside existing co-head of
ECM for EMEA Klaus Hessberger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan was fifth in the EMEA investment banking league
tables for ECM at the end of the first half of 2013, according
to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the bank confirmed the contents of the
memo but declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Profit up almost 31 percent to over 1.8 billion pesos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Revenue rises 6.4 percent to 18.1 billion pesos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, July 8 (Reuters) - Mexican media company Grupo
Televisa, the world's biggest producer of Spanish-language
content, said on Monday lower financing costs helped boost its
second-quarter net profit nearly 31 percent from the same
year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa reported a net profit of 1.826 billion pesos ($141
million) compared to 1.396 billion pesos in the year-earlier
quarter. Revenue rose 6.4 percent to nearly 18.1 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa's investment costs soared in the second-quarter of
2012 due to its acquisition of 50 percent of cellphone company
Iusacell from Grupo Salinas, which controls Mexico's No. 2
broadcaster TV Azteca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financing costs in the second quarter fell by 963 million
pesos compared to the same period last year to under 1.2 billion
pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa shares are down nearly 9 percent so far this year
after lawmakers passed a law that seeks to increase competition
in the television market. Analysts warn the stock could face
further pressure as a more powerful regulator comes into office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details on purchase agreement, Andina CEO's comments)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SANTIAGO, July 10 (Reuters) - Chilean bottler Embotelladora
Andina signed an agreement on Wednesday to buy Brazilian
Coca-Cola bottler Companhia de Bebidas Ipiranga in a transaction
valued at 1.218 billion reais, or $539 million, Andina said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andina's  and Ipiranga's board of
directors have approved the transaction, which is expected to be
completed during the second half of 2013, the Chilean company
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal "highlights our commitment to the Brazilian market,
as we see it as a region of immense growth potential with a
valuable consumer market that will further fuel our operations,"
Andina chief executive Miguel Angel Peirano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ipiranga, with operations in Brazil's Sao Paulo and Minas
Gerais states, had 2012 volume sales of 89.3 million unit cases
and revenues of 695 million reais, or $356 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andina said that the transaction, which it expects to
finance with debt, would allow it to "capture operative and
logistics synergies for approximately 10 million reais per year,
as well as tax efficiencies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andina already has operations in parts of Argentina, Brazil,
and Chile, as well as all of Paraguay.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The email that gave former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) vice president Fabrice Tourre his "fabulous Fab" nickname can be introduced at his upcoming securities fraud trial, a federal judge tentatively ruled on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July 10 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp, the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said on Wednesday its oil and gas production
declined last quarter, mainly due to various shutdowns and
maintenance work in Kazakhstan, Australia and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While refining operations improved on the previous quarter
with the completion of major maintenance at two large U.S.
refineries, output from Chevron's oil and gas wells accounts for
about nine-tenths of its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, the company produced the oil equivalent of 2.57
million barrels per day in the first two months of the quarter,
down about 80,000 bpd from the first quarter and running well
short of its full-year average production target of 2.65 million
bpd for 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"International net oil-equivalent production decreased
71,000 barrels per day, primarily due to planned turnaround
activity in Kazakhstan and Australia, maintenance in Nigeria,
and lower demand in Thailand," Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its interim update for the second quarter, the company
said average U.S. production of oil and gas from wells fell to
659,000 bpd in April and May from an average 664,000 for the
entire first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's domestic refining operations had been hit hard by
the shutdown of a key unit at its plant in Richmond, California,
after a fire last August. That unit started up in late April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. refinery input averaged 759,000 bpd in April and May,
up from 576,000 in the first quarter. In the second quarter a
year ago - the last period of full U.S. refining production
before the Richmond fire - input was 928,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as in April, the San Ramon, California-based company
did not give a directional indication of where its quarterly
earnings were headed in its interim update, as it has done every
quarter in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron were down 10 cents in after-hours trading
at $122.80. The company will post full second-quarter results on
Aug. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      U.S. net oil-equivalent production was comparable with first quarter 
      2013 results. International net oil-equivalent production decreased 
      71,000 barrels per day, primarily due to planned turnaround activity in 
      Kazakhstan and Australia, maintenance in Nigeria, and lower demand in 
      Thailand.

      U.S. refinery crude-input volumes increased by 183,000 barrels per day, 
      largely due to the completion of planned maintenance activity at the 
      Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery and the late-April restart of the 
      Richmond, California refinery crude unit which resumed normal operations 
      by quarter-end. International refinery crude-input volumes increased 
      40,000 barrels per day, reflecting completion of maintenance activities 
      at the Burnaby, Canada and Cape Town, South Africa refineries. Chemicals 
      earnings are expected to be lower due to planned and unplanned outages 
      affecting ethylene production.

			This interim update of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking 
      statements relating to Chevron&#8217;s operations that are based on 
      management&#8217;s current expectations, estimates and projections about the 
      petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries. Words such as 
      &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221;

      &#8220;outlook&#8221; and similar expressions are intended to identify such 
      forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of 
      future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and 
      other factors, many of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control and are 
      difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ 
      materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking 
      statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these 
      forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this 
      interim update. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no 
      obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as 
      a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing 
      crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and 
      chemical margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of 
      exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness 
      of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological 
      developments; the results of operations and financial condition of 
      equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company&#8217;s 
      production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation 
      networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability 
      for remedial actions or assessments required by existing or future 
      environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or 
      product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes, 
      regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other 
      pending or future litigation; the company&#8217;s future acquisition or 
      disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or 
      impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, 
      industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on 
      scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with 
      the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally 
      accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and 
      the factors set forth under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on pages 28 
      through 30 of the company&#8217;s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 
      addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and 
      international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or 
      unknown factors not discussed in this interim update could also have 
      material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Jobs, Dick Clark and Other 
      Talented Contributors To Disney History To Be Honored At A Ceremony On 
      Saturday, August 10
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Monsters Inc. and Monsters University stars Billy Crystal 
      and John Goodman, technology visionary Steve Jobs, television icon Dick 
      Clark and other beloved contributors to the Disney legacy will be named 
      and honored as official Disney Legends during the D23 
      Expo 2013 at 2 p.m. on Saturday, August 10, in the D23 Expo 
      Arena at the Anaheim Convention Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Disney Legends Awards program is a 26-year tradition of The Walt 
      Disney Company. The three-day D23 Expo provides a rare 
      opportunity for the public to be a part of the always touching and 
      memorable presentation, hosted by noted television personality Tom 
      Bergeron (host of ABC&#8217;s Dancing with the Stars and America&#8217;s 
      Funniest Home Videos).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Disney Legend Award is our highest and most coveted honor,&#8221; said 
      Disney Chairman and CEO Bob Iger.&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s reserved for the extraordinary 
      visionaries and artists behind the Disney magic, the men and women who 
      push the limits of innovation and creativity to ensure Disney remains 
      truly special.&#160;The eight Legends we honor this year helped create some 
      of our most beloved characters along with exciting new worlds and 
      thrilling attractions. They also entertained millions of people and 
      expanded our definition of what&#8217;s possible.&#160;They are all indelible parts 
      of our legacy, and we are proud to recognize them as true Disney 
      Legends.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2013 Disney Legends Award honorees (listed alphabetically) are:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			TONY BAXTER has developed beloved Disney attractions including 
      Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Journey Into Imagination, Splash 
      Mountain, and countless more over the course of his 43-year career with 
      Walt Disney Imagineering. Revered by Disney fans, he is best known for 
      his commitment to storytelling, attention to detail, and ability to 
      develop new ideas and attractions by combining time-tested design 
      practices with modern technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			COLLIN CAMPBELL touched almost every part of the Walt Disney 
      Company, from animated classics to legendary theme park attractions, 
      with stints in live action film and television. Collin&#8217;s work with Walt 
      Disney Imagineering includes the development of Walt Disney&#8217;s Enchanted 
      Tiki Room, Pirates of the Caribbean, as well as concept illustrations of 
      Magic Kingdom Park and Epcot Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			DICK CLARK brought rock and roll to 40 million homes across the 
      country with the national debut of American Bandstand on ABC in 
      1958. He went on to produce game shows, award shows including the Golden 
      Globes&#174; and the Academy of Country Music Awards, comedy specials, 
      movies, and other popular television specials. Dick might best be 
      remembered, however, as the host of ABC&#8217;s annual Dick Clark&#8217;s New 
      Year&#8217;s Rockin&#8217; Eve from 1973 until 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Wazowski, the frenetic, green cyclopean monster from Monsters Inc. 
      and Monsters University. Best known for his memorable roles in When 
      Harry Met Sally&#8230;, The Princess Bride, and City Slickers, 
      Billy, who has won six Emmy Awards and one Tony Award, has also been a 
      fixture on ABC television, where he hosted the Academy Awards&#174; broadcast 
      nine times and found his breakthrough role as Jodie Dallas on Soap 
      from 1977-81.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JOHN GOODMAN is a celebrated actor of stage and screen, and the 
      voice behind James P. Sullivan, better known as &#8220;Sully,&#8221; from Monsters 
      Inc. and Monsters University. Among John&#8217;s notable film

      Coyote Ugly, O Brother, Where Art Thou, and Confessions 
      of a Shopaholic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			STEVE JOBS changed the world of consumer electronics as the 
      founder of Apple, and was known throughout the world for his visionary 
      attitude and penchant for innovation. He was an early investor and chief 
      executive of Pixar, and became the Walt Disney Company&#8217;s largest 
      shareholder overnight when it acquired Pixar Animation Studios in 2006. 
      That same year, he joined the Disney board of directors, and remained a 
      valuable sounding board and advisor to the company until his passing in 
      2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			GLEN KEANE has brought to life many of Walt Disney Animation 
      Studios&#8217; most popular characters. Since becoming a Disney animator in 
      1974, he has animated classic Disney characters such as Penny in The 
      Rescuers, Elliott in Pete&#8217;s Dragon, Ratigan in The Great 
      Mouse Detective, the Beast in Beauty and the Beast, and the 
      titular characters in The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Pocahontas, 
      and Tarzan. In 2010, Glen served as Executive Producer and 
      Animation Supervisor for Tangled, a story he developed for more 
      than ten years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ED WYNN, a comedian whose career began on Broadway in the early 
      1900s, appeared in numerous Disney classics of the 1960s, including Mary 
      Poppins, Babes in Toyland, That Darn Cat, The 
      Absent-Minded Professor, and Son of Flubber. Fans of Disney 
      animation know him as the manic and distinctive voice of the Mad Hatter 
      in Alice in Wonderland.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each honoree receives a two-foot-tall bronze Disney Legends sculpture 
      that signifies the imagination, creativity and magic they have brought 
      to the Company. Disney Legends Award recipients also participate in a 
      handprint ceremony, and their bronzed prints will be displayed in the 
      Disney Legends Plaza at the Company&#8217;s Burbank headquarters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Admission to the ceremony will be on a first-come, first-served basis

      the 4,000-seat D23 Expo Arena, the ceremony will be simulcast into a 
      2,000-seat overflow theater inside the Convention Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first Disney Legend, actor Fred MacMurray (The Shaggy Dog, The 
      Absent-Minded Professor, The Happiest Millionaire), was named 
      in 1987. Including this year&#8217;s honorees, a total of 237 Disney Legends

      White, Tony Anselmo, Bill Farmer, Harry Archinal, Don Iwerks and Leota

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said it received approval from the European health regulator to expand use of its anti-bacterial vaccine to a wider population of adults aged 18 to 49 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine, Prevenar 13, was previously approved in Europe for use in infants, young children and adolescents between the ages of 6 weeks and 17 years and adults of 50 years and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is used to prevent infections from 13 strains of the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterium, which can cause pneumonia, ear infections and even fatal diseases such as pneumococcal meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is approved for use in infants and young children in more than 120 countries, and for use in adults aged 50 and over in more than 80 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the vaccine, known as Prevnar 13, in the United States, for children and adolescents aged 6 years to 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Prevnar, which is Pfizer's third-biggest brand, were hit in the first quarter, because wholesalers, with adequate supplies already on hand, held off on purchases of the vaccine.

			Plantronics Wearable Technology Enables Avtex to Provide a Seamless 
      Microsoft Lync Experience
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Leveraging the Plantronics Spokes SDK and the contextually aware 
      Voyager Legend UC, Avtex Smart Forward Agent Application Allows Users to 
      Automatically Transfer Calls to their Mobile Device
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference - Plantronics (NYSE:PLT), 
      a pioneer in wearable technology, today announced that a key partner, 
      Avtex Solutions, has developed the Avtex Smart Forward Agent application 
      to provide users with additional functionality when they use the Voyager 
      Legend UC headset with Microsoft Lync. By leveraging the contextual 
      information the Legend provides about how close a user is to their PC 
      while wearing it, Avtex 
      Smart Forward Agent can automatically turn the Lync Call Forwarding 
      or Simultaneous Ring features on when the user walks away from their PC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Plantronics is excited to see our partners leveraging the broad 
      capabilities of the Voyager Legend UC to bring users an application that 
      enhances the Lync experience beyond audio,&#8221; said Joe Burton, senior vice 
      president of Technology, Development  Strategy and CTO at Plantronics. 
      &#8220;With users becoming increasingly mobile the Avtex Smart Forward Agent 
      better integrates a user&#8217;s mobile phone with Lync for a truly unified 
      communications experience.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By automatically turning on the Call Forwarding or Simultaneous Ring 
      feature when stepping away from their PC, or turning it off completely &#8211; 
      users can communicate the most up to date presence to contacts and 
      maximize the Microsoft Lync experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We based the Avtex Smart Forward Agent application on the Plantronics 
      Spokes SDK because of Plantronics&#8217; unique ability to tap into aspects of 
      a person&#8217;s physical world,&#8221; said Colleen Reynolds, vice president at 
      Avtex Solutions. &#8220;The sophisticated sensor technology Plantronics 
      incorporates into their headsets automatically creates a contextually 
      aware platform for Avtex to build on. We are confident our two 
      technologies will bring users a seamless call forwarding experience.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Avtex saw the opportunity to enhance the Lync experience by capitalizing 
      on the Spokes SDK&#8482; and the embedded sensor technology within Plantronics 
      headsets. Avtex created the Avtex Smart Forward Agent application, which 
      could communicate contextual data with the PC and headset through a 
      Bluetooth&#174; USB Adapter to sense users&#8217; presence, automatically prompting 
      the Lync Call Forwarding or Simultaneous Ring feature as needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft Lync connects people everywhere, on Windows 8 and other 
      operating systems including mobile devices, as part of their everyday 
      productivity experience. Lync provides a consistent, single client 
      experience for presence, instant messaging, voice, video, and a greater 
      meeting experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Avtex Smart Forward Agent, Plantronics has a full suite of endpoints 
      Optimized for Microsoft Lync 2013. Delivering a choice of high quality 
      audio endpoints can be critical for user adoption of any unified

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp launched its biggest internal overhaul in five years to streamline the development of products from Windows to tablets, hoping to catch nimbler rivals in mobile and cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Shakeup designed to cut red tape; catch up in mobile,
cloud era&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Creates four main divisions, down from five&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Helps shore up Ballmer's hold over mega-corporation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares climb 3 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Alexei Oreskovic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 11 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
launched its biggest internal overhaul in five years to
streamline the development of products from Windows to tablets,
hoping to catch nimbler rivals in mobile and cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of coordination and infighting have hurt innovation
within the $74 billion revenue, 98,000-employee organization,
which hopes to accelerate the design of products that appeal to
a new generation of users more accustomed to smartphones and
tablets than laptops or desktop PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts see Thursday's moves, which include
centralizing business-oriented functions such as marketing and
research expenses under separate units, as helping shore up
Ballmer's control over the sprawling corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing major responsibilities for profit and revenue
accounting allows the main divisions to focus on innovative
products and eliminates the fiefdoms - Windows, Office for
instance - that may have encouraged infighting in recent years,
analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't do a major reorganization like this unless you
have some serious problems," BGC analyst Colin Gillis said. "It
consolidates power around the CEO."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development of Windows will now be folded into one group
headed by Terry Myerson. He had previously focused only on
Windows Phone and now has responsibility for tailoring the
flagship operating software for devices ranging from the
traditional PC to tablets and gaming consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Larson-Green, previously co-chief of the main Windows
division, will oversee a new division charged with all hardware
devices, from the Surface tablet to the Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the most senior managers have a new role after
the reorganization, which did not include any major new hires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves realign the company that helped revolutionize the
personal computing industry in the 1980s into what Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer calls a "devices and services"
corporation - a nod to Apple Inc, which has surpassed
it in profit and market value in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also an implicit rejection of "software", the business
which Microsoft helped pioneer and drove the worldwide adoption
of personal computing, but in which it faces stiff competition
from new rivals that have popularized Internet-based services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives told reporters and analysts on a conference call
they did not plan layoffs for now. But a certain amount of
employee disruption is to be expected as the company modifies
its device marketing and development strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can be a major distraction. The details have to be
ironed out, there will be a lot of water-cooler talk and that's
happening as the company has some critical products coming out,
like a unified phone, Xbox," Gillis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares have gained almost 30 percent this year,
helped by a rally that began in late April when the company
released strong revenue and earnings during what was one of the
worst quarters for PC sales on record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They closed Thursday up 2.8 percent at $35.685.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's stock hit a high of more than $59 at the height
of the first dotcom boom, but have mostly been in a range of
$23-$32 for the last decade. While rivals Apple and Google Inc
 have shot ahead of it in market value, Microsoft is
nearly unique in its staying power near the top of the tech
pyramid, and its Windows and Office businesses keep it a
profitable giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BE LIKE APPLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who took over as CEO from co-founder Bill Gates in
2000, said he wants the company to be more like Apple, which has
roared past Microsoft in sales and stock market value in the
past few years by smoothly melding its devices with online
services such as iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is trying to bring products to the market faster and make
the company more efficient, and wants to entice people to use
Microsoft products on a variety of devices besides personal
computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has been struggling to compete in a world
of mobile devices and Web-based services dominated by Apple and
Google, launched the Surface tablet in 2012. But the device has
failed to make meaningful headway against the iPad or Android
devices made by Samsung Electronics and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its Windows 8 release last year also alienated PC users
accustomed to a long-established interface, prompting Microsoft
to bring back, among other things, the familiar "Start" button
in a hasty update. All operating systems now come under Terry
Myerson, who had previously headed up Windows Phone and the
software giant's efforts to crack the mobile market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are rallying behind a single strategy as one company -
not a collection of divisional strategies," Ballmer said in a
memo to employees published on Microsoft's website on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's last significant reorganization came in July
2008 when Ballmer split Microsoft's 'Platforms &amp; Services
Division' into three separate units - Windows, Online Services
and Server and Tools - in the wake of the failure to buy Yahoo
Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been struggling with sharply declining
personal computer sales that cut into its software revenue as
consumers and some businesses increasingly favor smartphones and
tablets. Worldwide PC shipments declined 11.4 percent in the
second quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year
decline, according to industry research firm IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the four new engineering groups include Myerson's
operating systems unit, and applications and services
engineering to be led by Qi Lu, who had previously overseen the
perennially money-losing online services arm. He also will be
responsible for Office software, one of Microsoft's biggest cash
cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurt DelBene, the former president of Microsoft Office, will
retire. His departure follows that of gaming chief Don Mattrick,
now CEO of Zynga, and Steven Sinofsky, formerly head of the
Windows unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella, the company's leading authority on Internet
infrastructure, takes over all Web-based cloud services such as 
Azure, which competes with Amazon.com Inc's AWS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether the changes will mean that Microsoft
will offer less financial data about certain products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a major concern if they use this opportunity to reduce
the transparency, so we're hoping that's not the case," Cross
Research analyst Richard Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a strategic perspective, it seems that they're just
streamlining the operating groups to bring all ... into one
group, all the applications all the cloud focus, all the
devices," he added. "There's a certain logic to that that makes
sense to us."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's sweeping re-organization on Thursday creates a company that, more than ever, bears the stamp of Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The face of Microsoft since he took the reins from co-founder Bill Gates in 2000, Ballmer stressed the importance of improving internal collaboration and eliminating redundancies when he released the company's new organizational blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts say the changes also mean less leeway for Microsoft's individual businesses to set and pursue their own agendas, as the company imposes a more streamlined, top-down approach to its strategy and operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the changes promised, the move reinforces Ballmer's grip on the company's direction and further muddies the succession picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still no heir apparent or any succession strategy that has become apparent," said David Smith, an analyst with industry research firm Gartner.

The key question will be can Ballmer deliver this in new model and can it be successful," said Channing Smith, co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund, which does not own Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With his track record, it will be question mark for investors going forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the world's No.1 software company, whose $74 billion in annual revenue is powered largely by its dominant role in the PC business via its flagship Windows and Office software. But the company has been caught flat-footed by new trends such as mobile computing, where software by Google Inc and Apple Inc lead the pack, as well as by Web-based "cloud" services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors credit Ballmer for expanding the Windows and Office franchises and growing Microsoft into one of the world's largest technology corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they also fault him for missing out on technology trends.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The reorganization Microsoft Corp announced on Thursday represents the most sweeping re-structuring of the world's largest software company since 2008, designed to better align Microsoft's operations with Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's stated goal of becoming a "devices and services" company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's stronghold providing software for PCs is under threat as consumers and corporations increasingly turn to mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, and to Web-based software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new management structure will create four main product groups, instead of the five business units that have comprised Microsoft's business in recent years. The changes will also shuffle Microsoft's leadership ranks, providing new roles and responsibilities for many of the top brass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a rundown of the Microsoft's new main business units and the executives running then:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will run the Cloud and Enterprise Engineering Group. The company's leading authority on Internet infrastructure and former chief of the Server and Tools unit takes over all Web-based cloud services such as Azure, which competes with Amazon.com Inc's AWS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tech heavy-hitter originally from India, he joined Microsoft in 1992. Previously, he worked for Sun Microsystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Larson-Green&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Windows co-chief will head up Devices and Studio Engineering, incorporating all hardware development as well as games, music, video and other entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, she ran the technical side of the Windows unit, which includes the Surface tablet. She joined Microsoft in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terry Myerson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As leader of the Operating Systems Engineering Group, he sits atop all development of hardware and related software of the flagship operating software for a plethora of devices, from the Surface to the Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myerson previously oversaw the Windows Phone unit, responsible for the company's revamped efforts to take on Apple and Google in the booming smartphone market -- with little success. He joined Microsoft in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi Lu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will run Applications and Services Engineering. Formerly the overseer of perennially money-losing online services like Bing and the MSN Web portal, he now takes Office software, one of Microsoft's biggest cash cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lu came to Microsoft after working for Yahoo for 10 years, leading its Internet search and advertising technology efforts. He holds 20 U.S. patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Regulator denies bid for priority pipeline access&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Says Chevron refinery able to operate under current
conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Asks Kinder Morgan to revise allocation procedures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta, July 11 (Reuters) - Canada's National
Energy Board has turned down Chevron Corp's bid to
secure priority access to oil shipped on the Trans Mountain
pipeline for its British Columbia refinery, arguing the facility
could operate using existing supply sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron had sought to secure supply for its 55,000 barrel
per day refinery in Burnaby because it was having difficulty
ensuring it could source enough oil on the chronically
over-booked pipeline, which carries Alberta crude to British
Columbia and Puget Sound, to keep the refinery operating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board, which regulates the Kinder Morgan Energy Partners
LP -owned line, said the refinery had been consistently
able to meet its 40,000 barrel per day minimum run rate despite
the lack of secure space on the 300,000 bpd Trans Mountain line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Board was of the view that it is the responsibility of
Chevron to design a portfolio of supply options that will best
mitigate its supply risk and ensure the long-term viability of
the Burnaby Refinery," the regulator said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron sought priority access for the refinery, which
supplies a third of British Columbia's gasoline, last year,
after Kinder Morgan reduced the amount of space on the line
available to spot shippers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space on the line has been rationed since 2010, with
would-be shippers seeking to ship more crude than the line could
carry. The board said Kinder Morgan must revise the procedures
it uses to allocate space on the line or explain why its current
methods are adequate by the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Chevron said the company will comment after
it has reviewed the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Robert Cyran
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer says the software giant must speed up and focus on what customers want. That at least is the gist of two sprawling memos justifying a sweeping restructuring, unveiled on Thursday. Yet the Microsoft organization now looks more complex. And the company is vague about its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer is right that the nearly $300 billion Microsoft cannot continue on its current trajectory. The PC market is in free fall. Shipments have dropped for five consecutive quarters, with an 11 percent decline in the second quarter according to figures just released by Gartner. That hasn&#8217;t noticeably affected Microsoft yet. It can only be a matter of time, however, until the company&#8217;s two cash cows &#8211; the Windows operating system and business software like Office, which account for about 80 percent of profit &#8211; eventually suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was organized into eight divisions based on products such as Windows, Office and Skype. The company&#8217;s argument that these distinctions are increasingly artificial has merit. Microsoft&#8217;s tablets and smartphones, for example, must combine its software, online services and other offerings into one complete package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Ballmer is right to rethink reporting lines. The company will now have four engineering areas: operating systems, apps, the cloud, and devices. That sounds a sensible way to organize a tech company. But things deteriorate somewhat from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineering is just one of eight new so-called functions at Microsoft, the others including the likes of &#8220;business development and evangelism&#8221; as well as more typical groups like finance and legal. Another group called Dynamics &#8211; Microsoft&#8217;s enterprise planning software business &#8211; will remain separate. Though it may stop silo-like businesses engaging in unnecessary internal competition, the new organization still seems likely to frustrate rather than encourage engineers with smart new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even after nearly 6,000 words across the two missives, it&#8217;s not really clear what Microsoft wants to be. Both memos say, in bold type, that Microsoft should create devices and services that &#8220;empower people around the globe at home, at work, and on the go, for the activities they value the most.&#8221; Ballmer signs off his screed with a &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221; But where to? If Microsoft can&#8217;t clearly define its destination, a confused organizational structure isn&#8217;t going to help it get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUCHAREST (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N) won approval to drill exploration wells for shale gas in three areas in eastern Romania, local news agency Mediafax reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romania's leftist government initially opposed shale gas when it took power in 2012 but has since became a supporter in view of potential economic benefits from any major discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediafax said the decision was taken by the Technical Assessment Committee of the Environment protection agency of the town of Vaslui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that Romania and its neighbors Bulgaria and Hungary could between them have 538 billion cubic meters of gas, which would be enough to cover Romania's consumption for almost 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Radu Marinas)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;

      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

its first major overhaul in five years.&lt;/p&gt;

Chief Executive Steve Ballmer split the company's 'Platforms &amp;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp, which won a ban last year on importing some phones made by a Google Inc subsidiary, filed a motion in a U.S. court on Friday asking the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection to enforce the measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission, which hears a long list of high-tech patent complaints, said in May 2012 that Google's Motorola Mobility infringed a Microsoft patent for generating and synchronizing calendar items. It barred any infringing Motorola Mobility device from being imported into the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All phones with Google's Android software are affected by the ban, Microsoft said. But Google said that it should have applied to only some Motorola Mobility Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That order was to have gone into effect 60 days after it was issued but, according to Microsoft's court filing, it still has not been enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CBP (Customs and Bureau Protection) has repeatedly allowed Motorola to evade that order based on secret presentations that CBP has refused to share with Microsoft," the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google argued that Microsoft tried to broaden the order beyond what the ITC had intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"U.S. Customs appropriately rejected Microsoft's effort to broaden its patent claims to block Americans from using a wide range of legitimate calendar functions, like scheduling meetings, on their mobile phones," said Matt Kallman, a Google spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for U.S. Customs declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filing is the latest salvo in an international smartphone patent war that has embroiled a half dozen companies in lawsuits filed in about a dozen countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute is a sign that deciding which product infringes a patent is harder now that the world has gone high tech, and that Customs may not have the needed expertise to make that determination and perhaps should rely on the ITC, said Deanna Tanner Okun, a former ITC chairman who is a partner at Adduci, Mastriani &amp; Schaumberg, LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Problems have increased.

a patent is harder now that the world has gone high tech, and
that Customs may not have the needed expertise to make that
determination and perhaps should rely on the ITC, said Deanna
Tanner Okun, a former ITC chairman who is a partner at Adduci,
Mastriani &amp; Schaumberg, LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Problems have increased. The system is outdated," she said.
"They're using practices and procedures that are 20 years old."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank, posted a 31 percent increase in second-quarter earnings on Friday after underwriting income jumped and bond trading revenue rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the first of the major U.S. banks to report results for the quarter, managed to book more profit from trading corporate bonds even as debt prices broadly fell. The bank's comments made some investors hopeful that rivals with big trading arms will also post strong second-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) were up more than 1 percent as of late Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan also acknowledged that market conditions have grown difficult, and that it might need to accelerate cost-cutting. Since mid-May, U.S. bond markets have suffered their worst two-month selloff in a decade, as the Federal Reserve has said it is planning to taper its massive bond purchases, known as quantitative easing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bond market weakness puts Chief Executive Jamie Dimon in a tough spot. Mortgage rates are rising, which could slash mortgage lending volume by 30 to 40 percent, said Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake on a call with investors. But U.S. economic growth is still subdued, meaning demand for most other loans is hardly surging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a difficult environment," said Gary Townsend, co-founder of hedge fund Hill-Townsend Capital, which invests in financial stocks. "The bank is not doing as well as it can in a better interest-rate environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's results beat analysts' average forecast. Its shares were down 0.5 percent at $54.88 on Friday afternoon. The stock had jumped 25 percent this year as of Thursday's close, helped by growing confidence that the U.S. economy is on the road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the stock has fluctuated wildly in recent weeks because of concern that higher bond yields would cut in to the value of bank assets and weigh on capital levels, even if in the longer-term higher yields can lift interest income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BY THE NUMBERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, net income rose to $6.50 billion, or $1.60 a share, in the latest quarter, from $4.96 billion, or $1.21, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.44 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four cents of the earnings per share came from dipping into funds the company had previously set aside to cover loan losses. More than half of that reserve release was from a real estate loan portfolio that has benefited from rising home prices, and the rest was from loans on credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher interest rates reduced the value of investment securities at the bank, by one measure offsetting four-fifths of the additional capital it generated during the quarter. JPMorgan improved some of its capital ratios by reducing its risk-weighted assets, according to a presentation for an investor teleconference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from fixed-income and equities trading rose 18 percent. Trading revenue in last year's second quarter was hurt by the European debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking was a second strong suit for JPMorgan. Revenue climbed 17 percent to $3.1 billion, driven by higher fees from underwriting debt and equity issues. Fees from advising companies on mergers and acquisitions fell by 15 percent to $304 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the bank as a whole, revenue receded by 3 percent to $12 billion. The drop reflected a 7 percent slide in noninterest revenue that was hurt by lower mortgage fees and related income. Net interest income fell 1 percent, reflecting lower deposit margins and declining loan balances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSING MARKET TRANSITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's mortgage business is in flux now. U.S. mortgage rates have risen, with the main 30-year rate having risen more than three-quarters of a percentage point over the quarter to 4.58 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That cut in to the bank's pretax income from making mortgage loans, which fell 37 percent to $582 million, including loans the bank had to buy back. The bank did make more loans - they rose 12 percent to $49 billion - but rising rates cut in to the profitability of the loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank could be forced to cut costs in the business, CFO Lake said. Because it is unclear when volumes will drop, and it takes time to cut costs, drops in lending volume could challenge profitability, Lake added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the second-largest U.S. mortgage lender after Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N), with an 11 percent market share as of the first quarter, according to industry newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INCREASING CONFIDENCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the second quarter, JPMorgan put further distance between itself on the so-called London Whale debacle of a year earlier, when bad bets on the credit market ultimately cost the bank more than $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year-earlier period, the unit that held the trades booked losses of $1.76 billion. Those trades have since been switched over to JPMorgan's investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-quarter results are the first the bank has released since Dimon overwhelmingly won a shareholder referendum in May on whether he should hold both the chairman and the chief executive posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's quarterly report, along with one the same day from Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest bank, marks the start of an intense 1-1/2 weeks of results from major financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc (C.N), the third-biggest U.S. bank, is to report on Monday, followed by Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore and Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; writing by Frank McGurty; editing by Dan Wilchins, Ted Kerr, Lisa Von Ahn and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt has turned back several flights carrying hundreds of Syrians after tightening visa rules following the toppling of President Mohamed Mursi, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egypt this week introduced visa requirements for Syrians after local media accused Syrian Islamists of joining deadly clashes between Mursi's supporters and the army who had ousted him. They previously only needed a passport to enter Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have fled a conflict pitting forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad against insurgents, which has killed an estimated 100,000 people and driven 1.7 million abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said Egyptian authorities had refused permission for several flights from Damascus and the Syrian coastal city Latakia - one with 250 Syrians on board - to land. Syrians landing on flights from other countries were deported upon arrival at Cairo airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I appeal to the Egyptian authorities ... admit and protect all Syrians seeking refuge in their country," U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said. The Egyptian embassy in Damascus was not able to issue visas at the moment, the UNHCR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday's clash between Mursi supporters and soldiers in Cairo, in which 53 protesters and four soldiers were killed, has stoked fears among some Egyptians that the trouble is being stirred up by outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are especially wary of those from Syria and Gaza, home to Islamist groups seen as close to Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Alison Williams)&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Downgrades 1 Non-Investment Class of J.P. Morgan 2004-CIBC9
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded one class and affirmed 14 classes of J.P. 
      Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp.'s commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates, series 2004-CIBC9. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrade to the non-investment class is a result of losses incurred 
      and the likelihood of future losses to the already distressed class. The 
      affirmations are due to sufficient credit enhancements and generally 
      stable performance of the underlying collateral pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 3.3% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 8.2%, including $71.3 million (6.5% of 
      the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has 
      designated 12 loans (15.2%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 
      three specially serviced assets (4.2%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the June 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 42% to $639.4 million from $1.1 billion at 
      issuance. Per the servicer reporting, nine loans (8.7% of the pool) are 
      defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes N through 
      NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the Towson Overlook loan 
      (1.7% of the pool), which is secured by a 137,600 square foot (sf) 
      retail center located in Towson, MD. The property struggles with poor 
      performance due to occupancy issues. The property is underperforming its 
      competition in the market with rents at nearly half that of its 
      competitors. The servicer reported occupancy is at 81.1% as of the 
      first-quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is the Poplar Creek 
      Plaza loan (0.8%), which is secured by a 63,860 sf retail center located 
      in Schaumburg, IL, northwest of Chicago. As per the property's May 2013 
      rent roll, the occupancy is at 93%; however, significant lease rollover 
      of 34.1% will occur prior to year-end 2014. In addition, the property's 
      net operating income (NOI) decreased 60.7% from year-end 2011 to 2012 
      due to reduced rental rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the Town Center 
      Colleyville loan (1%), which is secured by a 59,572 sf retail center 
      located in Colleyville, TX, northeast of Dallas. The property has 
      struggled from poor performance over the last several years. The 
      servicer reported occupancy and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) as of 
      year-end 2012 were 74.8% and 0.76 times (x), respectively. The subject 
      property also has 22% of leases expiring prior to loan maturity in May 
      2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classes A-4 through C remain Stable due to increasing 
      credit enhancements and continued paydown. A downgrade to class D is 
      possible if losses are greater than expected.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following classes and revises Recover Estimates 
      (REs) as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11 million class E to 'Csf' from 'CCsf', RE 50%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes, revises Rating Outlook and REs as 
      indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$452.7 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$105.2 million class A1-A at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$0 class P at 'Dsf', RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Classes A-1, A-2 and A-3 have been paid in full. Fitch does not rate 
      class NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X 
      certificates.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co dialed back its
commodity trading risk in the second quarter from the previous three months as
prices of raw materials fell, results from the largest U.S. bank showed on
Friday.
    Value-at-Risk in commodities at JPMorgan stood at $13 million per day in the
quarter, down $2 million from the first quarter and unchanged from a year
earlier. VaR is a measure of the maximum amount of money a  bank is prepared to
lose in a day from trading a particular asset class.
    Commodity prices as indicated by the Thomson Reuters-Jefferies CRB index
 fell 7 percent in the second quarter, sliding each month.
    Like other Wall Street banks, JPMorgan groups its commodities revenue under
the fixed income category and does not break down the sector individually. As a
result, VaR is often one of its key risk-reward indicators for commodities.
    JPMorgan said fixed income revenue fell to $4.1 billion in the second
quarter from nearly $4.8 billion a year earlier.
    Still, JPMorgan reported a 31 percent rise in second-quarter profit to $6.50
billion as trading revenue increased and the bank rebounded from the "London
Whale" derivatives loss of 2012.

&lt;p&gt;* PPI, consumer sentiment data on tap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Futures up: Dow 13 pts, S 1.1 pts, Nasdaq 4.25 pts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were
little changed Friday after stocks closed at fresh highs a day
earlier, in the wake of quarterly results from JPMorgan and
ahead of data on inflation and consumer sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 index and the Dow industrials 
closed at record highs on Thursday, after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank will keep
monetary policy loose for some time to lower the unemployment
rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As far as today is concerned, the market is likely to try
to catch its breath after strong gains posted during the week,"
said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global
Capital in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nonetheless, markets are still poised to close near their
records and I suspect they will maintain most of their gains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, the largest U.S. bank by
assets, dipped 0.5 percent to $54.85 in premarket trading. The
bank reported a 31 percent jump in quarterly profit as trading
revenue rebounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Wells Fargo &amp; Co dipped 0.1 percent to
$41.85 in premarket trading after the fourth-largest U.S. bank
by assets reported its quarterly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The June Producer Price Index is due at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230
GMT). Economists in a Reuters survey forecast a 0.5 percent rise
in PPI, with a 0.1 percent rise excluding volatile food and
energy items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark S index has risen 3.8 percent over the past
six sessions. That's its longest winning streak since early
March, when the index climbed for seven sessions on positive
data, hopes for rosy results and signals from the Fed that it
would continue to backstop the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of
Consumers preliminary July consumer sentiment index is scheduled
for release at 9:55 a.m. (1355 GMT). Economists in a Reuters
survey expect a reading of 85.0 compared with 84.1 in the final
June report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S 500 futures edged up 1.1 points and were slightly
above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking
into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on
the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added
13 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 4.25 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect S 500 companies' second-quarter earnings
to have grown 2.5 percent from a year earlier, with revenue up
1.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S.-listed shares of Infosys jumped 9 percent to
$45.61 in premarket trade after the company reported quarterly
results and maintained its revenue growth forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valero Energy Corp dipped 3.5 percent to $33.35
before the opening bell. The U.S. refining company said it
expects lower second-quarter earnings due to a rise in the price
of some of the crude oil it processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. defense firm General Dynamics is in talks to
deliver battle tanks to Saudi Arabia, beating out German rival
Krauss-Maffei Wegmann for the lucrative deal, a German newspaper
reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European shares headed Friday for their best week since late
April, buoyed by central banks' commitment to stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors in Asian stocks turned cautious, even after a
record close on Wall Street, as markets braced for China's
second-quarter economic growth data on Monday that could show
weakness in the world's second-biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;

      Arrow Electronics Inc. (NYSE:ARW) has been selected as an IBM Global 
      Training Provider for IBM&#8217;s Software Group and Systems and Technology 
      Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arrow has been an IBM distributor since 1989, and its IT training group, 
      Arrow Enterprise Computing Solutions Education, an established education 
      and training services provider that is among one of the most 
      comprehensive and innovative in the IT industry, is one of the largest 
      IBM Training providers. As such, Arrow has been working closely with IBM 
      to successfully test elements of the new model in the United Kingdom, 
      Ireland and the Nordics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the selection process, Arrow demonstrated the required 
      qualifications based on excellence in marketing, selling, IT training 
      capabilities and the ability to cover IBM Training on a global basis. In 
      the next 12 months, Arrow ECS Education will implement its IBM Global 
      Training program in up to 130 countries. It is anticipated that the 
      program will be available in 10 countries to start, and that it will be 
      offered in more than 50 additional countries by the end of 2013 and to 
      the remaining countries by Summer 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a value-added distributor and one of the leading IT training 
      providers, we are excited and honoured that IBM will leverage our IT 
      training expertise and excellence as part of IBM&#8217;s Global Training 
      program,&#8221; said Laurent Sadoun, president of Arrow ECS in Europe, the 
      Middle East and Africa and head of Arrow&#8217;s worldwide services for the

&lt;p&gt;* Bank sets aside less money for bad loans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Mortgage banking income falls 14 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares down marginally in premarket trading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co reported a
31 percent rise in quarterly profit on Friday as trading revenue
rebounded and the biggest U.S. bank by assets set aside less
money to cover bad loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $6.50 billion, or $1.60 per share, in the
second quarter ended June 30 from $4.96 billion, or $1.21 per
share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year-earlier quarter included the vast majority of the
losses of more than $6.2 billion on derivatives positions that
were so large that hedge funds had referred to the trader
handling them as the "London Whale".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provision for credit losses fell 78 percent to $47 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.44 per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not
immediately clear if the figures were comparable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank, whose shares were down marginally in premarket
trading, said revenue from fixed income and equities rose 18
percent in the quarter compared with a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corporate and private equity division, which a year ago
lost $1.78 billion after-tax because of the London Whale
debacle, lost $522 million in the latest quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortgage banking income, which comes from making home loans
and servicing existing mortgages, fell 14 percent to $1.1
billion as a refinancing wave subsided and interest rates rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the second largest U.S. mortgage lender after
Wells Fargo &amp; Co with an 11 percent market share. Wells
Fargo reports results later on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares, which were trading at $54.85 before the
bell, had risen 25 percent this year up to Thursday's close,
helped by growing confidence that the U.S. economy is on the
road to a solid recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the stock has been volatile in recent weeks because
of concern that higher interest rates will erode the value of
bank assets before they generate new revenue from lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are the first the bank has released since
Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon overwhelmingly won a
shareholder referendum in May on whether he should hold both
posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co dialed back its
commodity trading risk slightly in the second quarter from the previous three
months, as prices of raw materials fell, results from the largest U.S. bank
showed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-Risk (VaR) in commodities at JPMorgan stood at $13 million in the
second quarter, down $2 million from the first quarter and unchanged from the
second quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commodity prices as indicated by the Thomson Reuters-Jefferies CRB index
 fell 7 percent in the second quarter, tumbling each month from April
to June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, typical of Wall Street banks, groups its commodities revenue under
the fixed income category and does not break down the sector individually, often
leaving VaR as one of its key risk-reward indicators for commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second quarter, JPMorgan said fixed income revenue fell to $4.1
billion from the year earlier figure of nearly $4.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it reported a 31 percent rise in second-quarter profit, as trading
revenues rose and the biggest U.S. bank by assets rebounded from the "London
Whale" derivatives loss of 2012. Net income rose to $6.50 billion from $4.96
billion a year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* PPI, consumer sentiment data on tap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Futures: Dow up 2 pts, S flat, Nasdaq up 3.25 pts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were
little changed Friday after stocks closed at fresh highs a day
earlier, in the wake of quarterly results from JPMorgan and
ahead of data on inflation and consumer sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The S 500 index and the Dow industrials 
closed at record highs on Thursday, after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank will keep a
loose monetary policy for some time to lower the unemployment
rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, the largest U.S. bank by
assets, dipped 0.5 percent to $54.85 in premarket trade. The
bank reported a 31 percent jump in quarterly profit as trading
revenue rebounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Wells Fargo &amp; Co is also due to report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The June Producer Price Index is due at 8:30 a.m. EDT
(1230 GMT). Economists in a Reuters survey forecast a 0.5
percent rise in PPI, with a 0.1 percent rise excluding volatile
food and energy items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The benchmark S index has risen 3.8 percent over the
past six sessions. That's its longest winning streak since early
March, when the index climbed for seven sessions on positive
data, hopes for rosy results and signals from the Fed that it
would continue to backstop the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of
Consumers preliminary July consumer sentiment index is scheduled
for release at 9:55 a.m. (1355 GMT). Economists in a Reuters
survey expect a reading of 85.0 compared with 84.1 in the final
June report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S 500 futures were flat and were roughly even
with fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 2
points, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 3.25 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Analysts expect S 500 companies' second-quarter earnings
to have grown 2.5 percent from a year earlier, with revenue up
1.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* U.S. defense firm General Dynamics is in talks to
deliver battle tanks to Saudi Arabia, beating out German rival
Krauss-Maffei Wegmann for the lucrative deal, a German newspaper
reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* European shares gained ground Friday, supported by the
Federal Reserve's commitment to stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Investors in Asian stocks turned cautious even after a
record close on Wall Street as markets braced for China's
second-quarter economic growth data on Monday that could offer
telling evidence of weakness in the world's second-biggest
economy.&lt;/p&gt;

      NEW YORK, July 12, 2013 -- JPMorgan&#160;Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) today 
      reported net income of $6.5&#160;billion for the second quarter of 2013, 
      compared with net income of $5.0 billion in the second quarter of 2012. 
      Earnings per share were $1.60, compared with $1.21 in the second quarter 
      of 2012. Revenue1 for the quarter was $26.0 billion, compared 
      with $22.9 billion in the prior year. The Firm's return on tangible 
      common equity1 for the second quarter of 2013 was 17%, 
      compared with 15% in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the 
      financial results: &#8220;Our earnings reflected strong performance across our 
      businesses. We maintained our #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking 
      fees. Consumer deposits were up 10% compared with the prior year and 
      Credit Card sales volumes were a record $105.2 billion, up 10%. And 
      notably, Asset Management had $25 billion of net long-term client flows, 
      the seventeenth consecutive quarter of positive net long-term client 
      flows. Net charge-offs remain near historical lows in our Credit Card 
      business, have dropped to less than half of what they were a year ago 
      for our Real Estate Portfolios and remained very low in our wholesale 
      portfolios. In light of these trends, we reduced the allowance for loan 
      losses in Consumer  Community Banking in the second quarter by a total 
      of $1.5 billion. Loan growth across the industry continued to be soft, 
      reflecting a cautious stance by consumers, many small businesses and 
      corporations. However, we continue to see broad-based signs that the 
      U.S. economy is improving and we are hopeful that, as jobs are added and 
      confidence builds, the U.S. economy will strengthen over time.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon continued: &#8220;This quarter, we exceeded the proposed Basel III 
      Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirement &#8211; as of the end of the second 
      quarter, our estimated ratio was 118% &#8211; and we are committed to 
      achieving a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio1 of 9.5% by the end 
      of this year. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio1, 
      reflecting the final rules approved by the Federal Reserve on July 2, 
      2013, was approximately 9.3%
			at the end of the second 
      quarter, including the reduction of the value of our investment 
      securities that are available for sale because of higher long-term 
      interest rates.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon added: &#8220;While we have put extensive focus on our control agenda, 
      we have continued to serve our clients and communities around the world. 
      During the first six months of the year we raised capital and provided 
      credit2 totaling $1.0 trillion for our clients, from 
      individuals to large multinational corporations. Regarding our control 
      agenda, we have taken some of our best people, given them enormous 
      resources and tasked them with ensuring that our systems, practices, 
      controls and technology meet the highest standards. We are confident 
      that these investments will pay off and we will be a better company for 
      it.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon concluded: &#8220;I am proud of this Company and what our employees do 
      every day to serve our clients, customers and communities in over a 
      hundred countries.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

						Discussion of Results:Net income was $3.1 
            billion, a decrease of $193 million, or 6% compared with the prior 
            year, due to lower net revenue and higher noninterest expense,

		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $12.0 billion, a decrease of $435 million, or 3%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.1 billion, down 
      $67 million, or 1%, driven by lower deposit margins and lower loan 
      balances due to portfolio runoff, largely offset by higher deposit 
      balances. Noninterest revenue was $4.9&#160;billion, a decrease of 
      $368&#160;million, or 7%, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income, 
      partially offset by higher merchant servicing revenue, auto lease income 
      and net interchange income.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $19&#160;million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $179&#160;million in the prior year and 
      $549&#160;million in the prior quarter.&#160;The current-quarter provision 
      reflected a $1.5 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and 
      total net charge-offs of $1.5 billion. The prior-quarter provision 
      reflected a $1.2&#160;billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and 
      total net charge-offs of $1.7 billion. The prior-year provision 
      reflected a $2.1&#160;billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and 
      total net charge-offs of $2.3 billion.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $6.9&#160;billion, an increase of $27&#160;million from 
      the prior year, driven by continued investments in the business, offset 
      by lower mortgage servicing expense and lower remediation expense, 
      inclusive of a current-quarter charge, related to an exited non-core

		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Production pretax income was $582&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $349 million from the prior year, reflecting lower margins 
      and higher expense, partially offset by higher volumes and lower 
      repurchase losses. Mortgage production-related revenue, excluding 
      repurchase losses, was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $275&#160;million, or 18%, 
      from the prior year, reflecting lower revenue margins. Production expense2 
      was $720 million, an increase of $100&#160;million from the prior year, 
      driven by higher headcount-related expense as the business built 
      origination capacity. Repurchase losses for the current quarter 
      reflected a benefit of $16 million, compared with losses of $10 million 
      in the prior year and $81 million in the prior quarter. The current 
      quarter reflected a $185 million reduction in the repurchase liability 
      and lower realized repurchase losses compared with the prior year and 
      prior quarter.

      value, was $770 million, a decrease of $15&#160;million, or 2%, from the 
      prior year. MSR risk management income was $78 million, compared with 
      $233 million in the prior year. Servicing expense was $715&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $238 million from the prior year, reflecting lower servicing 
      headcount and lower costs associated with the Independent Foreclosure 
      Review.

			Card, Merchant Services  Auto net income was $1.2 billion, 
      an increase of $219 million, or 21%, compared with the prior year, 
      driven by lower provision for credit losses, higher net revenue and 
      lower noninterest expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $4.7 billion, up $145 million, or 3%, compared with the 
      prior year. Net interest income was $3.3&#160;billion, up $63 million 
      compared with the prior year. The impact of lower revenue reversals 
      associated with lower net charge-offs in Credit Card was largely offset 
      by lower average credit card loan balances and spread compression in 
      Auto. Noninterest revenue was $1.3&#160;billion, up $82 million compared with 
      the prior year, primarily driven by higher merchant servicing revenue, 
      auto lease income and net interchange income.

      The provision for credit losses was $564 million, compared with 
      $734&#160;million in the prior year and $686&#160;million in the prior quarter. 
      The current-quarter provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a 
      $550&#160;million reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to lower 
      estimated losses reflecting improved delinquency trends. The prior-year 
      provision included a $751 million reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses. The Credit Card net charge-off rate1 was 3.31%, down 
      from 4.32% in the prior year and 3.55% in the prior quarter; the 30+ day 
      delinquency rate1 was 1.69%, down from 2.13% in the prior 
      year and 1.94% in the prior quarter. The Auto net charge-off rate was 
      0.18%, up from 0.17% in the prior year and down from 0.32% in the prior 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $108 million, or 5%, 
      from the prior year, primarily driven by lower remediation expense, 
      inclusive of a current-quarter charge, related to an exited non-core 
      product.

						Discussion of Results:Net income was 
            $2.8&#160;billion, up 19% compared with the prior year. These results 
            primarily reflected higher net revenue, partially offset by higher 
            noninterest expense. Net revenue was $9.9&#160;billion, compared with 
            $9.0&#160;billion in the prior year. Net revenue included a $355 
            million gain from debit valuation adjustments (&#8220;DVA&#8221;) on 
            structured notes and derivative liabilities resulting from the 
            widening of the Firm's credit spreads; the prior year included a 
            gain from DVA of $755 million. Excluding the impact of DVA, net 
            income was $2.6 billion1, up 37% from the prior year, 
            and net revenue was $9.5 billion1, up 16% from the

      Banking revenue was $3.1 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the

      by higher debt underwriting fees of $956 million (up 50%) and equity 
      underwriting fees of $457 million (up 83%), partially offset by lower 
      advisory fees of $304&#160;million (down 15%). Treasury Services revenue was 
      $1.1 billion, down 2% compared with the prior year, driven by lower 
      trade finance spreads. Lending revenue was $373&#160;million, primarily 
      reflecting net interest income on retained loans and fees on 
      lending-related commitments, compared with $370 million in the prior 
      year.

      Markets  Investor Services revenue was $6.7 billion, up 7% from the 
      prior year. Fixed Income and Equity Markets combined revenue was 
      $5.4&#160;billion, up 18% from the prior year, reflecting solid client 
      revenue, as well as improved performance in credit-related and equities 
      products. Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 1% from the 
      prior year. Credit Adjustments  Other revenue was $274&#160;million, 
      compared with $683 million in the prior year; both periods were 
      predominantly driven by the impact of DVA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $29 million in the prior year. The 
      ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 
      1.21%, compared with 1.31% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of 
      the consolidation of Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade 
      finance loans, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end 
      loans retained1 was 2.35%, compared with 2.75% in the prior 
      year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $5.7 billion, up 8% from the prior year, 
      primarily driven by higher compensation expense on increased revenue.

      increase of $48&#160;million, or 4%, driven by higher loan and liability 
      balances, partially offset by lower purchase discounts recognized on 
      loan repayments and spread compression on liability products. 
      Noninterest revenue was $551&#160;million, a decrease of $11 million, or 2% 
      compared with the prior year, driven by lower community development 
      investment-related revenue, partially offset by increased 
      deposit-related fees, credit card revenue, and investment banking fees.

      losses to period-end loans retained was 2.06%, down from 2.20% in the 
      prior year and up from 2.05% in the prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans were

      by $156 million, or 23%, from the prior quarter, mainly due to 
      repayments.

      Noninterest expense was $652&#160;million, up 10% compared with the prior

      $648 million, compared with a loss of $3.4 billion in the prior year. 
      The prior-year loss reflected $4.4 billion of principal transactions 
      losses from the synthetic credit portfolio that had been held by CIO, 
      partially offset by securities gains of $1.0 billion. Net revenue in the 
      current quarter included net securities gains of $123 million from sales 
      of available-for-sale investment securities and a modest loss related to 
      the redemption of trust preferred securities. Current-quarter net 
      interest income was a loss of $558 million due to low interest rates and 
      limited reinvestment opportunities.

          Presented on a managed basis. See notes on page 12 for further 
          explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis 
          totaled $25,211 million, $25,122 million, and $22,180 million for 
          the second quarter of 2013, first quarter of 2013, and second 
          quarter of 2012, respectively.

						Discussion of Results:Net income was $6.5 
            billion, up $1.5 billion, or 31%, from the prior year. The 
            increase was driven by higher net revenue and lower provision for 
            credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
          &lt;/p&gt;
				
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $26.0 billion, up $3.1 billion, or 13%, compared with 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, up $3.5 billion, 
      compared with the prior year. The current-quarter revenue included a 
      $355&#160;million gain from DVA on certain structured notes and derivative 
      liabilities resulting from the widening of the Firm's credit spreads; 
      the prior year included a gain from DVA of $755 million. Net interest 
      income was $10.9 billion, down $472 million, or 4%, compared with the 
      prior year, reflecting the impact of low interest rates on investment 
      securities yield and on reinvestment opportunities, lower loan yields 
      and portfolio run-off, partially offset by lower long-term debt costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $47 million, down $167 million from 
      the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was a 
      benefit of $29 million, compared with an expense of $171&#160;million in the 
      prior year. The consumer provision reflected a $1.5 billion release of 
      allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses reflecting 
      continued home price improvement, favorable delinquency trends and lower 
      estimated losses in mortgage and credit card portfolios. The prior year 
      consumer provision reflected a $2.1&#160;billion reduction in the related 
      allowance for loan losses predominantly related to the mortgage and 
      credit card portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.5&#160;billion, 
      compared with $2.3 billion in the prior year, resulting in net 
      charge-off rates of 1.66% and 2.51%, respectively. The decrease in 
      consumer net charge-offs was primarily due to improved delinquency 
      trends. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $76 million, 
      compared with $43 million in the prior year. Wholesale net recoveries 
      were $67 million, compared with net charge-offs of $9 million in the 
      prior year, resulting in net recovery rate of 0.09% and a net charge-off 
      rate of 0.01%, respectively. The Firm's allowance for loan losses to 
      period-end loans retained1 was 2.06%, compared 2.74% in the 
      prior year. The Firm's nonperforming assets totaled $10.9 billion at 
      June 30, 2013, down from the prior-quarter level of $11.6&#160;billion and 
      down compared with the prior-year level of $11.4&#160;billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $15.9 billion, up $900 million, or 6%, compared 
      with the prior year, driven by higher compensation expense on higher 
      revenue and higher litigation reserves, partially offset by lower 
      mortgage servicing expense. The current-quarter noninterest expense 
      included $678 million of expense for additional litigation reserves, 
      compared with $323 million of expense for additional litigation reserves 
      in the prior year.

          In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, 
          management reviews the Firm's results and the results of the lines 
          of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis, which is a non-GAAP financial 
          measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the 
          reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to 
          present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business 
          segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. Accordingly, 
          revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt 
          securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable 
          to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial 
          measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue 
          arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding 
          income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within 
          income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income 
          as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.

          The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans 
          excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans 
          held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans; and the 
          allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real 
          Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI 
          loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio 
          totaled $5.7 billion at June 30, 2013, March 31, 2013, and June 30, 
          2012. In Corporate  Investment Bank, the ratio of the allowance for 
          loan losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the 
          impact of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered 
          multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to 
          provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB's allowance coverage.

          Tangible common equity (&#8220;TCE&#8221;) represents common stockholders' 
          equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less 
          goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net 
          of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common 
          equity measures the Firm's earnings as a percentage of average TCE. 
          In management's view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as 
          well as to analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm's use of 
          equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers.

            The Tier 1 common ratio under both Basel I and Basel III are both 
            non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by 
            management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess the 
            Firm's capital position and to compare the Firm's capital to that 
            of other financial services companies. The Basel I Tier 1 common 
            ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted 
            assets. Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less 
            elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such 
            as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in 
            subsidiaries, and trust preferred securities. In July 2013, the 
            U.S. Federal Reserve approved the final rule for implementing 
            Basel III in the United States. For further information on Basel I

&lt;p&gt;July 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co reported a
31 percent rise in quarterly profit as trading revenue rebounded
and the biggest U.S. bank by assets avoided another "London
Whale" derivatives loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $6.50 billion, or $1.60 per share, in the
second quarter from $4.96 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year-earlier quarter included the vast majority of the
losses of more than $6.2 billion on derivatives positions that
were so large that hedge funds referred to the trader handling
them as the London Whale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Alexei Oreskovic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 11 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's 
sweeping re-organization on Thursday creates a company that,
more than ever, bears the stamp of Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The face of Microsoft since he took the reins from
co-founder Bill Gates in 2000, Ballmer stressed the importance
of improving internal collaboration and eliminating redundancies
when he released the company's new organizational blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts say the changes also mean less leeway for
Microsoft's individual businesses to set and pursue their own
agendas, as the company imposes a more streamlined, top-down
approach to its strategy and operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the changes promised, the move reinforces Ballmer's
grip on the company's direction and further muddies the
succession picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still no heir apparent or any succession strategy
that has become apparent," said David Smith, an analyst with
industry research firm Gartner.  "It sounds like he wants to run
it in a more centralized style."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Ballmer, 57, who presided over a decade of share price
stagnation and was deemed slow to respond to mobile computing,
remains more entrenched may worry investors and spur concern
that the reorganization will truly effect change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In theory, it's a great idea. The key question will be can
Ballmer deliver this in new model and can it be successful,"
said Channing Smith, co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth
Fund, which does not own Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With his track record, it will be question mark for
investors going forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the world's No.1 software company, whose $74
billion in annual revenue is powered largely by its dominant
role in the PC business via its flagship Windows and Office
software. But the company has been caught flat-footed by new
trends such as mobile computing, where software by Google Inc
 and Apple Inc lead the pack, as well as by
Web-based "cloud" services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors credit Ballmer for expanding the Windows and
Office franchises and growing Microsoft into one of the world's
largest technology corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they also fault him for missing out on technology
trends. And despite the success of the Xbox - the leader in a
declining videogames industry - the company has cranked out a
string of failed devices from the Zune media player to the Kin
phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been a rocky road. There's definitely been a lot of
optimism around certain products, which have not met
expectations," said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEP ASIDE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenges have led to sporadic calls for Ballmer to
step down, including from activist hedge fund investor Dan Loeb
two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That possibility became more remote with the reorganization
however, which BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said shored up
Ballmer's control over the sprawling organization of 98,000
employees that he runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're investing on the thesis that the CEO is going to
change soon, you need to reconsider your thesis," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Helms, an analyst with the consulting firm Directions,
said, "What this reorganization has done is taken away a lot of
functions in principle from people who were reporting directly
to Steve Ballmer," said .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes the post-Ballmer succession plan, long a concern
among investors, even less clear. Under the previous structure
comprised of mini-business units "there was a job short of the
CEO's chair that was very much like a CEO," said Helm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So if you wanted to develop your career, the skills and the
credibility to be Microsoft's next CEO there was a place to
land. Now there really isn't."&lt;/p&gt;

      NEW YORK, July 12, 2013 -- JPMorgan&#160;Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) today 
      reported net income of $6.5&#160;billion for the second quarter of 2013, 
      compared with net income of $5.0 billion in the second quarter of 2012. 
      Earnings per share were $1.60, compared with $1.21 in the second quarter 
      of 2012. Revenue1 for the quarter was $26.0 billion, compared 
      with $22.9 billion in the prior year. The Firm's return on tangible 
      common equity1 for the second quarter of 2013 was 17%, 
      compared with 15% in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the 
      financial results: &#8220;Our earnings reflected strong performance across our 
      businesses. We maintained our #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking 
      fees. Consumer deposits were up 10% compared with the prior year and 
      Credit Card sales volumes were a record $105.2 billion, up 10%. And 
      notably, Asset Management had $25 billion of net long-term client flows, 
      the seventeenth consecutive quarter of positive net long-term client 
      flows. Net charge-offs remain near historical lows in our Credit Card 
      business, have dropped to less than half of what they were a year ago 
      for our Real Estate Portfolios and remained very low in our wholesale 
      portfolios. In light of these trends, we reduced the allowance for loan 
      losses in Consumer  Community Banking in the second quarter by a total 
      of $1.5 billion. Loan growth across the industry continued to be soft, 
      reflecting a cautious stance by consumers, many small businesses and 
      corporations. However, we continue to see broad-based signs that the 
      U.S. economy is improving and we are hopeful that, as jobs are added and 
      confidence builds, the U.S. economy will strengthen over time.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon continued: &#8220;This quarter, we exceeded the proposed Basel III 
      Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirement &#8211; as of the end of the second 
      quarter, our estimated ratio was 118% &#8211; and we are committed to 
      achieving a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio1 of 9.5% by the end 
      of this year. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio1,

      we have continued to serve our clients and communities around the world. 
      During the first six months of the year we raised capital and provided 
      credit2 totaling $1.0 trillion for our clients, from 
      individuals to large multinational corporations. Regarding our control 
      agenda, we have taken some of our best people, given them enormous 
      resources and tasked them with ensuring that our systems, practices, 
      controls and technology meet the highest standards. We are confident 
      that these investments will pay off and we will be a better company for

						Discussion of Results:Net income was $3.1 
            billion, a decrease of $193 million, or 6% compared with the prior 
            year, due to lower net revenue and higher noninterest expense,

		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $12.0 billion, a decrease of $435 million, or 3%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.1 billion, down 
      $67 million, or 1%, driven by lower deposit margins and lower loan 
      balances due to portfolio runoff, largely offset by higher deposit 
      balances. Noninterest revenue was $4.9&#160;billion, a decrease of 
      $368&#160;million, or 7%, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income, 
      partially offset by higher merchant servicing revenue, auto lease income 
      and net interchange income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $19&#160;million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $179&#160;million in the prior year and 
      $549&#160;million in the prior quarter.&#160;The current-quarter provision 
      reflected a $1.5 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and 
      total net charge-offs of $1.5 billion. The prior-quarter provision 
      reflected a $1.2&#160;billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and 
      total net charge-offs of $1.7 billion. The prior-year provision 
      reflected a $2.1&#160;billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and 
      total net charge-offs of $2.3 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $6.9&#160;billion, an increase of $27&#160;million from 
      the prior year, driven by continued investments in the business, offset 
      by lower mortgage servicing expense and lower remediation expense, 
      inclusive of a current-quarter charge, related to an exited non-core

		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Production pretax income was $582&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $349 million from the prior year, reflecting lower margins 
      and higher expense, partially offset by higher volumes and lower 
      repurchase losses. Mortgage production-related revenue, excluding 
      repurchase losses, was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $275&#160;million, or 18%, 
      from the prior year, reflecting lower revenue margins. Production expense2 
      was $720 million, an increase of $100&#160;million from the prior year, 
      driven by higher headcount-related expense as the business built 
      origination capacity. Repurchase losses for the current quarter 
      reflected a benefit of $16 million, compared with losses of $10 million 
      in the prior year and $81 million in the prior quarter. The current 
      quarter reflected a $185 million reduction in the repurchase liability

      prior quarter.

      prior year. MSR risk management income was $78 million, compared with 
      $233 million in the prior year. Servicing expense was $715&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $238 million from the prior year, reflecting lower servicing

      associated with lower net charge-offs in Credit Card was largely offset 
      by lower average credit card loan balances and spread compression in 
      Auto. Noninterest revenue was $1.3&#160;billion, up $82 million compared with

						Discussion of Results:Net income was 
            $2.8&#160;billion, up 19% compared with the prior year. These results 
            primarily reflected higher net revenue, partially offset by higher 
            noninterest expense. Net revenue was $9.9&#160;billion, compared with 
            $9.0&#160;billion in the prior year. Net revenue included a $355 
            million gain from debit valuation adjustments (&#8220;DVA&#8221;) on 
            structured notes and derivative liabilities resulting from the 
            widening of the Firm's credit spreads; the prior year included a 
            gain from DVA of $755 million. Excluding the impact of DVA, net

            and net revenue was $9.5 billion1, up 16% from the

      Banking revenue was $3.1 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the

      underwriting fees of $457 million (up 83%), partially offset by lower 
      advisory fees of $304&#160;million (down 15%). Treasury Services revenue was 
      $1.1 billion, down 2% compared with the prior year, driven by lower 
      trade finance spreads. Lending revenue was $373&#160;million, primarily 
      reflecting net interest income on retained loans and fees on 
      lending-related commitments, compared with $370 million in the prior 
      year.

      Markets  Investor Services revenue was $6.7 billion, up 7% from the 
      prior year. Fixed Income and Equity Markets combined revenue was 
      $5.4&#160;billion, up 18% from the prior year, reflecting solid client 
      revenue, as well as improved performance in credit-related and equities 
      products. Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 1% from the 
      prior year. Credit Adjustments  Other revenue was $274&#160;million, 
      compared with $683 million in the prior year; both periods were 
      predominantly driven by the impact of DVA.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $29 million in the prior year. The 
      ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 
      1.21%, compared with 1.31% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of 
      the consolidation of Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade 
      finance loans, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end 
      loans retained1 was 2.35%, compared with 2.75% in the prior 
      year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $5.7 billion, up 8% from the prior year, 
      primarily driven by higher compensation expense on increased revenue.

      Net revenue was $1.7&#160;billion, an increase of $37 million, or 2%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $1.2&#160;billion, an 
      increase of $48&#160;million, or 4%, driven by higher loan and liability 
      balances, partially offset by lower purchase discounts recognized on 
      loan repayments and spread compression on liability products. 
      Noninterest revenue was $551&#160;million, a decrease of $11 million, or 2% 
      compared with the prior year, driven by lower community development 
      investment-related revenue, partially offset by increased 
      deposit-related fees, credit card revenue, and investment banking fees.

      Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $777 million, an increase of $37

      The provision for credit losses was $44 million, compared with a benefit

      net charge-off rate), compared with net recoveries of $9&#160;million (0.03% 
      net recovery rate) in the prior year and net recoveries of $7&#160;million 
      (0.02% net recovery rate) in the prior quarter. The allowance for loan 
      losses to period-end loans retained was 2.06%, down from 2.20% in the 
      prior year and up from 2.05% in the prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans were 
      $513&#160;million, down $404&#160;million, or 44%, from the prior year, and down 
      by $156 million, or 23%, from the prior quarter, mainly due to 
      repayments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $652&#160;million, up 10% compared with the prior

      of available-for-sale investment securities and a modest loss related to 
      the redemption of trust preferred securities. Current-quarter net

          Presented on a managed basis. See notes on page 12 for further 
          explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis 
          totaled $25,211 million, $25,122 million, and $22,180 million for 
          the second quarter of 2013, first quarter of 2013, and second 
          quarter of 2012, respectively.

						Discussion of Results:Net income was $6.5 
            billion, up $1.5 billion, or 31%, from the prior year. The 
            increase was driven by higher net revenue and lower provision for 
            credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
          &lt;/p&gt;
				
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $26.0 billion, up $3.1 billion, or 13%, compared with 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, up $3.5 billion, 
      compared with the prior year. The current-quarter revenue included a 
      $355&#160;million gain from DVA on certain structured notes and derivative 
      liabilities resulting from the widening of the Firm's credit spreads; 
      the prior year included a gain from DVA of $755 million. Net interest 
      income was $10.9 billion, down $472 million, or 4%, compared with the 
      prior year, reflecting the impact of low interest rates on investment 
      securities yield and on reinvestment opportunities, lower loan yields 
      and portfolio run-off, partially offset by lower long-term debt costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $47 million, down $167 million from 
      the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was a 
      benefit of $29 million, compared with an expense of $171&#160;million in the 
      prior year. The consumer provision reflected a $1.5 billion release of 
      allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses reflecting 
      continued home price improvement, favorable delinquency trends and lower 
      estimated losses in mortgage and credit card portfolios. The prior year 
      consumer provision reflected a $2.1&#160;billion reduction in the related 
      allowance for loan losses predominantly related to the mortgage and 
      credit card portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.5&#160;billion, 
      compared with $2.3 billion in the prior year, resulting in net 
      charge-off rates of 1.66% and 2.51%, respectively. The decrease in 
      consumer net charge-offs was primarily due to improved delinquency 
      trends. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $76 million, 
      compared with $43 million in the prior year. Wholesale net recoveries 
      were $67 million, compared with net charge-offs of $9 million in the 
      prior year, resulting in net recovery rate of 0.09% and a net charge-off 
      rate of 0.01%, respectively. The Firm's allowance for loan losses to 
      period-end loans retained1 was 2.06%, compared 2.74% in the 
      prior year. The Firm's nonperforming assets totaled $10.9 billion at 
      June 30, 2013, down from the prior-quarter level of $11.6&#160;billion and 
      down compared with the prior-year level of $11.4&#160;billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $15.9 billion, up $900 million, or 6%, compared 
      with the prior year, driven by higher compensation expense on higher 
      revenue and higher litigation reserves, partially offset by lower 
      mortgage servicing expense. The current-quarter noninterest expense 
      included $678 million of expense for additional litigation reserves, 
      compared with $323 million of expense for additional litigation reserves 
      in the prior year.

          In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, 
          management reviews the Firm's results and the results of the lines 
          of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis, which is a non-GAAP financial 
          measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the 
          reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to 
          present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business 
          segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. Accordingly, 
          revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt 
          securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable 
          to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial 
          measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue 
          arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding 
          income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within 
          income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income 
          as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.

          The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans 
          excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans 
          held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans; and the 
          allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real 
          Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI 
          loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio 
          totaled $5.7 billion at June 30, 2013, March 31, 2013, and June 30, 
          2012. In Corporate  Investment Bank, the ratio of the allowance for 
          loan losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the 
          impact of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered 
          multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to 
          provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB's allowance coverage.

          Tangible common equity (&#8220;TCE&#8221;) represents common stockholders' 
          equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less 
          goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net 
          of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common 
          equity measures the Firm's earnings as a percentage of average TCE. 
          In management's view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as 
          well as to analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm's use of 
          equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers.

            The Tier 1 common ratio under both Basel I and Basel III are both 
            non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by 
            management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess the 
            Firm's capital position and to compare the Firm's capital to that 
            of other financial services companies. The Basel I Tier 1 common 
            ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted 
            assets. Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less 
            elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such 
            as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in 
            subsidiaries, and trust preferred securities. In July 2013, the 
            U.S. Federal Reserve approved the final rule for implementing 
            Basel III in the United States. For further information on Basel I

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's sweeping re-organization on Thursday creates a company that, more than ever, bears the stamp of Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The face of Microsoft since he took the reins from co-founder Bill Gates in 2000, Ballmer stressed the importance of improving internal collaboration and eliminating redundancies when he released the company's new organizational blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts say the changes also mean less leeway for Microsoft's individual businesses to set and pursue their own agendas, as the company imposes a more streamlined, top-down approach to its strategy and operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the changes promised, the move reinforces Ballmer's grip on the company's direction and further muddies the succession picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still no heir apparent or any succession strategy that has become apparent," said David Smith, an analyst with industry research firm Gartner. "It sounds like he wants to run it in a more centralized style."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Ballmer, 57, who presided over a decade of share price stagnation and was deemed slow to respond to mobile computing, remains more entrenched may worry investors and spur concern that the reorganization will truly effect change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In theory, it's a great idea. The key question will be can Ballmer deliver this in new model and can it be successful," said Channing Smith, co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund, which does not own Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With his track record, it will be question mark for investors going forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the world's No.1 software company, whose $74 billion in annual revenue is powered largely by its dominant role in the PC business via its flagship Windows and Office software. But the company has been caught flat-footed by new trends such as mobile computing, where software by Google Inc and Apple Inc lead the pack, as well as by Web-based "cloud" services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors credit Ballmer for expanding the Windows and Office franchises and growing Microsoft into one of the world's largest technology corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they also fault him for missing out on technology trends. And despite the success of the Xbox - the leader in a declining videogames industry - the company has cranked out a string of failed devices from the Zune media player to the Kin phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been a rocky road. There's definitely been a lot of optimism around certain products, which have not met expectations," said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEP ASIDE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenges have led to sporadic calls for Ballmer to step down, including from activist hedge fund investor Dan Loeb two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That possibility became more remote with the reorganization however, which BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said shored up Ballmer's control over the sprawling organization of 98,000 employees that he runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're investing on the thesis that the CEO is going to change soon, you need to reconsider your thesis," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Helms, an analyst with the consulting firm Directions, said, "What this reorganization has done is taken away a lot of functions in principle from people who were reporting directly to Steve Ballmer," said .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes the post-Ballmer succession plan, long a concern among investors, even less clear. Under the previous structure comprised of mini-business units "there was a job short of the CEO's chair that was very much like a CEO," said Helm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So if you wanted to develop your career, the skills and the credibility to be Microsoft's next CEO there was a place to land. Now there really isn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) is following a move by rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to explore sales of its metal warehouse business, the Financial Times said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is following
a move by rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc to explore sales
of its metal warehouse business, the Financial Times said on
Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said
on its website on Sunday that both U.S. banks have in recent
months informally started to seek potential buying interest for
their warehouse units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman said the firm has no comment. A
spokeswoman at JPMorgan did not immediately return calls for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Reuters first reported Goldman has explored a sale
of its metals warehousing business Metro International LLC, just
three years after the investment bank bought the firm for $550
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A proposed rule change by the London Metal Exchange (LME) to
relieve bottlenecks that slow metal delivery out of warehouses
could cut into profits for the metal warehouse industry, the FT
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources told the FT that JPMorgan has recently started a
sales process for its warehousing unit, Henry Bath, although the
discussions began before the LME's rule change proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has also discussed sales of some of its physical
metal trading book, although there is no direct connection
between the two deals, the FT said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several U.S. banks including Goldman are locked in
discussions with the Federal Reserve over their right to keep
owning and operating physical commodity assets like warehouses,
oil storage tanks, and pipelines following their conversion to
bank holding companies during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under U.S. banking regulations, banks are usually barred
from owning physical commodity assets that they operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission heads to trial Monday against a former Goldman Sachs bond trader in a case it says highlights what went wrong on Wall Street in the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury selection begins in federal court in New York in the civil fraud case against Fabrice Tourre, 34, who the SEC says misled investors in an ill-fated mortgage securities investment called Abacus 2007-AC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the highest-profile trial to date stemming from the SEC's investigation of the events leading up to the 2008 crisis and, legal experts say, presents a chance for the SEC to hold an individual responsible at trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC's case, as summed up by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest last month, is that Tourre "handed Little Red Riding Hood an invitation to grandmother's house while concealing the fact that it was written by the Big Bad Wolf."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the SEC, the wolf in question is John Paulson, a hedge fund billionaire whose bet against the subprime mortgage market was chronicled in "The Greatest Trade Ever" by Gregory Zuckerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Paulson's hedge fund, Paulson &amp; Co Inc, turned to Goldman Sachs Group Inc for help betting against subprime mortgages, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They began discussing Abacus, which would give Paulson a role in picking the underlying portfolio of mortgage securities, the SEC said. Paulson could then short, or bet against, it through an insurance product called a credit default swap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Tourre, a French national, was 28 years old and working at Goldman Sachs in New York. He became the bank's principal employee working on what became Abacus, known in the financial industry as a synthetic collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Abacus's marketing materials failed to disclose Paulson's role in picking the underlying assets, instead saying that a subsidiary of ACA Capital Holdings Inc selected them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's goal, the SEC contends, was to deceive investors into buying the liabilities of Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a much-cited email sent on January 23, 2007, to his girlfriend at the time, Tourre said of the financial markets: the "whole building is about to collapse anytime now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab ... standing in the middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstrosities!!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the underlying mortgage securities turned sour, investors including IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and ABN AMRO Bank NV, now owned by Royal Bank of Scotland Group, lost over $1 billion, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson, meanwhile, netted around $1 billion, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Tourre and Goldman in April 2010. It accused Tourre of fraud, negligence and aiding and abetting Goldman Sachs in violating securities laws. Paulson was not sued, and Goldman agreed in July 2010 to pay $550 million to settle the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, who has left Goldman and is earning a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago, rejected a settlement offer that came just before Goldman settled, a source familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers have said they will seek to convince the jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan that the Abacus offering documents, while not disclosing Paulson's role, contained all the information investors might consider material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophisticated investors like IKB had the tools to analyze the mortgage investments tied to the collateralized debt obligation, Tourre's lawyers have said, and so it did not matter how the investments were chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers have also indicated in court papers they will point to news reports at the time to show how investors should have known that Paulson was betting against the subprime market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Tourre himself, witnesses at the trial are expected to include Laura Schwartz, who the SEC says was Tourre's "primary point of contact" at ACA, the company listed on Abacus's marketing materials as selecting its securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Schwartz, now a managing director at the Seaport Group, will testify that she understood from Tourre that Paulson was investing in the equity of Abacus rather than betting against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers have indicated they will try to challenge Schwartz's credibility as a witness because the SEC has investigated her role in a different collateralized debt obligation.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission heads to trial Monday against a former
Goldman Sachs bond trader in a case it  says highlights what
went wrong on Wall Street in the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury selection begins in federal court in New York in the

Katherine Forrest last month, is that Tourre "handed Little Red
Riding Hood an invitation to grandmother's house while
concealing the fact that it was written by the Big Bad Wolf."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the SEC, the wolf in question is John Paulson,
a hedge fund billionaire whose bet against the subprime mortgage
market was chronicled in "The Greatest Trade Ever" by Gregory
Zuckerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Paulson's hedge fund, Paulson &amp; Co Inc, turned to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc for help betting against subprime

into buying the liabilities of Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a much-cited email sent on Jan. 23, 2007, to his
girlfriend at the time, Tourre said of the financial markets: 
the "whole building is about to collapse anytime now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab ... standing in
the middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades
he created without necessarily understanding all of the
implications of those monstruosities!!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the underlying mortgage securities turned sour,
investors including IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and
ABN AMRO Bank NV, now owned by Royal Bank of Scotland Group
, lost over $1 billion, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson, meanwhile, netted around $1 billion, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Tourre and Goldman in April 2010. It accused
Tourre of fraud, negligence and aiding and abetting Goldman

Goldman agreed in July 2010 to pay $550 million to settle the
lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, who has left Goldman and is earning a doctorate in
economics at the University of Chicago, rejected a settlement
offer that came just before Goldman settled, a source familiar
with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers have said they will seek to convince the
jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan that the Abacus
offering documents, while not disclosing Paulson's role,
contained all the information investors might consider material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophisticated investors like IKB had the tools to analyze
the mortgage investments tied to the collateralized debt
obligation, Tourre's lawyers have said, and so it did not matter
how the investments were chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers have also indicated in court papers they
will point to news reports at the time to show how investors
should have known that Paulson was betting against the subprime
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Tourre himself, witnesses at the trial are expected
to include Laura Schwartz, who the SEC says was Tourre's
"primary point of contact" at ACA, the company listed on
Abacus's marketing materials as selecting its securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Schwartz, now a managing director at the
Seaport Group, will testify that she understood from Tourre that
Paulson was investing in the equity of Abacus rather than
betting against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers have indicated they will try to challenge
Schwartz's credibility as a witness because the SEC has
investigated her role in a different collateralized debt
obligation. It recently closed that probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tourre's witness list, meanwhile, is Paulson, who with a
net worth of $11.2 billion ranked No. 91 on Forbes' list of
richest people in the world. A lawyer for Paulson did not
respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides are heavily lawyered up. In a sign of how
seriously the SEC is taking the case, it will be represented by 
Matthew Martens, its chief litigation counsel. Former SEC
lawyers say it is rare for someone in that position to try a
case himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, whose defense is being paid for by Goldman, is
represented by former prosecutor Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer at
Allen &amp; Overy who counts former Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies CEO
Jeffrey Greenberg among her prior clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently Tourre brought on Sean Coffey, who is
primarily known for obtaining from banks $6.1 billion in
settlements for investors in WorldCom Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre is "confident that when all the evidence is
considered, the jury will soundly reject the SEC's charges,"
Chepiga and Coffey said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is one of several enforcement actions the SEC
has taken against banks and individuals involved in putting
together toxic mortgage financial products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the SEC has reached sizeable settlements with
banks, it has suffered setbacks in cases against individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, a federal jury in Manhattan rejected the SEC's
claims that former Citigroup manager Brian Stoker was liable for
violating securities laws in connection with a $1 billion
collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disappointments like the Stoker case have heightened the
stakes for the SEC in the Tourre's trial, legal experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Marder, a former assistant district administrator for
the SEC in Boston, said the case not only presents a chance for
the SEC to redeem itself but also a rare chance for the courts
to weigh in on wrongdoing during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The court could use this case to make a statement," said
Marder, now at Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp; Ciresi. "And one of best

District of New York, No. 10-03229.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trial of former Goldman Sachs bond trader Fabrice Tourre was about "Wall Street greed," a lawyer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said as the trial began on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC accuses Tourre of misleading investors in a mortgage investment called Abacus 2007-AC1 by not telling them that a hedge fund was involved in selecting the underlying assets and betting against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Martens, a lawyer for the SEC, told the jury the deal Tourre put together was "secretly designed to maximize the potential it would fail" to the benefit of the hedge fund, which made about $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the end, Wall Street greed drove Mr. Tourre to lie and deceive," Martens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, countered that the SEC was trying to turn her client into a "scapegoat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not a case about whether you approve or disapprove of Wall Street," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial, scheduled to last three weeks, stems from a lawsuit the SEC filed against Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Tourre in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, who is no longer with Goldman and is earning a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago, is on trial alone after Goldman agreed to pay a $550 million settlement in July 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, wearing a black suit and orange tie, sat with his counsel as the lawyers made their opening arguments. He did not speak during Monday's proceedings, although he is expected to testify later in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'TRICKERY AND HALF-TRUTHS'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC contends Tourre, at the time a vice president at Goldman, failed to disclose that Paulson &amp; Co Inc, the hedge fund run by billionaire John Paulson, was involved in picking mortgage securities tied to the Abacus investment and that it was also shorting, or betting against, it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martens said Tourre, the principal Goldman employee involved in the Abacus deal, had a duty to be truthful with investors. Instead, he hid "critical information" in order to get them to buy in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre also misled ACA Capital Holdings Inc, a third-party firm ostensibly brought in to select the securities included in the CDO, into believing that Paulson was an equity investor in Abacus rather than taking a short position, Martens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC contends ACA would not have participated had it known Paulson was betting against the investment. A different firm decided not to participate as ACA's portfolio selection agent when Tourre told it Paulson was going short, Martens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His solution was trickery and half-truths," he said. "His solution was securities fraud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martens also displayed a much-cited email sent on January 23, 2007, by Tourre to his girlfriend at the time, saying of the financial markets that the "whole building is about to collapse anytime now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab ... standing in the middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstrosities!!!" the email said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors lost more than $1 billion after almost all the securities tied to the transaction were downgraded, the SEC says. Paulson earned about the same amount thanks to his bet, the SEC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman made $15 million in fees on the deal, Martens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'NOTHING WRONG'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chepiga, Tourre's lawyer, countered in her own opening arguments that her client had not misled investors or ACA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said ACA knew at the time that Paulson was widely reported to be engaged in an aggressive bet against the U.S. housing market after setting up two funds to short subprime investments in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ACA knew Paulson took the opposite view," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACA, not Paulson, picked the securities tied to Abacus, she said, adding that ACA rejected dozens of securities that Paulson wanted included and ran a sophisticated computer analysis before signing off on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was standard for a firm such as ACA to take input from investors in selecting securities for a CDO, Chepiga said. In the case of a deal such as Abacus, known as a synthetic collateralized debt obligation, it would be usual to consult both long and short investors, which by design have both long and short investors involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The decision here was made by ACA," she said. "The selection here was made by ACA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Tourre's email to his girlfriend, Chepiga said it was irrelevant, calling it "an old fashioned love letter" and noting it was referencing a Financial Times article, which he attached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know two to three weeks from now you will find he did nothing wrong," Chepiga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JURY SELECTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Monday, the court picked five women and four men as jurors out of a pool of 48 people. They include a retired special education teacher, a former retail broker now teaching art history, a recent medical school graduate and an Episcopal priest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest excused some potential jurors after they said they had views about Wall Street or the role of banks in the financial crisis. The first juror to be excused said he had "a fairly jaundiced view of Wall Street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest also quizzed jurors on whether they had ever heard of Abacus, Tourre or his nickname, "Fabulous Fab."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the trial, Forrest warned the lawyers on both sides to "have a heart" and be mindful many jurors would not know the financial jargon expected to be used at trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the words or phrases she singled out were "asset-backed," "short," "security," "flip book" and "swap." She also cited the term "trading desk," saying "mere mortals don't know what a trading desk is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do not assume people know what investment bankers do," Forrest added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nate Raymond. Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - The trial of former Goldman
Sachs bond trader Fabrice Tourre was about "Wall Street greed,"
a lawyer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said as
the trial began on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC accuses Tourre of misleading investors in a mortgage
investment called Abacus 2007-AC1 by not telling them that a
hedge fund was involved in selecting the underlying assets and 
betting against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Martens, a lawyer for the SEC, told the jury the
deal Tourre put together was "secretly designed to maximize the
potential it would fail" to the benefit of the hedge fund, which
made about $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the end, Wall Street greed drove Mr. Tourre to lie and
deceive," Martens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, countered that the
SEC was trying to turn her client into a "scapegoat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not a case about whether you approve or disapprove
of Wall Street," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial, scheduled to last three weeks, stems from a
lawsuit the SEC filed against Goldman Sachs Group Inc and
Tourre in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, who is no longer with Goldman and is earning a
doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago, is on trial
alone after Goldman agreed to pay a $550 million settlement in
July 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, wearing a black suit and orange tie, sat with his
counsel as the lawyers made their opening arguments. He did not
speak during Monday's proceedings, although he is expected to
testify later in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'TRICKERY AND HALF-TRUTHS'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC contends Tourre, at the time a vice president at
Goldman, failed to disclose that Paulson &amp; Co Inc, the hedge
fund run by billionaire John Paulson, was involved in picking
mortgage securities tied to the Abacus investment and that it
was also shorting, or betting against, it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martens said Tourre, the principal Goldman employee involved
in the Abacus deal, had a duty to be truthful with investors.
Instead, he hid "critical information" in order to get them to

firm ostensibly brought in to select the securities included in
the CDO, into believing that Paulson was an equity investor in
Abacus rather than taking a short position, Martens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC contends ACA would not have participated had it
known Paulson was betting against the investment. A different
firm decided not to participate as ACA's portfolio selection
agent when Tourre told it Paulson was going short, Martens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His solution was trickery and half-truths," he said. "His
solution was securities fraud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martens also displayed a much-cited email sent on Jan. 23,
2007, by Tourre to his girlfriend at the time, saying of the
financial markets that the "whole building is about to collapse
anytime now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab ... standing in
the middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades
he created without necessarily understanding all of the
implications of those monstruosities!!!" the email said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors lost more than $1 billion after almost all the
securities tied to the transaction were downgraded, the SEC
says. Paulson earned about the same amount thanks to his bet,
the SEC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman made $15 million in fees on the deal, Martens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'NOTHING WRONG'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chepiga, Tourre's lawyer, countered in her own opening
arguments that her client had not misled investors or ACA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said ACA knew at the time that Paulson was widely
reported to be engaged in an aggressive bet against the U.S.
housing market after setting up two funds to short subprime
investments in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ACA knew Paulson took the opposite view," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACA, not Paulson, picked the securities tied to Abacus, she
said, adding that ACA rejected dozens of securities that Paulson
wanted included and ran a sophisticated computer analysis before
signing off on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was standard for a firm such as ACA to take input from
investors in selecting securities for a CDO, Chepiga said. In
the case of a deal such as Abacus, known as a synthetic
collateralized debt obligation, it would be usual to consult
both long and short investors, which by design have both long
and short investors involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The decision here was made by ACA," she said. "The
selection here was made by ACA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Tourre's email to his girlfriend, Chepiga said it was
irrelevant, calling it "an old fashioned love letter" and noting
it was referencing a Financial Times article, which he attached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know two to three weeks from now you will find he did
nothing wrong," Chepiga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JURY SELECTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Monday, the court picked five women and four men
as jurors out of a pool of 48 people. They include a retired
special education teacher, a former retail broker now teaching
art history, a recent medical school graduate and an Episcopal
priest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest excused some potential
jurors after they said they had views about Wall Street or the
role of banks in the financial crisis. The first juror to be
excused said he had "a fairly jaundiced view of Wall Street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest also quizzed jurors on whether they had ever heard
of Abacus, Tourre or his nickname, "Fabulous Fab."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the trial, Forrest warned the lawyers on
both sides to "have a heart" and be mindful many jurors would
not know the financial jargon expected to be used at trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the words or phrases she singled out were
"asset-backed," "short," "security," "flip book" and "swap." She
also cited the term "trading desk," saying "mere mortals don't
know what a trading desk is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do not assume people know what investment bankers do,"
Forrest added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - The trial of former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc bond trader Fabrice Tourre began with the
selection of five women and four men as jurors on Monday, in a
case centering on alleged Wall Street wrongdoing during the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Tourre,
34, of civil fraud, saying he misled investors in a mortgage
investment called Abacus 2007-AC1. The case is the
highest-profile to date stemming from the SEC's probe into the
causes of the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-week trial stems from a lawsuit the SEC filed 
against Goldman Sachs and Tourre in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, who is no longer with Goldman and is earning a
doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago, is
proceeding to trial alone after Goldman agreed to pay a $550
million settlement in July 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, wearing a black suit and orange tie, sat with his
counsel as the jury was selected on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC contends Tourre misled investors in the Abacus
investment vehicle, called a synthetic collateralized debt
obligation, in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says Tourre failed to disclose that Paulson &amp; Co Inc, the
hedge fund run by billionaire John Paulson, was involved in
picking mortgage securities tied to the CDO and was also
shorting, or betting against, it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors lost more than $1 billion after almost all the
securities tied to the transaction were downgraded, the SEC
says. Paulson earned about the same amount thanks to his bet
against it, the SEC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre denies the allegation and is "confident that when all
the evidence is considered, the jury will soundly reject the
SEC's charges," his lawyers, Pamela Chepiga and Sean Coffey,
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jurors for the trial were picked out of a pool of 48 people
brought into the courtroom. They include a retired special
education teacher; a former retail broker now teaching art
history; a recent medical school graduate; and a priest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest excused some potential
jurors after they said they had views about Wall Street or the

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch: JPMorgan Chase 2Q'13 Results Aided by Reserve Releases
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. reported solid second quarter 2013 (2Q'13) net 
      income of $6.5 billion, although these results were aided by 
      approximately $1.5 billion pretax ($930 million after-tax) of reserve 
      releases. Revenues held up versus prior periods and came in at $25.9 
      billion, while the DVA gain was $355 million. Overall expenses remain 
      controlled. Outside of the aforementioned DVA gain and reserve releases, 
      results were fairly clean during the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch considers the $1.5 billion (pretax) reserve release to be large, 
      albeit supported by improving asset quality in JPM's residential and 
      credit card lending portfolios. The company expects further reserve 
      releases over the coming quarters based on current asset quality 
      run-rates. Although Fitch recognizes improving consumer asset quality 
      measures which support lower provision levels, to the extent that 
      improvements in home prices or employment reverse, further reserve 
      releases may be less certain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As Fitch anticipated, residential mortgage banking showed signs of 
      slowing during the quarter, as mortgage rates have begun to rise. 
      Although mortgage applications were up 7% during the quarter to $65 
      billion, originations slowed during the quarter and were down 7% 
      reflecting the rise in rates. Fitch expects that as rates rise, 
      residential mortgage banking will taper off over the second half of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporate and Investment bank turned in better than expected 
      results; 2Q'13 is typically weaker relative to the first quarter. Within 
      the investment bank, investment banking fees showed strength, while FICC 
      was down seasonally. JPM continues to hold top positions in key 
      investment banking segments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commercial Banking and Asset Management turned in stable performance 
      during the quarter. Commercial banking loans outstanding were up 9% 
      versus the prior year and deposits were flat. Similarly, Asset 
      Management reported Assets Under Management (AUM) of $1.5 trillion based 
      on solid net inflows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the quarter, JPM continued to make progress on meeting Basel III 
      capital and liquidity standards. The company reported Basel III Tier I 
      Common of 9.3%, which is slightly below the 9.5% requirement, inclusive 
      of the globally systemically important financial institution capital 
      buffer. This also reflects AOCI losses incurred during the quarter due 
      to the back-up in interest rates. Fitch considers compliance with 
      potentially enhanced leverage ratios to be manageable, as JPM estimates 
      holding company leverage is 4.7%, and bank leverage compliance could be 
      achieved through management actions. Furthermore, JPM disclosed that its 
      liquidity coverage ratio reached 118% based on its interpretation of the 
      standard. On the back of this progress, JPM announced a dividend 
      increase to $0.38/share.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, July 15 (Fitch) JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. reported solid
second quarter 
2013 (2Q'13) net income of $6.5 billion, although these results
were aided by 
approximately $1.5 billion pretax ($930 million after-tax) of
reserve releases. 
Revenues held up versus prior periods and came in at $25.9
billion, while the 
DVA gain was $355 million. Overall expenses remain controlled.
Outside of the 
aforementioned DVA gain and reserve releases, results were
fairly clean during 
the quarter. 
Fitch considers the $1.5 billion (pretax) reserve release to be
large, albeit 
supported by improving asset quality in JPM's residential and
credit card 
lending portfolios. The company expects further reserve releases
over the coming 
quarters based on current asset quality run-rates. Although
Fitch recognizes 
improving consumer asset quality measures which support lower
provision levels, 
to the extent that improvements in home prices or employment
reverse, further 
reserve releases may be less certain.
As Fitch anticipated, residential mortgage banking showed signs
of slowing 
during the quarter, as mortgage rates have begun to rise.
Although mortgage 
applications were up 7% during the quarter to $65 billion,
originations slowed 
during the quarter and were down 7% reflecting the rise in
rates. Fitch expects 
that as rates rise, residential mortgage banking will taper off
over the second 
half of 2013.   
The Corporate and Investment bank turned in better than expected
results; 2Q'13 
is typically weaker relative to the first quarter. Within the
investment bank, 
investment banking fees showed strength, while FICC was down
seasonally. JPM 
continues to hold top positions in key investment banking
segments. 
Commercial Banking and Asset Management turned in stable
performance during the 
quarter. Commercial banking loans outstanding were up 9% versus
the prior year 
and deposits were flat. Similarly, Asset Management reported
Assets Under 
Management (AUM) of $1.5 trillion based on solid net inflows. 
During the quarter, JPM continued to make progress on meeting
Basel III capital 
and liquidity standards. The company reported Basel III Tier I
Common of 9.3%, 
which is slightly below the 9.5% requirement, inclusive of the
globally 
systemically important financial institution capital buffer.
This also reflects 
AOCI losses incurred during the quarter due to the back-up in
interest rates. 
Fitch considers compliance with potentially enhanced leverage
ratios to be 
manageable, as JPM estimates holding company leverage is 4.7%,
and bank leverage 
compliance could be achieved through management actions.
Furthermore, JPM 
disclosed that its liquidity coverage ratio reached 118% based
on its 
interpretation of the standard. On the back of this progress,
JPM announced a 
dividend increase to $0.38/share.

			Pfizer Provides Update on Global Regulatory Approvals and Launches of 
      XELJANZ&#174; (tofacitinib citrate) for the 
      Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that tofacitinib has been 
      approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who 
      had an inadequate response to existing therapies in several additional 
      countries around the world, including Switzerland, which is the first 
      European country to receive approval. Swissmedic, the Swiss agency for 
      therapeutic products, approved tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg twice-daily (BID) 
      as monotherapy or in combination with a disease modifying non-biologic 
      antirheumatic agent (DMARD), including methotrexate (MTX), in adult 
      patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who have had an inadequate 
      response or intolerance to MTX. Tofacitinib 5 mg BID has also been 
      approved in Argentina, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and 
      tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID has been approved in Russia. The brand 
      name for tofacitinib in the approved markets will be XELJANZ, except for 
      Russia, where the brand name will be Jaquinus&#174;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously announced, XELJANZ 5 mg BID is also approved in the United 
      States and Japan for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active RA. 
      XELJANZ was launched in the United States in November 2012, and XELJANZ 
      is expected to be commercially available in Japan this month following 
      approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in 
      March 2013. XELJANZ will be co-promoted in Japan by Pfizer and Takeda 
      Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Initially, XELJANZ will be made 
      available in Japan to medical institutions participating in an 
      all-patient surveillance program, designed by Pfizer in collaboration 
      with Japan&#8217;s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) and the 
      Japan College of Rheumatology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;More than 23 million people worldwide are living with rheumatoid 
      arthritis and there remains an unmet need for additional treatments, 
      with up to one-third of RA patients not adequately responding and about 
      half who stop responding to any particular DMARD within five years,&#8221; 
      said Geno Germano, president and general manager, Specialty Care and 
      Oncology, Pfizer. &#8220;XELJANZ has a novel mechanism of action for the 
      treatment of moderate-to-severe RA. With these approvals, we believe 
      XELJANZ has the potential to change the way rheumatologists treat this 
      chronic, and potentially disabling, disease, and we are proud to offer 
      patients and physicians an additional treatment option.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Regulatory applications for XELJANZ for the treatment of 
      moderate-to-severe active RA remain under review in more than 30 
      additional countries. In Europe, Pfizer is seeking a re-examination of 
      the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) negative 
      opinion that was announced in April, and the company is currently 
      working with the CHMP on the next steps in the process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is the first approved RA treatment in a new class of medicines 
      known as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. The recent marketing 
      authorizations for XELJANZ were based on data from the comprehensive, 
      global, multi-study clinical development program for XELJANZ, which 
      included approximately 5,000 patients in more than 40 countries, 
      resulting in 7,000 patient-years of experience at the time of regulatory 
      submission.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Findings for XELJANZ
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Notable safety findings observed in the XELJANZ RA program include 
      serious and other important infections, including tuberculosis and 
      herpes zoster; malignancies, including lymphoma; gastrointestinal 
      perforations; decreased neutrophil and lymphocyte counts; and lipid 
      elevations. The most common serious adverse events were serious 
      infections. The most commonly reported adverse events were upper 
      respiratory tract infections, headache, nasopharyngitis and diarrhea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Rheumatoid Arthritis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that 
      typically affects the hands and feet, although any joint lined by a 
      synovial membrane may be affected. RA can be painful and disabling,1 
      causing swelling, stiffness and loss of function in the joints.1 
      RA affects 23.7 million people worldwide,2 and although 
      multiple treatments are available, up to one-third of patients do not 
      adequately respond, and about half stop responding to any particular 
      DMARD within five years.3,4,5,6,7,8 As a result, there 
      remains a need for additional options.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About XELJANZ
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is a novel, oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor for the treatment 
      of RA. Unlike recent therapies for RA, which are directed at 
      extracellular targets such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, XELJANZ takes 
      a novel approach targeting the intracellular pathways that operate as 
      hubs in the inflammatory cytokine network.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (the proposed indication) and 
      receive a positive opinion from the CHMP for the proposed indication; 
      whether and when the European Commission and regulatory authorities in 
      other jurisdictions will approve applications that have been or may be 
      submitted for the proposed indication, as well as their decisions 
      regarding labeling and other matters that could affect its availability 
      or commercial potential; uncertainties regarding the commercial success 
      of the proposed indication; and competitive developments.

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron Corp (CVX.N) signed an agreement with Argentina's YPF (YPFD.BA) on Tuesday to invest $1.24 billion in the Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas formation, thought to be one of the biggest reserves in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the first major investment announced in Argentina's petroleum sector since President Cristina Fernandez ordered the seizure of YPF from Repsol (REP.MC) in May 2012, claiming the Spanish group had not invested enough in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country is trying to reverse a long decline in natural gas and oil output that has hurt its trade surplus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies plan to drill 100 wells in an area of 20 square kilometers (5,000 acres), known as Loma La Lata Norte and Loma Campa&#241;a in an initial development phase, according to statements from YPF and Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said Loma La Lata field is now producing more than 10,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. A second phase of the development will require the drilling of 1,500 wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Argentina's government published a decree to allow oil companies to export, tax free, up to 20 percent of the crude and natural gas they produce in the country, paving the way for the Chevron deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that explore Vaca Muerta and export from the field will also be allowed to keep their earnings in foreign exchange outside the South American country, a benefit denied to other companies, which are required to repatriate their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local firm Bridas Energy also signed a preliminary deal with YPF to drill in Vaca Muerta, but Chevron is the first company to finalize investment plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repsol has brought suit against YPF, Bridas Energy and Chevron in Madrid, where a judge will decide whether YPF's deal with Chevron should be frozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has several high-profile legal battles in South America, including its year-long tussle in Brazil following an offshore oil spill there and a two-decade international fight over rainforest pollution in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 40 Mapuche Indians staged a protest against Chevron's involvement in Vaca Muerta earlier on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case of any local legal challenges, YPF and Chevron have agreed to go to court in the United States rather than in Argentina, according to a source familiar with the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Department of Energy report has shown Argentina holds more natural gas trapped in shale rock than all of Europe - a bounty estimated at 774 trillion cubic feet, the bulk of it located in Vaca Muerta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Writing by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* First major private investment since YPF re-nationalized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Argentina changed regulations on Monday to lure shale
investment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Alejandro Lifschitz and Karina Grazina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES, July 16 (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron
Corp signed an agreement with Argentina's YPF 
on Tuesday to invest $1.24 billion in the Vaca Muerta shale oil

Chevron in Madrid, where a judge will decide whether YPF's deal
with Chevron should be frozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has several high-profile legal battles in South
America, including its year-long tussle in Brazil following an
offshore oil spill there and a two-decade international fight
over rainforest pollution in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 40 Mapuche Indians staged a protest against Chevron's
involvement in Vaca Muerta earlier on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case of any local legal challenges, YPF and Chevron have
agreed to go to court in the United States rather than in
Argentina, according to a source familiar with the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Department of Energy report has shown Argentina holds
more natural gas trapped in shale rock than all of Europe - a
bounty estimated at 774 trillion cubic feet, the bulk of it
located in Vaca Muerta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips, Alaska's top-volume oil producer, will pay about $264 million to BP Plc to help cover the cost of transporting crude through the Trans Alaska Pipeline (TAPS), under a settlement approved on Tuesday by federal officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said quarterly profit doubled, boosted by investment gains and a lower tax rate, but investors fretted that these factors will not be repeated in future periods, sending the bank's shares lower on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman's investing and lending segment, which tracks its investments in private equity deals, publicly traded stocks, loans and bonds, produced nearly seven times as much revenue in the second quarter as in the same period last year, much more than analysts expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors questioned how much revenue growth the bank can generate by investing its own capital under new regulations. The Volcker rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, limits banks' market wagers with their own money. But the industry has years to comply with the law, and Goldman believes most of its investing and lending activities already do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's effective tax rate dropped to 27 percent from 32 percent in part because the bank is electing to keep more of its international income permanently offshore, and because it earned more money overseas. Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz told analysts on a conference call that the lower tax rate was not likely to be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's tough to get too excited about these numbers because they're potentially unsustainable," said Tom Jalics, senior research analyst at Key Private Bank, whose clients own bank shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results underscore the difficulties Goldman and its rivals face in navigating the post-crisis world. With regulators pressing banks to boost capital levels, many of Goldman's most profitable businesses are earning less. The bank's return on equity, a measure of how effectively it wrings profit from shareholders' money, was just 10.5 percent in the second quarter, a hair above what it would pay for equity funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Goldman's net income rose to $1.86 billion, or $3.70 per share, in the quarter, from $927 million, or $1.78 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected $2.82 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net revenue rose 30 percent to $8.61 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest contributor to revenue was fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading, which reflects trading with clients. Revenue there rose 12 percent to $2.46 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's results echoed similar trends in the investment banking units of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), whose fixed-income trading businesses also benefited from improvements in trading and underwriting revenue in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's stock fell $2.76, or 1.7 percent, to close at $160.24 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares are up 64 percent over the past 52 weeks, and are well above Goldman's tangible book value of $141.62 as of June 30, but down from a 52-week high of $168.18 hit on June 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE WE ARE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Goldman's conference call with analysts, management fielded questions about the bank's capital and leverage ratios, particularly about whether it was in a good position to meet preliminary U.S. rules for leverage. New proposed regulations came out earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our first assessment is we're very comfortable with where we are," Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He later added that "the only reason I'm not being more specific about numbers at this stage is the team really hasn't had the time to go through the kind of diligence that we would normally want them to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's biggest source of revenue growth was the investing and lending division, where revenue surged to $1.42 billion from $203 million a year earlier. JMP Securities analyst David Trone had expected the segment to produce revenue of $850 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The segment's results have oscillated wildly since it was set up in 2009, delivering anywhere from $2.9 billion to $7.5 billion in revenue annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's investment banking revenue increased 29 percent to $1.55 billion, helped by a 45 percent jump in underwriting revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Improving economic conditions in the U.S. drove client activity," Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement, adding that "the operating environment has shown noticeable signs of improvement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bond yields jumped during the quarter, which cut into clients' willingness to take risk, but those concerns have since abated a bit, Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does feel like people have recalibrated at this stage," he said, adding, "Some of this is returning to kind of normal interest-rate levels.

      A subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today signed an 
      agreement with affiliates of the Argentine oil company YPF S.A. (NYSE: 
      YPF) that furthers the development of shale oil and gas resources from 
      the Vaca Muerta formation located in the Neuqu&#233;n province.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The agreement calls for initial outlays of approximately $1.24 billion 
      to enable the first phase of development in the Loma La Lata Norte and 
      Loma Campa&#241;a areas. The initial program will include the drilling of 100 
      wells in a 5,000-acre tract, part of a 96,000-acre concession.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This strategic investment will allow Chevron to take part in the Vaca 
      Muerta, one of the most exciting shale oil and gas plays in the world 
      today,&#8221; said George Kirkland, vice chairman of Chevron Corporation. &#8220;It 
      provides Chevron with a new opportunity to profitably grow production 
      beyond our 2017 production target of 3.3 million barrels per day.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron has a long history in Argentina, and this project demonstrates 
      our commitment to the country, its economic development and its goal of 
      achieving energy self-sufficiency,&#8221; said Ali Moshiri, president, Chevron 
      Africa-Latin America Exploration and Production.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Loma La Lata field is currently producing more than 10,000 barrels 
      of oil-equivalent per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Argentina currently produces an average of 21,000 barrels of 
      crude oil and 4 million cubic feet of natural gas in the Neuqu&#233;n Basin, 
      where it holds operated interests ranging from 18.8 to 100 percent.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S 500 snapped its eight-day winning streak on Tuesday after disappointing sales from Coca-Cola, while investors turned cautious on the day before the Federal Reserve chairman's congressional testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market's pullback came a day after both the Dow and the S 500 ended at record closing highs for the third consecutive session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's volume was below average at 5.5 billion shares traded on exchanges, but above Monday's 4.91 billion, which was the lightest of any full trading day this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight of the 10 S 500 industry sector indexes declined, with materials shares among the day's worst performers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) was the biggest drag in terms of points on the S 500 after the world's largest soft drinks maker reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter sales, which it blamed on economic malaise and unusually cold and wet weather. The stock, which was the Dow's biggest percentage loser, fell 1.9 percent to $40.23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think you're going to see a lot of companies that are coming in just barely meeting their earnings expectations and again reporting reduced revenues, and I think that's the crux of the problem with our economy," said Brian Amidei, managing director at HighTower Advisors in Palm Desert, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are eager to hear Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony about monetary policy on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. His comments will be closely analyzed for signs of when the central bank may start reducing its stimulus efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernanke's comments in late May, which raised the prospect of trimming the Fed's $85 billion in monthly stimulus, triggered a brief selloff and interrupted this year's rally. The S 500 is still up 17.5 percent since December 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slipped 32.41 points, or 0.21 percent, to end at 15,451.85. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index .SPX declined 6.24 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish at 1,676.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 8.99 points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 3,598.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day's economic data showed that U.S. consumer prices picked up in June. The overall U.S. Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since February, after inching up 0.1 percent in May. U.S. homebuilder confidence rose in July to its strongest level in 7-1/2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial stocks, which started the day as outperformers, also dropped despite strong earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS.N). The S financial sector index .SPSY fell 0.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reported quarterly profit doubled as the bank made more money trading bonds before an interest-rate spike hit markets in June. But Goldman's stock slid 1.7 percent to $160.24 as investors fretted that the results could not be easily repeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other earnings reports, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) shares were flat at $90.40 after the Dow component reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Strong sales of prescription drugs and medical devices more than offset anemic growth of its consumer products, Johnson &amp; Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect S 500 companies' second-quarter earnings to have grown 3 percent from a year earlier, with revenue up 1.5 percent, data from Thomson Reuters showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) sank 14.3 percent to $109.05 after Goldman Sachs Group Inc set a new price target far below the stock's current trading price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bell, shares of Yahoo (YHOO.O) slipped 2.7 percent to $26.15 following the release of its results. In Tuesday's regular session, Yahoo shares fell 1.7 percent to $26.88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day's volume was well below the average daily closing volume for the year of about 6.4 billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decliners outpaced advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1. On the Nasdaq, about 14 stocks fell for every 11 that rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch: Goldman's Performance Remains Solid
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second quarter 2013 (2Q'13) operating profits for The Goldman Sachs 
      Group, Inc. (Goldman) were generally in line with Fitch Ratings' 
      expectations: moderately lower than a strong 1Q'13 but still favorable. 
      Goldman maintained conservative liquidity and posted a moderately higher 
      Basel III capital ratio. These latest results have no rating 
      implications (IDRs: 'A/F1' Stable Outlook).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As expected, total revenues decreased from a robust 1Q'13 level, but 
      compared favorably year-over-year. Revenues in 1Q'13 benefitted from 
      positive market conditions in both the fixed income and equities 
      combined with seasonal strength. As 2Q'13 progressed, market dynamics 
      remained generally favorable in April and May, but deteriorated in June. 
      The last month of 2Q'13 was characterized by higher interest rates and 
      credit spreads combined with a downturn in equities. Consequently, 
      client activities slowed and negative inventory marks affected results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Institutional client services remained the largest contributor to 
      revenues at 50% of total. Within this segment, fixed income activities 
      were affected the most by tougher markets in June. The currency business 
      benefited from greater volatility (particularly in Asia) and the 
      equities business remained steady compared to 1Q'13. Trading VaR ticked 
      up sequentially in view of higher currency volatility, but remained well 
      contained particularly in view of more volatile markets generally in 
      June.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investment banking revenues remained in line with 1Q'13 thanks to 
      continued strength in debt underwriting activities combined with steady 
      advisory revenues. Going forward, debt underwriting activities could 
      weaken if the higher interest rates and credit spreads are sustained. In 
      addition, activities tend to slow down in the summer months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenues in the investing and lending segment remained quite positive 
      for the quarter, but declined from a robust 1Q'13. A highlight was the 
      sale of Goldman's remaining stake in ICBC. The contribution from this 
      area tends to be volatile from quarter to quarter depending on moves in 
      equity markets and credit spreads. Asset management revenues were 
      moderately higher on a linked quarter basis and in line with year ago 
      levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global core excess liquidity, including unencumbered, highly liquid 
      securities and cash, stood at a healthy $183 billion (20% of total 
      assets) and averaged $180 billion during the latest quarter versus $181 
      billion in 1Q'13. Liquidity has been consistently maintained at these 
      conservative levels in recent years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under Basel III, Goldman's Tier I common ratio was approximately 9.3% 
      compared with approximately 9% at end-1Q'13. This ratio benefited from 
      the sale of a majority stake in the reinsurance business, which was less 
      capital efficient under Basel III. This estimated ratio is comfortably 
      above the 8.5% minimum (7% plus the 1.5% G-SIFI buffer) and well within 
      reach of Goldman's 9.5% target. Fitch believes Goldman is comfortably 
      positioned to meet the new proposed supplementary leverage ratio both at 
      the holding company and at Goldman Sachs Bank USA.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, July 16 (Fitch) Second quarter 2013 (2Q'13) operating
profits for The 
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman) were generally in line with
Fitch Ratings' 
expectations: moderately lower than a strong 1Q'13 but still
favorable. Goldman 
maintained conservative liquidity and posted a moderately higher
Basel III 
capital ratio. These latest results have no rating implications
(IDRs: 'A/F1' 
Stable Outlook).
As expected, total revenues decreased from a robust 1Q'13 level,
but compared 
favorably year-over-year.  Revenues in 1Q'13 benefitted from
positive market 
conditions in both the fixed income and equities combined with
seasonal 
strength.  As 2Q'13 progressed, market dynamics remained
generally favorable in 
April and May, but deteriorated in June.  The last month of
2Q'13 was 
characterized by higher interest rates and credit spreads
combined with a 
downturn in equities. Consequently, client activities slowed and
negative 
inventory marks affected results.  
Institutional client services remained the largest contributor
to revenues at 
50% of total. Within this segment, fixed income activities were
affected the 
most by tougher markets in June. The currency business benefited
from greater 
volatility (particularly in Asia) and the equities business
remained steady 
compared to 1Q'13. Trading VaR ticked up sequentially in view of
higher currency 
volatility, but remained well contained particularly in view of
more volatile 
markets generally in June.
Investment banking revenues remained in line with 1Q'13 thanks
to continued 
strength in debt underwriting activities combined with steady
advisory revenues. 
Going forward, debt underwriting activities could weaken if the
higher interest 
rates and credit spreads are sustained.  In addition, activities
tend to slow 
down in the summer months. 
Revenues in the investing and lending segment remained quite
positive for the 
quarter, but declined from a robust 1Q'13. A highlight was the
sale of Goldman's 
remaining stake in ICBC. The contribution from this area tends
to be volatile 
from quarter to quarter depending on moves in equity markets and
credit spreads. 
Asset management revenues were moderately higher on a linked
quarter basis and 
in line with year ago levels.
Global core excess liquidity, including unencumbered, highly
liquid securities 
and cash, stood at a healthy $183 billion (20% of total assets)
and averaged 
$180 billion during the latest quarter versus $181 billion in
1Q'13. Liquidity 
has been consistently maintained at these conservative levels in
recent years. 
Under Basel III, Goldman's Tier I common ratio was approximately
9.3% compared 
with approximately 9% at end-1Q'13.  This ratio benefited from
the sale of a 
majority stake in the reinsurance business, which was less
capital efficient 
under Basel III.  This estimated ratio is comfortably above the
8.5% minimum (7% 
plus the 1.5% G-SIFI buffer) and well within reach of Goldman's
9.5% target. 
Fitch believes Goldman is comfortably positioned to meet the new
proposed 
supplementary leverage ratio both at the holding company and at
Goldman Sachs 
Bank USA.

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman Sachs profit doubles, helped by bond trading&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Coke profit falls on weak economy, wet weather&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow off 0.3 pct; S 500 down 0.5 pct; Nasdaq down 0.4 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Caroline Valetkevitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday
after disappointing sales from Coca-Cola and as investor
caution took hold on the day before the Federal Reserve
chairman's congressional testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market's pullback came a day after both the Dow and the
S 500 ended at record closing highs for the third consecutive
session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's decline put the S 500 on track to break an
eight-day string of gains. Nine of the 10 S 500 industry
sector indexes fell, with energy and material shares ranking
among the day's worst performers. Marathon Petroleum 
dropped 4.1 percent to $70.13. Alcoa slid 1 percent to
$8.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co was among the biggest drags on the Dow and 
weighed on the S 500 after the world's largest soft drinks
maker reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter sales, which
it blamed on economic malaise and unusually cold and wet
weather. The stock fell 2.2 percent to $40.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think you're going to see a lot of companies that are
coming in just barely meeting their earnings expectations and
again reporting reduced revenues, and I think that's the crux of
the problem with our economy," said Brian Amidei, managing
director at HighTower Advisors in Palm Desert, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial stocks, which started the day as outperformers,
also dropped despite strong earnings from Goldman Sachs.
The S financial sector index fell 0.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reported quarterly profit doubled as the bank
made more money trading bonds before an interest-rate spike hit
markets in June. But Goldman's stock slid 1.7 percent to $160.28
as investors fretted that the results could not be easily
repeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was down 42.07
points, or 0.27 percent, at 15,442.19. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index was down 7.90 points, or 0.47 percent, at 1,674.60.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 13.83 points, or
0.38 percent, at 3,593.67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday's modest advance took place on the lightest volume of
any full trading day this year, with just 4.91 billion shares
traded on U.S. exchanges. In addition to the nominal closing
highs set by the Dow and the S 500, the Nasdaq ended at the
highest level since September 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading was expected to remain subdued ahead of Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony on Wednesday before
the House Financial Services Committee. His comments will be
closely analyzed for signs of when the central bank may start
reducing its stimulus efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson &amp; Johnson shares dipped 0.1 percent to
$90.31 after the Dow component reported higher-than-expected
second-quarter earnings. Strong sales of prescription drugs and
medical devices more than offset anemic growth of its consumer
products, Johnson &amp; Johnson said. Earlier, the 
stock hit a 52-week high at $91.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect S 500 companies' second-quarter earnings
to have grown 3 percent from a year earlier, with revenue up 1.5
percent, data from Thomson Reuters showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. homebuilder confidence rose in July to its strongest
level in 7-1/2 years as tightening supply and solid demand
fueled the sector's recovery even in the face of rising mortgage
rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Tesla Motors Inc sank 14.8 percent to
$108.44 after Goldman Sachs Group Inc set a new price target far
below the current trading price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Antony Currie
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs isn&#8217;t yet the envy of Wall Street again. The investment bank generated $1.9 billion of profit in the second quarter, twice the figure of a year ago and beating the estimates of analysts by a third. Though it sounds like a return to Goldman&#8217;s good old days, it hasn&#8217;t managed to solidly outpace rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, some of the bottom line was helped by a lower tax rate. In the three months to June, Goldman handed over 27 percent of its pretax profit to governments around the world. That&#8217;s about 6 percentage points lower than it has been paying of late. It was the benefit, finance chief Harvey Schwartz told investors on Tuesday, of permanently reinvesting in the business money made outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reduced levies brought in an extra $159 million for shareholders, without which Goldman&#8217;s annualized return on equity for the quarter would have dipped from 10.5 percent to 9.6 percent, or just below the rule-of-thumb estimate for a big bank&#8217;s cost of capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investing and lending also contributed a decent slug of revenue. At $1.4 billion, the sum was 32 percent below that of the first quarter, but still seven times what it was a year ago. That&#8217;s great &#8211; for now. It may be tough to duplicate, though, and not just because investments in debt and private equity are lumpy. The Volcker Rule will prohibit banks from devoting more than 3 percent of capital to such pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s efforts elsewhere were mostly decent enough. Asset management revenue was flat at $1.3 billion, but isn&#8217;t the firm&#8217;s strongest division. Sales of stocks and bonds were solid, with underwriting fees jumping 45 percent from a year ago. And traders of fixed income, currencies and commodities reaped $2.5 billion of revenue, mostly avoiding the macroeconomic and central-banker induced effects that stung smaller rival Jefferies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of it, however, was markedly better than the performance of the folks at Citigroup and JPMorgan. In some areas, the competitors even held up stronger. Goldman is accustomed to being far ahead of the pack. For now, though, it is only distinctly better than it had been, not the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, July 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on
Tuesday it has written to the U.S. Attorney General to ask for
more freedom to disclose how it handles requests from national
security organizations for customer data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal comes a week after the Guardian newspaper
reported that Microsoft allowed U.S. security agencies to
circumvent encryption of Outlook emails and capture Skype online
chats, citing leaked documents provided by Edward Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company said there were
"significant inaccuracies" in media reports last week and
asserted it does not allow any government direct or unfettered
access to customers' emails, instant messages or data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DETROIT (Reuters) - The shares of electric carmaker Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) fell about 12 percent on Tuesday after Goldman SachsGroup Inc (GS.N) set a new price target far below the current trading price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Archambault, in a broader research note on the automotive sector published on Tuesday, offered three different growth scenarios for Tesla and set a six-month price target of $84 a share, up from $61, previously. He left unchanged his "neutral" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla's shares were off $15.25 at $112.01 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. Through Monday, the stock had nearly quadrupled so far this year. Earlier this month, Nasdaq said that Tesla's shares would be listed on the Nasdaq 100 index to reflect the company's rising profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the stock closes at this level, it would be the largest one-day drop since Jan 13, 2012, when it fell nearly 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, Archambault sees Chief Executive Elon Musk's company selling 105,000 cars, including the Model S and a future smaller sedan, with 14.6 percent operating margins and earnings of $5.99 a share. In the second scenario, he sees 150,000 sales, 14.8 percent margins and earnings per share of $8.59. The most bullish scenario was for 200,000 sales, 15.2 percent margins and $11.69 in earnings per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In averaging out the three scenarios, Archambault came up with the new price target of $84, which is far below the current price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking more broadly about the auto sector, Archambault said auto stocks have underperformed the S 500 index by an average of 26 percent in three of the last four tightening periods. He said the sector has historically peaked 65 percent of the way through an expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archambault said he was now focused on General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N). "Both ... have strong product driven growth stories in multiple regions," he said in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archambault rates both stock as "buy," but sees stronger near-term catalysts for GM's share, including the rollout of profitable full-size pickup trucks boosting margins in the second half of 2013, and the possibility of a common dividend by year end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Analysts pressured Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz on Tuesday to disclose how close the bank is to meeting new leverage ratio requirements proposed last week by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a conference call, eight analysts asked questions about the ratio, but Schwartz refused to provide an estimate of where Goldman stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our first assessment is we're very comfortable with where we are," he said, later adding that "the only reason I'm not being more specific about numbers at this stage is the team really hasn't had the time to go through the kind of diligence that we would normally want them to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz also cautioned that the rule is not final, and may change before being implemented. As it stands, banks will have to hold equity capital equal to 6 percent of total assets at bank subsidiaries and 5 percent of total assets at broader holding companies by 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLSA analyst Mike Mayo questioned Schwartz aggressively about the lack of disclosure, asking him to give some kind of estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I hear you saying is, 'Trust us, we will be there,'" said Mayo.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Analysts pressured Goldman
Sachs Group Inc Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz
on Tuesday to disclose how close the bank is to meeting new
leverage ratio requirements proposed last week by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a conference call, eight analysts asked questions about
the ratio, but Schwartz refused to provide an estimate of where
Goldman stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our first assessment is we're very comfortable with where
we are," he said, later adding that "the only reason I'm not
being more specific about numbers at this stage is the team
really hasn't had the time to go through the kind of diligence
that we would normally want them to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz also cautioned that the rule is not final, and may
change before being implemented. As it stands, banks will have
to hold equity capital equal to 6 percent of total assets at
bank subsidiaries and 5 percent of total assets at broader
holding companies by 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLSA analyst Mike Mayo questioned Schwartz aggressively
about the lack of disclosure, asking him to give some kind of
estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I hear you saying is, 'Trust us, we will be there,'"
said Mayo. "On the other hand, you're not disclosing a number
like your peers have done and perhaps other peers will do. So on
a disclosure basis, you're behind peers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other large banks that have reported earnings in recent
days, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Wells Fargo &amp; Co

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman Sachs profit doubles, helped by bond trading&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Coca-Cola second-quarter profit falls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Futures: S up 0.2 pt, Dow up 2 pts, Nasdaq up 4 pts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Angela Moon and Alison Griswold&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set for a flat
open on Tuesday as profit-taking after the S 500's eight-day
advance and investor caution about monetary policy outweighed
Goldman Sachs' doubling of its quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data showed consumer prices rose more than expected in June
as gasoline prices jumped, but underlying inflation pressure
remained benign, pointing to lukewarm domestic demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data, along with a housing report later in the day,
comes one day before Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
testifies before the House Financial Services Committee.
Investors about monetary policy and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will be looking for clues about when the Fed might
begin to reduce its bond-buying program, which has helped stocks
to reach record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc's shares rose 0.7 percent to
$163.80 in premarket trade after the firm reported quarterly
profit that doubled as the bank made more money trading bonds
before an interest-rate spike hit markets in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's again a tribute to the nimble trading in their fixed
income group and that's what they're always known for," said
Jack De Gan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory Corp in
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a much more impressive number for financial markets
and it's going to be tough for the other investment banks to
measure up to that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Citigroup's strong earnings helped push the S
500 to post its longest winning streak since mid-January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had eight straight up days in the S, so we could
have a down day (today) just for trading purposes," De Gan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson &amp; Johnson also reported higher-than-expected
second-quarter earnings as strong sales of prescription drugs
and medical devices more than offset anemic growth of its
consumer products. The stock rose 1 percent in premarket trade
to $91.26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other earnings, Coca-Cola Co, a Dow component, 
reported quarterly earnings fell below the company's
expectations. Coke's stock fell 3 percent to $39.80 in premarket
trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S 500 futures were down 0.8 point, and slightly
below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking
into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on
the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 2
points, while Nasdaq 100 futures added 2.25 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online broker Charles Schwab Corp posted a 7
percent fall in quarterly profit as growth in net new assets
slowed and expenses rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S 500
finished at record closing highs for the third consecutive
session. The Nasdaq scored its highest close since September
2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European shares edged down on Tuesday, slipping back after
rallying from 2013 lows over the last two weeks, with Telecom
Italia falling due to uncertainty over the company's
plans to spin off its fixed-line network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays (BARC.L) has poached JP Morgan (JPM.N) executive Tushar Morzaria to become its new finance director, offering him up to 6 million pounds ($9.1 million) in annual pay and awards to help the bank recover from a series of scandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morzaria faces a challenging job. Barclays has pledged to improve relations with regulators and raise standards at the bank, shortcomings exposed when it was fined $450 million in June 2012 for rigging the Libor global benchmark interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its capital strength is also under scrutiny. It is in talks with the Bank of England over how to reduce leverage after being warned last month it had to do so. Barclays said that could force it to cut lending to British households and firms, but the central bank said it would not allow that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morzaria is chief financial officer of corporate and investment banking (CIB) at JP Morgan Chase, where he has spent most of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan praised Morzaria's "analytical ability, combined with his calm, steady demeanor" and said it would appoint his successor in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move ends Barclays' lengthy search for a finance director, after it said in February that Chris Lucas would step down after six years in the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morzaria, 44, will be paid a salary of 800,000 pounds and can earn an annual bonus of up to 2 million pounds and a long-term share award of up to 3.2 million. The long-term award would only start paying out in five years' time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is expected to begin work at Barclays this autumn but there will be a lengthy handover period. He will join the board at the start of next year and take over as finance director when Lucas retires at the end of February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in Uganda and moved to Britain in 1971.

Before JP Morgan he worked at SG Warburg (UBSN.VX) and Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas has been finance director for a tough six years and last year was particularly difficult. He is one of four current and former employees being investigated by UK authorities regarding a capital injection by Qatar in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has also been accused in recent years of aggressive interpretation of regulations, paying staff too much, and it was found to have mis-sold products to millions of customers - leading to it paying billions of pounds in compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas has had health problems and although that has not affected his ability to do his job, it influenced his decision to retire, a person familiar with the matter said in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the only Barclays executive director still in their post after the bank was fined over the Libor rate rigging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antony Jenkins replaced Bob Diamond as CEO and David Walker replaced Marcus Agius as chairman, and they have overhauled senior management and promised to drive through a major change in culture and standards across the bank's 140,000 workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas was paid 1.9 million pounds last year, after foregoing any annual bonus. He was paid almost 4 million pounds in both 2011 and 2010, including long-term awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Matt Scuffham and Pravin Char)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc trimmed its
commodities trading risk in the second quarter as raw materials prices declined,
quarterly results from the Wall Street investment bank showed on Tuesday. 
    Goldman's Value-at-Risk in commodities stood at $19 million per day in the
second quarter, down $2 million from the first quarter and $1 million lower than
a year earlier. VaR is a measure of the maximum amount of money a bank is
prepared to lose in a day from trading a particular asset class.
    Like other Wall Street banks, Goldman groups its commodities revenue under
the fixed income category and does not break out the sector individually. As a
result, VaR is often one of its key risk-reward indicators for commodities.
    JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, a rival of Goldman, also reported a slight
decline in its second-quarter commodities risk as oil, metals and crop prices
fell in the period. The Thomson Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a key
indicator of commodity prices, declined 7 percent in the second quarter.
    Goldman Sachs said second-quarter fixed income revenue rose 12 percent from
a year earlier to $2.46 billion, helped by significantly higher net revenue in
currencies, credit products and commodities.
    The bank's quarterly profit doubled to $1.86 billion from $927 million a
year ago as it made more money trading bonds before an interest-rate spike hit
markets in June. 
    Wall Street banks' average commodities VaR by quarter (millions of dollars

10-Q filings with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission.

expectations. Coke's stock fell 3 percent to $39.80 in premarket
trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors were also cautious before a batch of data on
consumer prices, industrial production and housing. The reports
come a day before Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke give the
Fed's semiannual testimony before the House Financial Services
Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets will be parsing his words for clues on when the Fed
may start reducing its bond-buying program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc's quarterly profit doubled as
the bank made more money trading bonds before an interest-rate
spike hit markets in June. Its shares were up 1.3 percent at
$165.13. Citigroup's strong earnings the day before helped push
the S 500 to a higher close, which was the longest streak
since mid-January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think obviously once again we're seeing another company
beating estimates and that's good news, but I think the market
is probably going to take a breather today ahead of Bernanke's
testimony and some of the economic data," said Peter Cardillo,
chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's net income rose to $1.86 billion, or $3.70 per
share, from $927 million, or $1.78 per share, in the comparable 
quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other earnings, Coca-Cola Co, a Dow component, 
reported lower quarterly earnings, below the company's
expectations and causing the stock to fall in premarket trading.
Coke cited challenging global economic conditions. Net income
dipped to $2.68 billion, or 59 cents per share, in the second
quarter, from $2.79 billion, or 61 cents per share, a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer price data for June is scheduled for 8:30 a.m.
(1230 GMT) and the industrial production data is due at 9:15
a.m.. The National Association of Home Builders housing market
index for July is due at 10 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S 500 futures were little changed and in line with
fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 10
points, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 2 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S 500
finished at record closing highs for the third consecutive
session. The Nasdaq scored its highest close since September
2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European shares edged down on Tuesday, slipping back after
rallying from 2013 lows over the last two weeks, with Telecom
Italia falling due to uncertainty over the company's
plans to spin off its fixed-line network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			Goldman Sachs Reports Second Quarter Earnings Per Common Share of 
      $3.70
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today reported net revenues of 
      $8.61&#160;billion and net earnings of $1.93&#160;billion for the second quarter 
      ended June&#160;30,&#160;2013. Diluted earnings per common share were $3.70 
      compared with $1.78 for the second quarter of 2012 and $4.29 for the 
      first quarter of 2013. Annualized return on average common shareholders&#8217; 
      equity (ROE)&#160;(1) was 10.5% for the second quarter of 
      2013 and 11.5% for the first half of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Goldman Sachs continued its leadership in investment banking, ranking 
        first in worldwide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions 
        for the year-to-date.&#160;(2)
			
			
        The firm ranked first in worldwide equity and equity-related 
        offerings, common stock offerings and initial public offerings for the 
        year-to-date.&#160;(2)
			
			
        Debt underwriting produced record quarterly net revenues of 
        $695&#160;million.
      
			
        Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share&#160;(3) 
        both
				increased approximately 2% during the quarter to 
        $151.21 and $141.62, respectively.
      
			
        The firm continues to manage its liquidity and capital conservatively. 
        The firm&#8217;s global core excess liquidity&#160;(4) was 
        $183&#160;billion&#160;(5) as of June&#160;30,&#160;2013. In 
        addition, the firm&#8217;s Tier&#160;1 capital ratio&#160;(6) was 
        15.6%&#160;(5) and the firm&#8217;s Tier&#160;1 common ratio&#160;(7) 
        was 13.5%&#160;(5) as of June&#160;30,&#160;2013, in each case 
        under Basel&#160;1 and reflecting the revised market risk regulatory 
        capital requirements which became effective on January&#160;1,&#160;2013.

      _____________
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The firm&#8217;s performance was solid especially in the context of mixed 
      economic sentiment during the quarter,&#8221; said Lloyd C. Blankfein, 
      Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;Improving economic conditions in 
      the U.S. drove client activity and the strength of our global client 
      franchise allowed us to deliver positive performance across a number of 
      our businesses. While the operating environment has shown noticeable 
      signs of improvement, we continue to put a premium on disciplined risk 
      management, particularly in regard to the firm&#8217;s strong capital and 
      liquidity levels.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Net Revenues
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investment Banking
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.55&#160;billion, 29% higher than 
      the second quarter of 2012 and essentially unchanged compared with the 
      first quarter of 2013. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were 
      $486&#160;million, slightly higher than the second quarter of 2012. Net 
      revenues in the firm&#8217;s Underwriting business were $1.07&#160;billion, 45% 
      higher than the second quarter of 2012. This increase primarily 
      reflected significantly higher net revenues in debt underwriting, due to 
      leveraged finance activity, and in equity underwriting, primarily 
      reflecting an increase in industry-wide activity. The firm&#8217;s investment 
      banking transaction backlog was essentially unchanged compared with the 
      end of the first quarter of 2013.&#160;(8)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Institutional Client Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $4.31 billion, 11% 
      higher than the second quarter of 2012 and 16% lower than the first 
      quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution 
      were $2.46&#160;billion, 12% higher than the second quarter of 2012, 
      reflecting significantly higher net revenues in currencies, credit 
      products and commodities. These increases were partially offset by 
      significantly lower net revenues in mortgages and lower net revenues in 
      interest rate products. Although Fixed Income, Currencies and 
      Commodities Client Execution operated in a generally favorable 
      environment during the first half of the quarter, market conditions 
      across products became more challenging during the latter part of the 
      quarter, as interest rates and market volatility increased.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Equities were $1.85&#160;billion, 9% higher than the second 
      quarter of 2012. Excluding net revenues from the firm&#8217;s reinsurance 
      business&#160;(9), net revenues in Equities were 23% higher 
      compared with the same period last year, reflecting significantly higher 
      net revenues in equities client execution, which reflected significantly 
      higher net revenues in derivatives and cash products. Commissions and 
      fees were higher, primarily in Asia, due to an increase in activity and 
      higher market values. Securities services net revenues were lower 
      compared with the second quarter of 2012. Excluding the decline 
      attributable to the sale of the firm&#8217;s&#160;hedge fund administration 
      business in 2012, securities services net revenues were essentially 
      unchanged. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment 
      generally characterized by higher volatility levels, particularly in 
      Asia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The net gain attributable to the impact of changes in the firm&#8217;s own 
      credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected 
      was $59&#160;million ($32&#160;million and $27&#160;million related to Fixed Income, 
      Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, 
      respectively) for the second quarter of 2013, compared with a net gain 
      of $6&#160;million for the second quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investing  Lending
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investing  Lending were $1.42&#160;billion for the second 
      quarter of 2013. Results for the second quarter of 2013 included net 
      gains of $462&#160;million from investments in equities, primarily in private 
      equities, net gains and net interest income of $658&#160;million from debt 
      securities and loans, and other net revenues of $295&#160;million related to 
      the firm&#8217;s consolidated investments. During the quarter, the firm sold 
      its remaining investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and 
      Commercial Bank of China Limited.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investment Management
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.33&#160;billion, essentially 
      unchanged compared with the second quarter of 2012 and the first quarter 
      of 2013. Net revenues in the second quarter of 2013 included higher 
      management and other fees, primarily due to higher average assets under 
      supervision&#160;(10), and higher transaction revenues 
      compared with the second quarter of 2012. These increases were offset by 
      lower incentive fees. During the quarter, long-term assets under 
      supervision&#160;(10) decreased $4&#160;billion, reflecting market 
      depreciation of $11&#160;billion, primarily in fixed income assets, partially 
      offset by net inflows of $7&#160;billion. Net inflows primarily included 
      inflows in fixed income assets&#160;(11), partially offset by 
      outflows in alternative investment assets. Liquidity products&#160;(10) 
      decreased $9&#160;billion during the quarter. Total assets under supervision
			decreased $13&#160;billion during the quarter to $955&#160;billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating expenses were $5.97&#160;billion, 14% higher than the second 
      quarter of 2012 and 11% lower than the first quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Compensation and Benefits
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, 
      estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity 
      awards and other items such as benefits) was $3.70 billion for the 
      second quarter of 2013, 27% higher than the second quarter of 2012, 
      reflecting a significant increase in net revenues. The ratio of 
      compensation and benefits to net revenues for the first half of 2013 was 
      43.0%, compared with 44.0% for the first half of 2012. Total staff 
      (12) decreased 1% compared with the end of the first quarter of 
      2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Non-Compensation Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Non-compensation expenses were $2.26&#160;billion, essentially unchanged 
      compared with the second quarter of 2012 and 5% lower than the first 
      quarter of 2013. Non-compensation expenses for the second quarter of 
      2013 included lower expenses as a result of the sale of the firm's 
      reinsurance business and lower expenses related to consolidated 
      investments compared with the second quarter of 2012. These decreases 
      were partially offset by increased net provisions for litigation and 
      regulatory proceedings and higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and 
      distribution fees which principally reflected higher transaction volumes 
      in Equities. The second quarter of 2013 included net provisions for 
      litigation and regulatory proceedings of $149&#160;million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Provision for Taxes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2013 was 30.4%, down 
      from 33.0% for the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to a 
      determination that certain non-U.S. earnings will be permanently 
      reinvested abroad, as well as changes in the earnings mix.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Capital
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of June&#160;30,&#160;2013, total capital was $240.08&#160;billion, consisting of 
      $78.04&#160;billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity (common shareholders&#8217; 
      equity of $70.84&#160;billion and preferred stock of $7.20&#160;billion) and 
      $162.04&#160;billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common 
      share was $151.21 and tangible book value per common share&#160;(3) 
      was $141.62, both approximately 2% higher compared with the end of the 
      first quarter of 2013. Book value and tangible book value per common 
      share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock 
      units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 
      468.5&#160;million as of June&#160;30,&#160;2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On April&#160;25,&#160;2013, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.) issued 
      40,000 shares of perpetual 5.50% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative 
      Preferred Stock, Series&#160;J (Series&#160;J Preferred Stock), for aggregate 
      proceeds of $1.00&#160;billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the quarter, the firm repurchased 10.5&#160;million shares of its 
      common stock at an average cost per share of $152.80, for a total cost 
      of $1.60&#160;billion. The remaining share authorization under the firm&#8217;s 
      existing repurchase program is 75.9&#160;million shares.&#160;(13)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to bank 
      holding companies, the firm&#8217;s Tier&#160;1 capital ratio&#160;(6) 
      was 15.6%&#160;(5) and the firm&#8217;s Tier&#160;1 common ratio&#160;(7) 
      was 13.5%&#160;(5) as of June&#160;30,&#160;2013, up from 14.4% 
      and 12.7%, respectively, as of March&#160;31,&#160;2013 (in each case under 
      Basel&#160;1 and reflecting the revised market risk regulatory capital 
      requirements which became effective on January&#160;1,&#160;2013).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Other Balance Sheet and Liquidity Metrics
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The firm&#8217;s global core excess liquidity (GCE)&#160;(4) was 
        $183&#160;billion&#160;(5) as of June&#160;30,&#160;2013 and averaged 
        $180&#160;billion&#160;(5) for the second quarter of 2013, 
        compared with an average of $181&#160;billion for the first quarter of 2013.
      
			
        Total assets
				were $938&#160;billion&#160;(5) as 
        of June&#160;30,&#160;2013, compared with $959&#160;billion as of March&#160;31,&#160;2013.
      
			
        Level 3 assets
				were $43&#160;billion&#160;(5) as 
        of June&#160;30,&#160;2013, compared with $46&#160;billion as of March&#160;31,&#160;2013, and 
        represented 4.6% of total assets.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Group Inc. declared a dividend of $0.50 per common share to be paid on 
      September&#160;27,&#160;2013 to common shareholders of record on August&#160;30,&#160;2013. 
      The firm also declared dividends of $244.79, $387.50, $261.11, $261.11,

      to preferred shareholders of record on July&#160;28,&#160;2013. In addition, the 
      firm declared dividends of $1,022.22 per each share of Series&#160;E

			Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking 
      Statements

      This press release contains &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the 
      meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not 
      historical facts, but instead represent only the firm&#8217;s beliefs 
      regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently 
      uncertain and outside of the firm&#8217;s control. It is possible that the 
      firm&#8217;s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly 
      materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition 
      indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some 
      of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm&#8217;s future 
      results and financial condition, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part&#160;I, Item&#160;1A

      Certain of the information regarding the firm&#8217;s capital ratios, 
      risk-weighted assets, total assets, level&#160;3 assets and global core 
      excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates. These estimates are 
      forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly 
      materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Statements about the firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction backlog also 
      may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject 
      to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that 
      they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, 
      that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, 
      possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors 
      that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a 
      transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting 
      transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic 
      conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities 
      markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer 
      of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a 
      decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate 
      financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the 
      transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a

          Tangible common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' 
          equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible 
          assets. Tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing 
          tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity by the number of common shares 
          outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees 
          with no future service requirements. Management believes that 
          tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity and tangible book value per 
          common share are meaningful because they are measures that the firm 
          and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common 
          shareholders&#8217; equity and tangible book value per common share are 
          non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP 
          measures used by other companies. The table below presents the 
          reconciliation of total shareholders' equity to tangible common 
          shareholders' equity:

            The Tier&#160;1 common ratio equals Tier&#160;1 common capital divided by 
            risk-weighted assets. As of June&#160;30,&#160;2013, Tier&#160;1 common capital 
            was $61.90&#160;billion, consisting of Tier&#160;1 capital of $71.14&#160;billion 
            less preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts 
            and other adjustments of $9.24&#160;billion. Management believes that 
            the Tier&#160;1 common ratio is meaningful because it is one of the 
            measures that the firm and investors use to assess capital 
            adequacy. The Tier&#160;1 common ratio is a non-GAAP measure and may

			Second Quarter and Year-to-Date 2013 Highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Second quarter volume grew 1% and year-to-date volume grew 3%. 
        Coca-Cola Americas grew 1% and Coca-Cola International grew 2% in the 
        quarter.
			
			
				Solid global volume and value share gains achieved in the quarter 
        in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages as well as 
        global volume and value share gains in sparkling and still beverages.
			
			
				Reported net revenues declined 3% in the second quarter and 2% year 
        to date. Excluding the impact of structural changes, comparable 
        currency neutral net revenues grew 2% in both the quarter and year to 
        date.
			
			
				Reported operating income declined 2% in the second quarter and 3% 
        year to date. Excluding the impact of structural changes, comparable 
        currency neutral operating income grew 4% in the quarter and 5% year 
        to date.
			
			
				Currency was a 2% headwind on comparable net revenues and a 3% 
        headwind on comparable operating income in the quarter.
			
			
				Second quarter reported EPS was $0.59, down 3% and comparable EPS 
        was $0.63, up 4%, including an approximate 2% currency headwind.
				Year-to-date 
        reported EPS was $0.98, down 7% and comparable EPS was $1.09, up 4% 
        despite two fewer selling days in the first half of 2013 and an 
        approximate 4% currency headwind.
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company today reported second quarter and year-to-date 
      2013 results. Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The 
      Coca-Cola Company said, &#8220;Our second quarter volume results came in below 
      our expectations, reflecting an ongoing challenging global macroeconomic 
      environment and unusually poor weather conditions in the quarter. While 
      we are not happy with our performance, we did gain global volume and 
      value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages as well as in 
      sparkling and still beverages in the quarter. Despite the headwinds in 
      the quarter, we are committed to improving upon our results, with 
      current dynamics leading us to believe that our performance will be 
      better in the second half of the year. We remain confident in our 2020 
      Vision and our system's ability to execute with precision around the 
      world. In this context, we remain firmly focused on investing alongside 
      our global bottling partners to strengthen our system for the future, to 
      deliver the brands and beverages that consumers love and to achieve our 
      long-term performance goals.&#8221;

			PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company reported worldwide volume growth of 1% in the 
      second quarter and 3% year to date, and grew global volume and value 
      share in the quarter in total NARTD beverages as well as in both 
      sparkling and still beverages. Volume growth in the quarter was below 
      the Company's expectations due to a confluence of factors that 
      collectively made for a challenging second quarter. Slow economies in 
      Europe, Asia and Latin America, and historically wet and cold weather 
      conditions across multiple regions impacted consumer spending and, 
      consequently, overall NARTD beverage industry performance. Coca-Cola 
      Americas grew volume 1% in the quarter and 2% year to date, with North 
      America volume down 1% and Latin America volume up 2% in the quarter. 
      Coca-Cola International grew volume 2% in the quarter and 4% year to 
      date, with second quarter Eurasia and Africa volume up 9%, Pacific 
      volume up 2% and Europe volume down 4%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide sparkling beverage volume was even in the quarter and up 2% 
      year to date. Despite unseasonably cold and wet weather and continued 
      volatile macroeconomic conditions in many markets around the world, we 
      grew global volume and value share in sparkling beverages in the 
      quarter, led by marketing campaigns such as &#8220;Share a Coke&#8221; in Europe and 
      &#8220;Coca-Cola Open Summer&#8221; in North America. Worldwide brand Coca-Cola 
      volume grew 1% in the quarter and 2% year to date, with growth in the 
      quarter across diverse markets, including Thailand (+24%), India (+18%), 
      Nigeria (+15%), Russia (+11%), Argentina (+7%) and the Philippines 
      (+7%). The Coca-Cola Company was recognized during the quarter with the 
      2013 Creative Marketer of the Year Award at the Cannes Lions 
      International Festival of Creativity, widely considered to be the 
      world's foremost celebration of creative excellence in brand 
      communications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide still beverage volume grew 6% in both the quarter and year to 
      date, with solid volume and value share growth across beverage 
      categories, including packaged water, juices and juice drinks and 
      ready-to-drink tea. Excluding the impact of acquired volume, primarily 
      the Aujan partnership in the Eurasia and Africa Group, still beverage 
      volume grew 4% in the quarter. Ready-to-drink tea volume grew 10% in the 
      quarter, with continued strong performance of key brands such as Gold 
      Peak and Honest Tea in North America, Ayataka green tea in Japan and 
      Fuze Tea across multiple markets worldwide. Packaged water volume grew 
      6% in the quarter, as we continue to focus on innovative and sustainable 
      packaging and immediate consumption occasions that help drive value 
      share growth ahead of volume share growth. Energy drinks volume grew 5% 
      in the quarter driven by growth across our global portfolio of energy 
      brands. Juices and juice drinks volume grew 4% in the quarter, with 
      growth across all geographic operating groups.

        Our Eurasia and Africa Group's volume grew 9% in the quarter and 11% 
        year to date (up 6% and 9%, respectively, excluding the benefit of 
        acquired volume primarily from the Aujan partnership), cycling 10% 
        growth in the prior year quarter. All business units in the group 
        achieved volume growth in the quarter, led by Middle East and North 
        Africa, up 17% (up 9% excluding the benefit of acquired volume); 
        Central, East and West Africa, up 10%, and Russia, up 3%. Reported net 
        revenues for the quarter increased 5%, reflecting a 7% increase in 
        concentrate sales and positive price/mix of 4%, partially offset by a 
        6% currency headwind. Comparable currency neutral net revenues 
        increased 11% in the quarter. After adjusting for unit case sales 
        without concentrate sales equivalents, concentrate sales in the 
        quarter slightly lagged unit case sales due to timing, but year to 
        date they are in line. Reported operating income increased 12% in the 
        quarter. Comparable currency neutral operating income increased 19% in 
        the quarter, driven by volume, pricing and product mix, as well as 
        efficient expense management, partially offset by continued 
        investments in the business.
      
			
        During the quarter, Eurasia and Africa grew volume and value share in 
        total NARTD beverages. Sparkling beverage volume grew 7% in the 
        quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola, which also grew 7%. This growth was 
        due to a continued focus on driving executional capabilities in the 
        marketplace, greater consumer choice in package and price options, 
        integrated marketing campaigns such as &#8220;Coca-Cola Crazy for Good&#8221; and 
        &#8220;Coke with Meals&#8221;, as well as the expansion of the Coke Studio music 
        competition. Sprite volume grew 6% in the quarter and Fanta volume 
        grew 5% as new campaigns were launched across multiple markets. Still 
        beverage volume grew 15% in the quarter, including the benefit of 
        acquired brands which added eight points of volume growth to overall 
        Eurasia and Africa still beverages. In Russia, key contributors to 
        volume growth in the quarter were brand Coca-Cola, up 11%, Fanta 
        Orange, up 9% and Schweppes, up 31%. We gained volume and value share 
        in total NARTD beverages in Russia, with a strong marketing calendar 
        tied to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and supported in the quarter by 
        our largest-ever consumer promotion in the country offering an 
        under-the-cap points program to redeem for Winter Olympics-themed 
        glassware.

        Our Europe Group's volume declined 4% in the quarter and 2% year to 
        date, cycling a 4% decline in the prior year quarter. Although we grew 
        share, the quarter was marked by particularly poor weather across many 
        countries, including severe flooding in parts of Germany and Central 
        Europe, as well as ongoing weakness in consumer confidence and 
        spending across the region, which have impacted the entire NARTD 
        beverage industry. Reported net revenues declined 1% in the quarter, 
        reflecting a 3% decline in concentrate sales and a 2% currency 
        headwind, partially offset by positive price/mix of 4%. Price/mix 
        includes the benefit of consolidating the innocent juice and smoothie 
        business starting in May 2013. Comparable currency neutral net 
        revenues increased 1% in the quarter. After adjusting for unit case 
        sales without concentrate sales equivalents, concentrate sales in the 
        quarter were in line with unit case sales. Reported operating income 
        declined 7% in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral operating 
        income declined 3% in the quarter, reflecting the decline in volume, 
        partially offset by efficient expense management and the timing of 
        operating expenses.
      
			
        During the quarter, the Europe Group grew volume and value share in 
        total NARTD beverages as well as in sparkling beverages, juices and 
        juice drinks and energy drinks despite continued weak industry trends. 
        In addition, we gained share in ready-to-drink tea. A key marketing 
        campaign launched in markets throughout Europe late in the quarter, 
        titled &#8220;Share a Coke&#8221;, placed the names of individual consumers on our 
        iconic Coca-Cola bottles and cans. To date, the campaign has received 
        positive consumer feedback and it has now been extended and expanded 
        as a result. Although Germany and Northwest Europe and Nordics volume 
        declined low single digits in the quarter, we gained volume and value 
        share in total NARTD beverages as well as in sparkling beverages. The 
        Iberia and Central and Southern Europe regions continue to manage 
        through very tough macroeconomic conditions with ongoing 
        brand-building programs and an occasion-based package, price and 
        channel segmentation strategy.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Latin America
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Latin America Group's volume grew 2% in the quarter and 3% year to 
        date, cycling 3% growth in the prior year quarter. Volume growth in 
        the quarter was led by Latin Center, up 7%, South Latin, up 5% and 
        Mexico, up 1%. Brazil volume was even in the quarter, cycling 6% 
        growth in the prior year quarter and reflecting some consumer 
        uncertainty given the economic slowdown and protests late in the 
        quarter. Reported net revenues for the quarter increased 6%, 
        reflecting concentrate sales growth of 2% and positive price/mix of 
        9%, partially offset by a currency headwind of 5%. Comparable currency 
        neutral net revenues increased 11% in the quarter. Reported operating 
        income was up 6% in the quarter, with comparable currency neutral 
        operating income up 13%, primarily reflecting volume, pricing and 
        product mix, partially offset by increased investments in support of 
        the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and upcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup.
      
			
        During the quarter, the Latin America Group gained share in total 
        NARTD and sparkling beverages as well as both volume and value share 
        in still beverages. This performance was driven by continued 
        activation of brand and category campaigns such as &#8220;Crazy for Good&#8221; 
        and &#8220;140 Calories&#8221;, previously launched in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia 
        and now expanded to Central America, as well as investments in 
        cold-drink equipment and continued segmentation across multiple price 
        points and package sizes. In addition, late in the quarter we launched 
        Coca-Cola Life in Argentina, our first low-calorie cola naturally 
        sweetened with stevia leaf extract and sugar. In the quarter, brand 
        Coca-Cola volume was up 1% and both Sprite and Fanta volumes were up 
        4%. Still beverage volume grew 8% in the quarter, driven by growth in 
        ready-to-drink tea, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and 
        packaged water. We gained both volume and value share in total NARTD 
        beverages across multiple markets, including Mexico, Argentina and 
        Colombia.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			North America
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our North America Group's volume declined 1% in the quarter and was 
        even year to date, cycling 1% growth in the prior year quarter. Volume 
        was under pressure due to unseasonably cold and wet weather and the 
        timing of the Easter and July 4th holiday periods as well 
        as weakened consumer spending that has impacted the overall NARTD 
        beverage industry in North America. Reported and comparable currency 
        neutral net revenues for the quarter declined 1%, reflecting a 1% 
        decline in &#8220;as reported&#8221; volume and even price/mix, including positive 
        1% price/mix for sparkling beverages. Second quarter reported 
        operating income declined 3%. Comparable currency neutral operating 
        income was even in the quarter, reflecting the volume performance and 
        continued investment in our brands as well as the impact of structural 
        changes, offset by efficient management of operating expenses.
      
			
        During the quarter, North America maintained volume share and grew 
        value share in total NARTD beverages as we continued to focus on our 
        core strategies of building strong brands, creating value with 
        customers and enhancing system capabilities. In addition, we gained 
        volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages, with 
        volume and value share gains across every still beverage category 
        except sports drinks. Sparkling beverage volume declined 4% in the 
        quarter with sparkling beverage price/mix growth of 1% and value share 
        growing ahead of volume share, as we remain committed to a rational 
        pricing environment. Still beverage volume grew 5% in the quarter, led 
        by strong performance across both the ready-to-drink tea and packaged 
        water categories with brands such as Gold Peak, smartwater and Dasani 
        leading the way. Further, our volume and value share gains in the 
        juices and juice drinks category were driven by 4% volume growth for 
        Simply and 3% growth for Minute Maid.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pacific
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Pacific Group's volume grew 2% in both the quarter and year to 
        date, cycling 10% growth in the prior year quarter. Reported net 
        revenues for the quarter declined 5%, reflecting 4% concentrate sales 
        growth, offset by a 4% decline in price/mix and a 5% currency 
        headwind. The unfavorable price/mix in the quarter was primarily a 
        result of geographic mix, as we cycled product launches in Japan in 
        the prior year, as well as shifts in product and package mix within 
        individual markets. Comparable currency neutral net revenues were 
        even. Concentrate sales in the quarter were ahead of unit case sales 
        due to timing, primarily in China. For the full year, we expect 
        concentrate sales to be in line with unit case sales. Reported 
        operating income decreased 3% in the quarter, reflecting geographic 
        mix and a 2% currency headwind. In addition, reported operating income 
        reflects a benefit related to structural changes. Comparable currency 
        neutral operating income was even in the quarter.
      
			
        Volume growth in the quarter was wide ranging, with 28% growth in 
        Vietnam, 22% growth in Indonesia, 17% growth in Thailand and 1% growth 
        in both Japan and India. Volume performance was even in both China and 
        the Philippines in the quarter. Sparkling beverage volume growth was 
        even in the quarter, yet brand Coca-Cola grew 3% and Fanta grew 7%. 
        Still beverages grew 4% in the quarter, with 7% growth in packaged 
        water, 5% growth in ready-to-drink tea and 6% growth in sports drinks. 
        Japan's sparkling beverage volume grew 1% in the quarter, supported by 
        music-themed integrated marketing campaigns such as the &#8220;Zero Limit&#8221; 
        campaign for Coca-Cola Zero, up 13%. India volume growth of 1% in the 
        quarter was cycling 20% growth in the prior year quarter and reflects 
        the impact of an earlier and heavier than normal monsoon season in 
        2013 and cycling a later than normal monsoon season in the prior year. 
        Importantly we gained volume and value share in India in the quarter 
        in total NARTD beverages as well as in both sparkling and still 
        beverages. Our second quarter volume performance in China continued to 
        be impacted by the economic slowdown, poor weather and competitive 
        activity such as package upsizing. Despite this, still beverages grew 
        4% in the quarter, driven by juices and juice drinks and packaged 
        water. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2013, we continue to 
        expect the industry and our business to be impacted by China's 
        economic slowdown. However, we are evolving our strategies in China 
        and we anticipate a return to growth in our business in the second 
        half of the year.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bottling Investments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Bottling Investments Group's (BIG) volume grew 1% in the quarter 
        and 2% year to date after adjusting for the net impact of structural 
        changes, primarily the deconsolidation of the Philippine bottling 
        operations in 2013. BIG volume including the impact of structural 
        changes was down 16% in the quarter and 12% year to date. The growth 
        in volume in the quarter after adjusting for the impact of structural 
        changes was led by India, with strong volume and value share gains, as 
        well as markets within BIG's Southeast Asian operations. Reported net 
        revenues for the quarter declined 10%. This reflects the 1% volume 
        growth and positive price/mix of 1%, offset by a currency headwind of 
        1% and an 11% net impact due to structural changes. Comparable 
        currency neutral net revenues declined 10% in the quarter. Reported 
        operating income in the quarter grew 38%. Comparable currency neutral 
        operating income increased 12% in the quarter, reflecting positive 
        pricing and product mix in certain markets, partially offset by 
        continuing investments in our in-market capabilities.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			FINANCIAL REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second quarter reported net revenues declined 3%, with comparable net 
      revenues also down 3%. This reflects a 1% increase in concentrate sales, 
      offset by a 2% impact from structural changes and a 2% currency 
      headwind. The structural changes in the quarter primarily reflect the 
      deconsolidation of the Philippine bottling operations in 2013. We 
      achieved solid pricing across key markets around the world leading to 
      global NARTD value share growth for the 24th consecutive 
      quarter. Price/mix in the quarter was even, as the benefit of positive 
      pricing was offset by geographic mix, and as we cycled positive 3% 
      price/mix in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of structural 
      changes, comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 2% in both the 
      quarter and year to date. We anticipate that the Philippine bottling 
      transaction, together with the bottling transaction in Brazil which 
      closed earlier this month, will reduce our full-year 2013 net revenues 
      by 3%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported and comparable cost of goods sold decreased 5% in the quarter, 
      reflecting a 1% increase in concentrate sales offset by the impact of 
      structural changes, primarily the deconsolidation of the Philippine 
      bottling operations in 2013. Currency reduced comparable cost of goods 
      sold in the quarter by 2%. Excluding the impact of structural changes, 
      comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold was even in the quarter. 
      Items impacting comparability in the quarter primarily included net 
      gains/losses on commodities hedging.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported SGA expenses declined 3% in the quarter and comparable SGA 
      expenses declined 2%. Currency reduced comparable SGA expenses by 1% in 
      the quarter. Excluding the impact of structural changes, comparable 
      currency neutral SGA expenses grew 1% in the quarter, including a 
      strong increase in direct marketing expenses, and we captured two points 
      of operating expense leverage. The structural changes in the quarter 
      primarily reflect the deconsolidation of the Philippine bottling 
      operations in 2013. Operating expense leverage in the quarter was 
      impacted by the reversal of certain expenses related to our long-term 
      incentive plans. A portion of our stock-based compensation is based on 
      multi-year performance periods and includes the impact of currency, 
      which we now estimate will be a headwind of 4% on operating income for 
      the full year versus our expectation at the end of the first quarter of 
      a 2% headwind. We now expect to achieve low single-digit operating 
      expense leverage for the full year after excluding the impact of 
      structural changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second quarter reported operating income decreased 2%. Excluding the 
      impact of structural changes, primarily the deconsolidation of the 
      Philippine bottling operations in 2013, comparable currency neutral 
      operating income grew 4% in the quarter and 5% year to date. Items 
      impacting comparability reduced second quarter 2013 operating income by 
      $175 million and reduced second quarter 2012 operating income by $119 
      million. Currency reduced comparable operating income by 3% in the 
      quarter. Including our hedge positions, current spot rates and the 
      cycling of our prior year rates, we estimate currency will have a
			4% 
      unfavorable impact on comparable operating income for both the third 
      quarter and the full year. Further, we anticipate that the Philippine 
      bottling transaction, together with the bottling transaction in Brazil 
      that closed earlier this month, will have a 1% structural impact on our 
      full-year 2013 operating income, with this decline offset by a 
      corresponding improvement in equity income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Year-to-date net share repurchases totaled $2.0 billion. We are 
      targeting net share repurchases of $3.0 to $3.5 billion for the full 
      year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second quarter reported EPS was $0.59 and comparable EPS was $0.63. 
      Items impacting comparability reduced second quarter 2013 reported EPS 
      by a net $0.04 and had no net impact on second quarter 2012 reported 
      EPS. In both periods, these items included restructuring charges, costs 
      related to global productivity initiatives, transaction gains/losses, 
      net gains/losses related to our economic hedges, primarily commodities, 
      and certain tax matters. Items impacting comparability in second quarter 
      2012 also included charges related to changes in the structure of 
      Beverage Partners Worldwide (BPW) and charges related to the supply of 
      Brazilian orange juice.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Year-to-date cash from operations was $3,956 million, down 5% versus the 
      prior year, primarily due to the impact of two fewer selling days in the 
      period, an unfavorable impact from currency, and an increase in the use 
      of working capital in preparation for the peak season of our growing 
      global business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Effective Tax Rate
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As discussed in the first quarter 2013 earnings release, we had 
      previously estimated that the underlying effective tax rate on 
      operations would be 23.5% for 2013. We now anticipate that the 
      underlying effective tax rate on operations for 2013 will be 23.0%. We 
      expect this rate to remain unchanged through 2014. We are required to 
      record income tax expense for the first six months of the year based on 
      the estimated underlying effective tax rate for the full year. To bring 
      the effective tax rate for the first six months of 2013 in line with the 
      current estimated full year underlying effective tax rate, we recorded 
      income tax expense at an underlying effective tax rate of 22.6% for the 
      second quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%. The variance 
      between the reported rate and the underlying rate was due to the tax 
      effect of various items impacting comparability, separately disclosed in 
      this document in the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial 
      Measures schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of 
      significant or unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when 
      they occur, are separately recognized in the appropriate period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Items Impacting Prior Year Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First quarter 2012 results included a net gain of $0.01 per share due to 
      gains related to equity investees, partially offset by restructuring 
      charges, costs related to global productivity initiatives, charges 
      related to changes in the structure of BPW and charges related to the 
      supply of Brazilian orange juice.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Items impacting results had no net effect on second quarter 2012 
      reported EPS. These items included a transaction gain and certain tax 
      matters, offset by restructuring charges, costs related to global 
      productivity initiatives, charges related to changes in the structure of 
      BPW and charges related to the supply of Brazilian orange juice.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			NOTES
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        All references to growth rate percentages, share and cycling of growth 
        rates compare the results of the period to those of the prior year 
        comparable period.
      
			
        &#8220;Concentrate sales&#8221; represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, 
        beverage bases and powders sold by, or used in finished beverages sold 
        by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers.
      
			
        &#8220;Sparkling beverages&#8221; means NARTD beverages with carbonation, 
        including energy drinks and carbonated waters and flavored waters.
      
			
        &#8220;Still beverages&#8221; means nonalcoholic beverages without carbonation, 
        including noncarbonated waters, flavored waters and enhanced waters, 
        juices and juice drinks, teas, coffees, sports drinks and 
        noncarbonated energy drinks.
      
			
        All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit 
        case volume, except for the reference to volume included in the 
        explanation of net revenue growth for North America. All volume 
        percentage changes, unless otherwise noted, are computed based on 
        average daily sales. &#8220;Unit case&#8221; means a unit of measurement equal to 
        24 eight-ounce servings of finished beverage. &#8220;Unit case volume&#8221; means 
        the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company 
        beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling 
        partners to customers.
      
			
        For both North America and Bottling Investments Group, net revenue 
        growth attributable to volume reflects the percentage change in &#8220;as 
        reported&#8221; volume, which is based on as reported sales rather than 
        average daily sales and includes the impact of structural changes, 
        where applicable. For North America, this volume represents Coca-Cola 
        Refreshments' unit case sales (which are equivalent to concentrate 
        sales) plus concentrate sales to non-Company-owned bottling operations.
      
			
        Year-to-date 2013 financial results were impacted by two fewer selling 
        days, and fourth quarter 2013 financial results will be impacted by 
        one additional selling day. Unit case volume results for the quarters 
        are not impacted by the variance in selling days due to the average 
        daily sales computation referenced above.
      
			
        In January 2012, the Company announced that Beverage Partners 
        Worldwide (BPW), our joint venture with Nestl&#233; in the ready-to-drink 
        tea category, will focus its geographic scope primarily in Europe and 
        Canada. The joint venture was phased out in all other territories by 
        the end of 2012, and the Company's agreement to distribute products in 
        the United States terminated at the end of 2012. We have eliminated 
        the BPW and Nestl&#233; licensed volume and associated concentrate sales 
        for the year ended December 31, 2012 in those countries impacted by 
        these structural changes.
      
			
        As previously announced, effective January 1, 2013, the Company 
        transferred our India and South West Asia business unit from the 
        Eurasia and Africa operating segment to the Pacific operating segment. 
        The countries included in our India and South West Asia business unit 
        are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. This 
        change in organizational structure did not impact the other geographic 
        operating segments, Bottling Investments or Corporate. The 
        reclassified historical operating segment data reflecting the change 
        in organizational structure was disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the 
        U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 21, 2013.
      
			
        The Company reports its financial results in accordance with 
        accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). 
        However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures 
        provide users with additional meaningful financial information that 
        should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. 
        Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making 
        financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the 
        Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in 
        addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported 
        results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial 
        information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.

      During the three months ended June&#160;28, 2013, the results of our

        Intersegment revenues were $175 million for Europe, $76 million for 
        Latin America, $5 million for North America, $157 million for Pacific 
        and $20 million for Bottling Investments.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $6 million for Europe, $55 million for North America, 
        $6&#160;million for Pacific, $20 million for Bottling Investments and $46 
        million for Corporate due to charges related to the Company's 
        productivity and reinvestment program as well as other restructuring 
        initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income 
        taxes were increased by $1 million for Pacific and $1 million for 
        Corporate due to the refinement of previously established accruals 
        related to the Company's 2008&#8211;2011 productivity initiatives.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $6 million for Corporate due to transaction costs 
        associated with certain of the Company's bottling partners.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $144 million for 
        Corporate due to charges related to the pending merger of four of the 
        Company's Japanese bottling partners.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $139 million for 
        Corporate due to a gain the Company recognized as a result of 
        Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Coca-Cola FEMSA") issuing additional 
        shares of its own stock during the period at a per share amount 
        greater than the carrying value of the Company's per share investment.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $23 million for 
        Corporate due to a charge the Company recognized on the early 
        extinguishment of certain long-term debt.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by a net $3 million for 
        Bottling Investments due to the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of 
        unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method

      During the six months ended June&#160;28, 2013, the results of our operating 
      segments were impacted by the following items:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Intersegment revenues were $332 million for Europe, $147 million for 
        Latin America, $9 million for North America, $303 million for Pacific 
        and $40 million for Bottling Investments.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $2 million for Eurasia and Africa, $6 million for Europe, 
        $137 million for North America, $14 million for Pacific, $41 million 
        for Bottling Investments and $56 million for Corporate due to charges 
        related to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program as well 
        as other restructuring initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income 
        (loss) before income taxes were increased by $1 million for Pacific 
        and $1 million for Corporate due to the refinement of previously 
        established accruals related to the Company's 2008&#8211;2011 productivity 
        initiatives.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        increased by $3 million for North America due to the refinement of 
        previously established accruals related to the loss or damage of 
        certain fixed assets as a result of Hurricane Sandy.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $7 million for Corporate due to transaction costs 
        associated with certain of the Company's bottling partners.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $9 million for 
        Bottling Investments and $140 million for Corporate due to the 
        devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, including our proportionate 
        share of the charge incurred by an equity method investee which has 
        operations in Venezuela.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $144 million for 
        Corporate due to charges related to the pending merger of four of the 
        Company's Japanese bottling partners.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $139 million for 
        Corporate due to a gain the Company recognized as a result of 
        Coca-Cola FEMSA issuing additional shares of its own stock during the 
        period at a per share amount greater than the carrying value of the 
        Company's per share investment.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by a net $33 million for 
        Bottling Investments due to the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of 
        unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method 
        investees.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $23 million for 
        Corporate due to a charge the Company recognized on the early 
        extinguishment of certain long-term debt.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $1 million for 
        Corporate due to an adjustment to the Company's loss on the sale of a 
        controlling ownership interest in our previously consolidated 
        Philippine bottling operations to Coca-Cola FEMSA.

        Intersegment revenues were $323 million for Europe, $121 million for

        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $109 million for North America, $31 million for Bottling 
        Investments and $8 million for Corporate due to charges related to the

        before income taxes were increased by $3&#160;million for Europe due to the 
        refinement of previously established accruals related to the Company's 
        2008&#8211;2011 productivity initiatives.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $20 million for North America due to changes in the 
        Company's ready-to-drink tea strategy as a result of our U.S. license 
        agreement with Nestl&#233; terminating at the end of 2012.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $12 million for North America due to costs associated with 
        the Company detecting residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not 
        registered in the U.S. for use on citrus products, in orange juice 
        imported from Brazil for distribution in the U.S.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $92 million for 
        Corporate due to a gain the Company recognized as a result of

		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting 
      principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or referred 
      to herein as "reported"). However, management believes that certain 
      non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful 
      financial information that should be considered when assessing our 
      ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial 
      measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in 
      evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should 
      be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company&#8217;s 
      reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP 
      financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of 
      accounting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following information is provided to give qualitative and 
      quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items 
      impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, 
      our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly 
      titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to 
      consider as "items impacting comparability" based on how management 
      views our business; makes financial, operating and planning decisions; 
      and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, 
      gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting 
      only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as 
      relating to different and unrelated underlying activities or events 
      across comparable periods, are generally considered "items impacting 
      comparability". In addition, we provide the impact that changes in 
      foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results ("currency 
      neutral") as well as the impact of structural changes on our financial 
      results.

			Restructuring
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and six months ended June&#160;28, 2013, the Company 
      recorded charges of $20&#160;million and $41 million, respectively. The 
      Company also recorded charges of $15&#160;million and $30 million during the 
      three and six months ended June&#160;29, 2012, respectively. These charges 
      were related to the integration of our German bottling and distribution 
      operations as well as other restructuring initiatives outside the scope 
      of the Company's productivity and reinvestment program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Productivity and Reinvestment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and six months ended June&#160;28, 2013, the Company 
      recorded charges of $113&#160;million and $215&#160;million, respectively. The 
      Company also recorded charges of $54 million and $118 million during the 
      three and six months ended June&#160;29, 2012, respectively. These charges 
      were related to our productivity and reinvestment program. This program 
      is designed to further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and 
      reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth. The first 
      component of this program is a global productivity initiative focused 
      around four primary areas: global supply chain optimization; global 
      marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and 
      operational excellence; and data and information technology systems 
      standardization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second component of our productivity and reinvestment program 
      involves a new integration initiative in North America related to our 
      acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises' former North America business. The 
      Company has identified incremental synergies in North America, primarily 
      in the area of our North American product supply operations, which will 
      enable us to better serve our customers and consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a combined productivity and reinvestment program, the Company 
      anticipates generating annualized savings of $550&#160;million to 
      $650&#160;million which will be phased in over time. We expect to begin fully 
      realizing the annual benefits of these savings in 2015, the final year 
      of the program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Productivity Initiatives
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and six months ended June&#160;28, 2013, the Company 
      reversed charges of $2 million. During the three and six months ended 
      June&#160;29, 2012, the Company reversed charges of $2&#160;million and $3 
      million, respectively. These reversals were related to previously 
      established accruals associated with our 2008&#8211;2011 productivity 
      initiatives. These initiatives were focused on providing additional 
      flexibility to invest for growth and impacted a number of areas, 
      including aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean 
      techniques; redesigning key processes to drive standardization and 
      effectiveness; better leveraging our size and scale; and driving savings 
      in indirect costs.

			Equity Investees
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and six months ended June&#160;28, 2013, the Company 
      recorded net charges of $3 million and $33 million, respectively. During 
      the three and six months ended June&#160;29, 2012, the Company recorded net 
      charges of $1&#160;million and net gains of $43&#160;million, respectively. These 
      amounts represent the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of unusual or 
      infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Transaction Gains/Losses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2012, four of the Company's Japanese bottling partners announced 
      their intent to merge as Coca-Cola East Japan Bottling Company, Ltd. 
      ("CCEJ"), a publicly traded entity, through a share exchange. The merger 
      was approved by the respective bottlers' shareowners in March 2013, and 
      the transaction received final regulatory approval in May 2013. The 
      terms of the merger agreement include the issuance of new shares of one 
      of the publicly traded bottlers in exchange for 100 percent of the 
      outstanding shares of the remaining three bottlers according to an 
      agreed upon share exchange ratio. Based on the closing price of the 
      shares on June 28, 2013, the value of the shares that the Company will 
      receive in exchange for its investments in two of the non-publicly 
      traded bottlers was less than the carrying value of those investments. 
      As a result, we were required to write down the carrying value of these 
      investments to their implied fair value, resulting in a loss of $144 
      million during the three and six months ended June&#160;28, 2013. The merger 
      was completed effective July&#160;1, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and six months ended June&#160;28, 2013, the Company also 
      recorded charges of $6 million due to transaction costs associated with 
      certain of our bottling partners and a gain of $139 million due to 
      Coca-Cola FEMSA issuing additional shares of its own stock during the 
      period at a per share amount greater than the carrying value of the 
      Company's per share investment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the items above, during the six months ended June&#160;28, 
      2013, the Company recorded an additional charge of $1 million related to 
      transaction costs associated with certain of our bottling partners and a 
      benefit of $1 million due to an adjustment to the Company's loss on the 
      sale of a majority interest in our previously consolidated Philippine 
      bottling operations to Coca-Cola FEMSA in January 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and six months ended June&#160;29, 2012, the Company 
      recognized a gain of $92 million due to Coca-Cola FEMSA issuing 
      additional shares of its own stock during the period at a per share 
      amount greater than the carrying value of the Company's per share 
      investment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Certain Tax Matters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended June&#160;28, 2013, the Company recorded a net 
      tax benefit of $1&#160;million related to amounts required to be recorded for 
      changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and six months ended June&#160;29, 2012, the Company 
      recorded a net tax benefit of $25 million and $33&#160;million, respectively. 
      These benefits were primarily related to the reversal of certain 
      valuation allowances, partially offset by amounts required to be 
      recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest 
      and penalties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Other Items
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Impact of Natural Disasters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused widespread flooding and wind 
      damage across the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, primarily in 
      New York and New Jersey. During the six months ended June&#160;28, 2013, the 
      Company reversed charges of $3 million due to the refinement of 
      previously established accruals related to the loss or damage of certain 
      fixed assets resulting from the hurricane.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Economic (Nondesignated) Hedges
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company uses derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price 
      risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing 
      process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these 
      derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge 
      accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair 
      values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for 
      outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our 
      non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying 
      exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of 
      income. We believe this adjustment provides meaningful information 
      related to the benefits of our economic hedging activities. During the 
      three months ended June&#160;28, 2013, and June&#160;29, 2012, the net impact of 
      the Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities 
      described above resulted in an increase to our non-GAAP operating income 
      of $38&#160;million and $46&#160;million, respectively. During the six months 
      ended June&#160;28, 2013, and June&#160;29, 2012, the net impact of the Company's 
      adjustment related to our economic hedging activities described above 
      resulted in an increase of $120 million and a decrease of $3 million, 
      respectively, to our non-GAAP operating income.

			Early Extinguishment of Long-Term Debt
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and six months ended June&#160;28, 2013, the Company 
      recorded a charge of $23 million due to the early extinguishment of 
      certain long-term debt.

			Hyperinflationary Economies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the six months ended June&#160;28, 2013, the Company recorded a charge 
      of $149 million related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, 
      including our proportionate share of the charge incurred by an equity 
      method investee which has operations in Venezuela.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Beverage Partners Worldwide and License Agreement with Nestl&#233; S.A.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and six months ended June&#160;29, 2012, the Company 
      recorded charges of $11 million and $14 million, respectively, due to 
      changes in the structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide ("BPW"), our 
      50/50 joint venture with Nestl&#233; S.A. ("Nestl&#233;") in the ready-to-drink 
      tea category. In addition, during the six months ended June&#160;29, 2012, 
      the Company recorded charges of $20&#160;million due to changes in our 
      ready-to-drink tea strategy as a result of our U.S. license agreement 
      with Nestl&#233; terminating at the end of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Brazilian Orange Juice
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In December 2011, the Company learned that orange juice being imported 
      from Brazil contained residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not 
      registered in the U.S. for use on citrus products. As a result, the 
      Company began purchasing additional supplies of Florida orange juice at 
      a higher cost than Brazilian orange juice. During the three and six 
      months ended June&#160;29, 2012, the Company incurred charges of $6&#160;million 
      and $12 million, respectively, related to these events, including the 
      increased raw material costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Currency Neutral
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management evaluates the operating performance of our Company and our 
      international subsidiaries on a currency neutral basis. We determine our 
      currency neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as 
      appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results by 
      the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of 
      current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current 
      period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as 
      appropriate, the derived current period local currency operating results 
      by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of 
      the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to 
      translate the Company's financial statements in the comparable prior 
      year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating

			Structural Changes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Structural changes generally refer to acquisitions or dispositions of 
      bottling, distribution or canning operations and consolidation or 
      deconsolidation of bottling and distribution entities for accounting 
      purposes. In 2012, the Company acquired bottling operations in Vietnam, 
      Cambodia and Guatemala. In 2013, the Company acquired bottling 
      operations in Myanmar and sold a majority interest in our previously 
      consolidated Philippine bottling operations. Accordingly, these 
      acquisition and disposal activities have been included as structural 
      items in our analysis of the impact of these changes on certain line 
      items in our condensed consolidated statements of income.

&lt;p&gt;* Consumer prices and industrial production data on tap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Goldman Sachs to report earnings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Futures up: S 0.8 pt, Dow 9 pts, Nasdaq 1.75 pts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were
little changed on Tuesday ahead of data on inflation and
industrial production, and corporate earnings from major firms
like Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Economic data on consumer prices, industrial production
and housing comes a day ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke's semi-annual testimony before the House of
Representatives Financial Services Committee. Markets will be
closely eyeing his comments for clues on when the Fed may start
reducing its bond-buying program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Consumer price data for June is scheduled for 8:30 a.m.
EDT (1230 GMT) and the industrial production data is on tap for
9:15 a.m. EDT. The National Association of Home Builders housing
market index for July is due at 10:00 a.m. EDT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Goldman Sachs shares are likely to be in the
spotlight with the bank's earnings due ahead of the bell, and
especially after Citigroup's strong earnings on Monday that
helped the S 500 higher for an eighth straight day, which was
the longest streak since mid-January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Other companies due to report earnings include Yahoo
 and Johnson &amp; Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S 500 futures rose 0.8 point and were in line
with fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 9
points, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 1.75 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* European stock markets fell after the ZEW German economic
sentiment indicator unexpectedly declined in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays (BARC.L) has poached JP Morgan (JPM.N) executive Tushar Morzaria to become its new finance director from February, offering up to 6 million pounds ($9.1 million) in annual pay and awards to help its recovery from a series of scandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ends a lengthy search for a finance director, after Barclays said in February Chris Lucas would step down after six years in the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morzaria is currently chief financial officer of corporate and investment banking at JP Morgan Chase, where he has spent the majority of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morzaria, 44, was born in Uganda and moved to Britain in 1971. The British citizen is a qualified chartered accountant who has worked for JP Morgan in London and New York and previously held finance roles at Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) and SG Warburg (UBSN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will be paid a salary of 800,000 pounds and can earn an annual bonus of up to 2 million pounds and a long-term share award of up to 3.2 million. The long-term award would only start paying out in five years' time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morzaria is expected to begin work at Barclays this autumn but there will be a lengthy handover period. He will join the board at the start of next year and take over as finance director when Lucas retires at the end of February.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) raised its full-year outlook on Wednesday based on cost cutting and a strong software pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machine Corp beat second-quarter earnings estimates thanks to growth in its mainframe and software units, but missed on revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the first half, we've had strength in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa region, but declines in some of our larger markets like China and Australia have impacted the overall performance," Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we look at the second half," he said, "we have some very, very distinct tailwinds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added IBM had the best services backlog growth in four years and a very strong software pipeline going into the second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares, which had been up after-hours nearly 3 percent, gave about half of that back to end all of Wednesday's New York trade up 1.25 percent at $197.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said that excluding a $1 billion restructuring charge related to job cuts, it raised its non-GAAP earnings per share expectations for this year by 20 cents to at least $16.90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts were taken mainly outside of the United States, a spokesman said, adding about 60 percent were from IBM's services division and 20 percent each from its hardware and software segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also said that a "substantial second-half gain" it was expecting from a divestiture in its previous EPS outlook "will not likely be achieved" by the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge did not give details apart from saying that the company was still in active discussions and that it would not sell too low or rush into a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, he said, "fundamentally, whether we close a large divestiture this year or not, we'll not have any effect on our ability to achieve our 2015 objective of at least $20 per share on an all-in basis".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the year news of talks between IBM and Lenovo over the sale of IBM's System X server business surfaced but were not confirmed by the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Marshall, an analyst at ISI Group, said the sale "is perhaps the last significant opportunity to optimize gross margins of the IBM product portfolio".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He estimated it could fetch $2 billion to $3 billion in a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total operating non-GAAP gross profit margin was 49.7 percent in the 2013 second quarter compared with 48.2 percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, N.Y.-based company said its quarterly non-GAAP income rose 3 percent, excluding a $1 billion restructuring charge, to $4.3 billion, or $3.91 a share, compared with $3.51 a year ago and analyst estimates of $3.77 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $2.91, down 13 percent; net income was $3.2 billion, down 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue dropped 3 percent to $24.9 billion below average analyst expectations of $25.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted for currency, software revenue was up 5 percent and its mainframe revenue rose 11 percent in the quarter.

&lt;p&gt;* Job cuts mainly outside the United States&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Shares trade higher after hours&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nicola Leske&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 17 (Reuters) - IBM raised its full-year outlook
on Wednesday based on cost cutting and a strong software
pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machine Corp beat second-quarter

percent, gave about half of that back to end all of Wednesday's
New York trade up 1.25 percent at $197.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said that excluding a $1 billion restructuring charge
related to job cuts, it raised its non-GAAP earnings per share
expectations for this year by 20 cents to at least $16.90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts were taken mainly outside of the United States, a
spokesman said, adding about 60 percent were from IBM's services
division and 20 percent each from its hardware and software
segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also said that a "substantial second-half gain" it was
expecting from a divestiture in its previous EPS outlook "will
not likely be achieved" by the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge did not give details apart from saying that the
company was still in active discussions and that it would not
sell too low or rush into a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, he said, "fundamentally, whether we close a
large divestiture this year or not, we'll not have any effect on
our ability to achieve our 2015 objective of at least $20 per
share on an all-in basis".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the year news of talks between IBM and Lenovo
over the sale of IBM's System X server business surfaced but
were not confirmed by the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Marshall, an analyst at ISI Group, said the sale "is
perhaps the last significant opportunity to optimize gross
margins of the IBM product portfolio".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He estimated it could fetch $2 billion to $3 billion in a
sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total operating non-GAAP gross profit margin was 49.7
percent in the 2013 second quarter compared with 48.2 percent a
year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, N.Y.-based company said its quarterly non-GAAP
income rose 3 percent, excluding a $1 billion restructuring
charge, to $4.3 billion, or $3.91 a share, compared with $3.51 a
year ago and analyst estimates of $3.77 a share, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $2.91, down 13

analyst expectations of $25.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted for currency, software revenue was up 5 percent and
its mainframe revenue rose 11 percent in the quarter. Currency
negatively impacted overall revenue growth by about $500
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge said he expected a continued negative impact from
currency through the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several brokerages had cut their price targets for IBM in
the past weeks on concerns over revenue growth and recent weaker
performance by competitors Oracle and Accenture
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the results were better than expected,
especially after IBM posted a rare miss in its first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After a first half that showed muted demand at best, you
have a 20 cent raise excluding the workforce rebalancing, what
is implied you are going to have strength in the higher margin
software and services," said Edward Jones tech analyst Josh
Olson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research, said IBM's
strength in software demonstrated that its "strategic shift to
focus on software is paying dividends".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the broader tech market perspective, software overall
will continue to be one of the strongest tech segments in 2013,"
he added.&lt;/p&gt;

A copy of Rakoff's order was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, serving an 11-year prison term, was the highest-ranking financial executive convicted in a multi-year federal crackdown on insider trading. Gupta is the highest-ranking corporate executive convicted in that probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the federal appeals court in New York upheld Rajaratnam's conviction, rejecting his argument that wiretap evidence was used improperly to convict him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta in May argued before the same court that wiretap evidence should have been excluded from his trial as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one such call, just before Berkshire's investment was announced, Rajaratnam was heard telling a trader that a caller had told him that "something good might happen to Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta's criminal sanctions also included a $5 million fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC in 2011 won a $92.8 million civil penalty against Rajaratnam, then a record for an SEC insider trading case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gupta case is SEC v.

copy of Rakoff's order was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, serving an 11-year prison term, was the
highest-ranking financial executive convicted in a multi-year
federal crackdown on insider trading. Gupta is the
highest-ranking corporate executive convicted in that probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the federal appeals court in New York upheld
Rajaratnam's conviction, rejecting his argument that wiretap
evidence was used improperly to convict him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta in May argued before the same court that wiretap
evidence should have been excluded from his trial as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one such call, just before Berkshire's investment was
announced, Rajaratnam was heard telling a trader that a caller
had told him that "something good might happen to Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta's criminal sanctions also included a $5 million fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC in 2011 won a $92.8 million civil penalty against
Rajaratnam, then a record for an SEC insider trading case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gupta case is SEC v. Gupta, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York, No. 11-07566.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 17 (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
Director Rajat Gupta was ordered to pay a $13.9 million penalty
and banned from serving as an officer or director of a public
company for having illegally passed corporate secrets to former
hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, a top U.S. regulator said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the order
was issued earlier in the day by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff
in Manhattan, who also oversaw Gupta's related criminal trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta is appealing his June 2012 conviction and two-year
prison term for having fed confidential information he learned
at Goldman board meetings to Rajaratnam, a former billionaire
who ran Galleon Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Gupta was not immediately available for

&lt;p&gt;July 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) are close to reaching a settlement that could
result in the bank paying the largest penalty ever over allegations of power
market manipulation in California and the Midwest, the Wall Street Journal
reported on Wednesday.
    The amount to be paid is not yet known, but past discussions have involved
close to $1 billion, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter.
 

JPMORGAN POWER TRADING TIMELINE
2005 - FERC authorizes JPMorgan to sell power at market based rates, starting
its trading in U.S. power markets.

2008-2010 - JPMorgan acquires a number of power plants and electricity tolling
agreements through its purchase of Bear Stearns and RBS Sempra during the
financial crisis.

March 2011 - Grid operator California ISO filed with national regulator FERC to
fix a loophole in the power market bidding process after a party's behavior
"aggravated the market impact of the flaw." That party was later identified as
JPMorgan.

March 2011 - California ISO informs JPMorgan the grid operator reviewed the
bank's bidding activities and intends to refer the matter to the FERC Office of
Enforcement, marking the start of FERC's investigation.
    
April 2011 - After California ISO asked FERC to close a loophole that allowed
traders to engage in exploitative power bidding practices, the state grid
operator said a trader, later identified as JPMorgan, started to immediately
exploit another loophole in their rules.

April 2011 - California ISO forces power sellers to reimburse $35.3 million to
electricity distributors from trades executed from August 2010 to March 2011 due
to effect of exploitive bidding practices.

Feb-June 2012 - California ISO imposes a non-public $486,000 penalty against
JPMorgan in February for failing to submit all information the grid operator
sought as part of its investigation into exploitative bidding practices. FERC
rejects the bank's appeal of the penalty.

June 2012 - Grid operator California ISO asks FERC to approve its plan to force
power sellers to reimburse money earned from exploitive bidding practices to
electricity distributors from April 2009 to March 2011. The ISO had already
forced power sellers to reimburse $35.3 million in April 2011 for the period
between August 2010 and March 2011.

July 2012 - FERC subpoenas JPMorgan in federal court to provide emails as part
of its investigation into market manipulation in California and the Midwest, the
first time the bank has been publicly named as the party that allegedly
manipulated the California market. 

November 2012 - FERC suspends JPMorgan's authority to sell power at market based
rates for six months for making factual misrepresentations during an
investigation into market manipulation. The ban is to start in April 2013.
 
    
April 2013 - JPMorgan six-month ban on selling power at market based rates
begins.

May 2013 - An internal FERC document leaked to the New York Times says the
regulator may charge JPMorgan with power market manipulation. The document also
says JPMorgan's commodities chief, Blythe Masters, may have made "false and
misleading statements," to the regulator under oath. 

May 2013 - JPMorgan tells shareholders FERC may take action against bank for
certain power market bidding activities. (ID:nL2N0DP33K]

May 2013 - JPMorgan reduces presence in California power market, selling the
right to market electricity from three power plants. 

June 2013 - FERC approves a request from California ISO to force JPMorgan and
other traders to reimburse $16.7 million to electricity distributors in the
state for disruptive bidding practices between April 2009 and March 2011.

&lt;p&gt;July 17 (Reuters) - IBM, the world's largest
technology services company, reported second-quarter earnings
per share that beat estimates. Its shares were up nearly 3
percent in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said on Wednesday its
quarterly non-GAAP income rose 3 percent, excluding a $1 billion

compared with $3.51 a year ago and analyst estimates of $3.77 a

&lt;p&gt;July 17 (Reuters) - The following is a list of U.S. power plants JPMorgan
Chase and Co have an interest in, according to the bank's filing with
U.S. federal energy regulators in June 2012.
    JPMorgan officials have refused to talk about the plants they currently have
an interest in for competitive reasons. Some of the plants are owned by units of
JPMorgan, while others are under "tolling" agreements under which the bank
supplies fuel and sells power on behalf of the plant's owner.
    In May, JPMorgan sold the rights to market electricity from three power
plants in California to a unit of Edison International. 
    In total, JPMorgan controls about 8,000 megawatts of electricity generation,
enough to power about 8 million homes.

      IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced second-quarter 2013 diluted earnings of 
      $2.91 per share, compared with diluted earnings of $3.34 per share in 
      the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of 13 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $3.22 per share, including workforce 
      rebalancing charges, compared with operating diluted earnings of $3.51 
      per share in the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of 8 percent. 
      Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share were $3.91, an increase 
      of 8 percent, excluding the impact of workforce rebalancing charges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second-quarter net income was $3.2 billion compared with $3.9 billion in 
      the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of 17 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) net income was $3.6 billion, including workforce rebalancing

      percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues for the second quarter of 2013 of $24.9 billion were down 
      3 percent (down 1 percent, adjusting for currency) from the second 
      quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the second quarter, we delivered strong performance in our

		&lt;p&gt;
      Second-quarter operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $0.31 per 
      share of charges: $0.15 per share for the amortization of purchased 
      intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and $0.16 per

      and liabilities primarily related to market performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Full-Year 2013 Expectations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company said that a substantial second-half gain that it was 
      expecting in its prior view of earnings per share will not likely be 
      achieved the end of 2013. As a result, the company updated its prior 
      full-year EPS expectations, including the impact of a second-quarter $1 
      billion workforce rebalancing charge, to at least $16.25, with the net 
      impact of $0.45 driven by the elongated discussions for its larger 
      divestiture project. IBM&#8217;s full-year 2013 EPS expectations are as 
      follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full-year GAAP diluted earnings per share expectations are at least 
      $15.08. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share expectations are 
      being raised to at least $16.90, excluding the second-quarter $1 billion 
      workforce rebalancing charge. Operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share 
      expectations are at least $16.25, including the second-quarter $1 
      billion workforce rebalancing charge.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2013 operating (non-GAAP) earnings expectations exclude $1.17 per 
      share of charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets, other 
      acquisition-related charges, and retirement-related charges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Geographic Regions

      The Americas&#8217; second-quarter revenues were $10.7 billion, a decrease of 
      3 percent (down 3 percent, adjusting for currency) from the 2012 period. 
      Revenues from Europe/Middle East/Africa were flat at $7.8 billion (down 
      1 percent adjusting for currency). Asia-Pacific revenues decreased 8 
      percent (flat, adjusting for currency) to $5.8 billion. OEM revenues 
      were $538 million, up 5 percent (up 6 percent adjusting for currency) 
      compared with the 2012 second quarter.

      Fitch Downgrades 2 Below-Investment-Grade Classes of JPMCC 2005 - LDP2
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded two and affirmed 21 classes of J.P. Morgan 
      Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp.'s commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates, series 2005-LDP2. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are due to increased credit enhancement from 
      significant paydowns and stable performance of the pool. The downgrades 
      reflect the increase in losses from the specially serviced loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 8.5% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 4.9%, including $126.2 million (4.2% of 
      the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has 
      designated 45 loans (26.5%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 17 
      specially serviced loans (15.9%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the June 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 42.1% to $1.7 billion from $2.9 billion at 
      issuance. Fifteen loans (7.3%) are currently defeased. Interest 
      shortfalls are affecting classes J, K and N through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to Fitch-modeled losses is secured by an 898,564 
      square foot (sf) mixed-use development consisting of five office 
      buildings, a mixed-use building, and a retail building located in Creve 
      Coeur, MO (6.6%). The loan was transferred to special servicing in April 
      2012 for maturity default. The special servicer is in discussions with 
      the borrower. Occupancy is currently at 91%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second-largest contributor to Fitch-modeled losses is secured by a 
      236,961 sf office plaza located in Piscataway, NJ (1.6%). The special 
      servicer is in discussions with the borrower regarding a possible 
      restructure, as the loan suffers from cash flow issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third-largest contributor to Fitch-modeled losses is two office 
      properties located in Atlanta, GA and Southfield, MI (2%). The loan 
      transferred to special servicing in March 2011 for imminent default. The 
      Atlanta property became real-estate owned (REO) in June 2012 and the 
      Michigan property in January 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings on the class A-1A through A-J notes are expected to be 
      stable as the credit enhancement remains high. Classes B through E may 
      be subject to further downgrades should losses be greater than expected.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has downgraded the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$26.1 million class G to 'CCsf' from 'CCCsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$44.7 million class H to 'Csf' from 'CCCsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch has affirmed the following classes and revised Outlooks as 
      indicated:

      Fitch: Agreement with Chevron Credit Neutral to YPF's Ratings
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The recent agreement between YPF S.A. and Chevron Corporation is credit 
      neutral to YPF's ratings, according to Fitch Ratings. YPF's current 
      foreign and local currency ratings are 'B-', and its national scale 
      rating is 'AA(arg)'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On July 16, 2013, YPF announced a Project Investment Agreement with 
      Chevron to develop unconventional hydrocarbon resources in the province 
      of Neuquen in an area that includes Loma La Lata Norte and Loma Campana. 
      Chevron is initially committed to invest USD1240 million to drill more 
      than 100 wells in one year. The joint investment is estimated in USD1.5 
      billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the initial phase, the agreement with Chevron is not expected to 
      pressure to YPF's cash flow as the majority of the investment will be 
      financed by Chevron. The project is expected to benefit from the 
      incentives included in the Decree 929/2013 that was published on July 
      15, 2013. (Please see the comment 'Argentina: New Oil and Gas Sector 
      Incentives Are Insufficient to Attract Massive Investment' published 
      today for additional information). As a result, a condition for Chevron 
      to make an initial investment of USD300 million, is that the project is 
      granted a new concession over its specific area for a 35-year period. 
      The province of Nequen will be responsible for granting such concession. 
      During a second phase each party will invest 50% each. Fitch will assess 
      the impact on YPF of the second stage of the investment in Neuquen when 
      there is public information available on the amount of the investment, 
      capex program, the financing resources and reserves and production 
      profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      YPF's international rating is rated at the same level as Argentina's 
      local currency, following the government's expropriation of Repsol's 51% 
      controlling stake in April 2012. The government ownership generates 
      uncertainty over the company's future efficiency and profitability, as 
      state-owned entities tend to incorporate more social considerations into 
      their business strategy. YPF's ratings reflect the company's government 
      ownership and decreasing reserves and production volumes. YPF benefits 
      from a strong market position and its business integration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of December 2012, YPF had weak operating metrics reflected in the 
      company reporting 5.5 years of reserves, which is well below Fitch's 
      optimal level of 10 years. In 2012, YPF's one-year reserve replacement 
      (RRR) decreased to 85% from 113% in 2011 but, positively, its production 
      remained stable at approximately 485 thousand barrels of oil equivalent 
      (boe) per day as of March 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      YPF's leverage is low at USD/boe 3.4 as of December 2012, although it 
      has grown from USD/boe 2.6 in 2011. Total debt has increased to USD 3620 
      as of March 2013 from USD 1965 in 2011, but the company's debt maturity 
      profile has improved. Short-term debt has decreased to 25% over total 
      debt (USD 894 million) from 60% over total debt (USD 1884 million in 
      2011), mitigating refinancing risk. As of March 213, YPF's cash position 
      was US$843 million.

      In celebration of Disneyland&#8217;s 58th anniversary today, D23: The Official 
      Disney Fan Club has launched the &#8220;Off the Map Sweepstakes.&#8221; Twenty-five 
      lucky D23 Members and their guests will be invited to Disneyland Park to 
      visit four of the park&#8217;s little-seen but widely heard of locations: Walt 
      Disney&#8217;s private apartment, the Lilly Belle VIP parlor car on the Disneyland 
      Railroad, Circle D Ranch, and the Disneyland Dream Suite.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our friends at Disneyland will give the winning D23 Members a special 
      glimpse at some of the park&#8217;s most amazing hidden gems, special places 
      that most guests never get to see,&#8221; said Steven Clark, Head of D23. &#8220;Our 
      first &#8216;Off the Map&#8217; member event in 2012 was such a huge hit that we 
      wanted to reprise it with this special sweepstakes so even more of our 
      members have a chance to visit these truly magical and historical 
      Disneyland locations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Winners will be able to explore:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Walt Disney&#8217;s private apartment: Built during the initial 
        construction of Disneyland, Walt Disney&#8217;s private apartment is a 
        quaint studio dwelling, filled with Victorian decor, family photos, 
        and antiques selected by the Disney family.
      
			
				Lilly Belle VIP parlor car: Disneyland guests have long taken 
        grand circle tours on the Disneyland Railroad, but few ever 
        enjoy the ride from the elegant Lilly Belle VIP car parlor. Named 
        after Walt&#8217;s wife, Lillian, the Lilly Belle is truly a piece of 
        history, built in 1955, and refurbished to its modern state of luxury 
        for America&#8217;s bicentennial celebration in 1976.
      
			
				Circle D Ranch: From the friendly goats at Big Thunder Ranch to 
        the horses who carry guests down Main Street, U.S.A., Circle D Ranch 
        is home to Disneyland&#8217;s beloved &#8220;four-legged cast members.&#8221;
      
			
				Disneyland Dream Suite: This private space above Pirates of 
        the Caribbean was originally planned to be another apartment for 
        Walt Disney, but he passed away before its completion. In 2008, 
        Imagineers used some of Walt&#8217;s original ideas and some truly magical 
        surprises of their own to transform it into a fantasy villa like no 
        other.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prime money market funds reduced their holdings of European bank debt in June as investors favored government securities over money funds at quarter-end, according to a report by JPMorgan Securities released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime money funds' exposure to euro zone banks fell by $18 billion to $200 billion last month. Since the end of 2012, the funds have trimmed their holdings of that region's bank paper by $2 billion, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They slashed their French bank exposure by $10 billion, mostly in short-dated certificates of deposits (CDs), to $115 billion in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These funds also pared their holdings of other European bank debt last month. They trimmed their ownership of bank paper from Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom by $30 billion to $219 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Month-over-month changes in general sector allocations for prime (money funds) mirrored those of March with broad reductions to bank exposures, particularly to European banks," JPMorgan analysts wrote in their latest monthly analysis of prime money funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime money funds focused their purchases last month in U.S. Treasury bills. They raised their total Treasuries investment by $12 billion or 12 percent to $108 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the money from European bank holdings were moved into bank debt from other regions, particularly Canada, where funds increased their stakes by $16 billion in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the increased investments in Canadian bank debt was in the form of floating-rate CDs on fears over rising global interest rates after the Federal Reserve signaled it might shrink its unprecedented bond purchase program later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This increase likely speaks to available supply as floating-rate note issuance has been running relatively strong on the prospect of rising rates," the JPMorgan analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worries over less Fed stimulus caused a dramatic sell-off in the U.S. bond market, resulting in the worst quarter for U.S. Treasuries in 2-1/2 years and investors scrambling out of bond funds which they had poured money into earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime money funds, tracked by JPMorgan, lost $15.1 billion or 1.05 percent in assets in June, partly due to fund operators needing cash to meet a surge in redemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

Treasury bills. They raised their total Treasuries investment by
$12 billion or 12 percent to $108 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the money from European bank holdings were moved
into bank debt from other regions, particularly Canada, where
funds increased their stakes by $16 billion in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the increased investments in Canadian bank debt was
in the form of floating-rate CDs on fears over rising global
interest rates after the Federal Reserve signaled it might
shrink its unprecedented bond purchase program later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This increase likely speaks to available supply as
floating-rate note issuance has been running relatively strong
on the prospect of rising rates," the JPMorgan analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worries over less Fed stimulus caused a dramatic sell-off 
in the U.S. bond market, resulting in the worst quarter for U.S.
Treasuries in 2-1/2 years and investors scrambling out of bond
funds which they had poured money into earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime money funds, tracked by JPMorgan, lost $15.1 billion
or 1.05 percent in assets in June, partly due to fund operators
needing cash to meet a surge in redemptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. prime money market funds
reduced their holdings of European bank debt in June as
investors favored government securities over money funds at
quarter-end, according to a report by JPMorgan Securities
released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime money funds' exposure to euro zone banks fell by $18
billion to $200 billion last month. Since the end of 2012, the
funds have trimmed their holdings of that region's bank paper by
$2 billion, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;

			Cetus&#174; PAO Joins Cetus&#174; HiPerSYN&#174; and Cetus&#174; DE Creating a Family of 
      Products for a Range of Compressor Applications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of 
      technologically advanced engine oils, lubricants and coolants, today 
      announced it has expanded its line of Cetus&#174;-branded compressor oils. 
      Cetus&#174; PAO and the rebranded Cetus&#174; HiPerSYN&#174; (formerly HiPerSYN) have 
      joined Cetus&#174; DE to create a family of premium compressor oils 
      formulated for use in a wide range of applications, including portable 
      and stationary rotary screw, rotary vane, and reciprocating compressors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We saw the need to create a family of premium compressor oils and 
      evaluated our existing product portfolio to determine the proper path to 
      take,&#8221; said Jeff Snyder, Industrial Brand Specialist, Chevron Products 
      Company. &#8220;We have developed our new Cetus PAO product and joined it with 
      the rebranded Cetus HiPerSYN and our original Cetus oil, Cetus DE. This 
      combination of products gives our customers a single family of premium 
      compressor oils that meet their varied needs while helping to extend 
      equipment life and improve operational efficiency.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cetus&#174; PAO oils are synthetic air compressor lubricants formulated with 
      the highest quality polyalphaolefin (PAO) base fluids. They provide 
      thermal and oxidation stability, high viscosity index, high flash point, 
      low pour point, and hydrolytic stability while protecting against rust, 
      oxidation, foaming.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cetus&#174; PAO oils are designed to meet the requirements of modern higher 
      output, more efficient air compressors. These units are more compact and 
      operate at higher speeds than older compressors, resulting in higher 
      temperatures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cetus&#174; PAO (ISO 32, 46, 68, 100, 150) Benefits:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Exceptional thermal and oxidation stability
      
			
        Long machinery life and maximum compressor efficiency
      
			
        Long drain intervals
      
			
        Minimal maintenance and downtime
      
			
        Low volatility and excellent air release tendency
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cetus&#174; HiPerSYN&#174; Oils are designed to meet the needs of most air 
      compressor applications, especially those with wide operating 
      temperature ranges that may challenge non-synthetic oils. These higher 
      viscosity grade products are especially effective in high temperature 
      applications, such as industrial bearings and gears that require 
      RO-type synthetic gear oil and sootblowers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cetus&#174; HiPerSYN&#174; Oils are formulated with premium base oil technology

      Cetus&#174; DE oils are synthetic diester-based, oxidation resistant 
      compressor oils for use in portable and stationary rotary screw, rotary 
      vane, and reciprocating compressors. These oils excel in applications 
      that cannot tolerate carbon build up, and perform extremely well in high 
      temperatures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cetus&#174; DE oils have a low sludge-forming tendency and a high solvency 
      for deposits that help keep compressor parts clean. Cetus&#174; DE oils 
      provide a greater margin of safety than conventional petroleum products 
      because their flash points, fire points, and auto ignition temperatures 
      are much higher.

			Sequella Acquires Exclusive Worldwide Rights to Pfizer&#8217;s Sutezolid, 
      Currently in Clinical Development for Tuberculosis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sequella Obtains Development and Commercialization Rights to 
      Sutezolid for All Indications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sequella, a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company commercializing novel 
      antibiotics to treat life-threatening infectious diseases, today 
      announced that it has licensed Pfizer Inc&#8217;s exclusive worldwide rights 
      to develop and commercialize sutezolid, a Phase 2 oxazolidinone 
      antibiotic currently in development for the treatment of tuberculosis 
      (TB).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sutezolid demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis in the laboratory and in animal models of TB, an 
      aerosol-transmitted infection with a prevalence of over 2 billion people 
      worldwide. It also demonstrated encouraging activity in a Phase 2a Early 
      Bactericidal Activity (EBA) study in TB patients in South Africa. Under 
      the terms of the parties&#8217; exclusive license agreement, Sequella will be 
      solely responsible for completing clinical development and 
      commercializing the product globally. Financial terms of the transaction 
      were not disclosed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted to bring in a second clinical-phase TB asset that may 
      be paired with other TB drugs or with SQ109, our drug currently in Phase 
      2 studies for drug-sensitive TB in Africa and in a pivotal trial for 
      multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB in Russia. These two drugs, SQ109 and 
      sutezolid, could potentially anchor a totally new drug combination 
      regimen to treat all forms of active TB disease,&#8221; said Dr. Carol Nacy, 
      CEO of Sequella. &#8220;We will pursue development of sutezolid under its own 
      NDA, and also plan for combination studies in subsequent clinical 
      trials.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As Pfizer continues to concentrate our RD resources where we believe 
      we can have the greatest impact, we have evolved our internal infectious 
      disease focus from treatment to prevention through our leading expertise 
      in vaccine technology,&#8221; said Rod MacKenzie, PhD, Group Senior Vice 
      President and Head of PharmaTherapeutics RD at Pfizer. &#8220;Given the 
      urgent patient need in TB, we sought a partner for sutezolid that would 
      bring deep expertise and a strong commitment to TB patients. We believe 
      Sequella meets these criteria and offers a portfolio with the&#160;important 
      potential for combination studies.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TB, whether drug sensitive or MDR, is always treated with three or more 
      drugs to reduce emergence of drug resistance. Preclinical laboratory 
      studies performed independently by both Sequella and Pfizer show SQ109 
      and sutezolid to each have activity as single agents, and promising 
      additional activity when used in combination. A very low natural 
      resistance rate of M. tuberculosis to either drug, demonstration 
      that both drugs shorten treatment time in animal models of TB, and their 
      distinct and complementary mechanisms of action on M. tuberculosis, 
      all suggest that a regimen containing SQ109 and sutezolid could 
      potentially improve existing therapies with regard to efficacy and 
      containment of resistance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recent market reports estimate a $400-$500 million global peak sales 
      market for a drug to treat MDR-TB, approximately 5% of TB worldwide and 
      a rising global public health threat. Sequella intends to commercialize 
      its TB assets for both drug sensitive and MDR-TB, if and when approved 
      by applicable regulatory authorities. Sutezolid also has activity on 
      several clinically important Gram positive bacteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Sutezolid
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer had been developing an antimicrobial compound, sutezolid 
      (PNU-100480 or U-480), as a promising new treatment for tuberculosis 
      (TB). Sutezolid is currently in Phase 2 development and most recently 
      completed a Phase 2a Early Bactericidal Activity (EBA) study in patients 
      with TB in South Africa. Its potential indications include multi-drug 
      and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB), HIV-associated 
      tuberculosis (HIV-TB), drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB), and 
      suspected M/XDR latent M.tuberculosis infection (M/XDR-LTBI).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sutezolid also shows promise for antibiotic-resistant Gram (+) bacterial 
      infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
      (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings as slow personal computer sales ate into its Windows business and the company took an unexpected $900 million charge for its inventory of unsold Surface tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock fell 5 percent after hours from 5-year highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive charge underlines the struggles of the world's largest software company, which last week announced a deep reorganization to transform itself into a "devices and services" leader, but is struggling to make mobile computing as attractive as Apple Inc or Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the biggest miss we've ever seen from Microsoft, the biggest that I could remember," said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. "It looks like everything was weak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the sell-off late Thursday, Microsoft shares had risen 32 percent this year, beating a 19 percent rise in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the $900 million charge was related to its Surface RT tablet, the version of its tablet running on ARM Holdings-designed chips. The Surface was meant to challenge Apple's iPad when it was launched alongside Windows 8 in October, but has not sold well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Microsoft said it was drastically cutting prices and expanding distribution of the model to entice buyers, reducing the value of Surface devices in its inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do know we have to do better, particular in mobile devices," Amy Hood, Microsoft's new chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. "That's a big reason we made the strategic organizational changes last week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's biggest shake-up in five years, unveiled by Chief Executive Steve Ballmer last week, creates a single devices unit for the first time at the company, suggesting that it will double down on its so-far unsuccessful move into hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit of 59 cents per share, compared with a 6 cents per share loss in the year-ago quarter when it wrote off the cost of a failed acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street had estimated earnings of 75 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding the Surface charge, Microsoft reported 66 cents per share profit, a less drastic miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 10 percent to $19.9 billion, helped by sales of Microsoft's Office suite of applications, but fell short of analysts' average estimate of $20.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Windows rose slightly, but only because of the inclusion of some deferred revenue, weighed down by an estimated 11 percent dip in PC sales in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Windows 8 has sold more than 100 million licenses since launching in October, but is struggling to win over many consumers confused by the new design which is more suited to tablets than traditional PCs. Acknowledging this, Microsoft is releasing a revamped version of the system called Windows 8.1 later this year, which brings back the iconic 'start' button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Liana Baker in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc decided not to pursue a bid for Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc this week, according to two people familiar with the matter, leaving Amgen Inc in the front position to buy the cancer drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Onyx closed down 3.3 percent at $128.55 on Thursday, their lowest level since it announced a sale process on June 30 and valuing the South San Francisco, California-based company at around $9.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onyx, which rejected Amgen's $120 per share bid and instead put itself up for sale, was expecting to receive first-round offers from a few interested parties as soon as this week, people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, among the drugmakers that have been evaluating a bid as recently as a few days ago, has decided not to move forward, mainly on concerns that Onyx has become too expensive after a recent run-up in its share price, the people said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources asked not to be named because details of the auction are not public. Pfizer, Onyx and Amgen declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few other drugmakers that showed interest, such as Gilead Sciences Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and AstraZeneca Plc, have also been deterred by price, the people familiar with the matter said, though the companies' latest position could not be confirmed as of Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilead and AstraZeneca declined to comment. Bristol-Myers did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Onyx, which closed at $86.82 on June 28 before news of the sale process, have since surged more than 50 percent. The steep price gain already prompted a number of other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies not to pursue a deal, several people familiar with the matter previously said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large pharmaceutical and biotech companies have been looking to acquire smaller biotech firms to gain access to new drugs and offset revenue losses stemming from expired patents, but rich valuations of target companies are proving to be a big hurdle to dealmaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onyx sells Nexavar, a treatment for liver and kidney cancer, and the new colon cancer drug Stivarga - both in partnership with Germany's Bayer AG. Onyx last year began selling Kyprolis for multiple myeloma, which some analysts estimate will reach peak annual sales of $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's nothing to do with the attractiveness of those drugs. It's just that the price got away from buyers," said a third person familiar with the sale process, asking not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Soyoung Kim in New York; Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler in London and Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Gary Hill and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, July 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on
Thursday reported lower-than expected quarterly earnings as slow
personal computer sales ate into its Windows business and it
took a large unexpected charge for its inventory of unsold
Surface tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc decided not

Inc in the pole position to buy the cancer drugmaker

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades 1 Distressed Class of JPM 2002-CIBC4
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded one and affirmed nine classes of J.P. 
      Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates, series 2002-CIBC4 (JPMC 2002-CIBC4). A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrade of class D to 'Csf' from 'CCCsf' indicates that the losses 
      to this class have become more certain, primarily due to the decline in 
      performance and valuations of the specially serviced assets. Fitch 
      modeled losses of 9.7% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the 
      original pool balance total 12.5%, including $95.9 million (12% of the 
      original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 
      six loans (37.6%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes three 
      specially serviced assets (17.6%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Negative Outlook on the 'Bsf' rated class C indicates that further 
      downgrades are possible if the collateral performance deteriorates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the July 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 94.6% to $42.9 million from $798.9 million 
      at issuance. Currently, there are only 17 loans remaining in the pool, 
      compared to 121 at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, one loan (4.5% 
      of the pool) is defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting 
      classes D through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is a loan (4.7%) secured by a 
      50,964 square foot (sf) retail property in Macon, GA. The loan was 
      transferred to special servicing in May 2012 due to maturity default. 
      The borrower is not remitting cash flow and the foreclosure process has 
      been initiated. Fitch's stressed value based on servicer reported 
      property value indicates losses upon disposition of this asset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is loan (4.6%) secured 
      by a 19,400 sf retail property in Edwards, CO. The loan was transferred 
      to special servicing in February 2012 due to maturity default. Legal 
      counsel has been engaged and the Notice of Default has been sent. 
      Foreclosure and receivership was filed in April 2013 and a receivership 
      motion has now been granted by the courts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following class and assigns or revises Recovery 
      Estimates (REs) as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$10 million class D to 'Csf' from 'CCCsf', RE 80%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$31.7 million class C at 'Bsf', Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$1.2 million class E at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class F at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class G at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class H at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class J at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class K at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class L at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class M at 'Dsf', RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A-1, A-2, A-3 and B certificates have paid in full. Fitch does 
      not rate the class NR certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the rating 
      on the interest-only class X-1 certificates.

			Microsoft U.S. Partner of the Year Perficient Receives More Top 
      Honors at WPC 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Awards recognize Perficient&#8217;s leadership and expertise in Microsoft 
      cloud computing solutions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Perficient, 
      Inc. (NASDAQ: PRFT), a leading information technology consulting 
      firm serving Global 2000 and other large customers throughout North 
      America, was honored as Microsoft&#8217;s 
      2013 US Partner of the Year at Microsoft&#8217;s 
      2013 Worldwide Partner Conference (WPC) in Houston last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Perficient dedicated itself this year to embracing the Microsoft 
      devices and services strategy, and subsequently has driven tremendous 
      customer value,&#8221; said&#160;Jenni 
      Flinders,&#160;Microsoft US vice president, Partner Strategy and Programs. 
      &#8220;I want to personally congratulate them on their success.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the U.S. Partner of the Year honor, Perficient today 
      announced it received additional awards and recognition from Microsoft. 
      At WPC, Perficient was named the East Region NSI Partner of the Year, 
      the Central Region Enterprise Cloud Partner of the Year and the 
      Northeast Area Cloud Partner of the Year. These awards highlight 
      Perficient&#8217;s capabilities in and successful implementations of Microsoft 
      technology solutions including cloud computing technologies like Office 
      365, Azure, 
      Lync, Yammer, SharePoint Online, InTune and Dynamics CRM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Cloud computing has become a top priority for CIOs as they are 
      challenged with enhancing their business strategically rather than 
      finding ways to keep servers up and running. Cloud enables organizations 
      to be more efficient and agile, and lowers operating costs,&#8221; said Mike 
      Gersten, vice president of Perficient&#8217;s Microsoft National Business 
      Group. &#8220;Already, the cloud market has matured, and we&#8217;re seeing our work 
      with Microsoft technologies increasingly revolve around cloud-based 
      solutions that drive effective business strategy. In addition to being 
      named the U.S. Partner of the Year, we&#8217;re honored Microsoft has 
      recognized our cloud 
      expertise with these additional awards.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Perficient has helped clients across multiple industries implement cloud 
      solutions like Office 
      365 and Lync 
      technologies. The company has activated more than 500,000 Office 365 
      seats, which is more than any other National Systems 
      Integrator.&#160;Highlights of recent implementations include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Working with an automotive company to build a new Active Directory 
        environment, creating integration while leveraging their identity 
        management system, and extending Lync Online to their approximately 
        31,000 users.
      
			
        Partnering with a recycling company to build out the necessary 
        infrastructure to support a move to Exchange Online, and develop the 
        migration process needed to successfully transition to the hosted 
        Exchange Environment.
      
			
        Collaborating with one of the largest healthcare providers to 
        integrate Office 365 to quickly setup and extend their Active 
        Directory environment for not only Lync Online, but all of the Office 
        365 services. This allowed the company to easily deploy Lync Online to 
        all 6,000 users within weeks.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Avtex is honored by Microsoft for achieving outstanding levels of 
      sales achievement and innovation.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Avtex, a national provider of customer experience technologies 
      and services has joined the prestigious 2013 Microsoft Dynamics Inner 
      Circle, an elite group of the most strategic Microsoft Dynamics partners 
      from across the globe with sales achievements that rank them in the 
      highest echelon of the Microsoft Dynamics global network of partners. 
      Members of the Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle have performed to a high

      park attractions, TV shows and live action films; plus items from 
      contemporary Disney milestones.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      Academy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      #epayments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Visa 
      Inc. (NYSE:V), the global payments technology company, and NetHope, 
      a consortium of more than 40 humanitarian organizations, today announced 
      the five recipients of the Visa Innovation Grants Program. The grants 
      will help leading development organizations modernize the distribution 
      of payments related to microfinance, agriculture, health, and emergency 
      relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Every year, billions of dollars in cash payments are distributed to 
      people in need through emergency relief efforts, benefit stipends, 
      conditional cash transfers, microfinance programs, and other development 
      initiatives. Digitizing these payments, through mobile phones or other 
      electronic methods, not only improves security and speeds distribution, 
      it also can promote financial inclusion by providing recipients access 
      to broader financial services, including savings and electronic payments 
      tools.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The group of five grantee organizations includes: Agribusiness 
      Systems International (ASI), Freedom 
      from Hunger, International 
      Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Mercy 
      Corps, and Pathfinder 
      International.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Around the world, humanitarian and development organizations are 
      delivering important programs that are tackling poverty and helping 
      improve lives,&#8221; said Douglas Sabo (@DSabo), 
      head of Corporate Responsibility at Visa Inc. &#8220;We have heard the call 
      from these organizations for assistance to modernize the way they 
      distribute funds by shifting to electronic payments, allowing them to be 
      even more efficient and effective. We are proud the Visa Innovation 
      Grants Program can help enable this transition.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through the Visa Innovation Grants Program, Visa is awarding $500,000 in 
      grants to increase the long-term impact of development programs through 
      the innovation and adoption of electronic payments. The program is being 
      delivered in partnership with NetHope, which fosters collaboration among 
      leading international humanitarian organizations to address, create and 
      implement scalable technology solutions to aid the developing world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We received submissions for Visa Innovation Grants from organizations 
      working in a wide variety of sectors around the world, all of which are 
      seeking better ways to deliver funds to the people who need them,&#8221; said 
      Dr. William Brindley, executive director and CEO of NetHope. &#8220;The 
      transition to electronic payments is an important driver of social and 
      economic development, and we&#8217;re excited to be part of a program that is 
      helping to create new models for the future.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An Expert Advisory Committee of distinguished public and private sector 
      leaders assisted in reviewing the more than 30 grant applications 
      submitted. The committee included:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Nabeeha Mujeeb Kazi, managing director, Humanitas Global Development
      
			
        Nick Maunder, humanitarian and development consultant
      
			
        Eric Nee, managing editor, Stanford Social Innovation Review
      
			
        Sarah Rotman, financial sector specialist, CGAP
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We saw an impressive array of ideas from applicants on how the use of 
      electronic payments could improve the delivery and impact of development 
      programs,&#8221; said Sarah Rotman, financial sector specialist at CGAP, and a 
      member of the Expert Advisory Committee. &#8220;These recipients show 
      particular promise to deliver game-changing ideas and scale across 
      diverse sectors.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each of the grant recipients will put the Visa Innovation Grants funds 
      to work in unique ways, designed to maximize the impact of the project&#8217;s 
      stated focus area:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Agribusiness Systems International (ASI)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ASI will use the Visa Innovation Grant to bring formal financial 
      services to rice farmers in Ghana. The program will extend branchless 
      banking in rural areas by integrating mobile finance into the rice value 
      chain. Mobile finance will reduce the risk of theft, connect farmers and 
      other actors with financial services, and ensure timely payments to 
      farmers. Founded in 1993 as an affiliate of ACDI/VOCA, 
      ASI 
      is a nonprofit consulting organization that helps smallholder farmers 
      become competitive in the agribusiness sector.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Freedom from Hunger
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Freedom from Hunger will use the Visa Innovation Grant to improve access

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JEFFERSON, Texas, July 18, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Innocap, Inc. (or "Innocap") (OTCBB:INNO) (OTCQB:INNO) is pleased to announce the completion of a detailed research report authored by Rob Goldman of Goldman Small Cap Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

	In the Goldman Opportunity Research report on the Company, analyst Rob Goldman outlines his investment thesis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Innocap is a great story that has broad appeal among public and private investors and appears poised to now become a great stock. Led by a renowned leader in marine salvage recovery, Innocap offers huge upside via the potential value of marine salvage recovery cargo (i.e., treasure) with the I-52 project potentially worth hundreds of millions alone. Plus, Innocap is poised to enjoy other revenue streams related to post-recovery operations including film production, education, promotion, entertainment and exhibitions. This model is similar to Premier Exhibitions which is known for its Titanic salvage and other, unique nationwide exhibitions. As Innocap initiates the return to I-52 and engages in its other salvage operations and related ventures, we expect that the Company's valuation will increase substantially."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MILAN, July 18 (Reuters) - Italian tyremaker Pirelli
 shares opened 3.9 percent higher in Milan on Thursday
after JP Morgan raised the stock to overweight and upped its
price target to 12 euros from 9.50 euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors shrugged off a Wednesday court ruling that Pirelli
chief Marco Tronchetti Provera was found guilty of having
received stolen data in 2004, when he led Telecom Italia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tronchetti denies any wrongdoing.

      IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced second-quarter 2013 diluted earnings of 
      $2.91 per share, compared with diluted earnings of $3.34 per share in 
      the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of 13 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $3.22 per share, including workforce 
      rebalancing charges, compared with operating diluted earnings of $3.51 
      per share in the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of 8 percent. 
      Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share were $3.91, an increase 
      of 8 percent, excluding the impact of workforce rebalancing charges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second-quarter net income was $3.2 billion compared with $3.9 billion in 
      the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of 17 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) net income was $3.6 billion, including workforce rebalancing 
      charges, compared with $4.1 billion in the second quarter of 2012, a 
      decrease of 12 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) net income, excluding the 
      impact of workforce rebalancing, was $4.3 billion, an increase of 3 
      percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues for the second quarter of 2013 of $24.9 billion were down 
      3 percent (down 1 percent, adjusting for currency) from the second 
      quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the second quarter, we delivered strong performance in our 
      higher-value software and mainframe businesses and again significantly 
      increased our services backlog on growth in new business,&#8221; said Ginni 
      Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Going forward, we will continue investing in our strategic growth 
      initiatives, acquiring and divesting capabilities, re-balancing skills 
      and taking action in the areas that are not performing. We expect 
      continued improvement through the second half of the year and remain 
      confident that we will achieve our increased 2013 operating EPS 
      expectation of at least $16.90, excluding the $1 billion workforce

		&lt;p&gt;
			Second-Quarter GAAP &#8211; Operating (non-GAAP) Reconciliation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second-quarter operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $0.31 per 
      share of charges: $0.15 per share for the amortization of purchased 
      intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and $0.16 per 
      share for retirement-related charges driven by changes to plan assets 
      and liabilities primarily related to market performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Full-Year 2013 Expectations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company said that a substantial second-half gain that it was 
      expecting in its prior view of earnings per share will not likely be 
      achieved the end of 2013. As a result, the company updated its prior 
      full-year EPS expectations, including the impact of a second-quarter $1 
      billion workforce rebalancing charge, to at least $16.25, with the net 
      impact of $0.45 driven by the elongated discussions for its larger 
      divestiture project. IBM&#8217;s full-year 2013 EPS expectations are as 
      follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full-year GAAP diluted earnings per share expectations are at least 
      $15.08. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share expectations are 
      being raised to at least $16.90, excluding the second-quarter $1 billion 
      workforce rebalancing charge. Operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share 
      expectations are at least $16.25, including the second-quarter $1 
      billion workforce rebalancing charge.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2013 operating (non-GAAP) earnings expectations exclude $1.17 per 
      share of charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets, other 
      acquisition-related charges, and retirement-related charges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Geographic Regions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Americas&#8217; second-quarter revenues were $10.7 billion, a decrease of 
      3 percent (down 3 percent, adjusting for currency) from the 2012 period. 
      Revenues from Europe/Middle East/Africa were flat at $7.8 billion (down 
      1 percent adjusting for currency). Asia-Pacific revenues decreased 8 
      percent (flat, adjusting for currency) to $5.8 billion. OEM revenues 
      were $538 million, up 5 percent (up 6 percent adjusting for currency) 
      compared with the 2012 second quarter.

      Revenues from the company&#8217;s growth markets were flat (up 1 percent, 
      adjusting for currency). Revenues in the BRIC countries &#8212; Brazil, 
      Russia,&#160;India and China &#8212; were flat (up 1 percent, adjusting for

      for currency) to $4.6 billion.

      Pre-tax income from Global Technology Services decreased 14 percent and 
      pre-tax margin decreased to 15.4 percent. Pre-tax income from Global

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Members of Microsoft Corp's board have held talks with ValueAct Capital Management LP in recent days over the activist shareholder's demands to secure a seat on the company's board, two sources close to the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ValueAct, which wants a say in the way the world's largest software company is adapting to the new world of mobile computing, is seeking to nominate a person from its own organization, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes as Microsoft had its biggest sell-off in four years, wiping $34 billion off its market value, after quarterly results were hit by weak demand for its latest Windows system and poor sales of its Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based ValueAct, which manages more than $10 billion for clients, owned 33 million Microsoft shares as of March, which is 0.4 percent of total shares outstanding, but it is believed to be buying more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund, co-founded by finance industry veteran Jeff Ubben in 2000, has made a reputation for building stakes in companies and working with management in private to change fundamental strategy. ValueAct's other major holdings include Adobe Systems Inc, Motorola Solutions Inc and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months a number of Microsoft's top institutional investors have contacted ValueAct, expressing concern over management execution and strategy, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High among the issues in the talks, which the sources described as ongoing, is the apparent lack of succession planning at the top of the company. Steve Ballmer has held the chief executive job since 2000 and shows no signs of relinquishing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 57, once remarked that he envisaged staying on until his youngest child goes to college, which would be around 2017 or 2018, but since then he has not publicly addressed the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ValueAct and Microsoft declined to comment. The software company has previously said there is a CEO succession plan in place, but has declined to give details of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNDER PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's huge stock drop on Friday, prompted by its financial results and a $900 million write-down on the value of unsold Surface tablets, provoked fresh skepticism of Ballmer's new plan to reshape Microsoft around devices and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The recent reorganization does not fix the tablet or smartphone problem," Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund said in a note to clients on Friday. "The devices opportunity just received a $900 million hardware write-off for Surface RT and investors may not even like the idea of wading deeper into this territory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ValueAct is thought to oppose Microsoft's recent foray into making its own devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Ballmer have been the targets of much criticism over the past decade, chiefly for falling behind Apple Inc and Google Inc in the shift toward mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, however, has not been subjected to much overt protestation from shareholders. The most public challenge came two years ago, when Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, who made his name warning about Lehman Brothers' financial health before the investment bank's collapse, called for Ballmer to step down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft never responded publicly to that call, and the company's board has never indicated any major disapproval with Ballmer's performance, although it did trim his bonus last year for sagging Windows sales and a mistake that led to a massive fine by European regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ValueAct may find it difficult to stir up change at Microsoft, even if it does get a seat on the board, given that co-founder and Chairman Bill Gates has long been a solid supporter of his old friend and colleague Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates, who founded Microsoft in 1975 with Paul Allen, still owns about 4.8 percent of the company and is the largest individual shareholder. Ballmer, who is also on the board, owns about 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside Gates and Ballmer, seven independent directors make up Microsoft's nine-person board. The lead independent director is John Thompson, a former Symantec Corp and IBM executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares closed down 11.4 percent at $31.40 on Nasdaq on Friday, but recovered slightly to $31.58 in after-hours trading, after the news that board members were in talks with ValueAct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nadia Damouni in New York and Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Edward Tobin, Gary Hill, Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp shares fell more than 11 percent on Friday, their biggest plunge in more than four years, a day after the software company posted dismal quarterly results due to weak demand for its latest Windows system and poor sales of its Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock's selloff, from five-year highs, is the biggest in percentage terms since January 2009, when the world's largest software company cut 5,000 jobs during the recession. At one point in the day, losses exceeded 12 percent, making it the biggest fall since the Internet stock bubble burst in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $34 billion was wiped off Microsoft's market value on Friday, exceeding the size of rival Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's earnings were wrecked by a $900 million writedown on the value of unsold Surface tablets after it cut prices in a bid to excite buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poor results shocked Wall Street, which had believed the company's strength with business customers would help it ride out a downturn in consumer PC sales. The results provoked fresh skepticism of Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's new plan to reshape the company around devices and services, unveiled last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The recent reorganization does not fix the tablet or smartphone problem," Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund said in a note to clients on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;July 19 (Reuters) - Two JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co

&lt;p&gt;* Biggest one-day drop since recession, layoffs in 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Loses $34 billion in market value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares had been at five-year highs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Analyst predicts shareholder activism this summer

 (Updates with closing share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp shares fell more
than 11 percent on Friday, their biggest plunge in more than
four years, a day after the software company posted dismal
quarterly results due to weak demand for its latest Windows
system and poor sales of its Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock's selloff, from five-year highs, is the biggest in
percentage terms since January 2009, when the world's largest
software company cut 5,000 jobs during the recession. At one
point in the day, losses exceeded 12 percent, making it the
biggest fall since the Internet stock bubble burst in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $34 billion was wiped off Microsoft's market value on
Friday, exceeding the size of rival Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's earnings were wrecked by a $900 million
writedown on the value of unsold Surface tablets after it cut
prices in a bid to excite buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poor results shocked Wall Street, which had believed the
company's strength with business customers would help it ride
out a downturn in consumer PC sales. The results provoked fresh
skepticism of Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's new plan to
reshape the company around devices and services, unveiled last
week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The recent reorganization does not fix the tablet or
smartphone problem," Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund said in a note
to clients on Friday. "The devices opportunity just received a
$900 million hardware write-off for Surface RT and investors may
not even like the idea of wading deeper into this territory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherlund suggested that activist investors will pressure
Ballmer to reconsider his strategy this summer, a reference to
ValueAct Capital, which took a $2 billion stake in Microsoft in
April and is in talks to get a seat on Microsoft's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This (the results) was much more disruptive than investors
have expected, with Microsoft missing its guidance in every
division and guiding lower," wrote Sherlund. "Everything an
activist investor could ask for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Wall Street analysts were similarly dismayed by
Microsoft's latest financial report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brokerages Raymond James and Cowen &amp; Co cut their ratings on
Microsoft stock by a notch to "market perform" and at least five
others trimmed their price targets by as much as $3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price targets were cut as low as $35, below Thursday's
closing price of $35.44. The shares fell as low as $31.02 on
Friday and closed at $31.40 on Nasdaq, an 11.4 percent drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBR Capital Markets analyst David Hilal said Microsoft's
revenue from Windows operating system in the fourth quarter was
9 percent below his expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key potential growth drivers (Windows 8, Surface) of
the Microsoft story appear to be fading, heading into FY14,"
Hilal wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Microsoft said it was drastically cutting
Surface prices to entice buyers, reducing the value of the
devices in its inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft launched Surface tablets last year to challenge
Apple Inc's iPad, but sales have failed to meet
expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The new Windows RT operating system has not been the hit
MSFT had hoped for," Cowen analyst Gregg Moskowitz said in a
note, adding that investor expectations for the tablet had never
been very high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janney Capital Markets analysts said the writedown was an
admission that Microsoft's first attempt in the tablet market
had not been successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said on Thursday it expected revenue from
Windows software to continue to fall due to a weak PC market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's outlook points to a weaker PC market, shifts
toward subscription revenue and a pause ahead of the Xbox One
gaming console release, all of which are expected to pressure
revenue growth, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xbox is the only device by Microsoft that has found a
following among consumers and a new version is expected to
launch this year.

&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft, Google tumble after results miss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* GE jumps after profit beats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow, S 500 retreat from record highs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow off 0.1 pct, S up 0.03 pct, Nasdaq off 0.8 pts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Caroline Valetkevitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - The Dow and Nasdaq fell on
Friday, led by losses in tech shares after disappointing results
from Microsoft and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 was flat, as better-than-expected results from
General Electric Co and Schlumberger NV helped to
offset the tech losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp was the biggest drag on all three
major indexes, with the Nasdaq showing the steepest declines.
Google Inc also dragged on the S 500 and Nasdaq. Both
reported earnings that fell short of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems like (tech) may be the one area where companies
haven't gotten expectations sufficiently reduced," said Eric
Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment
Management Corp in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stocks like Microsoft and Google I think were probably at
the point where they had traded so nicely into earnings that
people were really looking for something positive to be said."  
  Microsoft shares gained 21 percent in the second quarter,
while Google was up 11 percent in the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of fresh economic data, the high-profile
earnings disappointments in the tech sector prompted investors
to lock in profits after some rosy results and reassuring
comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Thursday
sent the Dow and S to record closing levels. The benchmark S
is up more than 18 percent for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft slumped 10.9 percent to $31.56, while Google lost
1.5 percent to $896.77. The S tech sector led
declines, falling 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was down 18.88
points, or 0.12 percent, at 15,529.66. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index was up 0.58 points, or 0.03 percent, at 1,689.95.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 26.95 points, or
0.75 percent, at 3,584.33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in the tech sector, Advanced Micro Devices Inc 
tumbled 14.9 percent to $3.95 after the company said gross
margins would fall, even as the chipmaker forecast
stronger-than-expected revenue growth in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, encouraging earnings reports from other companies
helped keep the S 500 near break-even. Shares of General
Electric rose 5 percent to $24.80 while shares of Schlumberger
gained 5.9 percent to $83.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect S 500 companies' second-quarter earnings
to have grown 2.9 percent from a year earlier, with revenue up
1.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Friday, of the 104 companies in the S 500 that
have reported earnings for the quarter, 65.4 percent have
reported earnings above analyst expectations, while 51 percent
have topped revenue estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other companies to report, Whirlpool Corp 
climbed 8.2 percent to $129.18 after raising its full-year
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intuitive Surgical Inc slid 9.1 percent to $383.47
after the company cut its 2013 sales forecast and said U.S.
regulators had issued a warning after an inspection of its
facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 
      2012-HSBC
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed all rated classes of J.P. Morgan Chase 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-HSBC (JPMCC 2012-HSBC). A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmation of JPMCC 2012-HSBC is based on the stable performance of 
      the underlying trust asset. As of the July 2013 remittance, the loan is 
      current and physical occupancy has stabilized as expected at issuance. 
      The loan is interest-only for the first 60 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATINGS SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. No rating actions are 
      expected unless there are material changes to the property occupancy and 
      cash flow. Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in 
      the report 'JPMCC Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-HSBC' (Aug. 31, 2012), 
      available at www.fitchratings.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HSBC Tower is a 30-story, 864,303 square foot (sf), high-rise office 
      building located in the Grand Central/Bryant Park submarket in midtown 
      Manhattan. At issuance, the property was 92% leased, with some tenants 
      awaiting the build out of their units. As of the February 2013 rent 
      roll, reported occupancy is 93.9%. HSBC occupies 63.4% of the net 
      rentable area (NRA), and its lease expires in 2020, two years prior to 
      the loan term. The HSBC lease was signed when the company completed a 
      sale-leaseback transaction with the sponsor. The second-largest tenant 
      is the international law firm Baker  McKenzie (12.2% of the NRA).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan is structured with a hard lockbox and both ongoing and upfront 
      reserves. Reserves account for current and future expenses for leasing 
      costs and capital expenditures, as well as upfront reserves to cover 
      ongoing capital improvements and free rent. A rollover reserve of $1.25 
      million per annum is in place for HSBC as is a cash flow sweep that will 
      be triggered 30 months prior to HSBC's lease expiration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$200,000,000 class A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      --Interest-only class X-A* at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Interest-only class X-B** at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Two JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) directors who sat on the board's risk committee in the run-up to the London Whale trading debacle have retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directors, David Cote and Ellen Futter, won relatively low numbers of votes at the company's annual meeting in May, signaling investor discomfort with them. Shareholders have told Reuters that they have continued to agitate for changes on the board since the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board expects to appoint additional directors "as the year goes on," Lee Raymond, the presiding director, said in the statement on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two advisory firms had suggested investors vote against Futter, who heads the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and Cote, who is chairman and chief executive of Honeywell International Inc (HON.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were on the risk committee when JPMorgan announced the bad credit derivatives trades that ultimately cost the bank more than $6.2 billion and damaged its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futter was re-elected to the board with only 53.1 percent of the vote at the company's annual meeting in May, which she did not attend. Cote received 59.3 percent of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond had said at the annual meeting that he expected the board to make changes in its risk policy committee following the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two directors were long-standing board members. Cote had served for more than five years, and Futter for 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon emerged from the annual meeting with more evident power than before, after 68 percent of shareholders recommended that he continue to be both chairman of the board and chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The endorsement exceeded the 60 percent of votes Dimon had received the year before and came after many investors feared he might quit if they did not agree that he could both run the company and lead the board in its oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, in Friday's statement, said of Cote and Futter, "We have learned a great deal from both of them and will miss having them as members of our board."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry and Nadia Damouni in New York; Editing by Gerald E.

		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that two of its 
      directors, David Cote and Ellen Futter, have retired from its Board of 
      Directors. The company also said that it intends to appoint new 
      directors to the Board later this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ms. Futter is retiring after 16 years of service to the company, having 
      served on several Board committees and helping steer the company through 
      a number of mergers as well as the recent financial crisis. &#8220;Ellen has 
      been an outstanding director and leader &#8211; helping guide our firm 
      successfully during a critical time in our history. I will miss her 
      greatly,&#8221; said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Cote is stepping down after more than five years of service. Jamie 
      Dimon said, &#8220;As Chairman and CEO of Honeywell, Dave brought exceptional 
      experience to JPMorgan Chase across a broad spectrum of issues. He is a 
      highly talented executive, and we were all fortunate to benefit from his 
      knowledge and leadership.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon concluded, &#8220;I want to thank Ellen and Dave for their dedicated

      will miss having them as members of our Board.&#8221;

      add its thanks to Ellen and Dave for their significant contributions to 
      our company over the years and to our Board governance. We are always in 
      search of great directors, and the Board expects to appoint additional 
      directors as the year goes on.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;I am proud to have served as a member of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Board during 
      such a historic time in the life of the company,&#8221; said Ellen Futter, 
      adding, &#8220;having been a director since the 1990s, I believe that this is 
      the right time to make this transition. It&#8217;s a great company with 
      outstanding leadership in Jamie Dimon, senior management and at the 
      Board level.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dave Cote said, &#8220;I am grateful for the opportunity to have served on the 
      JPMorgan Chase Board. Given the increasing demands on the Directors of 
      companies in the financial services sector, I decided that now was the 
      time to reallocate my limited personal time to other outside activities.

&lt;p&gt;July 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp shares fell 9
percent in early trading, a day after the software company
posted dismal quarterly results due to weak demand for PCs and
disappointing sales of its Surface tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerages Raymond James and Cowen &amp; Co cut their ratings on
Microsoft stock by a notch to "market perform" and at least five
others trimmed their price targets by as much as $3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price targets were cut as low as $35, below Thursday's
closing price of $35.44. The shares fell to $32.00 on the
Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBR Capital Markets analyst David Hilal said Microsoft's
revenue from Windows operating system in the fourth quarter was
9 percent below his expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key potential growth drivers (Windows 8, Surface) of
the Microsoft story appear to be fading, heading into FY14,"
Hilal wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted lower-than-expected quarterly earnings on
Thursday, hit by a $900 million write down on its Surface
tablets after it cut prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Microsoft said it was drastically cutting
Surface prices to entice buyers, reducing the value of the
devices in its inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft launched Surface tablets last year to challenge
Apple Inc's iPad, but their sales have failed to meet
expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, the new Windows RT operating system has not
been the hit MSFT had hoped for," Cowen analyst Gregg Moskowitz
said in a note, adding that investor expectations for the tablet
were never very high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janney Capital Markets analysts said the write down was an
admission that Microsoft's first attempt in the tablet market
had not been successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said on Thursday it expected revenue from
Windows software to continue to fall due to a weak PC market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's outlook points to a weaker PC market, shifts
towards subscription revenue and a pause ahead of the Xbox One
gaming console release, all of which are expected to put revenue
growth under pressure, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xbox is the only device by Microsoft that has found a
following among consumers and a new version is expected to
launch this year.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Britain picked U.S. investment bank JP Morgan (JPM.N) to advise it on the sale of stakes in Lloyds (LLOY.L) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), marking another step in a sale which could add billions of pounds to state coffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government's holdings in the two banks date from when they were bailed out with 65 billion pounds ($98.8 billion) of public funds during the credit crunch and finance minister George Osborne is keen to progress the sale before an election due in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is expected to kick off the sale of shares in Lloyds, in which it owns 39 percent, before the end of September if the bank's shares remain above the 61 pence price at which the government bought in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely to start with a placing of between 3 billion pounds and 5 billion of Lloyds shares with institutional investors, bankers have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS, in which the state has 81 percent, is a more problematic case, because the shares remain well below the government's breakeven price and its restructuring is less well advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JP Morgan, it is a prestigious award after what was a hotly contested pitch between investment banks, although it will not be paid for the initial period of work, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body which manages the Lloyds and RBS stakes, said on Friday JP Morgan would initially help devise strategies "for realizing value for the government's shareholdings in the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UKFI said it will review the appointment on a periodic basis. It also listed more than a dozen banks shortlisted to work on any share sale, which included all of the big names from Wall Street and the City of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lloyds shares were down 1.5 percent at 69 pence by 1300 GMT, underperforming a 0.2 percent rise by Europe's bank sector .SX7P, but are still up 44 percent this year, fuelled by expectations for a sharp rise in profits and a resumption of dividend payments next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HARD FOUGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of JP Morgan's most senior bankers who could work on the deal include Viswas Raghavan, its head of banking for Europe, and the new co-heads of its UK investment banking business: Conor Hillery, who previously ran its UK financial institutions group, and Ina De, previously co-head of equity capital markets for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will continue to be a hard-fought battle to run the 20 billion pound sale of Lloyds shares, even though fees on the deal will be far less lucrative than for private sector work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the scale of the sale, banks could still earn 25 million pounds if they charged 0.5 percent on the sale of 5 billion pounds of shares, and share 325 million pounds in fees on the full Lloyds and RBS stake sales - albeit maybe over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortlists were named for four roles: bookrunner, co-lead manager, capital markets adviser, and financial and/or strategic adviser. UKFI will pick banks from the lists at short notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen banks were on the list to advise on strategy, with JPMorgan joined by U.S. rivals Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Citi (C.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Europe were Barclays (BARC.L), HSBC (HSBA.L), Rothschild ROT.UL, Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), UBS (UBSN.VX) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six firms were names as potential capital markets advisors, who could help on a retail offer, including Lazard (LAZ.N), Portman Capital and Solid Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan, UBS, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank all worked closely with the Treasury during the 2008 bailout of the banks.

&lt;p&gt;* U.S. bank will not be paid for initial work -source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Top banks on shortlists for advisor, bookrunner roles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Lloyds sale could start Aug-Sept after share price rally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Steve Slater&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - Britain picked U.S. investment
bank JP Morgan to advise it on the sale of stakes in
Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, marking
another step in a sale which could add billions of pounds to
state coffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government's holdings in the two banks date from when
they were bailed out with 65 billion pounds ($98.8 billion) of
public funds during the credit crunch and finance minister
George Osborne is keen to progress the sale before an election
due in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is expected to kick off the sale of shares in
Lloyds, in which it owns 39 percent, before the end of September
if the bank's shares remain above the 61 pence price at which
the government bought in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely to start with a placing of between 3 billion
pounds and 5 billion of Lloyds shares with institutional
investors, bankers have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS, in which the state has 81 percent, is a more
problematic case, because the shares remain well below the
government's breakeven price and its restructuring is less well
advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JP Morgan, it is a prestigious award after what was a
hotly contested pitch between investment banks, although it will
not be paid for the initial period of work, a person familiar
with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body which manages the
Lloyds and RBS stakes, said on Friday JP Morgan would initially
help devise strategies "for realising value for the government's

underperforming a 0.2 percent rise by Europe's bank sector
, but are still up 44 percent this year, fuelled by
expectations for a sharp rise in profits and a resumption of 
dividend payments next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HARD FOUGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of JP Morgan's most senior bankers who could work on
the deal include Viswas Raghavan, its head of banking for
Europe, and the new co-heads of its UK investment banking
business: Conor Hillery, who previously ran its UK financial
institutions group, and Ina De, previously co-head of equity
capital markets for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will continue to be a hard-fought battle to run the 20
billion pound sale of Lloyds shares, even though fees on the
deal will be far less lucrative than for private sector work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the scale of the sale, banks could still earn 25
million pounds if they charged 0.5 percent on the sale of 5
billion pounds of shares, and share 325 million pounds in fees
on the full Lloyds and RBS stake sales - albeit maybe over a

&lt;p&gt;July 19 (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported a
fall in second-quarter profit, hurt by lower demand for power

&lt;p&gt;Operating earnings fell to $3.69 billion, or 36 cents per

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The tech industry maxim that "no one ever got fired for buying IBM" is a testament to how Big Blue has been the gold standard in computing services for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But IBM faces an unlikely challenger in Amazon.com Inc, the e-commerce retail giant that is becoming a force in the booming business of cloud computing, even winning backing from America's top spy agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of being dismissed as a supplier of online computer services to startups and small businesses, Amazon Web Services (AWS) beat out International Business Machines this year to snag a $600 million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has successfully appealed its loss in the contest, stalling it for now. But the episode highlights how Amazon is evolving from an online retailer into a competitive provider of information technology and services to big companies, and government bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has helped push Amazon shares to a new record ahead of the company's second-quarter results due on Thursday. Amazon doesn't break out AWS results, but Wall Street believes it is expanding faster than the retail business and is more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AWS is one of the main spokes of the bull case on Amazon shares," argues Ron Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities. "Software and IT investors are aware of and are trying to size AWS, and what the impact could be on their sector."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is entrenched in corporations across the globe; and with one of the industry's biggest research budgets, is likely to remain so for some time. But it and other players like Oracle are taking note of AWS as cloud computing takes off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public cloud computing, which AWS pioneered in 2006, lets companies rent computing power, storage and other services from data centers shared with other customers - typically cheaper and more flexible than maintaining their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon has begun to build a portfolio of significant clients, including Samsung, Pfizer, the Public Broadcasting Service and NASA, the U.S. space agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That unexpected threat is rippling through the sector. After two quarters of falling sales, Oracle announced partnerships in June with former foes Microsoft and Salesforce.com, a response in part to AWS's expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AWS is having a really meaningful impact on IT and the big incumbent companies like IBM are reacting to that now," said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Co, who covers Rackspace Hosting, one of Amazon's main rivals in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FROM BOOKSTORE TO TECH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon began life as an online bookseller, but in past years has expanded into everything from tablet computers to video. Critics say it is spending heavily with little regard for the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its stock hit a record $309.39 on July 16 and is up more than 22 percent this year.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 (Reuters) - The tech industry maxim
that "no one ever got fired for buying IBM" is a testament to
how Big Blue has been the gold standard in computing services
for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But IBM faces an unlikely challenger in Amazon.com Inc
, the e-commerce retail giant that is becoming a force
in the booming business of cloud computing, even winning backing
from America's top spy agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of being dismissed as a supplier of online
computer services to startups and small businesses, Amazon Web
Services (AWS) beat out International Business Machines 
this year to snag a $600 million contract with the Central
Intelligence Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has successfully appealed its loss in the contest,
stalling it for now. But the episode highlights how Amazon is
evolving from an online retailer into a competitive provider of
information technology and services to big companies, and
government bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has helped push Amazon shares to a new record ahead of
the company's second-quarter results due on Thursday. Amazon
doesn't break out AWS results, but Wall Street believes it is
expanding faster than the retail business and is more
profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AWS is one of the main spokes of the bull case on Amazon
shares," argues Ron Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities.
"Software and IT investors are aware of and are trying to size
AWS, and what the impact could be on their sector."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is entrenched in corporations across the globe; and with
one of the industry's biggest research budgets, is likely to
remain so for some time. But it and other players like Oracle
 are taking note of AWS as cloud computing takes off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public cloud computing, which AWS pioneered in 2006, lets
companies rent computing power, storage and other services from
data centers shared with other customers - typically cheaper and
more flexible than maintaining their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon has begun to build a portfolio of significant
clients, including Samsung, Pfizer, the
Public Broadcasting Service and NASA, the U.S. space agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That unexpected threat is rippling through the sector. After
two quarters of falling sales, Oracle announced partnerships in
June with former foes Microsoft and Salesforce.com
, a response in part to AWS's expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AWS is having a really meaningful impact on IT and the big
incumbent companies like IBM are reacting to that now," said
Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Co, who covers Rackspace
Hosting, one of Amazon's main rivals in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FROM BOOKSTORE TO TECH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon began life as an online bookseller, but in past years
has expanded into everything from tablet computers to video.
Critics say it is spending heavily with little regard for the
bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its stock hit a record $309.39 on July 16 and is up more
than 22 percent this year. In contrast, Oracle is down 4 percent
in 2013. IBM, which reported a fifth straight quarterly sales
fall on Wednesday, is up 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS slashed prices on one of its popular services, EC2, this
month and Rackspace shares promptly slid, leaving them down more
than 45 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS generates at least $2 billion a year in revenue now from
a total pie of more than $60 billion, according to analysts who
expect that to quintuple to more than $10 billion in coming
years, partly driven by higher government cloud spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tussle with IBM over the CIA contract has helped burnish
Amazon's credentials, increasing Wall Street's confidence in the
ability of AWS to compete with the big boys of enterprise IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five companies vied for the contract - AWS, IBM, Microsoft,
AT and another unidentified firm, according to a report
on the bidding by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When AWS won, IBM protested, triggering the report by the
GAO. The agency recommended in June that the CIA re-do some
parts of its contract negotiations, giving IBM another chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the GAO also stated that AWS's offering was superior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In every technical criterion Amazon out-scored IBM, one of
the most sophisticated and capable IT companies in the world,"
said Carlos Kirjner, an analyst at Bernstein Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CIA had "grave" concerns, according to the GAO report,
about IBM's ability to provide "auto-scaling," a feature that
automatically adds or removes computing power in response to
applications use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Auto-scaling is very complex and there are not many cloud
providers that can do it well, but Amazon is great at it," said
Kyle Hilgendorf, a cloud computing analyst at Gartner. "I don't
think anyone thinks IBM has a better cloud service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Clint Roswell said there were "inaccuracies"
in the government's assessment of its CIA proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM remains committed to providing enterprise-level secure

&lt;p&gt;CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt said on Monday it would cancel visa fees for Syrians, the latest effort to ease diplomatic tensions between the two Arab states after the army ousted President Mohamed Mursi this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mursi, a member of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood, had cut off diplomatic relations with Syria, led by President Bashar al-Assad, a follower of the Shi'ite's Alawite sect, last month at a rally packed with hardline Sunni Islamists calling for holy war in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt's army-backed administration that replaced Mursi has since tried to distance itself from his position, which analysts say could signal a desire to return to a role as a more neutral broker in the civil war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict between pro-democracy protesters and hardline Sunni militants and Assad's forces since March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Syrians have been displaced to Arab and international countries, including tens of thousands in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt's radio broadcast the news about the change in policy on Syrian visa on its main noon news show on Monday and said it was "meant to comfort the Syrian people".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy said on Saturday that Egypt has no intention of waging a holy war against Syria and was "re-examining" diplomatic ties with the war-torn country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Ministry spokesman Badr Abdelatty told Reuters the removal of the visa fees was "a sign of our full support for the Syrian people during this difficult period".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt still supported the "revolution" of the Syrian people, he added, but did not say if that included their call to oust Assad. Mursi repeatedly had called on Assad to step down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did it in order to ease the burden on our Syrian brothers," foreign ministry spokesman Abdelatty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syrians will still have to apply for visas, a measure introduced this month after media and some officials accused Syrian Sunni-Muslims of joining Mursi's supporters in their clashes with the military. More than 100 people were killed in the clashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Repeats to clarify President Assad's religious affiliation)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tom Finn; Editing by Michael Roddy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Alistair Barr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 (Reuters) - The tech industry maxim
that "no one ever got fired for buying IBM" is a testament to
how Big Blue has been the gold standard in computing services
for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But IBM faces an unlikely challenger in Amazon.com Inc
, the e-commerce retail giant that is becoming a force
in the booming business of cloud computing, even winning backing
from America's top spy agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of being dismissed as a supplier of online
computer services to startups and small businesses, Amazon Web
Services (AWS) beat out International Business Machines 
this year to snag a $600 million contract with the Central
Intelligence Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has successfully appealed its loss in the contest,
stalling it for now. But the episode highlights how Amazon is
evolving from an online retailer into a competitive provider of
information technology and services to big companies, and
government bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has helped push Amazon shares to a new record ahead of
the company's second-quarter results due on Thursday. Amazon
doesn't break out AWS results, but Wall Street believes it is
expanding faster than the retail business and is more
profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AWS is one of the main spokes of the bull case on Amazon
shares," argues Ron Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities.
"Software and IT investors are aware of and are trying to size
AWS, and what the impact could be on their sector."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is entrenched in corporations across the globe; and with
one of the industry's biggest research budgets, is likely to
remain so for some time. But it and other players like Oracle
 are taking note of AWS as cloud computing takes off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public cloud computing, which AWS pioneered in 2006, lets
companies rent computing power, storage and other services from
data centers shared with other customers - typically cheaper and
more flexible than maintaining their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon has begun to build a portfolio of significant
clients, including Samsung, Pfizer, the
Public Broadcasting Service and NASA, the U.S. space agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That unexpected threat is rippling through the sector. After
two quarters of falling sales, Oracle announced partnerships in
June with former foes Microsoft and Salesforce.com
, a response in part to AWS's expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AWS is having a really meaningful impact on IT and the big
incumbent companies like IBM are reacting to that now," said
Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Co, who covers Rackspace
Hosting, one of Amazon's main rivals in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FROM BOOKSTORE TO TECH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon began life as an online bookseller, but in past years
has expanded into everything from tablet computers to video.
Critics say it is spending heavily with little regard for the
bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its stock hit a record $309.39 on July 16 and is up more
than 22 percent this year. In contrast, Oracle is down 4 percent
in 2013. IBM, which reported a fifth straight quarterly sales
fall on Wednesday, is up 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS slashed prices on one of its popular services, EC2, this
month and Rackspace shares promptly slid, leaving them down more
than 45 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS generates at least $2 billion a year in revenue now from
a total pie of more than $60 billion, according to analysts who
expect that to quintuple to more than $10 billion in coming
years, partly driven by higher government cloud spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tussle with IBM over the CIA contract has helped burnish
Amazon's credentials, increasing Wall Street's confidence in the
ability of AWS to compete with the big boys of enterprise IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five companies vied for the contract - AWS, IBM, Microsoft,
AT and another unidentified firm, according to a report
on the bidding by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When AWS won, IBM protested, triggering the report by the
GAO. The agency recommended in June that the CIA re-do some
parts of its contract negotiations, giving IBM another chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the GAO also stated that AWS's offering was superior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In every technical criterion Amazon out-scored IBM, one of
the most sophisticated and capable IT companies in the world,"
said Carlos Kirjner, an analyst at Bernstein Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CIA had "grave" concerns, according to the GAO report,
about IBM's ability to provide "auto-scaling," a feature that
automatically adds or removes computing power in response to
applications use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Auto-scaling is very complex and there are not many cloud
providers that can do it well, but Amazon is great at it," said
Kyle Hilgendorf, a cloud computing analyst at Gartner. "I don't
think anyone thinks IBM has a better cloud service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Clint Roswell said there were "inaccuracies"
in the government's assessment of its CIA proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM remains committed to providing enterprise-level secure
and robust cloud solutions and looks forward to a renewed
opportunity to show our capabilities to fulfill the requirements
of this important agency," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment on the CIA
contract. A CIA spokesman also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM bought SoftLayer Technologies, a rival to AWS, for $2
billion in June. That could help it when the CIA comes calling
again, said Bill Moran at Ptak Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They do not need any other issue like 'auto-scaling' to
bedevil them the next time around," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 22 (Reuters) - The California electricity trades that
may bring JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co a record penalty stem from
a "flaw" in the regional trading system, highlighting why power
traders are increasingly anxious about a broad crackdown on the
market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank is working to close the book on an
investigation that dates back more than two years, when the
California Independent System Operator (ISO), the state's grid
operator, noticed that a then-unnamed market participant had
been using an "exploitative" trading strategy that had
effectively forced the grid to pay for a plant to sit idle,
ultimately adding to customers' costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan initially denied the accusations but is now
reportedly in talks with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) to settle the complaint for hundreds of
millions of dollars, a potentially record penalty for the
agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case comes amid a series of high-profile investigations
by FERC, which in 2005 was granted by Congress expanded powers
to pursue market malfeasance in the wake of the Enron scandal
and the 2000-2001 California energy debacle. FERC levied $470
million in penalties against Barclays PLC this week for
manipulating California power markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike traders' brazen efforts to choke off power
supplies and jack up rates for "Grandma Millie" a decade ago,
the recent activities stem from far more subtle gambits in which
traders may benefit whether prices go up or down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deeper focus on what appear to be less overt forms of
manipulation - or what some players would more likely deem
entrepreneurial trading - has sent shivers through the industry,
forcing companies to reassess the risk of participating in the
$200 billion U.S. physical power market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FERC is trying to convey where it views market activity
that might otherwise be permitted under the letter of the market
regulations to nonetheless be considered unlawful and, in FERC's
view, manipulation," said David Doot, a partner who covers
energy at law firm Day Pitney, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clients are revisiting what they are doing to make sure
(they) are OK and not skating too close to the line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a four-month period from March through June 2011, the
operators of the California and Midwest power grids - the
California ISO and Midwest ISO - made four different filings to
FERC to close market loopholes and alert regulators of the
bank's "abusive" bidding strategies. (ISOs are nonprofit public
entities responsible for operating power grids and running
competitive power markets.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISOs estimated three of the bidding techniques together
resulted in at least $73 million in improper payments, not
including "millions of dollars in payments from another
technique," according to a FERC lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLOSING LOOPHOLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a series of filings over the past two years, the
California ISO described what it called "exploitative bidding
practices" that amounted to bait-and-switch maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISO said JPMorgan "aggravated the market impact of (a)
flaw" of the "bid cost recovery" mechanism, which assures
generators will receive compensation for their power plant's
fixed startup and operating costs if the ISO asks their unit to
run but it fails to cover its costs from power sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISO also accused the bank of causing the misuse of
"exceptional dispatch," which is a system to activate power
plants on a last-minute basis as necessary to prevent unexpected
emergencies that could threaten grid reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC approved each of the ISOs' requests to change their
market rules and prevent further abuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's trading practices are outlined in the California
ISO's filings with FERC dating to March 2011, when it asked the
regulator to modify market rules that had been put in place in
April 2009, when the grid launched a new trading system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That month the ISO told JPMorgan it was notifying FERC's
Office of Enforcement of the bank's exploitative bidding
practices. But JPMorgan was not publicly identified as the
trader in question until FERC subpoenaed the bank in July 2012
to provide emails related to an investigation into market
manipulation in California and the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC closed the bid-cost-recovery loophole in May 2011 and
the exceptional-dispatch loophole in August 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a time line of FERC's investigation of JPMorgan, see:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC's outgoing chairman, Jon Wellinghoff, has said the
newly empowered enforcement team is targeting malfeasance, not
Wall Street, but traders still fear that its action could reduce
liquidity in the market, making prices more volatile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FERC likes having financial players in the markets because
they add capital and liquidity," said Marc Spitzer, a former
commissioner at FERC from 2006-2011 and currently a partner at
Washington law firm Steptoe &amp; Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But, we don't want them to manipulate an arguable gap in
the law that they managed to find."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW THE BANK DID IT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's trading activities in California revolved largely
around operations at a handful of power plants that JPMorgan
effectively operated under "tolling" arrangements. The plants
were owned by AES Corp, but JPMorgan was responsible for
fuel-supply and power sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under such agreements, the plant owner (AES) still operates
the facility, but the third party (JPMorgan) has a significant
amount of control over how and when the plant runs, based on its
contract and the profitability of its trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the California grid, JPMorgan took advantage of
a dynamic that is peculiar to physical power markets, which
operate on two different time frames: next-day and real-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the so-called day-ahead market, the grid solicits offers
to sell electricity for the coming day based on forecast demand
and other factors. The California ISO selects which power plants
will run based on competitive bids from generators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because capacity needs can vary widely depending on weather
conditions, the day of the week and other factors, the grid also
operates a real-time market, where spot prices and real
conditions require the grid to balance supply and demand on an
hourly basis. Prices can fluctuate wildly in this market,
spiking three- or fourfold in an hour if the grid is short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day-ahead bids include not only the price at which the
plant will sell electricity but also the startup costs and
minimum load costs it will incur. By selecting a plant to run,
the grid agrees to pay those fixed costs if the plant is
underutilized because, for example, electricity demand is lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The costs, which include fuel and other expenses, are repaid
only if the plant can't recover them through regular sales. They
are not disclosed for competitive reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is this minimum cost that JPMorgan is said to have
exploited to its own advantage. The ISO did not say how much the
bank reaped from this kind of trade, but the grid operator has
already recovered $52 million from power sellers due to such
deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's trading strategy, the ISO said, was to submit
bids with high minimum load costs but exceptionally low -
sometimes negative - power prices, making them attractive enough
for the grid to schedule the plant to run the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the following day's real-time market, JPMorgan would
change its prices, submitting very high bids that discouraged
the grid from "dispatching," or running, the plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would leave the unit running below its minimum level or
not at all, triggering a "minimum load" payment to cover those
costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To cover the previous day's sales, JPMorgan traders would
simply buy power supplies in the spot market - potentially
making a loss on the electricity trades themselves but more than
making up the difference when the grid paid to cover the fixed
startup and minimum load costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISO said the problem started in December 2010 when
bid-cost-recovery "uplift" charges reached $16 million, up from
previous monthly payments of $5 million to $11 million. In
January 2011 the ISO said uplift amounts surpassed $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXCEPTIONAL DISPATCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grid also said the bid-cost-recovery strategy increased
power costs by causing it to call on emergency reserve
generation under the "exceptional dispatch" system because some
plants were not meeting their day-ahead commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the day-ahead market, the ISO selects the units that will
produce energy as well as those that will be held in reserve.
Reserve units, which typically represent up to 7 percent of
forecast daily demand, stand ready to operate in case of an
unexpected shutdown or surge in demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By removing its units from the real-time market, JPMorgan's
bidding strategy in some cases also removed units from the pool
of reserve capacity, which sometimes forced the ISO to dispatch
other units to maintain required reserves at much higher prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISO said in just five days in April 2011 it paid out
$3.6 million in exceptional-dispatch payments related to the
bidding strategies. It did not say who profited from these
payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, JPMorgan sold the tolling agreements for three AES
plants to California power company Southern California Edison, a
unit of Edison International.&lt;/p&gt;

      2012 and April 1, 2012, with the financial results of its Animal Health 
      business reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. 
      These statements were derived from the historical statements of income 
      of Pfizer for the respective periods. Pfizer&#8217;s press release announcing

      On June 24, 2013, Pfizer completed the full disposition of Zoetis Inc. 
      (Zoetis), which was achieved through a series of steps, including the 
      formation of Zoetis, a separate company to which Pfizer transferred 
      substantially all of its animal health assets and liabilities, an 
      initial public offering of a 19.8% interest in Zoetis and an exchange 
      offer for the remaining 80.2% interest. The financial results of Zoetis, 
      the standalone public company, may differ from the financial results of 
      the Animal Health business reflected in Pfizer&#8217;s statements of income as 
      a discontinued operation, as the components of this business differed 
      from Zoetis.

		&lt;p&gt;BIRMINGHAM, AL--(Marketwired - July 23, 2013) -
 Walter Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT), a leading, publicly traded "pure-play" producer of metallurgical coal for the global steel industry, today provided preliminary operating results for the second quarter 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We significantly reduced costs in the second quarter led by strong performance from our Alabama premium hard coking coal mines," said Walt Scheller, Chief Executive Officer. "I am pleased with our operational progress, however our financial results for the quarter still reflect the significant ongoing weakness in the global met coal market. While the short-term outlook for global met coal pricing remains depressed, we continue to maintain our focus on operating safely and efficiently, lowering costs and improving our financial performance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Production&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second quarter 2013 metallurgical (met) coal production is expected to total approximately 2.9 million metric tons (MMTs), up approximately 7% compared with first quarter 2013. Higher production in the quarter was driven by an increase of 0.4 MMTs from the Company's low-volatility (low-vol) and mid-volatility (mid-vol) mines in Alabama. Met coal cash cost of production per metric ton (MT) is expected to have declined by more than 10%, or over $10 per MT, compared with the first quarter of 2013. Production cost per MT in the Company's low-vol and mid-vol mines in Alabama declined 14%, while per ton met cash costs of production in the Canadian operations also declined despite lower production volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy expects to report second quarter 2013 met coal sales of approximately 2.4 MMTs, a decrease from the first quarter of approximately 0.3 MMTs, primarily due to late arrival of vessels. The Company expects met coal cash cost of sales per MT to increase by approximately 2% in the second quarter of 2013 as a result of a charge to restate ending inventory at the lower of cost or market ("LCM") that reflects a projected decline in third quarter 2013 met coal and low-vol PCI prices. Excluding the LCM charge to ending inventory, met coal cash cost of sales per MT would be slightly improved versus the first quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Release and Conference Call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Company also announced that in conjunction with the release of its second quarter 2013 earnings results before market open on Thursday, August 1, 2013, it will conduct a conference call with institutional investors and analysts to be broadcast live over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What:&#160;Walter Energy's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When:&#160;Thursday, Aug. 1, 2013 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where: &#160;www.walterenergy.com

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - After years of nationalist rhetoric and protectionist policies, Argentina is seeking to lure foreign investment to its Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas field in an bid to jumpstart the country's energy sector and reverse a decline in output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a year after stunning the market by seizing the country's biggest energy company, YPF, the government eased regulations to sign a $1.24 billion production contract with U.S.-based Chevron Corp (CVX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal was seen as a breakthrough for Argentina as it tries to regain energy sufficiency and could be a turning point for investment in a country that has been locked out of the international capital markets since its 2002 sovereign default and has not yet compensated Spain's Repsol (REP.MC) for the nationalization of YPF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the government's change of course carries a political risk ahead of October's mid-term elections, a vote that will determine whether President Cristina Fernandez keeps control of the Congress. The opposition accuses her of flipflopping on core values by offering too much to the U.S. oil major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Argentina must move forward with shale gas development. Unfortunately, in a context where the country is no longer credible, it was necessary to give more," said a local oil consultant who requested anonymity in order to speak freely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron on July 16 inked the deal with the now state-controlled YPF (YPFD.BA) to tap into Vaca Muerta, thought to be one of the largest energy reserves in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the Chevron deal done, the government loosened up its foreign exchange regulations which have helped define the presidency of Fernandez. She was re-elected in 2011 on promises to increase the state's role in Latin America's third-biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a surprising move, the government issued a decree just a day before the Chevron contract was announced last Tuesday that allows oil companies investing at least $1 billion over five years to export - tax free - up to 20 percent of the crude and natural gas they produce in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that explore Vaca Muerta and export from the field will also be allowed to keep their earnings in foreign exchange outside the South American country - a benefit denied to companies in other ventures, which are still required to repatriate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLICY DEPARTURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy moves were quite a departure for Fernandez, who in May 2012 shocked the oil sector by seizing a 51-percent stake in YPF from its former parent company Repsol. Fernandez said at the time the takeover was part of a push toward resource nationalization and higher energy production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts and opposition figures said the Chevron deal looked less like a sign of policy flexibility than a step backward in terms of the tough stance that Fernandez has always taken with the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government went right to its knees in order to bring investment here," said Federico Sturzenegger, a center-right candidate running for Congress in the October vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A local firm, Bridas Energy, has also signed a preliminary deal with YPF to drill in Vaca Muerta, but Chevron is the first company to finalize investment plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success that Argentina has in attracting more companies to the mega field may depend on concessions offered by the government as it seeks to quell nerves over the 2012 takeover of YPF as well as its heavy-handed regulation of the nation's economy and lingering fallout from its massive 2002 debt default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, inflation, measured by private economists at 25 percent and exacerbated by generous public spending ahead of the October vote, has added to investor worries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial and political stakes are high for Fernandez. Argentina's trade deficit in energy alone is at $4.5 billion over the last 12 months and it currently imports about a fourth of the natural gas that it consumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government has realized it needs private investment to develop Vaca Muerta and regain energy self-sufficiency, the lack of which puts a heavy burden on its trade balance and fiscal accounts," said Ignacio Labaqui, who analyzes Argentina for New York-based consultancy Medley Global Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Department of Energy report has shown Argentina holds 802 trillion cubic feet of natural gas trapped in shale rock and 27 billion barrels of oil, the bulk of it located in Vaca Muerta. That would make Argentina the second largest holder of shale gas reserves after China and No. 4 in shale oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Hugh Bronstein, editing by G Crosse)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists entirely of 
      30-year fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to borrowers with strong credit 
      profiles and full documentation. Strong borrower quality is reflected in 
      the 769 weighted average (WA) original FICO, 66.3% WA CLTV, $543,551 WA 
      household income and $2.4 million WA liquid reserves. In addition, 
      third-party due diligence was conducted on 100% of the pool and the 
      results indicated strong underwriting controls.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Weak Representations and Warranties Framework: While the transaction 
      benefits from JPMCB, J.P. Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Corp. (JPMMAC) 
      (rated A+/F1) and FRB (rated BBB+/F2) as rep providers for approximately 
      98.2% of the pool, Fitch believes the value of the RW framework is 
      diluted by the presence of qualifying and conditional language, as well 
      as by the inclusion of sunset provisions, each of which substantially 
      reduce lender loan breach liability. While the agency believes that the 
      high credit quality pool and clean diligence results mitigate the RW 
      risks to some degree, Fitch considered the weaker framework in its 
      analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High Geographic Concentration: The pools' primary concentration risk is 
      California, where 49% of the properties are located. In addition, 54.6% 
      of the properties are located in the pool's top five regions, 
      representing MSAs in California, New York and Illinois. The pool has 
      significant regional concentrations that resulted in an additional 
      penalty of approximately 32% to the pool's lifetime default expectation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how 
      the ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than 
      assumed at both the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and national 
      levels. The implied rating sensitivities are only an indication of some 
      of the potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors that 
      the transaction may become exposed to or be considered in the 
      surveillance of the transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected 
      lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The 
      model currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For 
      one of the top 10 regions in the mortgage pool, 
      Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL (6.5% of the mortgage pool), Fitch's SHP 
      model does not project declines in home prices. Fitch conducted 
      sensitivity analyses assuming sMVDs of 10%, 15%, and 20% for this 
      identified metropolitan area. The sensitivity analyses indicated no 
      impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model projected 15.6% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.

      In its analysis, Fitch considered placing a greater emphasis on recent 
      economic performance in determining market value declines. While Fitch's 
      current loan loss model looks to three years of historical data and one 
      year of projections, this does not incorporate recent notable economic 
      improvement. To reflect the more recent economic environment, a 
      sensitivity analysis was performed using two years of historical 
      economic data and two years of projections. The result of this 
      sensitivity analysis was included in the consideration of the loss 
      expectations for this transaction. This sensitivity analysis resulted in 
      a base sMVD of 14.5%, down from 15.6%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the

      ExxonMobil Foundation&#8217;s 2012 Educational Matching Gift Program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil Foundation contributed unrestricted grants of $484,783 to 
      match donations of $181,161 from employees, retirees, directors and 
      surviving spouses. This investment includes gifts from employees of XTO 
      Energy Inc., an ExxonMobil subsidiary. XTO Energy has offices in Lakin 
      and Garden City with a nine-county operating area in the state of Kansas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The program matches donor pledges 3:1 up to $7,500 to qualified colleges 
      and universities in the United States along with the American Indian 
      College Fund, Hispanic Scholarship Fund and the United Negro College 
      Fund. Since the Educational Matching Gift Program began in 1962, more

      volunteerism and philanthropy. The corporation and foundation share that 
      philosophy and are proud to join them in their generous support,&#8221; said 
      Suzanne McCarron, president of the ExxonMobil Foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although grants are unrestricted, recipients are encouraged to designate 
      a portion to math and science programs supporting student engagement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nationwide, 871 institutions received $40.2 million through the 2012 
      Educational Matching Gift Program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the Educational Matching Gift Program, ExxonMobil and the

      science fields, as well as teacher training initiatives.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron Corp
 said it awarded contracts worth 550 million pounds

Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said on Tuesday that it signed deals for

 and that the manufacturing would take place in British
facilities in Leeds, Aberdeen and Newcastle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final investment decisions for Chevron's Alder oil field in
the central North Sea and its Rosebank field off the west coast
of the Shetlands are due later this year and in 2014
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both projects have received support from UK government
efforts to stimulate new developments through field allowances,"
said Craig May, managing director of Chevron Upstream Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain is focused on maximising its remaining North Sea
resources and is looking to the oil industry to help revive the
economy in the wake of big falls in production in recent years
which have acted as a drag on growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Rosebank and Alder projects are worth billions of
pounds and will unlock significant new oil and gas reserves,"
British Energy Minister Michael Fallon said.&lt;/p&gt;

			Columbus, Ohio, the Nation&#8217;s 15th-largest City, Selects Tyler 
      Technologies for Microsoft Dynamics&#174; AX 2012 
      for the Public Sector
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Columbus chooses Tyler for its deep public sector experience, history 
      of successful implementations, and ability to deliver Dynamics AX as a 
      cloud-based solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tyler Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: TYL) has signed an agreement with the 
      City of Columbus, Ohio, to implement Microsoft 
      Dynamics&#174; AX as the core financial application to replace 
      the city&#8217;s aging financial management system. Dynamics AX is an enterprise 
      resource planning (ERP) solution with public sector functionality 
      that Tyler Technologies jointly developed with Microsoft&#174;. 
      The contract, valued at approximately $5 million, includes software 
      licenses, implementation, hosting services and support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The City chose Tyler after a multi-year search for a new financial 
      management system to replace its nearly 15-year-old system that was no 
      longer being meaningfully updated by its provider and was nearing the 
      end of its product life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The City will access the Dynamics AX platform as a cloud-based solution 
      through hosting facilities managed entirely by experienced Tyler 
      professionals. Tyler&#8217;s facilities provide highly scalable infrastructure 
      and applications. The cloud environment also delivers a lower total cost 
      of ownership and predictable costs compared with the high costs of 
      buying hardware and hiring dedicated resources to manage an on-premise 
      deployment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to reviewing system capabilities, the City Auditor&#8217;s office 
      heavily weighted suppliers&#8217; public sector knowledge and experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our process was as much about finding a partner as it was the system 
      itself. We viewed it as not just acquiring software, but finding a 
      service provider that was willing to invest time and resources to learn 
      how we work, and show us commitment beyond the standard RFP response,&#8221; 
      said Tom Noorkah, financial systems administrator for the City of 
      Columbus. &#8220;The depth of Tyler&#8217;s proposal showed their detailed 
      understanding of the City, our needs and our processes. That, coupled 
      with the robust Dynamics AX platform, is why Tyler was the best fit.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to Tyler&#8217;s deep domain expertise, the City of Columbus liked 
      that Dynamics AX is intuitive, up to date, and would be easy for the 
      city&#8217;s more than 700 core users to adopt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;A lot of RD has gone into Microsoft&#8217;s Dynamics platform, so it&#8217;s a 
      very fresh and up-to-date application. It looks like Outlook&#174; 
      and interacts with Excel&#174;, both of which are very familiar to 
      our users. This familiarity should reduce the learning curve when 
      navigating a new application and help increase user adoption as we roll 
      it out,&#8221; Noorkah said. &#8220;With the Dynamics platform, the City can 
      leverage its existing investment in the Microsoft technology stack, and 
      Microsoft&#8217;s Technology Adopter Program gives the City a voice in ongoing 
      product design by letting us participate in usability studies and 
      feature design, as well as help influence product direction.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the City&#8217;s review process, the auditor&#8217;s staff reviewed details 
      on each supplier&#8217;s implementation history.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We compared original and final project budgets, and especially focused 
      on timelines because when you&#8217;re working on a project of this size, you 
      want to have a partner with a positive track record of estimating the 
      level of effort truly needed to implement its product and a history of 
      finishing projects in the amount of time originally proposed and within 
      the original budget,&#8221; said Darlene Wildes, senior accountant and project 
      manager for the City of Columbus. &#8220;During the review process, we 
      developed a real trust in Tyler that they are upfront and accurate in 
      the amount of time and resources it will take to deliver a successful 
      implementation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Columbus is Ohio&#8217;s capital, and with approximately 800,000 residents it 
      is the state&#8217;s largest city and home to several Fortune 500 companies as 
      well as The Ohio State University. Columbus, the 15th-largest city in 
      the U.S. by population, has a $770 million general fund operating budget 
      for 2013, and is the only U.S. city of its size to have an AAA credit 
      rating from all three national rating agencies. For 33 consecutive 
      years, the City has achieved a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence 
      in Financial Reporting for its Comprehensive 
      Annual Financial Report (CAFR) from the Government Finance Officers 
      Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Columbus City Auditor Hugh Dorrian leads a progressive and innovative 
      auditing department that is well-respected and known for its financial 
      reporting excellence,&#8221; said John S. Marr Jr., Tyler&#8217;s president and CEO. 
      &#8220;We are proud to partner with the City of Columbus in transforming its 
      core financial operations by combining Tyler&#8217;s municipal expertise with 
      the scalable architecture and deep functionality of Microsoft Dynamics 
      AX for the public sector.&#8221;

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to J.P. Morgan 
      Mortgage Trust 2013-3 Certificates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigns preliminary ratings to nineteen 
      classes of mortgage pass-through certificates from J.P. Morgan Mortgage 
      Trust 2013-3, a jumbo prime RMBS transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mortgage pool backing J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 2013-3 is comprised 
      of 389 first-lien mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of 
      $345,048,665 as of the cut-off date. The loans in the pool are all 
      fixed-rate mortgages with 30-year maturities. Thirty-three of the loans 
      are interest-only for ten years. The pool is characterized by 
      substantial borrower equity in each mortgaged property, as evidenced by 
      the weighted average LTV (64%) and CLTV (66%). The weighted average 
      credit score of the mortgage pool is 763, which is within the &#8220;prime&#8221; 
      mortgage range.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction included a loan-level analysis of the 
      mortgage pools using our Residential Mortgage Default and Loss Model, 
      together with a review of the key transaction parties, results of loan 
      file reviews performed by independent third party firms and review of 
      the legal structure and key documentation. This analysis is further 
      described in our U.S. RMBS Rating Methodology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;The single platform virtualization infrastructure is a thing of the 
      past. Today, IT administrators are leveraging various virtualization 
      platforms to reduce costs and manage workloads. VTUG&#8217;s goal is to 
      educate and provide the latest industry technical content and 
      information to make informed decisions about what and how to implement 
      next-generation virtualization technology,&#8221; said Chris Harney, VTUG 
      president and cofounder. &#8220;The Silicon Valley Slam will kick-off our West 
      Coast expansion and help foster the local network of virtualization 
      experts that are examining and implementing the future of virtualization 
      and hybrid computing models.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As the only virtualization user group that is platform-agnostic, the 
      VTUG expansion will provide Silicon Valley members with the 
      cross-platform technical content, information and education on 
      virtualization platforms from all major vendors including VMware, 
      Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Citrix and Red Hat, as well as 
      complementary technologies in system management, storage virtualization 
      and backup. In aggregating all the virtualization technical content in 
      one place, members use VTUG services to improve productivity, reduce the 
      number of hours doing research and readily find relevant content for 
      critical technical projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Oded Haner, chief technology officer of HotLink and the Silicon Valley 
      VTUG leader, said, &#8220;As a long-time CIO, I spent a tremendous amount of 
      time with my IT team collecting, evaluating and discussing 
      virtualization and cloud technologies with our peers. One of the key 
      problems was sorting through all the marketing hype. VTUG has a strong 
      track record of coalescing technical content from all the key 
      virtualization players, from the Fortune 500 to leading-edge startups, 
      so IT professionals have a single place to go for the best 
      platform-independent virtualization information available.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Chevron Awards Contracts to United Kingdom Suppliers for Alder and 
      Rosebank Projects Valued at Over a Half Billion Pounds
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron North Sea Limited announced today that it has awarded a number 
      of contracts for its Alder and Rosebank major capital projects to UK 
      suppliers to a total value of over &#163;550 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The subsea equipment vendor contract for the Rosebank project has been 
      awarded to OneSubsea UK Limited (formerly Cameron Limited). The contract 
      package includes the engineering, supply, and manufacturing of subsea 
      manifolds, subsea trees and subsea control systems. Equipment 
      manufacturing will take place at various locations in the UK, including 
      at their facility in Leeds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Three contracts have been awarded for the Alder project, also to UK 
      vendors:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Detailed engineering, procurement, installation and commissioning of 
        the complete subsea system, including the main subsea manifold, subsea 
        isolation valve manifold, 28 kilometers of pipe-in-pipe flow line, 
        umbilical and tie-in spools, awarded to Technip. This work will be 
        carried out in Aberdeen, Evanton and Newcastle.
      
			
        Design, manufacture and supply of two high pressure, high temperature 
        (HPHT) vertical, subsea monobore trees and wellheads, awarded to 
        OneSubsea UK Limited at their Leeds facility.
      
			
        Design, manufacture and supply of the subsea control system, including 
        the hydraulic and electrical components to be installed both at subsea 
        and on the Britannia Bridge Linked Platform (BLP), to Aker Solutions 
        at their Aberdeen facility.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These projects are of great importance to Chevron&#8217;s growth strategy in 
      the UK, representing new production West of Shetland and in the Central 
      North Sea,&#8221; said Craig May, Managing Director of Chevron Upstream Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These contract awards, made prior to Final Investment Decisions (FID), 
      represent long lead item commitments to enable us to protect schedules 
      in a very competitive market for goods and services. They also 
      demonstrate our ongoing belief in the UKCS as a place to invest, and our 
      confidence in the expertise of the UK supply chain, particularly in 
      subsea design, engineering and manufacturing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Both projects have received support from UK government efforts to 
      stimulate new developments through field allowances. This support 
      further demonstrates the importance of industry and government working 
      together to maximise the economic production of the UK&#8217;s hydrocarbon 
      reserves,&#8221; added May.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rosebank has achieved two milestone events recently, with the submission 
      to government for approval of both the Environmental Statement and the 
      Field Development Plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the announcement, Energy Minister Michael Fallon said:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement by Chevron is very good news for the UK economy 
      and our world-class supply chain. The North Sea is seeing a resurgence 
      of investment and it is great to see companies like Chevron recognising 
      that &#8216;made in Britain&#8217; is a hallmark for the highest quality.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;From Aberdeen, Leeds and Newcastle this half a billion pound investment 
      will support hundreds of highly skilled jobs in engineering, design and 
      manufacturing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Rosebank and Alder projects are worth billions of pounds and will 
      unlock significant new oil and gas reserves. They demonstrate how 
      development in technology and the right relationship between government 
      and industry boosts production and provides energy security, jobs and 
      investment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Notes to editors
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rosebank will be Chevron&#8217;s first deep water development in the UK.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Chevron-operated Rosebank project is located approximately 80 miles 
      (130 kilometers) north -west of the Shetland Islands, in water depths of 
      approximately 3,600 feet (1,100 meters). The project will include a 
      Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel, production 
      and water injection wells, subsea facilities and a gas export pipeline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rosebank field, discovered in 2004, is estimated to contain total 
      potentially recoverable oil-equivalent resources of 240 million barrels. 
      The Rosebank owners are Chevron North Sea Limited (operator) with a 40 
      percent equity interest; Statoil (U.K.) Limited (30 percent); OMV (U.K.) 
      Limited (20 percent) and DONG EP (UK) Limited (10 percent).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Alder is a technically challenging project that has taken many years to 
      bring to economic development through a combination of technology 
      development and commercial conditions. Discovered in 1975, the field is 
      located approximately 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the Scottish 
      coastline and 37 miles (60 kilometers) from the UK/Norway median line. 
      The high pressure high temperature (HPHT) gas condensate field lies in 
      water depths of approximately 492 feet (150 meters) and it will be 
      developed via a subsea tie back to the existing Britannia Bridge Linked 
      Platform (BLP) in Block 16/26.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s presence in the UKCS spans about 50 years, with the company 
      continuing to contribute significant sums to the UK economy in terms of 
      base business expenditures, taxation, jobs and technology development, 
      as well as ongoing investments in new operated and non-operated 
      projects. Through this and its international and global operations, 
      which utilise UK design, engineering and manufacturing in its worldwide 
      projects, Chevron&#8217;s contribution to the UK economy is of the order of 
      &#163;10 billion in just the last five years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - A key witness is scheduled to
testify on Tuesday in the U.S.  Securities and Exchange
Commission's case accusing former Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice
Tourre of misleading investors in a 2007 bond deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC has said in court papers that Laura Schwartz, a
former executive at a bond insurer, will testify that Tourre
told her that hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co Inc was backing the deal.
Her testimony is central to the SEC's case that Tourre hid from
investors the fact that Paulson &amp; Co was in fact betting against
the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tourre case, which began last week in federal court in
New York, is one of the biggest brought by the SEC over the
events leading up to the financial crisis of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the SEC, Paulson &amp; Co came to Goldman Sachs
looking for a way to bet against the subprime mortgage market.
They came up with a $2 billion synthetic collateralized debt
obligation tied to mortgage securities that became known as
Abacus 2007-AC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Goldman brought on a subsidiary of bond insurer ACA
Capital Holdings Inc to help select the mortgage securities
underlying Abacus, Tourre allegedly misled ACA by failing to
disclose that Paulson was selecting toxic securities for the
deal and planned to bet against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which was also initially a
defendant when the case was filed in 2010, settled for $550
million without admitting or denying the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, who left ACA in late 2007 and now works at the
Seaport Group, was the main point of contact with Tourre and
Paulson &amp; Co, the SEC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She can testify that she understood Paulson would be an
equity investor in Abacus and the role that understanding played
in ACA's decision to participate in the deal, the SEC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Tourre have said they will question Schwartz's
credibility by focusing on a recently concluded probe by the SEC
of Schwartz's role in a different transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz received a so-called Wells notice in February
indicating that SEC was considering recommending a case against
her over that transaction. Then, a week before Tourre's trial,
Schwartz's lawyers notified the court that the SEC staff had
decided against bringing a case against her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, former ACA Chief Executive Alan Roseman told the
court that ACA would have stopped the Abacus deal "in its
tracks" if Paulson's real role had been known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, a former executive at Paulson &amp; Co, Paolo
Pellegrini, testified that he believed he told Schwartz about
Paulson's strategy of betting against the U.S. housing market
before the Abacus transaction closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's 
commodity trading arm is looking to sell more of the electricity
deals it has with U.S. power plants and wind farms, a source
familiar with the business said on Wednesday, at a time when
Wall Street's involvement in physical commodity markets is under
heightened scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called power tolling and marketing deals cover enough
electricity to light up Indiana's 2.8 million homes, according
to detailed regulatory filings, and include almost 3,000
megawatts of power generation spread across nine states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential sale follows the company's move to largely
exit the California power market in May, where the bank has been
embroiled in a market manipulation scandal. The bank is
reportedly close to a more than $400 million settlement with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear if formal discussions have been held with
possible buyers for the agreements, which allow the firm to buy
fuel and sell power on behalf of the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank's commodity arm has already divested more than
50 percent of its tolling agreements this year after the sale of
around 3,600 megawatts of capacity to Edison International in
California two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's commodity division, known as JPMorgan Ventures
Energy Corporation, also owns interests in three power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining tolling agreements include one with privately
held Tenaska's 844 MW Lindsay Hill plant in Alabama, which
produces enough electricity to power 800,000 homes in the state,
according to the company's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Tenaska said the company had no knowledge
of JPMorgan's plans. The bank's commodity traders provide the
fuel and own the power produced by the facility, she added in an
email, but declined to disclose further terms of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other deals include a marketing agreement with Algonquin
Power to sell around 400 MW of capacity from three wind farm
projects in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Texas. Those deals, which
were originally set to last 10 to 15 years, were signed less
than nine months ago. A spokesperson for Algonquin did not
respond to telephone calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan does not plan to exit physical power markets
entirely, the source said, and will continue to trade physical
and financial electricity contracts in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A power trader at an energy hedge fund, who previously
worked for a large Wall Street firm, said he saw banks
retreating from the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the FERC market manipulation cases, I'm not sure the
banks have the appetite to keep trading in power - unless they
have a customer that wants them to do it," the hedge fund trader
said. He declined to be named because he is not authorized to
speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased regulation and bank capital requirements have led
some banks to review their exposure to physical commodity
trading, while total revenues from the sector have fallen by
about 50 percent across Wall Street from a peak above $12
billion between 2007 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POWER PLANTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pullback comes as political and regulatory scrutiny of
Wall Street's role in physical commodity trading intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Senate Banking Committee hearing in Washington on Tuesday
questioned whether banks should be allowed to own physical
commodity assets such as pipelines, refineries and metal
warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on Friday, the U.S. Federal Reserve issued a surprise
statement saying it was rethinking a decade-old decision
allowing banks to trade in physical commodities market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the Fed was thought to be primarily debating the
right of commercial banks to own physical trading assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation acquired a number of
U.S. power plants, tolling agreements and marketing arrangements
after it acquired  Bear Stearns and RBS Sempra during the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2007, Bear Stearns' commodity arm, Houston-based
Bear Energy, acquired the rights to more than 9,000 MW of
electric power output after purchasing Williams Power Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has sold many of the power plants it inherited from
Bear Stearns in 2008, according to a source familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's commodities division still has an equity
interest in three entities that own power plants in the United
States, which are held as merchant banking investments or other
permissible investments, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the plants, the 545 MW Kinder Jackson facility that
powers roughly half a million homes in Michigan, is also
embroiled in the FERC market manipulation case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other equity interests held by the commodity arm are in
the 230 MW Brandywine power plant in Maryland and a small 75 MW
biomass plant in Florida, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case against JPMorgan revolves around an FERC accusation
that the bank's commodity arm used an elaborate trading scheme
to try to make loss-making plants profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the FERC imposed a record $470 million fine
against Barclays Plc and four of its traders for
manipulating U.S. power markets between 2006 and 2008. Barclays
has said it will fight the fine in Federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's commodity division also want to sell its Henry
Bath metals warehousing business, according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has put Wall
Street banks and other big traders on notice that their metals
warehousing businesses might be investigated following years of
complaints about inflated prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan  also owns interests in power plants and wind farms
through its private equity arm, JPMorgan Capital Partners, and
JPMorgan Infrastructure Investments Group, its asset management
division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amgen Inc, the world's largest biotechnology company, has lined up Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Barclays Plc to finance a potential deal for Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc, according to three people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen, whose preliminary $120 per-share offer for Onyx was rejected by the company's board last month, is still keen to buy the cancer drugmaker and waiting to see if a higher competing offer will materialize, the people said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the sources asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. Onyx, Amgen, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Barclays declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onyx put itself up for sale on June 30, citing expressions of interest from Amgen and other third parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company, which closed at $86.82 on June 28 before news of the sale process, have since surged more than 50 percent to trade above $130, valuing the South San Francisco, California-based company at around $9.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steep price gains, as well as the floor price that Amgen has set with its initial $120 per-share offer, deterred several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that would otherwise have been interested in bidding, people familiar with the matter have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen has faced growing pressure to beef up its drug development pipeline as safety concerns trimmed sales of its flagship anemia drugs, while patents on four of Amgen's five top-selling drugs are set to expire, starting in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is best-known for these and other medicines used in supportive care of cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen Chief Executive Bob Bradway, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, took over from Kevin Sharer just over a year ago. Amgen shares have rallied since then as investors applauded the company's higher dividends and share repurchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's late-stage pipeline has several cancer drug candidates, including some acquired through takeovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer medicines are the holy grail for many drugmakers because of the limited effectiveness of current products and huge prices that can be charged for new biotech treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onyx sells Nexavar, a treatment for liver and kidney cancer, and the new colon cancer drug Stivarga - both in partnership with Germany's Bayer AG. Onyx last year began selling Kyprolis for multiple myeloma, which some analysts estimate will reach peak annual sales of $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Soyoung Kim and Jessica Toonkel in New York, additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson; editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Gold forecasts stay as no significant Fed tapering seen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Copper, iron ore least preferred over 12 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Most preferred include lead, zinc, palladium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is
sticking to its average forecast of $1,413 for an ounce of gold
this year as it does not see sharp reductions in U.S. Federal
Reserve stimulus, after fears of such cuts drove bullion prices
to near three-year lows recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note issued on Wednesday, Goldman said it also expected
gold to average $1,165 an ounce in 2014 as previously forecast,
although the price could reach $1,050 by the year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spot price of gold traded around $1,319 at 3:40
pm. EDT (1940 GMT). The market is down 20 percent on the year
after a selloff last month sparked by Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke's announcement of plans to curtail the central bank's
monthly bond purchases of $85 billion. The Fed stimulus has
fueled much of the highs in gold prices since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While gold has rebounded from a near three-year low of
$1,180.71 hit on June 28 after Bernanke assured that any
stimulus tapering would not be disruptive, many see the market
dropping further down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it expected gold to actually trade lower at
times than the averages forecast for this year and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Specifically, we expect gold prices to trade around $1,300
until year-end given our economists' expectation for lackluster
growth near term," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the market's downside was also expected to be muted by
the Fed's renewed position on stimulus cutbacks, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recent communication by Fed officials has emphasized that
the overall level of monetary accommodation will not be reduced
significantly," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said its "least preferred commodities" in the next
12-month period were copper and iron ore. Its most preferred,
relative to spot prices, included lead, zinc, palladium and hard
coking coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlook for copper and iron ore came as came as top
metals buyer China continued to report data indicating a
slowdown in its massive manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they (Goldman) are correct in saying that we
probably will see weaker supply demand equation for the base
metals than might have been thought previously," said Bill
O'Neill, partner of New Jersey-based commodities investment firm
LOGIC Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, we have markets like aluminum, which is in
oversupply."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman cut its forecast for aluminium to $1,866 a
tonne this year from $2,050. For 2014, the forecast was reduced
to $1,950 from a previous estimate of $2,050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its projection for nickel dropped to $14,821 a tonne
in 2013, from $16,625. For next year, the forecast was revised
to $14,750 from $17,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's platinum price forecast for 2013 fell to
$1,483 an ounce from $1,575. For next year, it anticipated the
price at $1,463, versus an earlier estimate for $1,600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In palladium, the outlook fell to $743 an ounce this
year from $781. For 2014, Goldman forecast $795 an ounce, down
from $925 an ounce previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With lead, the Wall Street bank dropped its forecast
to $2,098 a tonne from a previous $2,163. For 2014, its estimate
fell to $2,225 from $2,338.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In zinc, Goldman cut its forecast to $1,900 a tonne
from $2,103 a tonne. For next year, its expectation was for
$2,050 a tonne versus a previous $2,175 a tonne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 24 (Reuters) - London's West End lost nearly
200 million euros ($264 million) in retail revenue last year due
to tough visa requirements keeping Chinese tourists away, a
report by tax-free shopping facilitator Global Blue said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrods' managing director Michael Ward said in the report
that Chinese tourists were the luxury department store's most
important customers, and that Britain's current visa arrangement
was "narrow-minded".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending by Chinese tourists abroad rose 58 percent, as they
traveled to find cheap deals on luxury goods, making them the
highest-spending travelers in the world, the report showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Britain's strict visa application process, which
requires applicants to visit British embassies, has kept many
Chinese tourists away from London's upmarket retail districts of
Bond Street and Chelsea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian tourists, who are the second-biggest shoppers, face
up to two months' waiting time for a British visa, whereas one
for Europe's 26-country Schengen Area can take as little as
three days to process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report showed that tourists favour travel to the
Schengen zone because of its straightforward visa process and
widespread use - it is accepted in all member countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Blue operates a network of tax refund points for
foreign shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese shoppers were shown to prefer buying clothing, while
Russians most commonly bought watches and jewelry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chinese tourists often prefer to shop in Europe where they
can save as much as 50 percent on luxury goods," said Dai Bin,
president of the China Tourism Academy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France was ranked the top destination for Chinese tourists,
with nearly 10 percent higher growth in Chinese visitors than
Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany ranked second with a 76 percent increase in Chinese
visitors, boosted by flights from China landing at Frankfurt
airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also showed that Chinese tourists favour
Singapore as a short-haul shopping destination.

			JaffeGlenn Law Group Files Class-Action Lawsuit Against Servisair, LLC
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Airport Workers Say Company Intentionally Cheated Them Out of OT 
      Pay
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JaffeGlenn Law Group filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of workers 
      at several of the nation&#8217;s largest airports who contend Servisair, LLC, 
      deliberately denied them overtime pay, docked them for lunches they 
      never took, and even implemented a timekeeping system that automatically 
      reduced the time they worked each day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The more than 170 initial plaintiffs include ramp workers, cargo 
      handlers, refuelers, cleaners and plane deicers who are employed by 
      Servisair at New York&#8217;s LaGuardia and JFK airports, Miami International 
      Airport, Boston Logan International Airport and Chicago O&#8217;Hare 
      International Airport. In all, Servisair employs more than 5,000 such 
      workers at 30 airports across the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Servisair willingly refuses to pay its employees when they work more 
      than 40 hours a week and keeps inventing new ways to rob them of the 
      time they worked,&#8221; said Andrew Glenn, a partner at Miami-based 
      JaffeGlenn Law Group, which is representing the workers. &#8220;The same 
      workers who sweat each day to insure the flying public has a safe, 
      clean, pleasurable experience are having their hard-earned wages stolen 
      by their employer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class-action lawsuit alleges that Servisair and Matt Ellingson, an 
      executive vice president with oversight of all U.S. operations, have 
      engaged in a nationwide, systemic practice of violating the federal Fair 
      Labor Standards Act. Under FLSA, non-exempt employees like those at 
      Servisair are entitled to overtime pay after working more than 40 hours 
      per week.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Servisair cheated workers out of tens of millions of dollars in wages 
      over the past three years, Glenn stated, by:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Deducting 30 minutes each day from worker timecards for lunches that 
        were never taken;
      
			
        Using a timekeeping software system that automatically shortens a 
        workday by rounding up start times and rounding down stop times. For 
        example, a worker who clocks in at 10:02 a.m. would be credited for 
        starting at 10:30 a.m.; a worker who clocks out at 11:28 p.m. would be 
        credited for stopping work at 11:00 p.m.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      On average, Servisair airport workers are being shortchanged by 5 hours 
      of overtime each week, according to Glenn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Servisair and its parent company, Paris-based Derichebourg, have made 
      millions of dollars in profit each year at the expense of the workers 
      who have made the company successful,&#8221; Glenn said. &#8220;This is corporate 
      greed at its very worst, and we intend to aggressively fight on behalf 
      of the workers to recover the money owed to them.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class action was filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern 
      District of New York.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEVENSON, Md., July 25, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida on behalf of purchasers of Walter Investment Management Corp. ("Walter Investment" or the "Company") (NYSE:WAC) securities during the period between May 9, 2012 and June 6, 2013, inclusive (the "Class Period").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you have suffered a net loss from investment in Walter Investment Management Corp. securities purchased on or after May 9, 2012 and held through the revelation of negative information on March 18, 2013 as described below, you may obtain additional information about this lawsuit and your ability to become a lead plaintiff by contacting Brower Piven at www.browerpiven.com, by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com, by calling 410/415-6616, or at Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation, 1925 Old Valley Road, Stevenson, Maryland 21153. Attorneys at Brower Piven have combined experience litigating securities and class action cases of over 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	No class has yet been certified in the above action. Members of the Class will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead plaintiff. If you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the Class, you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff no later than September 23, 2013 and be selected by the Court. The lead plaintiff will direct the litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to accept a settlement and how much of a settlement to accept for the Class in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected from among applicants claiming the largest loss from investment in Company units during the Class Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the defendants' failure to disclose during the Class Period that the Company had failed to disclose material weaknesses in the internal controls related to its recent acquisition of Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Inc. ("RMS"), and that the Company had overstated the value of RMS. &#160;According to the complaint, following the Company's March 18, 2013 disclosure that its management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, had identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, the value of Walter Investment shares declined significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			CHMP Confirms Prior Opinion Regarding Marketing Authorization in 
      Europe for Pfizer&#8217;s XELJANZ&#174; (tofacitinib 
      citrate)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer Plans to Work with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to 
      Resubmit Marketing Authorization Application (MAA)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the Committee for Medicinal 
      Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has 
      confirmed its April 25, 2013, opinion to recommend against approval of 
      XELJANZ&#174; (tofacitinib citrate) for the treatment of 
      adult patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
      After re-examination of the application as requested by Pfizer, the CHMP 
      is of the opinion that XELJANZ does not demonstrate a favorable 
      benefit:risk profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While the CHMP considered that treatment with XELJANZ resulted in 
      reduction in the signs and symptoms of RA and improvement in the 
      physical function of patients, it has outstanding concerns on safety, 
      including serious infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company is currently evaluating the feedback from the CHMP and will 
      determine next steps to resubmit a MAA to the EMA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are disappointed in the outcome of the re-examination process. A 
      narrow majority of the CHMP felt there is too limited experience in the 
      patient population to fully characterize the profile of XELJANZ and the 
      Committee did not recommend approval at this time,&#8221; said Dr. Steven 
      Romano, senior vice president and the head of the Medicines Development 
      Group for Pfizer Specialty Care. &#8220;The clinical experience with XELJANZ 
      to date, which includes data from approximately 5,000 patients treated 
      for RA, demonstrates a consistent efficacy and safety profile across a 
      range of patient types and a risk profile that is familiar to 
      rheumatologists who have experience utilizing the range of treatments 
      available to treat this disease. We believe that the benefit:risk 
      profile of XELJANZ is favorable, and we remain committed to working with 
      the EMA to make XELJANZ available to appropriate patients in Europe.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the Marketing Authorization Application
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The MAA included data from the comprehensive, global, multi-study 
      clinical development program for XELJANZ, which included approximately 
      5,000 patients across Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials in more than 40 
      countries, resulting in 7,000 patient-years of exposure at the time of 
      regulatory submission. The application was based on the same pivotal 
      efficacy and safety data package that was provided to regulatory 
      agencies around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Rheumatoid Arthritis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RA is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that typically affects 
      the hands and feet, although any joint lined by a synovial membrane may 
      be affected. RA affects approximately 23.7 million people worldwide and 
      6.2 million in Europe.1 Although multiple treatments are 
      available, many patients do not adequately respond. Specifically, up to 
      one-third of patients do not adequately respond and about half stop 
      responding to any particular non-biologic disease-modifying 
      antirheumatic drug (DMARD) within five years.2,3,4,5,6,7 There 
      remains a need for additional therapeutic options.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About XELJANZ
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is a novel, oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor for the treatment 
      of RA. Unlike recent therapies for RA, which are directed at 
      extracellular targets such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, XELJANZ takes 
      a novel approach targeting the intracellular pathways that operate as 
      hubs in the inflammatory cytokine network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is approved in the United States, Japan, Argentina, Kuwait, 
      Russia, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates for the treatment of 
      adults with moderate-to-severe active RA.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FleetCor Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: FLT), a leading global provider of 
      fuel cards and workforce payment products to businesses, announced today 
      that it has signed a long-term agreement with Visa Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of this new agreement, FleetCor will utilize its Global 
      FleetNet (&#8220;GFN&#8221;) fuel card processing system together with Visa Europe&#8217;s 
      EMV standard chip and PIN intelligent technology to deliver new fuel 
      card solutions across Visa Europe territories.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The companies plan to develop new fuel card propositions together with 
      the first planned implementation in FleetCor&#8217;s Allstar business in the 
      UK.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Allstar will be the first to offer this Visa Europe chip and PIN 
      technology in the commercial fuel card space.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This Allstar fuel card implementation will create new benefits for 
      Allstar&#8217;s commercial clients, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Enhanced security and fraud protection: The chip technology will make 
        fuel cards nearly impossible to clone
      
			
        Enhanced convenience: The Allstar cards will be usable both inside the 
        shop and outside at the pump
      
			
        Enhanced control: The cards will have improved purchasing restrictions 
        to eliminate the purchase of non-approved fuel grades or other 
        out-of-policy items
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to combine our specialized fuel card expertise with Visa 
      Europe&#8217;s intelligent EMV chip technology to help us further capture more 
      European fuel card spend,&#8221; said Ron Clarke, FleetCor&#8217;s Chairman and CEO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Steve Price, Head of Business Development at Visa Europe, commented, &#8220;We 
      are delighted to have concluded a partnership with FleetCor to deliver 
      products to the fleet and fuel card marketplace. We believe there is a 
      real need for new solutions that help reduce costs and extend payment 
      functionality. The combination of Visa&#8217;s payments expertise together 
      with FleetCor&#8217;s specialist fuel industry expertise makes for a powerful 
      combination. I look forward to extending the partnership beyond this 
      first implementation.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;July 25 (Reuters) - The following is a list of U.S. power plants in which
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has an interest, according to the bank's filing with
U.S. federal energy regulators in late June.
    JPMorgan's commodity trading arm is looking to sell more of the electricity
deals it has with U.S. power plants and wind farms, a source familiar with the
business said Wednesday, after the bank largely exited the Californian market in
May. 
    So-called tolling and marketing agreements allow the bank's commodity
division, JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation, to supply fuel and then sell the
power on behalf of the plant's owner. The bank's commodity traders control more
than 2,950 megawatts of electricity through such deals, enough to power every
one of Indiana's 2.8 million homes.
    The bank's commodity division also has an equity interest in three entities
that own power plants in the United States, which are held as merchant banking
investments or other permissible investments, according to the source.
    JPMorgan also owns interests in power plants and wind farms through its
private equity arm, JPMorgan Capital Partners, and JPMorgan Infrastructure
Investments Group, its asset management division.

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transactions represent pass-throughs of all proceeds received in 
      respect of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) owned by each 
      trust. The ratings are based on the credit quality of the MRBs, all 
      currently rated 'AAA' with a Negative Outlook by Fitch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Proceeds from the certificate issuance were used to purchase MRBs issued 
      by certain municipal entities with ratings directly linked to the U.S. 
      sovereign rating. The MRBs are all currently collateralized by Ginnie 
      Mae (GNMA) guaranteed mortgage-backed securities or Fannie Mae (FNMA) 
      guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. The MRBs are all rated 'AAA' with 
      a Negative Outlook by Fitch based on the GNMA and FNMA guarantees of 
      full and timely payment of principal and interest on its securities. The 
      guaranties are backed by the rating of the U.S. treasury, which carries 
      the rating of the United States of America (the U.S. government; rated 
      'AAA/F1+' with a Negative Outlook by Fitch).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transactions rely, to a lesser extent, on a series of counterparties 
      to perform particular roles, including the trustee (Wells Fargo Bank, 
      N.A.; rated 'AA-/F1+', Outlook Stable, or U.S. Bank National 
      Association; rated 'AA-/F1+'; Outlook Stable) and the bank at which the 
      certificate account is established, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo) 
      and U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank). All distributions from 
      the underlying MRBs are deposited into the certificate account where 
      they are held un-invested, and are subsequently withdrawn by the trustee 
      prior to each payment date. The certificate account is a segregated 
      trust account, separated from the assets of the bank in the event of the 
      bank's insolvency. In its role as both issuer account bank and trustee, 
      Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank continue to satisfy the eligibility criteria 
      described in Fitch's 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance 
      Transactions'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If the underlying MRB is downgraded, the certificates would also be 
      downgraded. The MRB would likely be downgraded in the event that the 
      U.S. sovereign rating is downgraded by Fitch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The long-term 'AA', Positive Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4356 
      PUTTERs and DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has assigned to 
      City of San Antonio, Texas Electric and Gas Systems Junior Lien Revenue 
      Bonds, Series 2013 (rated 'AA+', Stable Outlook) that have been 
      deposited in the series 4356 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4356 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (rated 
      'A+/F1', Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating PUTTERs will expire on July 1, 
      2014, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, unless such date is

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects preferences of shoppers in 8th paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Mark Anderson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 24 (Reuters) - London's West End lost nearly
200 million euros ($264 million) in retail revenue last year due
to tough visa requirements keeping Chinese tourists away, a
report by tax-free shopping facilitator Global Blue said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrods' managing director Michael Ward said in the report
that Chinese tourists were the luxury department store's most
important customers, and that Britain's current visa arrangement
was "narrow-minded".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending by Chinese tourists abroad rose 58 percent, as they
traveled to find cheap deals on luxury goods, making them the
highest-spending travelers in the world, the report showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Britain's strict visa application process, which
requires applicants to visit British embassies, has kept many
Chinese tourists away from London's upmarket retail districts of
Bond Street and Chelsea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian tourists, who are the second-biggest shoppers, face
up to two months' waiting time for a British visa, whereas one
for Europe's 26-country Schengen Area can take as little as
three days to process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report showed that tourists favour travel to the
Schengen zone because of its straightforward visa process and
widespread use - it is accepted in all member countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Blue operates a network of tax refund points for
foreign shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese shoppers were shown to prefer buying watches and
jewelry, while Russians most commonly bought clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chinese tourists often prefer to shop in Europe where they
can save as much as 50 percent on luxury goods," said Dai Bin,
president of the China Tourism Academy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France was ranked the top destination for Chinese tourists,
with nearly 10 percent higher growth in Chinese visitors than
Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany ranked second with a 76 percent increase in Chinese
visitors, boosted by flights from China landing at Frankfurt
airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also showed that Chinese tourists favour
Singapore as a short-haul shopping destination.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's 
commodity trading arm is looking to sell more of the electricity
deals it has with U.S. power plants and wind farms, a source
familiar with the business said on Wednesday, at a time when
Wall Street's involvement in physical commodity markets is under
heightened scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called power tolling and marketing deals cover enough
electricity to light up Indiana's 2.8 million homes, according
to detailed regulatory filings, and include almost 3,000
megawatts of power generation spread across nine states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential sale follows the company's move to largely
exit the California power market in May, where the bank has been
embroiled in a market manipulation scandal. The bank is
reportedly close to a more than $400 million settlement with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear if formal discussions have been held with
possible buyers for the agreements, which allow the firm to buy
fuel and sell power on behalf of the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank's commodity arm has already divested more than
50 percent of its tolling agreements this year after the sale of
around 3,600 megawatts of capacity to Edison International in
California two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's commodity division, known as JPMorgan Ventures
Energy Corporation, also owns interests in three power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining tolling agreements include one with privately
held Tenaska's 844 MW Lindsay Hill plant in Alabama, which
produces enough electricity to power 800,000 homes in the state,
according to the company's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Tenaska said the company had no knowledge
of JPMorgan's plans. The bank's commodity traders provide the
fuel and own the power produced by the facility, she added in an
email, but declined to disclose further terms of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other deals include a marketing agreement with Algonquin
Power to sell around 400 MW of capacity from three wind farm
projects in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Texas. Those deals, which
were originally set to last 10 to 15 years, were signed less
than nine months ago. A spokesperson for Algonquin did not
respond to telephone calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan does not plan to exit physical power markets
entirely, the source said, and will continue to trade physical
and financial electricity contracts in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A power trader at an energy hedge fund, who previously
worked for a large Wall Street firm, said he saw banks
retreating from the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the FERC market manipulation cases, I'm not sure the
banks have the appetite to keep trading in power - unless they
have a customer that wants them to do it," the hedge fund trader
said. He declined to be named because he is not authorized to
speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased regulation and bank capital requirements have led
some banks to review their exposure to physical commodity
trading, while total revenues from the sector have fallen by
about 50 percent across Wall Street from a peak above $12
billion between 2007 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POWER PLANTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pullback comes as political and regulatory scrutiny of
Wall Street's role in physical commodity trading intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Senate Banking Committee hearing in Washington on Tuesday
questioned whether banks should be allowed to own physical
commodity assets such as pipelines, refineries and metal
warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on Friday, the U.S. Federal Reserve issued a surprise
statement saying it was rethinking a decade-old decision
allowing banks to trade in physical commodities market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the Fed was thought to be primarily debating the
right of commercial banks to own physical trading assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation acquired a number of
U.S. power plants, tolling agreements and marketing arrangements
after it acquired  Bear Stearns and RBS Sempra during the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2007, Bear Stearns' commodity arm, Houston-based
Bear Energy, acquired the rights to more than 9,000 MW of
electric power output after purchasing Williams Power Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has sold many of the power plants it inherited from
Bear Stearns in 2008, according to a source familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's commodities division still has an equity
interest in three entities that own power plants in the United
States, which are held as merchant banking investments or other
permissible investments, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the plants, the 545 MW Kinder Jackson facility that
powers roughly half a million homes in Michigan, is also
embroiled in the FERC market manipulation case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other equity interests held by the commodity arm are in
the 230 MW Brandywine power plant in Maryland and a small 75 MW
biomass plant in Florida, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case against JPMorgan revolves around an FERC accusation
that the bank's commodity arm used an elaborate trading scheme
to try to make loss-making plants profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the FERC imposed a record $470 million fine
against Barclays Plc and four of its traders for
manipulating U.S. power markets between 2006 and 2008. Barclays
has said it will fight the fine in Federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's commodity division also want to sell its Henry
Bath metals warehousing business, according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has put Wall
Street banks and other big traders on notice that their metals
warehousing businesses might be investigated following years of
complaints about inflated prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan  also owns interests in power plants and wind farms
through its private equity arm, JPMorgan Capital Partners, and
JPMorgan Infrastructure Investments Group, its asset management
division.&lt;/p&gt;

      Regulatory News:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:&#160;CCE)(Euronext Paris: CCE) today 
      reported second-quarter diluted earnings per share of 66 cents on a 
      reported basis, or 77 cents on a comparable basis. Currency translation 
      had a positive impact of approximately 1 cent per share compared to 
      second-quarter 2012. Second-quarter reported net income was $182 
      million, or $213 million on a comparable basis. Items affecting 
      comparability are detailed on pages 10 through 13 of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the second quarter, net sales totaled $2.2 billion, a decline of 2&#189; 
      percent from the same quarter in 2012 on a reported basis, or 3 percent 
      on a currency neutral basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second-quarter reported operating income totaled $272 million, a decline 
      of 9&#189; percent. Comparable operating income totaled $314 million, a 
      decline of 5 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our first half results were impacted by headwinds in the operating 
      environment and marketplace that also have impacted our full-year 
      outlook,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. 
      &#8220;These factors include ongoing macroeconomic weakness, poor weather, 
      continuing customer challenges from the impact of the French excise tax 
      increase last year, and the competitive environment in Great Britain. 
      Recent weather improvements and a solid summer program have helped 
      restore growth in our business as we begin the third quarter, although 
      much of the key summer selling season is still ahead of us,&#8221; Mr. Brock 
      said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our focus remains on our ultimate objective &#8211; delivering growth in 
      shareowner value. To that end, and given the sustained impact of these 
      issues in the operating environment, we continue to evaluate each 
      element of our company to improve our growth outlook. We will also 
      utilize all available business levers, including our solid free cash 
      flow and strong balance sheet to continue returning cash to shareowners 
      through our share repurchase program and dividends,&#8221; Mr. Brock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			OPERATING REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total second-quarter volume declined 2&#189; percent. Sparkling drinks 
      declined approximately 2&#189; percent, with Coca-Cola trademark brands down 
      2&#189; percent, though Coca-Cola Zero achieved growth of more than 13 
      percent. CCE&#8217;s portfolio of energy brands grew 3 percent, with Monster 
      achieving growth of approximately 15 percent. Still beverages declined 2 
      percent, including a 5 percent decline in water and high single-digit 
      growth for Capri-Sun. Total volume in Great Britain declined 
      approximately 1&#189; percent, and volume in continental Europe (including 
      Norway and Sweden) declined 2&#189; percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net pricing per case in the second quarter declined &#189; percent, compared 
      to an increase of 4 percent in the same quarter a year ago. Cost of 
      sales per case increased 2 percent, compared to an increase of 3 percent 
      in the same quarter a year ago. Gross margins were affected by prior 
      year hurdles, a more modest pricing strategy, and a negative mix impact, 
      most notably in Great Britain. Operating expenses declined 8 percent, 
      reflecting timing and the benefits of ongoing expense control. These 
      figures are comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At every level of our business, our people continue to seek ways to 
      improve our customer relationships, optimize service levels, and build 
      on the value of our brands,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, executive vice 
      president and president, European Group. &#8220;We are also improving our 
      overall pricing and promotion strategies, and our operating 
      effectiveness and efficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These efforts, combined with favorable July weather and our 
      Share-a-Coke program, have resulted in an encouraging start to the third 
      quarter,&#8221; Mr. Patricot said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FULL-YEAR 2013 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE now expects 2013 comparable earnings per diluted share in a range of 
      $2.45 to $2.50, including a negative currency translation impact of less 
      than 1 percent at recent rates. Full-year net sales are now expected to 
      grow in a low single-digit range versus prior year. Operating income is 
      now expected to grow in a low to mid-single-digit range. Guidance for 
      net sales and operating income is comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously announced, CCE began a new $1.5 billion share repurchase 
      program in January 2013, and the company now expects to repurchase at 
      least $1 billion of its shares by the end of 2013. The company also 
      expects its year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio to be within its long-term 
      range of 2&#189; to 3 times, reflecting the impact of its plan to return cash 
      to shareowners and incremental optimization of its capital structure. 
      These plans may be adjusted depending on economic, operating, or other 
      factors, including acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company continues to expect 2013 free cash flow in a range of $450 
      to $500 million after including a year-over-year increase in cash 
      restructuring expenses of approximately $125 million. Capital 
      expenditures are now expected to be approximately $325 million. Weighted 
      average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent and the 
      comparable effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be in a range of 
      26 percent to 28 percent.

			Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. Reports 
      Second-Quarter 2013 Results, Provides Full-Year Earnings Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Second-quarter diluted earnings per share totaled 66 cents on a 
        reported basis, or 77 cents on a comparable basis, including a 
        currency benefit of approximately 1 cent.
			
			
				Net sales totaled $2.2 billion, down 2&#189; percent on a reported 
        basis, or down 3 percent on a currency neutral basis; volume declined 
        2&#189; percent.
			
			
				Operating income totaled $272 million on a reported basis, or $314 
        million on a comparable basis. Comparable operating income declined 4 
        percent, or 5 percent on a currency neutral basis.
			
			
				CCE expects to repurchase at least $1 billion of its shares in 
        2013, with a year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio within its long-term 
        range of 2&#189; to 3 times.
			
			
				For 2013, CCE now expects comparable earnings per diluted share in 
        a range of $2.45 to $2.50, including a negative currency impact of 
        less than 1 percent at recent rates.
			
			
				CCE affirms 2013 free cash flow guidance of $450 to $500 million.
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:&#160;CCE)(Euronext Paris: CCE) today 
      reported second-quarter diluted earnings per share of 66 cents on a 
      reported basis, or 77 cents on a comparable basis. Currency translation 
      had a positive impact of approximately 1 cent per share compared to 
      second-quarter 2012. Second-quarter reported net income was $182 
      million, or $213 million on a comparable basis. Items affecting 
      comparability are detailed on pages 10 through 13 of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the second quarter, net sales totaled $2.2 billion, a decline of 2&#189; 
      percent from the same quarter in 2012 on a reported basis, or 3 percent 
      on a currency neutral basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second-quarter reported operating income totaled $272 million, a decline 
      of 9&#189; percent. Comparable operating income totaled $314 million, a 
      decline of 5 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our first half results were impacted by headwinds in the operating 
      environment and marketplace that also have impacted our full-year 
      outlook,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. 
      &#8220;These factors include ongoing macroeconomic weakness, poor weather, 
      continuing customer challenges from the impact of the French excise tax 
      increase last year, and the competitive environment in Great Britain. 
      Recent weather improvements and a solid summer program have helped 
      restore growth in our business as we begin the third quarter, although 
      much of the key summer selling season is still ahead of us,&#8221; Mr. Brock 
      said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our focus remains on our ultimate objective &#8211; delivering growth in 
      shareowner value. To that end, and given the sustained impact of these 
      issues in the operating environment, we continue to evaluate each 
      element of our company to improve our growth outlook. We will also 
      utilize all available business levers, including our solid free cash 
      flow and strong balance sheet to continue returning cash to shareowners 
      through our share repurchase program and dividends,&#8221; Mr. Brock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			OPERATING REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total second-quarter volume declined 2&#189; percent. Sparkling drinks 
      declined approximately 2&#189; percent, with Coca-Cola trademark brands down 
      2&#189; percent, though Coca-Cola Zero achieved growth of more than 13 
      percent. CCE&#8217;s portfolio of energy brands grew 3 percent, with Monster 
      achieving growth of approximately 15 percent. Still beverages declined 2 
      percent, including a 5 percent decline in water and high single-digit 
      growth for Capri-Sun. Total volume in Great Britain declined 
      approximately 1&#189; percent, and volume in continental Europe (including 
      Norway and Sweden) declined 2&#189; percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net pricing per case in the second quarter declined &#189; percent, compared 
      to an increase of 4 percent in the same quarter a year ago. Cost of 
      sales per case increased 2 percent, compared to an increase of 3 percent 
      in the same quarter a year ago. Gross margins were affected by prior 
      year hurdles, a more modest pricing strategy, and a negative mix impact, 
      most notably in Great Britain. Operating expenses declined 8 percent, 
      reflecting timing and the benefits of ongoing expense control. These 
      figures are comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At every level of our business, our people continue to seek ways to 
      improve our customer relationships, optimize service levels, and build 
      on the value of our brands,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, executive vice 
      president and president, European Group. &#8220;We are also improving our 
      overall pricing and promotion strategies, and our operating 
      effectiveness and efficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These efforts, combined with favorable July weather and our 
      Share-a-Coke program, have resulted in an encouraging start to the third 
      quarter,&#8221; Mr. Patricot said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FULL-YEAR 2013 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE now expects 2013 comparable earnings per diluted share in a range of 
      $2.45 to $2.50, including a negative currency translation impact of less 
      than 1 percent at recent rates. Full-year net sales are now expected to 
      grow in a low single-digit range versus prior year. Operating income is 
      now expected to grow in a low to mid-single-digit range. Guidance for 
      net sales and operating income is comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously announced, CCE began a new $1.5 billion share repurchase 
      program in January 2013, and the company now expects to repurchase at 
      least $1 billion of its shares by the end of 2013. The company also 
      expects its year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio to be within its long-term 
      range of 2&#189; to 3 times, reflecting the impact of its plan to return cash 
      to shareowners and incremental optimization of its capital structure. 
      These plans may be adjusted depending on economic, operating, or other 
      factors, including acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company continues to expect 2013 free cash flow in a range of $450 
      to $500 million after including a year-over-year increase in cash 
      restructuring expenses of approximately $125 million. Capital 
      expenditures are now expected to be approximately $325 million. Weighted 
      average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent and the 
      comparable effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be in a range of 
      26 percent to 28 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) - Etisalat ETEL.AD, the Gulf's biggest telecommunications operator, has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to advise on its planned bid for Pakistan mobile operator Warid Telecom, two sources aware of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warid, the country's smallest operator, has been put on the block in a sale likely to fetch up to $1 billion, Reuters reported last month.

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, July 25 (Reuters) - Etisalat, the Gulf's
biggest telecommunications operator, has hired Goldman Sachs
Group Inc to advise on its planned bid for Pakistan
mobile operator Warid Telecom, two sources aware of the matter
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warid, the country's smallest operator, has been put on the
block in a sale likely to fetch up to $1 billion, Reuters
reported last month. Etisalat and China Mobile, who
have existing operations in the country, were seen as potential
bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Etisalat, which is also in exclusive talks with Vivendi
 to buy its 53 percent stake in Maroc Telecom,
has existing operations in Pakistan through its stake in
Pakistan Telecommunication Co Ltd (PTCL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquisition of Warid, owned by conglomerate The Abu Dhabi
Group, would give the company an opportunity to consolidate its
operations in the country, said one banking source speaking on
condition of anonymity as the sale process has not been publicly
disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Etisalat and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan's mobile telecommunications sector has five
operators and is ripe for consolidation after a period when a
troubled economy, increasingly high levels of market penetration
and stiff competition has forced companies' margins lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Ritz, Etisalat's chief strategy officer, told Reuters
on Tuesday the UAE telecom group would look at opportunities to
bolster its existing portfolio without specifying whether the
firm was bidding for Warid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will consider ... opportunities in areas where it gives
us a chance to consolidate our existing portfolio," Ritz told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warid launched its cellular services in Pakistan in May 2005
and had 12.54 million subscribers by the end of March this year,
down from 17.39 million in 2010-11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other operators in Pakistan are Oslo-based Telenor 
and Orascom Telecom, which operates under the name

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is exiting physical commodities trading, the bank said in a surprise statement on Friday, as Wall Street's role in the trading of raw materials comes under unprecedented political and regulatory pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending billions of dollars and five years building the banking world's biggest commodity desk, JPMorgan said it would pursue "strategic alternatives" for its trading assets that stretch from Baltimore to Johor, and a global team dealing in everything from African crude oil to Chilean copper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm will explore "a sale, spinoff or strategic partnership" of the physical business championed by commodities chief Blythe Masters, the architect of JPMorgan's expansion in the sector and one of the most famous women on Wall Street. The bank said it will continue to trade in financial commodities such as derivatives and precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressured by tougher regulation and rising capital levels, JPMorgan joins other banks such as Barclays PLC and Deutsche Bank in a retreat that marks the end of an era in which investment banks across the world rushed to tap into volatile markets during a decade-long price boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan is the first big player to exit physical commodities entirely and attention will now turn to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which face similar pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's announcement follows a week of intense scrutiny of Wall Street's commodity operations, with U.S. lawmakers questioning whether banks should own warehouses and pipelines, and the U.S. Federal Reserve reviewing a landmark 2003 decision that allowed commercial banks to trade in physical markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's own review, which began in February, concluded that the profits from the business were too slight to be worth the risks and costs of dealing with regulators in multiple jurisdictions, according to one person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the commodity division's $2.4 billion in reported revenue last year surpassed those of long-time rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley combined, some have queried its profitability due to the costs of running a huge logistical operation. One analyst estimated that physical trade accounted for half or more of overall commodities revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sale could help JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon make good on his promise to put the bank back on course after a series of costly and embarrassing trading moves and regulatory run-ins, including a potential $410 million settlement over alleged power market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But securing a sale may not be straightforward. Several other large energy trading operations are also on the block, at a time when tough new regulations and low volatility have dampened interest in commodity trading. Rival investment banks are unlikely suitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which said it had its worst quarter in commodities in decades in the fourth quarter of 2012, has been trying to sell its business since last year. Goldman has looked at divesting its metal warehouse unit Metro since March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where just a few years ago the bulge bracket (banks) were expanding and hiring at a breakneck pace, now retrenchment is the order of the day," said George Stein, managing director of New York-based recruiting firm Commodity Talent LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news will also bring questions about the future for Britain-born Masters, who started as an intern on JPMorgan's London trading floor two decades ago. After long lagging rivals, she transformed JPMorgan's commodity arm into a global powerhouse in less than five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said the bank had "considered many different factors" before deciding to exit the business, "including the impact of potential new rules and regulation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVERSAL OF FORTUNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement came just three days after a powerful Senate banking committee heard from experts who said that metals warehouses owned by Wall Street and other commodities traders were distorting markets and even driving up the cost of aluminum cans for beer and soda. Some said allowing them to trade in physical markets was a risk to the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could be good news for consumers and taxpayers," said Senator Sherrod Brown, member of the Senate Banking Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Banks should focus on core banking activities," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission have also both launched probes into metal warehousing. When JPMorgan bought the company in 2010, Henry Bath's warehouses were the second largest in the London Metals Exchange system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's decision is a sharp and unexpected reversal for a bank that has pushed aggressively into the sector since 2008, when it first inherited a host of power trading assets through its acquisition of Bear Stearns during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was followed by the acquisition of RBS Sempra Commodities in 2010, allowing the bank to quickly become the largest commodity business on Wall Street, with a global footprint in oil and one of the biggest metal trade desks. Its staff swelled to 600 people across 10 offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank initially struggled, however, to integrate the entrepreneurial trading unit, and a number of senior traders left. That same year a bad trade in coal markets lost hundreds of millions of dollars, which Masters called a "rookie error."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seemed to have found its footing last year, securing new deals and stemming the exodus of talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During its short peak, JPMorgan's global commodity operation was considered the largest on Wall Street, supplying crude oil to the biggest refinery on the East Coast and holding enough electricity contracts to power Indiana's 2.8 million homes. It was one of the 10 largest U.S. natural gas traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tide seemed to turn this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already under pressure in Washington following its $6.2 billion "London Whale" loss on derivatives trades last year, in March it learned that the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was preparing to charge its power traders with manipulating markets in the Midwest and California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has since scaled back its power business and sold off half of its power trading contracts, Reuters reported earlier this week. Earlier this month its longtime global oil trading head Jeff Frase left the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH SALE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to move out of the raw materials trade comes months after Dimon vowed to resolve multiple government investigations and correct problems that regulators have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big banks are taking a more conciliatory stance in general with regulators who continue to impose new rules more than five years after the start of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the decision may be modest for the bank as a whole, analysts have said. JPMorgan shares ended down 0.8 percent at $56.05 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall commodity trading at the bank is around 15 percent of total fixed income, currency and commodity trading revenue (FICC), with physical-related trading around 5 to 10 percent of that, bank stock analyst Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank said in a report this week after meeting with Dimon. FICC revenue made up less than 15 percent of total bank revenue in the latest quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, getting good value for the commodity business may be tough as the market is already crowded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, facing even tougher regulatory pressure over its vast oil division, has been trying to sell its commodities division without success since last year. It may learn by September whether the Federal Reserve will allow it to keep its business, including the logistics unit TransMontaigne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hetco, the physical trading shop half owned by Hess Corp, is also in the midst of being sold as Hess is split up. And the energy trading unit of Omaha, Nebraska-based Gavilon may also be for sale after Marubeni Corp excluded it from its takeover of the grains trader this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of its Henry Bath warehouses, once considered the crown jewel of Sempra, is said to have slumped as the LME prepares to implement tougher rules that are meant to end the lengthy queues that have helped bolster earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are questions about the return on capital now," said a senior executive in the warehousing industry. "I don't see many deploying their money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry executives say that there are two types of buyers for these vast, capital-intensive businesses: private equity groups like Carlyle Group, which have recently moved into the space, and sovereign wealth funds like that of Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the group could also be a target for one of several merchant traders looking to quickly expand into metals and energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freepoint Commodities, a privately owned merchant founded by the original Sempra team, bought back a metals concentrates business from JPMorgan last year. Swiss-based Vitol and Mercuria, two of the world's largest energy traders, have both expanded into metals in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Henry and Josephine Mason in New York; Douwe Miedema in Washington; Avik Das and Aman Shah in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Phil Berlowitz and Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission may have destroyed his career, as former Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice Tourre put it, but for more than a year it didn't eliminate his pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc paid Tourre a base salary of 480,000 pounds ($738,000) after he was put on leave following the filing of the SEC lawsuit in 2010, Tourre said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, 34, speaking at the end of his second week of his trial, said he didn't have a choice but to go on leave after the lawsuit was filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was hoping to go back to Goldman Sachs and in the meantime make the SEC understand this transaction," Tourre, 34, told the court. Instead, he ended up on trial in federal court in New York on securities fraud charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial has become the highest-profile court proceeding to come out of the SEC's probes of the 2008 financial crisis and is a chance for the SEC to hold an individual accountable for alleged wrongdoing on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC contends that Tourre misled investors in a complex mortgage deal known as Abacus 2007-AC1. He failed to disclose to the investors that Paulson &amp; Co Inc, the hedge fund of billionaire John Paulson, both helped select the securities that the deal depended on and at the same time was planning to bet against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC also claims Tourre misled ACA Capital Holdings Inc, a company that Goldman hired to oversee the deal, into believing Paulson was investing in the deal rather than shorting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACA later became an investor in Abacus and insured it. When the underlying mortgage securities turned toxic, the investors lost about $1 billion, while Paulson's short positions made about the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, originally a co-defendant, agreed in July 2010 to pay $550 million to settle the lawsuit without admitting or denying wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, who denies wrongdoing, said Friday that he first learned the SEC had sued him when a headline scrolled across his screen while he was at work in April 2010 at Goldman Sachs Group Inc's London office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre had told jurors Thursday that he earned $1.7 million in salary and bonus in 2007, the year of the Abacus deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His earnings in 2007 - particularly the extent to which his bonus was tied to profits he brought Goldman - may help the SEC show that he obtained money or property thanks to the alleged misrepresentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for why SEC lawyer Matthew Martens chose to elicit how much Tourre earned on paid leave were less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Crimmins, a former SEC lawyer at K Gates, said while the pay isn't unusual on Wall Street, for the average juror it might sound "odd."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does in many juror minds create a troublesome point why someone that young earned that much," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre said the sum he earned on paid leave represented his base salary. Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, declined to confirm how much Tourre earned after being placed on paid leave in April 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the lawsuit was filed and he was subsequently called to testify before a U.S. Senate committee, Tourre said he "had to take a step back and figure out what to do with my life given that my nine-year career was destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre went on unpaid leave from November 2011 to the end of 2012, and is pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre said he hadn't "done anything wrong, as I'm here literally to tell the truth and clear my name."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'NOT ACCURATE' EMAIL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Tourre's defense team appeared to try to put an admission he made on Wednesday about an email he sent to ACA executive Laura Schwartz in January 2007 in a more favorable context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the email, Tourre said the riskiest slice of Abacus, known as the "first loss tranche," was "pre-committed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz this week testified that the "pre-committed" statement was a reason she thought Paulson, who Tourre in the email also said was sponsoring the transaction, was an equity investor in the deal rather than a short seller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre acknowledged Wednesday the statement "was not accurate," since that part of the deal wasn't being offered at all.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - A lawsuit by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission may have destroyed his
career, as former Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice Tourre put it,
but for more than a year it didn't eliminate his pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc paid Tourre a base salary of
480,000 pounds ($738,000) after he was put on leave following
the filing of the SEC lawsuit in 2010, Tourre said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, 34, speaking at the end of his second week of his
trial, said he didn't have a choice but to go on leave after the
lawsuit was filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was hoping to go back to Goldman Sachs and in the
meantime make the SEC understand this transaction," Tourre, 34,
told the court. Instead, he ended up on trial in federal court
in New York on securities fraud charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial has become the highest-profile court proceeding to
come out of the SEC's probes of the 2008 financial crisis and is
a chance for the SEC to hold an individual accountable for
alleged wrongdoing on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC contends that Tourre misled investors in a complex
mortgage deal known as Abacus 2007-AC1. He failed to disclose to
the investors that Paulson &amp; Co Inc, the hedge fund of
billionaire John Paulson, both helped select the securities that
the deal depended on and at the same time was planning to bet
against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC also claims Tourre misled ACA Capital Holdings Inc,
a company that Goldman hired to oversee the deal, into believing
Paulson was investing in the deal rather than shorting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACA later became an investor in Abacus and insured it. When
the underlying mortgage securities turned toxic, the investors
lost about $1 billion, while Paulson's short positions made
about the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, originally a co-defendant, agreed in July
2010 to pay $550 million to settle the lawsuit without admitting
or denying wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, who denies wrongdoing, said Friday that he first
learned the SEC had sued him when a headline scrolled across his
screen while he was at work in April 2010 at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc's London office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre had told jurors Thursday that he earned $1.7 million
in salary and bonus in 2007, the year of the Abacus deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His earnings in 2007 - particularly the extent to which his
bonus was tied to profits he brought Goldman - may help the SEC
show that he obtained money or property thanks to the alleged
misrepresentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for why SEC lawyer Matthew Martens chose to
elicit how much Tourre earned on paid leave were less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Crimmins, a former SEC lawyer at K Gates, said
while the pay isn't unusual on Wall Street, for the average
juror it might sound "odd."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does in many juror minds create a troublesome point why
someone that young earned that much," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre said the sum he earned on paid leave represented his
base salary. Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, declined to
confirm how much Tourre earned after being placed on paid leave
in April 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the lawsuit was filed and he was subsequently called
to testify before a U.S. Senate committee, Tourre said he "had
to take a step back and figure out what to do with my life given
that my nine-year career was destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre went on unpaid leave from November 2011 to the end of
2012, and is pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University
of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre said he hadn't "done anything wrong, as I'm here
literally to tell the truth and clear my name."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'NOT ACCURATE' EMAIL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Tourre's defense team appeared to try to put an
admission he made on Wednesday about an email he sent to ACA
executive Laura Schwartz in January 2007 in a more favorable
context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the email, Tourre said the riskiest slice of Abacus,
known as the "first loss tranche," was "pre-committed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz this week testified that the "pre-committed"
statement was a reason she thought Paulson, who Tourre in the
email also said was sponsoring the transaction, was an equity
investor in the deal rather than a short seller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre acknowledged Wednesday the statement "was not
accurate," since that part of the deal wasn't being offered at
all. Legal experts have said the admission could prove key in
the SEC's effort to convince the jury that Tourre is liable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This email undermines Mr. Tourre's defense and will force
him to try to convince the jury that what he said isn't what it
looks like - an effort to mislead a key institutional investor,"
said Jordan Thomas, a former SEC lawyer at Labaton Sucharow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Pamela Chepiga, Tourre's lawyer, displayed a
series of documents including deal term sheets sent to ACA after
the fact listing the first loss tranche as "NA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz had testified she believed "NA" meant "not
available," a reference to Paulson having already committed to
it. But Tourre had a different definition, "not applicable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because it was never issued, never intended to be issued,"
Tourre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is expected to rest its case Monday, and Tourre's

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co is exiting physical commodities trading, the bank said in a surprise statement on Friday, as Wall Street's role in the trading of raw materials comes under intense political and regulatory pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's biggest bank said an "internal review" had concluded it should pursue "strategic alternatives" for its physical commodities operations, which includes assets like its Henry Bath metals warehousing subsidiary and a vast global team trading everything from African crude to Canadian natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm will explore "a sale, spinoff or strategic partnership" for its physical arm, the statement said. It said the bank remained "fully committed" to its traditional financial commodity business, including trading derivatives and its activities in precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's announcement follows a week of unprecedented scrutiny of Wall Street's commodity operations, after the U.S. Federal Reserve said last Friday it was reviewing a landmark 2003 decision that allowed commercial banks to trade in physical markets to "complement" their financial activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move also comes as Chief Executive Jamie Dimon strives to put the bank back on course after a series of costly trading moves and regulatory run-ins, including a potential $410 million settlement over alleged power market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision is a sharp reversal for the bank that had pushed aggressively into the sector since 2008, when it first acquired a host of physical trading assets and expertise through its acquisition of Bear Stearns during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was followed by the acquisition of RBS Sempra Commodities in 2010, allowing the bank to quickly challenge Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for the title of largest commodity business on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for JPMorgan did not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move will also bring questions about the future for Blythe Masters, the architect of JPMorgan's growth in commodities and one of the most famous women on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VAST OPERATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review had been under way since at least February, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank concluded that the profits from the business were too slight to be worth the risks and costs of dealing with regulators in multiple jurisdictions, the person said. Another reason for the exit: Unlike the bank's traditional commodities trading, this business does not provide services that the bank's usual corporate customers want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank officials believe the physical business will be more valuable to another owner that is not coming under as much scrutiny as the banking giant, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its peak, JPMorgan's global commodity operation was considered the largest on Wall Street, supplying crude oil to the biggest refinery on the East Coast and holding enough electricity contracts to light Indiana's 2.8 million homes. It was one of the 10 largest U.S. natural gas traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the division's $2.4 billion in reported revenue last year exceeded those of the commodities divisions of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley combined, some have questioned its profitability given the costs involved in running a large logistical operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The about-face comes after a bumpy ride in the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Sempra acquisition, the bank appeared to struggle integrating the entrepreneurial trading unit into a storied Wall Street institution, and a number of senior traders left. That same year a bad trade in coal markets lost hundreds of millions of dollars, which Masters called a "rookie error."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already under pressure in Washington because of its size and for its $6.2 billion "London Whale" loss on derivatives trades last year, it suffered a fresh blow several months ago as the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) prepared to charge its power traders with manipulating markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recently the group's investment in warehousing firm Henry Bath has been attacked by metals consumers for distorting markets and driving up prices. The Department of Justice and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission have also both launched probes into metal warehousing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has already scaled back its power business and sold off half of its power trading contracts, Reuters reported earlier this week. Earlier this month its longtime global oil trading head Jeff Frase left the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could be good news for consumers and taxpayers," said Senator Sherrod Brown, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection, after JPMorgan's announcement on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Banks should focus on core banking activities. Our economy is strengthened when financial conflicts of interest and financial risk are reduced," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown who held a hearing on banks and commodities this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENDING CONTROVERSY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Deutsche Bank's bank stock analyst Matt O'Connor said that tougher regulation of physical commodities would only have a modest impact on the bank's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a meeting with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, he wrote that physical commodity trading might be around 5 to 10 percent of total fixed income, currency and commodity trading revenue (FICC). He estimated overall commodity trading at the bank at around 15 percent of FICC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sum, that would mean that trading in physical commodities probably generates less than 2 percent of JPMorgan's total revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to move out of the raw materials trade comes months after Dimon vowed to resolve multiple government investigations and correct problems that regulators have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big banks are taking a more conciliatory stance in general with regulators who continue to impose new rules more than five years after the start of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calls for legislation to limit the scope of dealings by big banks or even break them up have increased this year and caught the attention of bank executives and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares ended down 0.8 percent at $56.05 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CROWDED MARKET FOR TRADE HOUSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's commodity business will come enter an already crowded market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, facing even tougher regulatory pressure over its vast oil division, has been trying to sell its commodities division without success since last year. Hetco, the physical trading shop half owned by Hess Corp, is also in the midst of being sold as Hess is split up.

&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co 
is exiting physical commodities trading, the bank said in a
surprise statement on Friday, as Wall Street's role in the

Federal Reserve said last Friday it was reviewing a landmark
2003 decision that allowed commercial banks to trade in physical
markets to "complement" their financial activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move also comes as Chief Executive Jamie Dimon strives
to put the bank back on course after a series of costly trading
moves and regulatory run-ins, including a potential $410 million
settlement over alleged power market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision is a sharp reversal for the bank that had
pushed aggressively into the sector since 2008, when it first
acquired a host of physical trading assets and expertise through
its acquisition of Bear Stearns during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was followed by the acquisition of RBS Sempra
Commodities in 2010, allowing the bank to quickly challenge
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for the title of
largest commodity business on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for JPMorgan did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move will also bring questions about the future for
Blythe Masters, the architect of JPMorgan's growth in
commodities and one of the most famous women on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VAST OPERATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review had been under way since at least February,
according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank concluded that the profits from the business were
too slight to be worth the risks and costs of dealing with
regulators in multiple jurisdictions, the person said. Another
reason for the exit: Unlike the bank's traditional commodities
trading, this business does not provide services that the bank's
usual corporate customers want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank officials believe the physical business will be more
valuable to another owner that is not coming under as much

considered the largest on Wall Street, supplying crude oil to
the biggest refinery on the East Coast and holding enough

last year exceeded those of the commodities divisions of 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley combined, some have questioned
its profitability given the costs involved in running a large
logistical operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The about-face comes after a bumpy ride in the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Sempra acquisition, the bank appeared to struggle
integrating the entrepreneurial trading unit into a storied Wall
Street institution, and a number of senior traders left. That
same year a bad trade in coal markets lost hundreds of millions
of dollars, which Masters called a "rookie error."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already under pressure in Washington because of its size and

O'Connor said that tougher regulation of physical commodities
would only have a modest impact on the bank's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a meeting with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, he wrote
that physical commodity trading might be around 5 to 10 percent
of total fixed income, currency and commodity trading revenue
(FICC). He estimated overall commodity trading at the bank at
around 15 percent of FICC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sum, that would mean that trading in physical commodities
probably generates less than 2 percent of JPMorgan's total
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to move out of the raw materials trade comes
months after Dimon vowed to resolve multiple government
investigations and correct problems that regulators have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big banks are taking a more conciliatory stance in general
with regulators who continue to impose new rules more than five
years after the start of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calls for legislation to limit the scope of dealings by big
banks or even break them up have increased this year and caught
the attention of bank executives and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares ended down 0.8 percent at $56.05 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CROWDED MARKET FOR TRADE HOUSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's commodity business will come enter an already
crowded market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, facing even tougher regulatory pressure over
its vast oil division, has been trying to sell its commodities
division without success since last year. Hetco, the physical
trading shop half owned by Hess Corp, is also in the
midst of being sold as Hess is split up. And the energy trading
unit of Omaha, Nebraska-based Gavilon may also be for sale after
Marubeni Corp excluded it from its takeover of the
grains trader this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry executives say that there are two likely types of
buyers for these vast, capital-intensive businesses: private
equity groups like Carlyle Group, which have recently
moved into the space, and sovereign wealth funds like that of
Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the group could also be a target for one of several
merchant traders looking to quickly expand into metals and
energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freepoint Commodities, a privately owned merchant founded by
the original Sempra executives, bought back a metals
concentrates business from JPMorgan last year. Australian bank
Macquarie Group, which faces less regulatory pressure
because it does not have commercial banking operations in the
United States, has also become a large presence in U.S. energy
markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday the bank - which had become Wall Street's biggest trader in commodities - announced that it was putting the physical trading operations up for sale, quitting the business after months of intensifying pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are a selection of JPMorgan's physical trading assets and operations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSET: POWER PLANTS + ELECTRICTY TOLLING AND MARKETING AGREEMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DATE OF PURCHASE: March 2008 (JPMorgan buys Bear Stearns, including power subsidiary Bear Energy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION: The bank's commodity division, known as JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation, has electricity trading deals with U.S. power plants and wind farms totaling almost 3,000 megawatts of capacity - enough to light up each one of Indiana's 2.8 million homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May the bank largely exited the Californian power market, where it has been embroiled in a market manipulation scandal, selling power interests totaling over 3,000 MW of capacity to Edison International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's commodity division also has an equity interest in three entities that own power plants in the United States, including the 545 MW Kinder Jackson facility in Michigan, the 230 MW Brandywine plant in Maryland, and a 75 MW biomass plant in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also owns interests in power plants and wind farms through its private equity arm, JPMorgan Capital Partners, and JPMorgan Infrastructure Investments Group, its asset management division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2007, Bear Stearns' commodity arm, Houston-based Bear Energy, acquired the rights to more than 9,000 MW of electric power output after purchasing Williams Power Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSET: Henry Bath, metals warehousing business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DATE OF PURCHASE: July 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SELLER: RBS Sempra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRICE: Part of $1.7 billion RBS Sempra deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION: When RBS Sempra was bought by JPMorgan for $1.6 billion in 2010, it was the second-largest warehousing company in the LME's vast network with almost 100 warehouses. Since then it has been eclipsed by Goldman Sach's warehouse business Metro International and Glencore Xstrata's Pacorini, and is now the fourth largest based on the number of sheds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company was a founder member of the LME in 1877 and issued the first LME warrant on December 20 1883.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company motto is "habere et dispertire" - to have and to share. Tracing its roots back to 18th century England, the Liverpool, UK-based company was eventually bought by Metallgesellschaft in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, the company had largely been a trading house and ship operator. Hollywood actress Catherine Zeta Jones is reportedly named after the Henry Bath ship "Zeta" that was captained by her great grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It now has 72 warehousing locations in 11 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STATUS: RBS Sempra was told by the Federal Reserve it must divest Henry Bath within two years of the launch of its 2008 joint venture, and JPMorgan was believed to be facing similar pressure to divest the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSET: (UBS) Commodities Canada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DATE OF PURCHASE: Feb 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION: Bought from UBS in 2009, the Calgary-based trading division helped JPMorgan gain a foothold in the heart of the Canadian oil sands industry. It trades, transports and stores natural gas, crude and power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We provide extensive physical capabilities, specifically transport and warehousing, and specialize in trading and structuring across energy products, including oil, natural gas and power," the company says on its website detailing its Canadian operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said in 2010 that it was growing its Natural Resources Group, hiring senior oil and gas traders in Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG-TERM TRADING DEALS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* NORTHERN TIER REFINERY: In December 2010, JPMorgan agreed to provide crude oil to Northern Tier Energy's 82,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in St. Paul, Minnesota. It now supplies more than 90 percent of the refinery's crude, according to Northern Tier's SEC filings, including about 10,000 bpd imported from Canada last year, EIA data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* PHILADELPHIA ENERGY SOLUTIONS REFINERY: Last summer JPMorgan agreed to provide financing and crude supply to the 335,000 bpd refinery in Philadelphia as part of a buy-out by the Carlyle Group. Since September it has been importing some 250,000 bpd of crude from Nigeria, Chad and Azerbaijan. The deal helped the bank treble its crude imports last year to nearly 130,000 bpd, the data show, overtaking Morgan Stanley's crude and fuel imports for the first time ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Jonathan Leff and David Sheppard; Editing by Alden Bentley and Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Mica Rosenberg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday
upheld a ruling against Exxon Mobil Corp ordering the
company to pay $105 million in damages for polluting New York
City's groundwater with a toxic gasoline additive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a 2009

Exxon said it would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An oxygen-containing substance that is added to gasoline to
promote more complete combustion and reduce air pollution, MTBE
was one of several additives recommended by regulators to reduce

serve as a backup supply for the city's drinking water when the
reservoirs upstate go offline because of repairs or droughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city is planning to install and upgrade treatment
stations to remove the MTBE to ensure the drinking water meets
the same standards as the upstate system, the New York City Law
Department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's at issue here isn't just the choice to use MTBE,

			J.P. Morgan to Explore Strategic Alternatives for its Physical

		&lt;p&gt;
      To maximize value, the firm will explore a full range of options over

      annual client surveys and was recently named Derivatives House of the 
      Year by Energy Risk magazine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the internal review, J.P. Morgan has also reaffirmed that it 
      will remain fully committed to its traditional banking activities in the 
      commodity markets, including financial derivatives and the vaulting and 
      trading of precious metals. The firm will continue to make markets, 
      provide liquidity and offer advice to global companies and institutions 
      that have, for years, relied on J.P. Morgan&#8217;s global risk management 
      expertise.

&lt;p&gt;* Strategy is finding relative value in oil, gas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* A difficult time for commodity hedge funds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Barani Krishnan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - A former energy trader at
Glencore Xstrata Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
is launching a commodities hedge fund focused on trading price
spreads between different crude oil and petroleum products,
people familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Goldberg, who used to trade oil and natural gas for
Glencore, and gasoline and other commodities for Goldman, is
expected to start in August as chief investment officer at BBL
Commodities in downtown New York, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will be joined by Mark Strachan, a former Morgan Stanley
 executive, who will be operations and compliance head,
and ex-Goldman and Julius Baer Gruppe AG employee
Stephen Wieler, who will analyze energy markets at the new firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund's impending launch was first reported earlier this
week in the online edition of Absolute Return, a trade
publication for money managers. Goldberg did not immediately
return an email from Reuters seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldberg's strategy basically depends on finding relative
value among the different energy markets he trades in, according
to people briefed on the matter. In principle, the relative
strategy seeks to exploit price discrepancies between different
commodities, their delivery dates and locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldberg's focus will be on spreads in London-traded gasoil
 and Brent oil, and U.S. crude, gasoline
 and natural gas, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trades will be primarily in futures, listed options and
cleared swaps. Positions will focus on the "forward curve,"
where contract deliveries are 3 months to 24 months out and
where Goldberg has had his longest track record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trades can last from a day to a month in the short term and
one to six months over the long term, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said minimum investment at the fund will be $1 million,
and investors are allowed redeem their money with a 45-day
notice. The firm will charge the industry standard fee of 2
percent on management and 20 percent on profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldberg's fund launch comes at a difficult time for
commodity hedge funds, with data showing the majority of them
losing money every month since January, the longest losing
streak on record. The average commodity fund slid 3.58 percent
in the first six months of the year, according to data from the
closely watched Newedge commodity index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldberg joined Glencore's U.S. operations in 2010 as a
partner before the public listing of the merchant commodity
trader in 2011 and its merger with Xstrata in May this year. He
left earlier this year after leading Glencore's efforts to
diversify from non-physical commodity trading, those who know of
his record said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldberg started his career with Goldman in 2003, working
first with oil consumers and refiners on hedging strategies and
risk management offered by the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on to trade grains and base and precious metals, as
well as oil and natural gas, while Goldman ran a huge
proprietary trading business before the Dodd-Frank financial law
that reshaped financial risk taking on Wall Street. While he
managed risks across commodities, his niche was in gasoline and
distillate products.&lt;/p&gt;

("RMS"); d) the Company had overstated the value of RMS; and e) as a result of the foregoing, all statements at relevant times were materially false and misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On March 18, 2013, the Company disclosed that it had identified a material weakness in&#160;its internal control over financial reporting. On this news, the Company's shares fell 20% to close at $32.98 on March 19, 2013. On June 6, 2013, the Company reported that it had discovered a failure to record certain estimated liabilities to investors relating to servicing error by RMS and, therefore, RMS' financial statements should no longer be relied upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Testimony ended Monday in the civil fraud case of Fabrice Tourre, with lawyers for former Goldman Sachs trader not calling any witnesses before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's case goes to a Manhattan federal jury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond and Katya Wachtel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Testimony ended Monday in the
civil fraud case of Fabrice Tourre, with lawyers for former
Goldman Sachs trader not calling any witnesses before the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission's case goes to a Manhattan
federal jury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers had been expected to call witnesses
including hedge fund billionaire John Paulson to testify on his
behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, his lawyers asked the presiding judge to take the
case away from the jury and rule in Tourre's favor, which, as
expected, she rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of evidence the jury is entitled to weigh,"
U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closing arguments will begin on Tuesday morning, and Forrest
said jury deliberations may begin on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused Tourre of not disclosing to investors that
Paulson's hedge fund firm, Paulson &amp; Co Inc, selected mortgage
securities tied to a 2007 deal called Abacus 2007-AC1 and
planned to bet against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC also said Tourre misled ACA Capital Holdings Inc,
the company brought in to select assets linked to Abacus, into
believing Paulson would be an equity investor in the $2 billion
synthetic collateralized debt obligation offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors in Abacus lost about $1 billion, while Paulson
made about that same amount betting against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre has denied wrongdoing. Goldman Sachs Group Inc
, originally a co-defendant, agreed in 2010 to settle with
the SEC for $550 million without admitting wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC rested its case Monday after playing a video
deposition of Michael Nartey, a former Goldman employee in
London who marketed Abacus notes to IKB Deutsche Industriebank

deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, the SEC introduced testimony from 11 witnesses who
appeared live or gave depositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre testified for three days. While his lawyers did not
call any other witnesses, eight the SEC called were on Tourre's
witness list too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jurors may consider Tourre's decision not to call other

       Long, P.A., including former Special Assistant United States 
      Attorney, Timothy J. MacFall, announces that a complaint has been filed 
      in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida 
      on behalf of all persons or entities that purchased the common stock of 
      Walter Investment Management Corp. (&#8220;Walter Investment&#8221; or the 
      &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NYSE: WAC) 
      between May 9, 2012 and June 6, 2013, inclusive (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;), 
      alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against the 
      Company and certain of its officers (the &#8220;Complaint&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you purchased shares of Walter Investment during the Class Period, or 
      purchased shares prior to the Class Period and still hold Walter 
      Investment, and wish to discuss this action or have any questions 
      concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact Timothy 
      J. MacFall, Esquire or Peter Allocco of Rigrodsky  Long, P.A., 825 
      East Gate Boulevard, Suite 300, Garden City, NY at (888) 969-4242, by 
      e-mail to info@rl-legal.com, or 
      at: http://www.rigrodskylong.com/investigations/walter-investment-management-corp-wac.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walter Investment is a fee-based business services provider to the 
      residential mortgage industry. The Complaint alleges that throughout the 
      Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading 
      statements, and omitted materially adverse facts, about the Company&#8217;s 
      business, operations and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges 
      that the defendants concealed from the investing public that: (1) the 
      Company lacked adequate internal controls over financial accounting; (2) 
      the Company&#8217;s internal controls were not effective; (3) the Company&#8217;s 
      financial statements contained false and misleading statements; (4) the 
      Company had failed to disclose material weaknesses in the internal 
      controls of Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Inc. (&#8220;RMS&#8221;); (5) the Company 
      had overstated the value of its recent acquisition, RMS; and (6) as a 
      result of the foregoing, the Company&#8217;s statements were materially false 
      and misleading at all relevant times. As a result of defendants&#8217; false 
      and misleading statements, the Company&#8217;s stock traded at artificially 
      inflated prices during the Class Period. During this time, Company 
      insiders utilized these inflated prices to sell over $6.9 million worth 
      of their Company shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the Complaint, on November 7, 2012, the Company announced 
      that it had completed the acquisition of RMS, a mortgage company with a 
      similar business model to Walter Investment, for consideration of 
      approximately $120 million, $95 million of which was cash consideration 
      and the remainder with 891,265 of the Company&#8217;s shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On March 18, 2013, the Company shocked investors by disclosing, based on 
      an evaluation by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and management, that a 
      material weakness had been identified in the Company&#8217;s internal control 
      over financial reporting. On this news, shares in Walter Investment 
      dropped more than 20%, closing at $32.98 per share on March 19, 2013, on 
      heavy trading volume of over 9 million shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company addressed the totality of the weaknesses in its financial 
      reporting practices on June 6, 2013. Among other things, the Company 
      stated that as a result of &#8220;a failure to record certain estimated 
      liabilities to investors relating the servicing errors by RMS . . . the 
      RMS Historical Financial Statements, and the related report of RMS&#8217; 
      historical independent registered public accounting firm, should no 
      longer be relied upon, and should be restated to reflect the error 
      described above.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later 
      than September 23, 2013. A lead plaintiff is a representative party 
      acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In 
      order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the 
      class member&#8217;s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, 
      and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Your 
      ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the 
      decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Any member of the 
      proposed class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff through 
      counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an 
      absent class member.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While Rigrodsky 
       Long, P.A. did not file the Complaint in this matter, the 
      firm, with offices in Wilmington, Delaware and Garden City, New York, regularly 
      litigates securities class, derivative and direct actions, shareholder 
      rights litigation and corporate governance litigation, including 
      claims for breach of fiduciary duty and proxy violations in the Delaware 
      Court of Chancery and in state and federal courts throughout the United 
      States.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, in what could be the prelude to spinning off its generics drug business, said it plans to separate its commercial operations into two units, mainly for patent-protected brands and a third for generics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, said on Monday the changes will take effect by January in countries that do not require a consultation with labor unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Pfizer said it would begin examining the finances of its patent-protected unit, which it calls its "innovative" business, and its generic operation, called its "value" business, to decide whether to spin off the generics operation. It said the review would take three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer generics, which have far lower profit margins than patent-protected drugs, had global sales last year of $10.2 billion. The business represents 17 percent of total sales and overwhelmingly comes from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One "innovative" business will include drugs expected to have patent protection beyond 2015 and focus on treatment areas such as inflammation, immunology, cardiovascular and metabolic, neuroscience and pain, rare diseases and women's and men's health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geno Germano, who currently heads Specialty Care and Oncology, will head the Innovative Products Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other "innovative" business will include vaccines, cancer and consumer healthcare, to be headed by Amy Schulman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vaccines, oncology and consumer operations that will be bundled together seem unlikely bed fellows," Citibank analyst Andrew Baum said in a research note. He speculated that the components, all dependable sources of revenue, were grouped together to provide a "balanced" revenue base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said the structure of the three planned units, although not obvious at first, seems sound. Germano's business, which Fernandez called "innovative core #1," will have the largest sales force and provide global administrative and research support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schulman's group, "innovative core #2," will require far fewer sales representatives and likely have the highest value, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors should be pleased" with the planned structure, Fernandez said, including the fact that it integrates into all three units a focus on sales in emerging markets - fast-growing countries like China, India, Russia and Brazil, where the industry aims to reap most of its growth in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts have urged Pfizer to spin off its generics business, just like it did with the nutritional products and animal health units in recent years, so it can focus on its core, more lucrative branded pharmaceuticals business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baum and Fernandez said any spin-off of a company division would be unlikely before 2016, after Pfizer completes its examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schulman is Pfizer's general counsel and also heads the company's consumer healthcare unit, a $4 billion-a-year business. Pfizer has shown no interest in selling the unit, which makes the Advil painkiller and Robitussin cold treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Pfizer's top lawyer, Schulman helped negotiate its purchase of drugmaker Wyeth in 2009 and spearheaded Pfizer's $11.85 billion sale last year of its nutritionals products, a business she headed, to Swiss food giant Nestle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Douglas Lankler, who is now chief compliance and risk officer, takes over as general counsel on January 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "value" business unit, to be headed by John Young, will generally include products that will lose patent protection through 2015 in most major markets. It will also include biosimilars, which are generic forms of biotech medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First-quarter sales of Pfizer generics fell 16 percent to $2.35 billion, dragging down overall company results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares gained nearly 1.2 percent to $29.73 in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Fifteen years ago, a boom in
global commodity trading was underway, and JPMorgan was late to
the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to catch up with Wall Street rivals, JPMorgan
recruited a young trader, Danny Masters. Within a few years, it
had built a global platform that eclipsed its peers. At last it
was a major player in markets from oil to metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it pulled the plug. Regulatory scrutiny in metals
markets had tarnished its reputation; the gains from shipping
oil around the world no longer seemed worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, history repeated itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. announced it would try to sell or spin
off its physical commodity trading assets and operations,
dismantling an empire built over five years by commodities chief
Blythe Masters, 44, ex-wife of Danny Masters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement came almost 15 years to the day after the
bank said it would end its first big foray into raw materials,
led then by Danny when the couple was still married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operations for sale now account for as much as
two-thirds of the bank's $2 billion-plus commodity revenues.
They include 72 metal warehouses, three power plants, oil
contracts and hundreds of traders from Singapore to Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What remains will be a more traditional derivatives and
precious metals operation, not unlike what the bank had in the
early 1990s, when J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. hired Danny Masters to help
break into the ranks of the "Wall Street refiners," banks like
Morgan Stanley and Solomon Brothers that were driving
growth of the modern oil market. His team became major players
in the dynamic European crude market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For a year or two, there was nobody bigger than JP Morgan,"
said one senior industry executive in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, JPMorgan was building up a large
London base metals business, a new area for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of it would last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1996, J.P. Morgan was named as one of at least four banks
caught up in the Sumitomo Corp. copper trading scandal, when
rogue trader Yasuo Hamanaka racked up $2.6 billion in
unauthorized losses. Morgan, which had loaned money to the
Japanese trading firm, was the only bank to be rapped by
regulators for lax controls. It wound down the London desk by
1997 to focus on customer business, it said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1998, a year after Masters was named to lead the
global energy business, the bank announced plans to sell the
35-person trading team, a fraction the size of its current
500-plus commodities division. An executive said at the time
that a buyer with a strategic focus on energy trading "was in
the best interests of clients, employees and Morgan overall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, it shut down the unit after oil slumped to
$10 a barrel, discouraging potential buyers. In 1999, Danny
Masters set up one of the first commodity-focused hedge funds.
He could not be reached to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cambridge-educated Brit Blythe Levett, who had interned at
JPMorgan since 1987, had barely begun her career on the
commodities desk when the bank launched its bold plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She married Danny before he joined JPMorgan, and left the
commodities group before he started. She later won acclaim for
helping create credit derivatives. In 2001, they divorced. Five
years later, Blythe Masters returned to commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did not respond to email seeking a comment for this
article, and the bank declined to make her available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROCKY RE-START&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2004, oil prices were pushing past a record $50 a barrel,
copper was $3,000 per tonne, and investment banks were again
piling into commodities. Merrill Lynch, Barclays and
Deutche Bank were gaining on Goldman and Morgan
Stanley, which had enjoyed years of dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan saw "huge potential" in the business and believed
it could compete with the two big rivals, says a person familiar
with its commodities business at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank hired Morgan Stanley's top power and gas trader,
George "Beau" Taylor, to jump-start the effort. He beefed up the
desk with big trades and doubled the energy team to 70 within a
year. He said at the time he wanted to add more of "the proper
rainmakers in the right seats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next year, the bank scored a coup when one client, hedge
fund Amaranth Advisors, melted down after bad natural gas
trades. JPMorgan and hedge fund Citadel took over Amaranth's
trades and earned an estimated $725 million on that deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the business Taylor built lacked a large base of
customer flow and produced volatile results, including a
sizeable loss in the first quarter of 2006, although annual
results were strong, according to former employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2007, JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon told
analysts the bank had "not had the level of earnings stability
that we would have liked in energy." Value at risk in
commodities, a measure of the bank's own money being wagered,
more than doubled to an average $45 million a day in 2006;
Goldman Sachs' VaR, by contrast, was $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the bank refocused more on client-driven business, rather
than proprietary trading, Taylor left for a rival months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a period of turmoil in the trading business. Dimon
restructured the foreign exchange and commodities groups three
times in seven months. Blythe Masters, who had been the
investment bank's chief financial officer since 2004, took over
on a temporary basis in late 2006 and then, in mid-2007, was
formally named to run the commodities group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOP OF THE WORLD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following year would mark the start of an acquisition
spree that would transform the bank. But it would still take
years for Masters to get the business firing on all cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her first public appearance after taking over the
group was before a Senate subcommittee to talk about JPMorgan's
global environmental products trading division, and push for a
U.S. scheme. The bank's role in the still-young carbon market
was going to be "her thing," said one former employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the private markets to most effectively address the
problem of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, which
practitioners refer to as carbon, must have a price," Masters
told lawmakers at the July 2007 hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2008, JPMorgan bought carbon offsetting company
ClimateCare. In September, 2009, it paid $200 million to acquire
UK-based EcoSecurities, which developed clean energy programs
and carbon offsets as part of the Kyoto protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But efforts to create a U.S. emissions trading scheme were
collapsing by 2010, while the European Union's cap-and-trade
system, the world's biggest, went into freefall amid a glut of
credits and a dearth of confidence in new global curbs.
ClimateCare's management took the firm private in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, JPMorgan was doubling down on traditional
markets. In the early days of the 2008 financial crisis, it took
its first step back into physical trade, buying Bear Stearns,
along with its power plants and large trading book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following year it bought UBS's global agricultural book
and Canadian energy unit, a group that once worked for Enron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest deal came in early 2010. Royal Bank of Scotland,
bailed out by the UK government, was forced to sell off the
Sempra Commodities group it had bought a majority stake in just
before the crisis struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2010, Blythe Masters closed the $1.7 billion deal,
acquiring a global physical oil trading platform with a history
of big risks, and big rewards. It also had a premier base metal
trading and warehousing division that traced its roots back to
Metallgesellschaft (MG), the German enterprise that dominated
the London market in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ON TRACK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same year, JPMorgan suffered what Masters called a
"rookie" loss in illiquid coal markets estimated to have cost
the bank as much as $250 million. She was also enraged by the
publication of an internal conference call on which she told the
group's 600 traders that competitors were "scared shitless".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the traders at Sempra had already been chafing at
the more restrictive environment of a bank. In 2011, some of
them followed their former bosses to a new trading house called
Freepoint Commodities, backed by a private equity fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After these setbacks, the group seemed on track by mid-2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April last year, Blythe Masters inaugurated the first
educational program in the United States dedicated to broad
commodity trading, at the University of Colorado. Its lab was
filled with rows of trading terminals and premium data services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told CNBC at the time that JPMorgan expected client
demand for commodity finance, risk management and trading to
grow "very, very rapidly over the next couple of decades in
fact. ... we are very excited about the prospects for growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last July, JPMorgan clinched a deal that would make it the
11th largest U.S. oil importer: a three-year contract to supply
crude and sell products from the 330,000 barrel per day in
Philadelphia, the biggest on the U.S. East Coast. It was part of
a wide-ranging financing deal that helped Carlyle Group 
buy the plant, saving it from closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal showed how the combination of "physical
capabilities with our financial risk management and structuring
skills" offered "unique differentiators," Roy Salame, head of
global sales and structuring, told Energy Risk magazine in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNRAVELLING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time JPMorgan was named Risk's "Oil and Products
House of the Year" two months ago, however, things had already
begun to sour behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve, which for the past decade has allowed
commercial banks to trade broadly in physical markets, from
Middle East crude to power plant tolls, was looking more closely
than ever at how banks were operating in these markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A "review" of its landmark 2003 decision, made public in an
abrupt announcement last Friday, had in practice been underway
for months as the regulator queried other banks on pending
requests, according to a source who speaks to the Fed regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has declined to comment on the review,
or any discussion with any specific bank on commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Reuters report in early 2012 made it clear JPMorgan would
probably have to sell off the Henry Bath operation. Even deeper
questions arose that had forced the bank to review the future of
the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Michael Cavanagh, a co-chief executive of the
corporate and investment bank, told investors that because of
"changes in regulation, particularly around the physical side"
it would be looking to "optimize" the commodities group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next month, the U.S. power market regulator told
JPMorgan it was looking into allegations that JPMorgan
manipulated power markets in the Midwest and California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressure on the bank mounted last week, when a U.S. Senate
banking subcommitted grilled experts over whether investment
banks should be allowed to own warehouses and trade oil tankers,
putting unprecedented scrutiny the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, after announcing the bank's exit, a spokesman
said simply: "We considered many different factors, including
the impact of potential new rules and regulation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 29 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Monday said it
plans to internally separate its commercial operations into
three business segments, including a unit that sells
patent-protected branded drugs and one that sells generic
medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. drugmaker said it will implement the
changes in January in countries that do not require a
consultation with labor unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer earlier this year said it would begin separately
examining the finances and marketing of its patent-protected
drug business, which it calls its "innovative" business, and its
generic business as a possible prelude to selling off the
generic business in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer To Create Separate, Internal, Global Innovative And Value 
      Businesses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, Pfizer is announcing plans to move forward to internally separate 
      its commercial operations into three business segments, two of which 
      will include Innovative business lines and a third which will include 
      the Value business line. Each of the three segments will include 
      developed markets and emerging markets. The changes will be implemented 
      in January 2014 in countries that do not require a consultation with 
      works councils or unions, and will be implemented in countries that 
      require consultation after the successful conclusion of those processes. 
      Beginning with the first-quarter 2014 financial results, the company 
      will provide financial transparency for each of these three business 
      segments, which will include a 2014 baseline management view of profit 
      and loss for each segment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the Innovative business segments will be led by Geno Germano, 
      Group President, Innovative Products Group. It will generally include 
      products across multiple therapeutic areas that are expected to have 
      market exclusivity beyond 2015. The therapeutic areas include 
      Inflammation and Immunology, CV/Metabolic, Neuroscience and Pain, Rare 
      Diseases and Women&#8217;s /Men&#8217;s Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other Innovative business segment will include Vaccines, Oncology 
      and Consumer Healthcare and will be led by Amy Schulman, Group 
      President, Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare. Each of these 
      businesses will operate as a separate global business and require 
      distinct specialization in terms of the science, talent, and market 
      approach required to deliver value to consumers and patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Value business segment will be led by John Young, Group President, 
      Value Products Group. This group will include products that generate 
      strong, consistent cash flow, and will be positioned to provide patients 
      access to effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. In addition to 
      products that have lost market exclusivity, it will generally include 
      mature, patent-protected products that are expected to lose exclusivity 
      through 2015 in most major markets, biosimilars and current and future 
      established products collaborations, such as our existing partnerships 
      with Mylan in Japan, Teuto in Brazil and Hisun in China.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Olivier Brandicourt will lead the transition from the current Emerging 
      Markets organization to the regional structure that will be established 
      for each of the three business segments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In connection with the changes we are announcing today, Douglas Lankler, 
      currently Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, will become General 
      Counsel, and Rady Johnson, currently Senior Vice President and Associate 
      General Counsel, will become Chief Compliance and Risk Officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All leadership changes will be effective January 1, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY ---
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ian Read, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, &#8220;This represents 
      the next steps in Pfizer&#8217;s journey to further revitalize our innovative 
      core, enhance the value of our consumer and off-patent established 
      brands and maximize the use of our capital to create value for Pfizer 
      and our shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through this evolution, we will enable greater independence and focus 
      for the Innovative and Value businesses. Our new commercial operating 
      model will provide each business with an enhanced ability to respond to 
      market dynamics, greater visibility and focus, and distinctive 
      capabilities optimized to deliver value to patients and shareholders in 
      the coming years.&#8221;

			Pfizer Announces Reduced Advance Market Commitment Price with a 
      Further Reduction Beginning in 2014
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) welcomes today&#8217;s announcement from the GAVI 
      Alliance regarding the signing of a new supply agreement for Pfizer to 
      provide additional doses of Prevenar 13* (Pneumococcal Polysaccharide 
      Conjugate Vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]), the company&#8217;s 13-valent 
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, for use in infants and young children to 
      help protect against pneumococcal disease1 in the world&#8217;s 
      poorest countries under the terms of the Advance Market Commitment 
      (AMC). Pneumococcal disease is one of the leading causes of 
      vaccine-preventable deaths worldwide in children younger than 5 years of 
      age.2 Prevenar 13 is a vaccine that helps protect against the 
      13 strains of pneumococcal disease that are included in the vaccine. In 
      the United States, it is known as Prevnar 13 and is used for the 
      prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young 
      children.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The AMC is an innovative public health financing mechanism designed to 
      accelerate global rollout of vaccines in the world&#8217;s poorest countries 
      and is administered by the GAVI Alliance, a global health partnership 
      committed to saving children&#8217;s lives by increasing access to 
      immunization. Under the terms of the new supply agreement, Pfizer has 
      committed to supply the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) with up 
      to 260 million doses of Prevenar 13, at a reduced tail price, over the 
      course of the agreement period (through 2025). This is in addition to 
      480 million doses of the vaccine already committed through the first two 
      Supply Agreements. The tail price is the reduced price per dose set by 
      the manufacturer and paid by GAVI; the remaining amount is paid by the 
      AMC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer will offer Prevenar 13 through the AMC at the reduced price of 
      $3.40 per dose for the remainder of this year, at which time the price 
      will further decrease to $3.30 per dose for the remainder of the 
      agreement. This pricing will apply to doses purchased under all AMC 
      Supply Agreements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer is dedicated to broadening vaccine access and helping to improve 
      health outcomes around the world, and we&#8217;re proud to make Prevenar 13 
      available through the AMC program,&#8221; said Susan Silbermann, president, 
      vaccines at Pfizer. &#8220;Strong vaccination programs are a cornerstone of 
      economic development &#8211; a simple intervention that has dramatic short and 
      long term impact on health. Since first offering Prevenar 13 through the 
      AMC in 2010, we have continued to support this revolutionary public 
      health program that helps those most in need of potentially lifesaving 
      vaccinations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer entered into the first Supply Agreement to participate in the AMC 
      in March 2010, and then expanded its commitment through a second Supply 
      Agreement in 2011, pledging to supply Prevenar 13 through 2023. Since 
      Pfizer&#8217;s original agreement with the AMC in 2010, more than 20 countries 
      have introduced Prevenar 13 into their immunization programs,3 
      and pneumococcal vaccines are expected to reach more than 50 
      GAVI-supported countries by 2015.3 Prevenar 13 was first 
      introduced for use in infants and young children in December 2009 in 
      Europe and is now approved for such use in more than 120 countries 
      worldwide.
			Prevenar 13 is also approved for use in children 
      six weeks to 17 years old and adults 18 and older in Europe and certain 
      other countries. In the United States, Prevnar 13 (Pneumococcal 
      13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 
      Protein]) is not indicated for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia 
      in the pediatric population and is not approved for adults 18 through 49 
      years of age.5
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 is the most widely used pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 
      the world, and more than 500 million doses of Prevenar/Prevenar 13 have 
      been distributed worldwide.4 Prevenar 13 offers the broadest 
      serotype coverage of any currently available pneumococcal conjugate 
      vaccine for prevention of pneumococcal disease.1,5

			About Advance Market Commitments (AMCs)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The AMC is a public-private health funding mechanism administered by the 
      GAVI Alliance that is designed to create a sustainable marketplace, 
      ensure an affordable and stable supply of newer vaccines at a steeply 
      discounted price and stimulate the development and expansion of 
      manufacturing capacity for vaccines specifically for the world's poorest 
      countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Donors commit funds to guarantee the price of vaccines once they have 
      been developed. These financial commitments provide vaccine 
      manufacturers with the incentive they need to invest in vaccine research 
      and development, and to expand manufacturing capacity. In exchange, 
      companies sign a legally-binding commitment to provide the vaccines at a 
      price affordable to developing countries in the long term. For more 
      formation on AMCs, please go to www.vaccineamc.org.

			Pneumococcal Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease is a group of illnesses caused by the bacterium Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), also known as pneumococcus.6 
      It can affect people of all ages, although older adults, young children 
      and individuals with certain chronic medical conditions are at 
      heightened risk.7 The World Health Organization estimates 
      that more than 1.6 million people &#8212;including more than 800,000 children 
      younger than 5 years of age &#8212;die every year from pneumococcal 
      infections. Nearly all these deaths occur in the world&#8217;s poorest 
      countries.8 Pneumococcal disease includes invasive infections 
      such as bacteremia (bacteria in the blood) and meningitis (infection of 
      the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord), as well as 
      noninvasive disease such as pneumonia and acute otitis media (middle ear 
      infection).6
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			U.S. Indication for Prevnar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13 is a vaccine approved for children 6 weeks through 17 years 
        of age for the prevention of invasive disease caused by 13 S. 
        pneumoniae strains (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 
        and 23F), and for children 6 weeks through 5 years for the prevention 
        of otitis media caused by 7 of the 13 strains (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 
        19F, and 23F)
      
			
        Based upon immune responses to the vaccine, Prevnar 13 is also 
        approved for adults 50 years of age and older for the prevention of 
        pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive disease caused by the 13 vaccine 
        strains
      
			
        Prevnar 13 is not 100% effective and will only help protect against 
        the 13 strains included in the vaccine
      
			
        Effectiveness when given less than 5 years after a pneumococcal 
        polysaccharide vaccine is not known
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13 should not be given to anyone with a history of severe 
        allergic reaction to any component of Prevnar 13 or any diphtheria 
        toxoid&#8211;containing vaccine
      
			
        Children and adults with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV infection, 
        leukemia) may have a reduced immune response
      
			
        A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been observed 
        in some infants born prematurely
      
			
        The most commonly reported serious adverse events in infants and 
        toddlers were bronchiolitis (an infection of the lungs) (0.9%), 
        gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and small intestine) 
        (0.9%), and pneumonia (0.9%)
      
			
        In children 6 weeks through 17 years, the most common side effects 
        were tenderness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, 
        irritability, decreased appetite, decreased or increased sleep, and 
        fever. Most commonly reported side effects in children 5 years through 
        17 years also included hives
      
			
        In adults, immune responses to Prevnar 13 were reduced when given with 
        injected seasonal flu vaccine
      
			
        In adults, the common side effects were pain, redness, or swelling at 
        the injection site, limitation of arm movement, fatigue, headache, 
        muscle pain, joint pain, decreased appetite, chills, or rash
      
			
        Ask your health care provider about the risks and benefits of Prevnar 
        13. Only a health care provider can decide if Prevnar 13 is right for 
        you or your child

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - As JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) prepares to exit physical commodities trading, the spotlight is turning to the future of the two banks that have dominated Wall Street's involvement in the natural resources supply chain for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) two decades ago became known as the 'Wall Street Refiners' for their mastery of both financial and physical commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since 2012 Morgan Stanley has looked at selling its commodity arm and Goldman has made moves to scale back its physical operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letters between the banks and the Federal Reserve, received by Reuters under the Freedom of Information Act, show both banks are in discussions on conforming or divesting activities that fall outside the normal scope of commercial banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been looking at selling its Metro International metals warehouses firm since at least March, but it has also publicly reaffirmed its commitment to its J. Aron commodities business, where CEO Lloyd Blankfein started his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley has been looking at a possible spin-off or sale of its commodity arm since last summer, but with little success. Recent moves suggest it may try to refocus on its vast physical oil trading arm and exit peripheral markets like Australian electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is, in part, whether they will be able to choose their own future, or will the Federal Reserve's decision to review the entire role of Wall Street in physical commodities markets see regulators make the choice for them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past 10 days has seen unprecedented scrutiny of Wall Street's commodity trade, with a Senate hearing questioning whether banks should be allowed to own pipelines, warehouses and other commercial assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators and the Department of Justice have launched initial investigations into the metals warehousing business of banks and other big commodity traders, which have been accused of driving up the price of aluminum by drink can manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan cited the growing regulatory pressures as one of the reasons it has decided to exit physical commodities trading, it was not clear if it was influenced by the banks' discussions with the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person familiar with the matter said on Friday the bank had decided the profits from commodities were too slight to be worth the regulatory and reputational risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Jamie Dimon has been trying to put the bank back on course after a series of costly trading moves and regulatory run-ins, including a potential $410 million settlement over alleged power market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it was any one thing, but a culmination of things, that drove (JPMorgan's) decision," said Craig Pirrong, a professor at the University of Houston and expert in commodity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The legal and reputational risks, the Fed's likely action to constrain - if not eliminate - this sort of trading, the increasing capital strains on banks, and especially the political heat being directed at the industry. In the scheme of things at JPMorgan, commodities just weren't big enough and profitable enough to be worth all this bother."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LETTERS FROM THE FED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley may hold one advantage over JPMorgan, as their long history of operating in physical commodities as less regulated banks may provide them with "grandfathered" ownership of assets like warehouses, pipelines and storage tanks that other commercial banks aren't allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think there is a necessary or clear link between whatever the Fed's position is on JPMorgan's ownership of physical assets - if, in fact, it is the Fed that is pushing JPMorgan to divest - and the Fed's position on Goldman and Morgan Stanley," said Saule Omarova, associate professor of law at the University of North Carolina, who appeared at the Senate banking committee hearing last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are signs the Federal Reserve is still reviewing this position, just two months before a five-year deadline expires for Goldman and Morgan Stanley to conform their business activities to the Bank Holding Company Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Federal Reserve letter to the Goldman Sachs' lawyers in 2012, obtained by Reuters, said that "specifically, Goldman Sachs continues to engage in commodity-related activities and indirectly controls (redacted) impermissible non-real-estate investments that the Board has not authorized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter, dated September 19 2012, said the Fed was granting another one year extension for Goldman as it had made a "good faith effort to conform its impermissible activities" and had "taken steps to restructure or divest its commodity-related activities and its non-real estate investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment when asked what assets or activities the Fed letter referred to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear if the Fed was referring to Metro International, which Goldman bought two years after converting to a commercial bank during the financial crisis, and is now looking to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has already got rid of many of the physical trading assets it owned in 2008. Last year it sold its power plant business Cogentrix to private-equity firm the Carlyle Group. Its U.S. power sales have fallen since then, according to regulatory filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and are less than one sixth of their peak in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank may choose to focus on financial trading of commodity derivatives and other products, one of its strongest areas. It is already a much smaller player in global crude markets than it was in the 1990s. Oil traders and Wall Street rivals say it is rarely seen moving tankers of crude these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year it imported 5,000 barrels per day of crude oil to the United States, mainly for a small asphalt refinery in California, U.S. Energy Information Administration data shows. JPMorgan imported 50 times more, or around 250,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite launching a metals trading desk in 2010 after its purchase of Metro, it has struggled to compete against big merchant commodity firms like Glencore Xstrata and Trafigura, trading sources say. Two senior metals traders, Scott Evans and David Freeland, left Goldman earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas is the exception, where it has grown from a small presence to be a top 10 physical gas trader in North America since 2010, after its purchase of Nexen's trading book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Hintz, a Wall Street analyst at Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co in New York and a former treasurer of Morgan Stanley, said that regulatory pressures would probably lead to other banks eventually following JPMorgan's lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The commodities business of the future will likely devolve to its financing and risk management core and the banks will be less active in the physical markets," Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the vernacular of the commodities market - Wall Street will become "paper" traders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Morgan Stanley, the situation may be more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It went deeper than any other bank into physical oil trading, including acquiring its TransMontaigne terminal and storage firm, which Forbes magazine estimates is the 17th largest private company in the United States, with revenues of more than $14 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's request to the Federal Reserve for another year's leeway, also released to Reuters by the Federal Reserve under the Freedom of Information Act, consisted of eight heavily redacted pages and 10 annexes. It is not clear what physical commodity assets, if any, have been kept from public view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley could not be reached over the weekend to answer questions over what non-conforming assets were redacted in the Fed letter, and what, if any, assets had been conformed or divested since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is known is that despite all the regulatory uncertainty, TransMontaigne has pushed ahead with one of its biggest physical asset investments ever, taking a 42.5 percent stake in a $485 million oil terminal near Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Morgan Stanley tied itself even more closely to TransMontaigne, extending the majority of its oil terminal leases with the firm indefinitely, according to a filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank remains by far the most exposed to the growing pressure on banks in physical commodity trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHIBRO PRECEDENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan's commodity division, it is not clear how the next few months will go. Blythe Masters, one of the most powerful women on Wall Street, will remain in charge of the business and oversee the sale, but Morgan Stanley's experience may suggest it may not be straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the bank has already sold more than half of its electricity trading contracts, it still has a vast number of physical deals and assets, including long-term supply and sales agreements with two major U.S. refineries, and its Henry Bath metals warehouse market has over 70 locations worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an already crowded market, who would buy its assets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I doubt banks will buy. Which only leaves the physical trading houses and some of these newly formed merchant traders like Castleton and Freepoint," said a trader at a Western trading house in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is one possible alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Citigroup said in a press release - reminiscent of JPMorgan's statement on Friday - that it was evaluating "strategic alternatives" for its physical energy unit Phibro, including a possible sale of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank had absorbed the big energy trader in its merger with Travelers Group that year, but banking regulations did not automatically allow it to run the business given its dealings in physical tankers of crude oil and pipelines of natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years later Phibro was still a part of Citigroup, and the Federal Reserve granted approval for the bank to carry on trading in physical markets - a landmark decision the Fed says it is now reviewing. That approval opened the doors to almost every other commercial bank on Wall Street getting permission to trade physical commodities over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phibro was eventually sold to oil firm Occidental in 2008, after public outrage over a $100 million bonus Citigroup was set to pay to star oil trader Andy Hall, despite receiving a government bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pirrong, the professor and commodities expert, said that even if the banks do exit the physical business, they would likely be replaced by other "financial" firms, like private equity groups or hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Finance and commodities are inherently intertwined, and will continue to be so," Pirrong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The identities of the financial firms that are involved may change, but they will perform the same basic functions and provide the same basic products and services that the banks do now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Josephine Mason, Jonathan Leff and Jeanine Prezioso in New York, Florence Tan in Singapore; Editing by Michael Perry and Amran Abocar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - For third time in five years, one of the world's biggest commodity trading desks is for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) said on Friday it would seek "strategic alternatives" for its physical oil, gas, power and metals trading division, the core of which is a group that's already been through two ownership changes since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a surprise about-face for a bank that spent billions of dollars over the past five years assembling the largest physical trading platform on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On paper, it seems the perfect one-stop shop for a financial rival looking to buy into the world of pipelines and pallets: a global oil trading division includes a contract supplying the biggest refinery on the East Coast; Henry Bath &amp; Sons Ltd's 72 metal warehouses from Baltimore to Busan; a U.S. natural gas book three times larger than that of any other bank; and enough electricity contracts to light up Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet while other banks have often competed with JPMorgan as it acquired parts of Bear Stearns, UBS and RBS Sempra, this time around -- with a few exceptions -- they are more likely selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. and European banks face the same rising capital requirements, regulatory pressures and narrowing margins that are driving JPMorgan to quit the business, hearkening the end of an era in which banks raced to get into the physical trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since March, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has floated selling its warehousing business Metro International Trade Services LLC, a rival to JPMorgan's Henry Bath. For more than a year, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has tried, in vain, to sell its vast oil pipeline and terminals business TransMontaigne. It faces a September deadline from the Federal Reserve for a make-or-break decision over whether it will be able to keep the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately this is going to be a hard sale," one industry banker said of J.P. Morgan's offer to sell. "Look at what happened with Morgan Stanley's commodity business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers and industry sources said potential buyers could come from one of several areas: foreign banks like Brazil's BTG Pactual or Macquarie that are not subject to Fed regulations; merchant traders like Vitol or Mercuria that are expanding into metals markets; or wealthy, risk-hungry investors such as private equity and sovereign wealth funds, both of which have delved into commodity trading in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operation is so vast and diverse that it may be hard to find a single buyer, forcing JPMorgan to split the units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know that anyone will buy it lock stock and barrel. Perhaps the energy desk will go to a hedge fund but it has to be somebody with credit and trading lines for a physical company," said Ed Meir, an analyst at brokerage INTL FCStone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has said it may seek a joint venture, spin-out or sale, but has not said whether it will seek to keep the division whole or sell it in parts. But it has the luxury of some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that it has openly announced selling the group, it should have until July of 2015 to meet a Federal Reserve five-year grace period for divesting the Henry Bath unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns in 2008, inheriting a huge electricity desk and power plants as the financial crisis loomed. A year later it bought the global agricultural and Canadian energy businesses of UBS, which was quitting the market several years after buying remnants of failed merchant Enron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowning achievement for Commodities chief Blythe Masters came in 2010, when JPMorgan paid $1.7 billion for the metals and oil divisions of RBS Sempra Commodities. Eurpoean regulators forced the Royal Bank of Scotland to sell its stake to gain approval from Brussels for a state bailout. RBS had paid $1.35 billion for a 51 percent stake just two years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it is JPMorgan who is under pressure on multiple fronts. The bank is said to be in talks over a $400 million deal to settle allegations that it manipulated power markets; the metals warehousing industry is under public and political scrutiny over allegations that long queues are driving up prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as of last week, the Federal Reserve is reconsidering a landmark 2003 decision that first allowed banks to trade physical commodities, in addition to traditional derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of those factors may deter certain new players, particularly those who choose not to establish commercial banking operations in the United States, allowing them to remain outside of the Fed's limits on commodity trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's BTG Pactual has made little secret in recent months of its desire to build a big presence in the market, hiring former Noble Group (NOBG.SI) chief executive Ricardo Leiman to jump-start a major new expansion by recruiting traders on both sides of the Atlantic, according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has declined to comment on its plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia's Macquarie Group (MQG.AX) has also built up a major presence in U.S. gas, power and oil markets over the past five years, with a 160-strong trading desk in Houston, and dipped a toe into the metals warehousing business by joining hedge fund Red Kite in buying a stake in Scale Distribution, a small firm that runs an LME warehouse in Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macquarie had expressed interest in Henry Bath and the former Sempra physical metals team when it was up for sale in 2010, sources said at the time. So had Deutsche Bank, which has since scaled back sharply in physical U.S. and European trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian bank may also make a natural buyer for some of JPMorgan's energy assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bank spokesperson declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another contender may be Noble Group (NOBG.SI), the ambitious Hong Kong-based merchant that has tried for several years to expand globally, particularly in energy and metals markets. This month it hired JPMorgan's long-time head of global oil trading Jeff Frase, a veteran Goldman trader, and poached Morgan Stanley's top European crude traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, it bought a small U.S. company, Worldwide Warehouse Solutions, which has expanded to 13 LME warehouses, including in Singapore and the Netherlands. It also hired several big traders over the past year to broaden its metals desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WAREHOUSE GEM?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one time, the crown jewel of the business would have been Henry Bath &amp; Sons, a metals and soft commodity warehousing firm based in Liverpool, Britain that is nearly 220 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, JPM told regulators Henry Bath stored between 20 and 30 percent of metal stored in the LME's warehousing network in 2009. That was as much as 1.7 million tonnes of base metals, according to Reuters calculations, equivalent to 9 percent of global annual copper use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It booked profits of $113 million that year, almost four times 2008, as a glut of metal piled up during the world economic crisis. In 2010, just as JPMorgan was buying Sempra, Goldman Sachs paid more than $500 million for smaller rival Metro and Glencore bought Pacorini Metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But profits have ebbed as metals stocks have thinned, and competition from Goldman and Glencore Xstrata (GLEN.L) increased. In 2011, Henry Bath posted net profit of $27 million. The company has slipped from No. 2 to No. 4 in the LME system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers noted that two of the world's biggest oil traders, both based in Switzerland, had expanded into base metals in the past year. Vitol hired veteran trader Roger Pillai; Mercuria hired Mike Harrison from Standard Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their appetite to enter the warehousing business is uncertain at a time when the LME has proposed sweeping reform of its warehousing policy that are meant to reduce wait times and placate irate industrial users who complain about lengthy queues for delivery, but probably will also hit profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LME board will vote on its proposal in October and the change would be implemented next April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Vitol executive said the company was not likely to be interested in JPMorgan's physical businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure who it fits," the executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan sold its metals concentrates trading team to private equity-backed start-up Freepoint Commodities in order to comply with Fed regulations. As an LME ring-dealing, the world's largest metals market, JPMorgan is also one of the largest metals brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENERGY OPTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the physical energy markets, JPMorgan had leapfrogged its rivals by this year. It became the first bank in more than a decade to surpass Morgan Stanley as the biggest U.S. oil importer due to last year's deal to supply crude to a 330,000 barrel per day (bpd) Philadelphia refinery and a smaller contract to supply Northern Tier's (NTI.N) Minnesota plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan traded nearly 3,000 trillion British thermal units (Tbtu) of physical natural gas last year, making it the eighth-largest players in the market, according to data reported to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. That was down 17 percent from 2011 but still triple its nearest rival Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy market has been the largest and most attractive for investors, but enthusiasm may wane due to a FERC crackdown on U.S. electricity trading, lower volatility in oil and natural gas and signs of growing European oversight of physical markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here too the market is crowded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a purely proprietary physical energy trading shop with global reach, what about Hess Energy Trading Co. (Hetco), the joint-venture being sold off by Hess? For a domestic U.S. operation in good position to trade the booming business of shale and ethanol, how about Gavilon's oil division, spun out from Marubeni's takeover this summer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, potential buyers must try to value the intellectual capital of an energy group that owns few assets, with few guarantees the talent will stick around after a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My feeling is large traders will not buy banks' businesses, at best they can hire some of the better individuals there, but I don't see it any further than that," said one senior executive with a major merchant trader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the obstacles, JPMorgan hopes this sale will turn out better than the last time it tried to sell an energy unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-1998, after a five-year effort to get into physical energy trading, the bank said it would sell the 35-person division, which included a large European crude desk. Six months later it folded the group, having failed to find a buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jessica Toonkel, Mike Erman, Cezary Podkul in New York; Richard Mably and Ron Bousso in London; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Fifteen years ago, a boom in
global commodity trading was underway, and JPMorgan was late to
the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to catch up with Wall Street rivals, JPMorgan
recruited a young trader, Danny Masters. Within a few years, it
had built a global platform that eclipsed its peers. At last it
was a major player in markets from oil to metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it pulled the plug. Regulatory scrutiny in metals
markets had tarnished its reputation; the gains from shipping
oil around the world no longer seemed worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, history repeated itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. announced it would try to sell or spin
off its physical commodity trading assets and operations,
dismantling an empire built over five years by commodities chief
Blythe Masters, 44, ex-wife of Danny Masters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement came almost 15 years to the day after the
bank said it would end its first big foray into raw materials,
led then by Danny when the couple was still married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operations for sale now account for as much as
two-thirds of the bank's $2 billion-plus commodity revenues.
They include 72 metal warehouses, three power plants, oil
contracts and hundreds of traders from Singapore to Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What remains will be a more traditional derivatives and
precious metals operation, not unlike what the bank had in the
early 1990s, when J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. hired Danny Masters to help
break into the ranks of the "Wall Street refiners," banks like
Morgan Stanley and Solomon Brothers that were driving
growth of the modern oil market. His team became major players
in the dynamic European crude market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For a year or two, there was nobody bigger than JP Morgan,"
said one senior industry executive in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, JPMorgan was building up a large
London base metals business, a new area for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of it would last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1996, J.P. Morgan was named as one of at least four banks
caught up in the Sumitomo Corp. copper trading scandal, when
rogue trader Yasuo Hamanaka racked up $2.6 billion in
unauthorized losses. Morgan, which had loaned money to the
Japanese trading firm, was the only bank to be rapped by
regulators for lax controls. It wound down the London desk by
1997 to focus on customer business, it said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1998, a year after Masters was named to lead the
global energy business, the bank announced plans to sell the
35-person trading team, a fraction the size of its current
500-plus commodities division. An executive said at the time
that a buyer with a strategic focus on energy trading "was in
the best interests of clients, employees and Morgan overall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, it shut down the unit after oil slumped to
$10 a barrel, discouraging potential buyers. In 1999, Danny
Masters set up one of the first commodity-focused hedge funds.
He could not be reached to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cambridge-educated Brit Blythe Levett, who had interned at
JPMorgan since 1987, had barely begun her career on the
commodities desk when the bank launched its bold plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She married Danny before he joined JPMorgan, and left the
commodities group before he started. She later won acclaim for
helping create credit derivatives. In 2001, they divorced. Five
years later, Blythe Masters returned to commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did not respond to email seeking a comment for this
article, and the bank declined to make her available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROCKY RE-START&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2004, oil prices were pushing past a record $50 a barrel,
copper was $3,000 per tonne, and investment banks were again
piling into commodities. Merrill Lynch, Barclays and
Deutche Bank were gaining on Goldman and Morgan
Stanley, which had enjoyed years of dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan saw "huge potential" in the business and believed
it could compete with the two big rivals, says a person familiar
with its commodities business at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank hired Morgan Stanley's top power and gas trader,
George "Beau" Taylor, to jump-start the effort. He beefed up the
desk with big trades and doubled the energy team to 70 within a
year. He said at the time he wanted to add more of "the proper
rainmakers in the right seats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next year, the bank scored a coup when one client, hedge
fund Amaranth Advisors, melted down after bad natural gas
trades. JPMorgan and hedge fund Citadel took over Amaranth's
trades and earned an estimated $725 million on that deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the business Taylor built lacked a large base of
customer flow and produced volatile results, including a
sizeable loss in the first quarter of 2006, although annual
results were strong, according to former employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2007, JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon told
analysts the bank had "not had the level of earnings stability
that we would have liked in energy." Value at risk in
commodities, a measure of the bank's own money being wagered,
more than doubled to an average $45 million a day in 2006;
Goldman Sachs' VaR, by contrast, was $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the bank refocused more on client-driven business, rather
than proprietary trading, Taylor left for a rival months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a period of turmoil in the trading business. Dimon
restructured the foreign exchange and commodities groups three
times in seven months. Blythe Masters, who had been the
investment bank's chief financial officer since 2004, took over
on a temporary basis in late 2006 and then, in mid-2007, was
formally named to run the commodities group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOP OF THE WORLD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following year would mark the start of an acquisition
spree that would transform the bank. But it would still take
years for Masters to get the business firing on all cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her first public appearance after taking over the
group was before a Senate subcommittee to talk about JPMorgan's
global environmental products trading division, and push for a
U.S. scheme. The bank's role in the still-young carbon market
was going to be "her thing," said one former employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the private markets to most effectively address the
problem of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, which
practitioners refer to as carbon, must have a price," Masters
told lawmakers at the July 2007 hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2008, JPMorgan bought carbon offsetting company
ClimateCare. In September, 2009, it paid $200 million to acquire
UK-based EcoSecurities, which developed clean energy programs
and carbon offsets as part of the Kyoto protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But efforts to create a U.S. emissions trading scheme were
collapsing by 2010, while the European Union's cap-and-trade
system, the world's biggest, went into freefall amid a glut of
credits and a dearth of confidence in new global curbs.
ClimateCare's management took the firm private in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, JPMorgan was doubling down on traditional
markets. In the early days of the 2008 financial crisis, it took
its first step back into physical trade, buying Bear Stearns,
along with its power plants and large trading book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following year it bought UBS's global agricultural book
and Canadian energy unit, a group that once worked for Enron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest deal came in early 2010. Royal Bank of Scotland,
bailed out by the UK government, was forced to sell off the
Sempra Commodities group it had bought a majority stake in just
before the crisis struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2010, Blythe Masters closed the $1.7 billion deal,
acquiring a global physical oil trading platform with a history
of big risks, and big rewards. It also had a premier base metal
trading and warehousing division that traced its roots back to
Metallgesellschaft (MG), the German enterprise that dominated
the London market in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ON TRACK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same year, JPMorgan suffered what Masters called a
"rookie" loss in illiquid coal markets estimated to have cost
the bank as much as $250 million. She was also enraged by the
publication of an internal conference call on which she told the
group's 600 traders that competitors were "scared shitless".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the traders at Sempra had already been chafing at
the more restrictive environment of a bank. In 2011, some of
them followed their former bosses to a new trading house called
Freepoint Commodities, backed by a private equity fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After these setbacks, the group seemed on track by mid-2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April last year, Blythe Masters inaugurated the first
educational program in the United States dedicated to broad
commodity trading, at the University of Colorado. Its lab was
filled with rows of trading terminals and premium data services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told CNBC at the time that JPMorgan expected client
demand for commodity finance, risk management and trading to
grow "very, very rapidly over the next couple of decades in
fact. ... we are very excited about the prospects for growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last July, JPMorgan clinched a deal that would make it the
11th largest U.S. oil importer: a three-year contract to supply
crude and sell products from the 330,000 barrel per day in
Philadelphia, the biggest on the U.S. East Coast. It was part of
a wide-ranging financing deal that helped Carlyle Group 
buy the plant, saving it from closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal showed how the combination of "physical
capabilities with our financial risk management and structuring
skills" offered "unique differentiators," Roy Salame, head of
global sales and structuring, told Energy Risk magazine in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNRAVELLING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time JPMorgan was named Risk's "Oil and Products
House of the Year" two months ago, however, things had already
begun to sour behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve, which for the past decade has allowed
commercial banks to trade broadly in physical markets, from
Middle East crude to power plant tolls, was looking more closely
than ever at how banks were operating in these markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A "review" of its landmark 2003 decision, made public in an
abrupt announcement last Friday, had in practice been underway
for months as the regulator queried other banks on pending
requests, according to a source who speaks to the Fed regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has declined to comment on the review,
or any discussion with any specific bank on commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Reuters report in early 2012 made it clear JPMorgan would
probably have to sell off the Henry Bath operation. Even deeper
questions arose that had forced the bank to review the future of
the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Michael Cavanagh, a co-chief executive of the
corporate and investment bank, told investors that because of
"changes in regulation, particularly around the physical side"
it would be looking to "optimize" the commodities group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next month, the U.S. power market regulator told
JPMorgan it was looking into allegations that JPMorgan
manipulated power markets in the Midwest and California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressure on the bank mounted last week, when a U.S. Senate
banking subcommitted grilled experts over whether investment
banks should be allowed to own warehouses and trade oil tankers,
putting unprecedented scrutiny the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, after announcing the bank's exit, a spokesman
said simply: "We considered many different factors, including
the impact of potential new rules and regulation."&lt;/p&gt;

      b Notional amount and interest only.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of July 26, 2013. Fitch does not expect to rate the $41,620,829 class NR 
      or the $77,499,829 class X-C.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 45 loans secured by 89 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.148 billion as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association and Barclays Bank PLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 71.5% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 87.8%, and asset summary reviews on 87.8% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.28x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 99.8%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 9.33%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 5.72% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pool Concentration: The pool is more concentrated by loan size and 
      sponsor than average transactions from 2013, as evidenced by a loan 
      concentration index (LCI) of 484 and sponsor concentration index (SCI) 
      of 486. Also, the top 10 loans represent 61.4% of the pool, which is 
      higher than for 2013 transactions (at 54.3%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High Retail Concentration: Retail properties represent the largest 
      concentration at 43.3% of the pool. This is higher than the 2012 and 
      2013 average retail concentration of 35.9% and 31.6%, respectively. The 
      next largest property type concentrations are for hotel (14.7%), mixed 
      use (14.1%), office (12.0%) and industrial (11.1%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Leverage: The transaction trust leverage is in line with the 
      average across 2013 conduit transactions, with a Fitch DSCR of 1.28x and 
      Fitch LTV of 99.8%. The average DSCR and LTV for 2013 transactions are 
      1.36x and 99.8%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Single-Tenant Properties/Increased Refinance Risk: Properties with 
      single or multiple but related tenants comprise 16.9% of the pool, 
      including two of the top 11 loans. Tenants occupying the two larger 
      loans have leases expiring during the term, creating increased refinance 
      risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMCC 2013-C14 pool could withstand a 
      47.95% decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 34.06% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 51.49% decline in value and 
      an approximately 38.55% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc will pay $490.9 million to resolve accusations of illegal marketing of the drug Rapamune dating to Pfizer's 2009 acquisition of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, July 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc will pay
$490.9 million to resolve accusations of illegal marketing of
the drug Rapamune dating to Pfizer's 2009 acquisition of Wyeth

      Fitch Affirms JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 
      2010-C1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust commercial mortgage pass through certificates, 
      series 2010-C1. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's affirmations are based on generally stable performance of the 
      underlying collateral pool since issuance. There are currently no 
      delinquent or specially serviced loans. Fitch reviewed servicer-provided 
      year-end (YE) 2012 financial performance for 98.3% of the collateral 
      pool in addition to updated rent rolls for the top 15 loans, which 
      represent 67.9% of the transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlooks for all of the classes are Stable. No rating actions 
      are expected as the majority of the pool has maintained performance 
      consistent with issuance. As of the July 2013 distribution date, the 
      pool's certificate balance has paid down 3.9% to $688.7 million from 
      $716.3 million at issuance. There are currently 36 loans collateralized 
      by 96 properties. No loans have defeased since issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has concerns with the decline in performance of the largest loan 
      in the pool, The Gateway at Salt Lake City (13.5% of the pool). The 
      property is a 623,972 square foot (sf) retail center located in downtown 
      Salt Lake City, UT. The property is anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, 
      Barnes  Noble and Gateway Theaters. As of March 2013, the property was 
      76% occupied, down from 85.5% a year ago and 93% at year-end (YE) 2011. 
      The property was 96.4% occupied at issuance. The decline in occupancy is 
      due to tenants, upon lease expiration, migrating to a competing retail 
      center (City Creek Center) that was completed in 2012. The 
      servicer-reported debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) at year-end 
      (YE)2012 was 1.36 times (x), compared to 1.70x at YE2011. Fitch however 
      expects that occupancy at the subject property (The Gateway) should 
      stabilize as the City Creek Center appears to be fully occupied. The 
      risk of additional tenants migrating to the competing center exists, but 
      the future rollover may be limited space in the immediate competitive 
      set. Furthermore, the subject property's attractive retail location is 
      viewed as a positive, and the property benefits from strong sponsorship 
      and management. Fitch will continue to monitor the performance of this 
      loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest loan (6.7%) is secured by a portfolio of four 
      multi-tenant retail properties totaling 469,000 sf. The properties are 
      located in Virginia, California, New Jersey and Texas. As of December 
      2012, the servicer-reported occupancy was 90% with a DSCR of 1.51x, 
      compared to an occupancy rate of 91% with a DSCR of 1.53x at YE2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$388.5 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$131.3 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$61.5 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Interest Only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$16.1 million class B at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$26.9 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$14.3 million class D at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$7.2 million class F at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.3 million class G at 'B+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.6 million class H at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Big Pharma is still relying on belt-tightening to prop up financial results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck &amp; Co (MRK.N) said on Tuesday their quarterly results were again hit by generic competition for once top-selling products and the toll of a strong dollar on overseas revenue. Controls on marketing and administrative expenses, and other costs, helped them report earnings slightly above Wall Street estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neither company offered investors a quick return to growth based on new products, even if the worst of the "patent cliff" for best-selling drugs that have lost marketing exclusivity is behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are managing our costs in order for us to meet our bottom line (earnings) guidance," Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frazier said the company continues to have faith in the value of its animal health unit and consumer healthcare business, both of which had lower sales in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we were to view these assets as being more productive outside the company, we would consider other alternatives," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer earlier this year completed the spinoff of its own animal health business into a new company called Zoetis (ZTS.N), only months after selling off its nutritional products business. It aims to return billions of dollars in proceeds to investors through stock repurchases and higher dividends. But, like Merck, it is holding on for now to its consumer healthcare unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said the industry's best hope is a crop of new drugs and vaccines now in clinical trials that could transform treatment for cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Certainly in the second half of this decade, I foresee significant products coming to market which will be a catalyst for industrial growth," he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strength of the dollar, particularly against the Japanese yen, has hurt sales of many U.S. companies with extensive international business this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck said full-year sales were likely to be about 5 to 6 percent below last year's levels, Even so, it stuck to its full-year profit outlook of $3.45 to $3.55 per share, excluding special items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, said second quarter revenue fell 7 percent to $12.97 billion, with 3 percent of the decline due to an unfavorable foreign exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pfizer also trimmed costs and expenses by 3 percent and reiterated its full-year earnings forecast of $2.10 to $2.20 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said income, excluding special items, fell 10 percent to $4 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $4.45 billion, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck earned $906 million, or 30 cents per share, down from $1.79 billion, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Merck earned 84 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A LIFT FROM U.S. HEALTH REFORM?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It follows along with the bigger picture in healthcare where things are OK. They're not horrible, but they're not great either," said Michael Liss, portfolio manager at American Century Investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liss predicted that the next big catalyst for the industry would come when U.S. healthcare reform kicks into high gear next year, helping millions more Americans get insurance coverage for doctor's visits and medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are just waiting to get insurance and then spending will pick up," Liss predicted. "The rate of growth will improve. It's going to come from people having insurance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pfizer's Read said the company does not expect the Affordable Care Act to significantly bolster its sales or earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of those are younger and healthy patients, so we see no near-term impact on our business," he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's results were hurt by generic competition for its cholesterol fighter Lipitor, formerly the world's top selling medicine. Lipitor sales fell 55 percent $545 million, while Merck saw sales of its off-patent asthma drug Singulair plunge 80 percent to $281 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares closed down 13 cents at $29.67, while Merck fell 29 cents to $48.05 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer on Monday announced plans to internally separate its commercial operations into two units for branded products and a third for generics, leading to speculation that it was looking to split up the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday that Pfizer would need at least three years to consider whether to break up the company, and that the reorganization was essentially a test drive to more closely examine their respective operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is all about getting the three businesses to hum internally," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

special items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, said second quarter
revenue fell 7 percent to $12.97 billion, with 3 percent of the
decline due to an unfavorable foreign exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pfizer also trimmed costs and expenses by 3 percent and
reiterated its full-year earnings forecast of $2.10 to $2.20 per
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said income, excluding special items, fell 10 percent
to $4 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $4.45 billion, or 59
cents a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck earned $906 million, or 30 cents per share, down from
$1.79 billion, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding
special items, Merck earned 84 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A LIFT FROM U.S. HEALTH REFORM?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It follows along with the bigger picture in healthcare
where things are OK. They're not horrible, but they're not great
either," said Michael Liss, portfolio manager at American
Century Investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liss predicted that the next big catalyst for the industry
would come when U.S. healthcare reform kicks into high gear next
year, helping millions more Americans get insurance coverage for
doctor's visits and medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are just waiting to get insurance and then spending
will pick up," Liss predicted. "The rate of growth will improve.
It's going to come from people having insurance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pfizer's Read said the company does not expect the
Affordable Care Act to significantly bolster its sales or
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of those are younger and healthy patients, so we see
no near-term impact on our business," he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's results were hurt by generic competition for its
cholesterol fighter Lipitor, formerly the world's top selling
medicine. Lipitor sales fell 55 percent $545 million, while
Merck saw sales of its off-patent asthma drug Singulair plunge
80 percent to $281 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares closed down 13 cents at $29.67, while Merck
fell 29 cents to $48.05 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer on Monday announced plans to internally separate its
commercial operations into two units for branded products and a
third for generics, leading to speculation that it was looking
to split up the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio told analysts on a
conference call on Tuesday that Pfizer would need at least three
years to consider whether to break up the company, and that the
reorganization was essentially a test drive to more closely 
examine their respective operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is all about getting the three businesses to hum
internally," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      The 'AAAsf' rating on the senior certificates reflects the 10.00% 
      subordination provided by the 2.95% class A-M, 1.00% class B-1, 2.15% 
      class B-2, 1.45% class B-3, 1.05% class B-4 and 1.40% class B-5. The 
      $10,179,000 class A-M certificates and $4,831,665 class B-5 certificates 
      will not be rated by Fitch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the clear capital structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by 
      third party underwriters. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will act 
      as the master servicer and U.S. Bank Trust N.A. will act as the trustee 
      for the transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be 
      made to treat the trust as one or more real estate mortgage investment 
      conduits (REMICs).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This transaction includes the use of Pentalpha Surveillance LLC 
      (Pentalpha) as representation  warranties (RW) breach reviewer for the 
      benefit of the trust. The securities administrator will instruct 
      Pentalpha to review any loan that satisfies the review trigger. 
      Pentalpha will review the loan using the breach determination review 
      procedures outlined in the transaction documents to identify failures 
      with respect to one or more of the breach determination procedures. If a 
      failure exists, Pentalpha will determine whether or not the failure is 
      material, based on materiality conditions outlined in the transaction 
      documents. Pentalpha will then provide the final results of its review 
      and determination to the securities administrator.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMMT 2013-3 will be J.P. Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Corp.'s third 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2013. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime fixed-rate mortgage loans, 87.9% of which 
      are fully amortizing, with the remaining 12.1% containing a 10-year 
      interest-only period. The aggregate pool included loans originated or 
      acquired by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMCB, 44.5%), 
      First Republic Bank (FRB, 38.4%) and other various mortgage lending 
      institutions, each of which contributed less than 10% to the transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 389 loans with a 
      total balance of $345,048,665; an average balance of $887,015; a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 66.3%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 3.8%. Rate/Term and cash-out 
      refinances account for 48.8% and 9.7% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 769. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 96.9% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (49.3%), 
      New York (17.2%) and Illinois (7.5%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists entirely of 
      30-year fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to borrowers with strong credit 
      profiles and full documentation. Strong borrower quality is reflected in 
      the 769 weighted average (WA) original FICO, 66.3% WA CLTV, $543,551 WA 
      household income and $2.4 million WA liquid reserves. In addition, 
      third-party due diligence was conducted on 100% of the pool and the 
      results indicated strong underwriting controls.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Weak Representations and Warranties Framework: While the transaction 
      benefits from JPMCB, J.P. Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Corp. (JPMMAC, 
      rated 'A+/F1' by Fitch) and FRB (rated 'BBB+/F2') as rep providers for 
      approximately 98.2% of the pool, Fitch believes the value of the RW 
      framework is diluted by the presence of qualifying and conditional 
      language, as well as by the inclusion of sunset provisions, each of 
      which substantially reduce lender loan-breach liability. While the 
      agency believes that the high credit quality pool and clean diligence 
      results mitigate the RW risks to some degree, Fitch considered the 
      weaker framework in its analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High Geographic Concentration: The pools' primary concentration risk is 
      California, where 49% of the properties are located. In addition, 54.6% 
      of the properties are located in the pool's top five regions, 
      representing metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in California, New 
      York and Illinois. The pool has significant regional concentrations that 
      resulted in an additional penalty of approximately 32% to the pool's 
      lifetime default expectation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how 
      the ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than 
      assumed at both the MSA and national levels. The implied rating 
      sensitivities are only an indication of some of the potential outcomes 
      and do not consider other risk factors that the transaction may become 
      exposed to or be considered in the surveillance of the transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected 
      lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The 
      model currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For 
      one of the top 10 regions in the mortgage pool, 
      Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL (6.5% of the mortgage pool), Fitch's SHP 
      model does not project declines in home prices. Fitch conducted 
      sensitivity analyses assuming sMVDs of 10%, 15%, and 20% for this 
      identified metropolitan area. The sensitivity analyses indicated no 
      impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model projected 15.6% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In its analysis, Fitch considered placing a greater emphasis on recent 
      economic performance in determining market value declines. While Fitch's 
      current loan loss model looks to three years of historical data and one 
      year of projections, this does not incorporate recent notable economic 
      improvement. To reflect the more recent economic environment, a 
      sensitivity analysis was performed using two years of historical 
      economic data and two years of projections. The result of this 
      sensitivity analysis was included in the consideration of the loss 
      expectations for this transaction. This sensitivity analysis resulted in 
      a base sMVD of 14.5%, down from 15.6%.

			Points of Light and JPMorgan Chase Kick Off National &#8216;One America&#8217; 
      Tour
			to Unite Communities and Unlikely Allies in Volunteer Service
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Columbus, Ohio today Points 
      of Light, the world&#8217;s largest organization dedicated to volunteer 
      service, and JPMorgan 
      Chase are teaming up to commence a year-long, nationwide service 
      tour called One 
      America. The campaign will bring together rivals in politics, 
      entertainment, and sports with the goal of inspiring Americans to unite 
      in service for their communities throughout the year. At the end of the 
      campaign, Points of Light will have built an online and on-the-ground 
      community of Americans&#8212;hundreds of thousands strong&#8212;who have united to 
      volunteer their time, voices, or money in support of community action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;From city to city and neighborhood to neighborhood, this campaign will 
      demonstrate that&#8212;even in divisive times&#8212;service and volunteerism have 
      the power to bring the country together as One America,&#8221; said Tracy 
      Hoover, President, Points of Light.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "At JPMorgan Chase, we use our strength and global reach to support our 
      clients and communities in every city where we work. In just the last 
      three years, our employees provided more than 1 million hours of service
			to their communities around the world," said Peter L. Scher, 
      Executive Vice President and Global Head of Corporate Responsibility, 
      JPMorgan Chase. "By joining forces with Points of Light for One America, 
      we are endeavoring to do even more as a firm, and to inspire people 
      everywhere, from all walks of life, to come together to serve and build 
      stronger communities."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In each tour city, the One America campaign will unite hundreds at a 
      service event and also issue a call to action for tens of thousands to 
      make a tacit commitment to service. Today&#8217;s One America kick off in 
      Columbus also marks the official opening of registration for the 2nd 
      annual Columbus 
      Volunteer Challenge. At the event, 200 business and community 
      leaders, students, and local nonprofit staffers will make vegetable seed 
      balls to promote community gardening and nutrition. The beneficiary 
      organization is the Franklin 
      Park Conservatory&#8217;s &#8216;Growing to Green&#8217; program, Columbus's largest 
      organized effort to promote and provide free resources for community 
      gardening.

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Final Ratings to J.P. Morgan 
      Mortgage Trust 2013-3 Certificates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigns final ratings to twenty-one 
      classes of mortgage pass-through certificates from J.P. Morgan Mortgage 
      Trust 2013-3, a jumbo prime RMBS transaction. Concurrently we have 
      withdrawn our preliminary ratings on the certificates, which were 
      assigned on July 23, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mortgage pool backing J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 2013-3 is comprised 
      of 389 first-lien mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of 
      $345,048,665 as of the cut-off date. The loans in the pool are all 
      fixed-rate mortgages with 30-year maturities. Thirty-three of the loans 
      are interest-only for ten years. The pool is characterized by 
      substantial borrower equity in each mortgaged property, as evidenced by 
      the weighted average LTV (64%) and CLTV (66%). The weighted average 
      credit score of the mortgage pool is 763, which is within the &#8220;prime&#8221; 
      mortgage range.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction included a loan-level analysis of the 
      mortgage pools using our Residential Mortgage Default and Loss Model, 
      together with a review of the key transaction parties, results of loan 
      file reviews performed by independent third party firms and review of 
      the legal structure and key documentation. This analysis is further 
      described in our U.S. RMBS Rating Methodology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For complete details on the analysis, please see our New Issue Report, 
      J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 2013-3, which was published on July 30th 
      2013 at www.krollbondratings.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co agreed on Tuesday to pay $410 million to settle allegations of power market manipulation in California and the Midwest, the latest in a series of high-profile inquiries by U.S. federal energy regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, announced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), will allow Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to close the books on one of several costly run-ins with regulators over the past year. It came days after the bank said it was quitting the physical commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corp, the commodity trading unit that became one of the biggest U.S. electricity traders with the 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns, agreed to pay a civil penalty of $285 million and disgorge $125 million for "manipulative bidding strategies" from September 2010 through November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the second largest penalty in FERC history, and comes as the once-quiet government regulator steps up its pursuit of market malfeasance after gaining expanded powers from Congress in 2005, part of efforts to crack down on market manipulation after Enron Corp's spectacular collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said the settlement would "not have a material impact on our earnings" because the bank had previously set aside reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC said JPMorgan admitted the facts in the agreement, but "did not admit or deny the violations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has moved this year to resolve multiple government investigations and correct problems regulators have found at the bank in an effort to take a more conciliatory stance as new rules are imposed more than five years after the start of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal also came amid unprecedented political scrutiny of Wall Street's involvement in the raw materials supply chain. Lawmakers have questioned whether banks should own metals warehouses and power plants, while the U.S. Federal Reserve reviews a landmark 2003 decision that first let them trade commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FERC deal did not cite specific traders or JPMorgan's commodities chief Blythe Masters for any wrongdoing. Masters spent billions of dollars over the past five years to build JPMorgan's oil, power, gas and metals business into the biggest on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had vowed in May to fight the FERC charges and disputed allegations that employees lied or acted inappropriately during the investigation. After a court battle over the disclosure over documents, the bank entered settlement discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, FERC laid out Masters knowledge of the traders abusive bidding strategies, including spreadsheets given to her detailing a seven-year plan to churn up to $2 billion in profits from potentially loss-making power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC Commissioner Tony Clark heralded the settlement as "historic," but said he was frustrated over the bank's evasiveness during the investigation. FERC had accused JPMorgan on several occasions of being late in responding to data requests and alleged it sometimes submitted "misleading information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this investigation and others, it has become too common for subjects of an investigation to take steps to obfuscate the true intent of their business strategies as a litigation posture for dealing with their regulators," he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MANIPULATIVE BIDDING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, JPMorgan sold the so-called "tolling agreements" it owned for several power plants in California owned by AES Corp, for which it had been paying $170 million a year in rent. The agreements effectively gave the bank the right to operate the plants, supplying natural gas as fuel and then selling electricity into the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC said its investigators found the bank's Houston-based traders engaged in 12 "manipulative bidding strategies designed to make profits from power plants." The plants built in the 1950s and 1960s were less efficient than modern units and without the bidding strategies would not have operated very often, potentially costing the bank millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC said the company created "artificial conditions" by manipulating power grid operators into paying the bank to run the plants at low levels and getting "premium rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for three JPMorgan employees from the trading desk - Francis Dunleavy, Andrew Kittell and John Bartholomew - who were identified in the investigation, said the decision not to press charges against them indicated they had done nothing that broke the law. The three oversaw the bidding strategies, according to FERC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Francis, Andrew and John were very clear in their communications with the commission," said their attorney, William Scherman of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP, "that if the commission were to make any finding that they had engaged in any misconduct, they were fully prepared to defend and prove the legality of their conduct in court."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunleavy reported to Masters and was head of JPMorgan Ventures' Principal Investments unit. Dunleavy joined the bank after the takeover of Bear Stearns and supervised Kittell and Bartholomew, according to the FERC order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC levied a $470 million penalty against British bank Barclays Plc and four of its traders earlier this month. The tougher enforcement has rattled many traders in the power market, who say FERC is delving into a gray area that separates legitimate entrepreneurial trading from intentional manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays said it will fight the fine in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Sheppard, Jonathan Leff and David Henry in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Scott DiSavino&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 30 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
agreed on Tuesday to pay $410 million to settle allegations of
power market manipulation in California and the Midwest, the

of $285 million and disgorge $125 million for "manipulative
bidding strategies" from September 2010 through November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the second largest penalty in FERC history, and comes
as the once-quiet government regulator steps up its pursuit of
market malfeasance after gaining expanded powers from Congress
in 2005, part of efforts to crack down on market manipulation
after Enron Corp's spectacular collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said the settlement would
"not have a material impact on our earnings" because the bank
had previously set aside reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC said JPMorgan admitted the facts in the agreement, but
"did not admit or deny the violations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has moved this year to resolve multiple government
investigations and correct problems regulators have found at the
bank in an effort to take a more conciliatory stance as new
rules are imposed more than five years after the start of the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal also came amid unprecedented political scrutiny of

			ISO Declares FERC-Ordered Settlement with JPMorgan Vindication for 
      California Ratepayers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today approved a 
      historic $410 million settlement with JPMorgan, resolving an extensive 
      investigation into market manipulation in the California and Michigan 
      markets. Diligent market monitoring by the California Independent System 
      Operator Corporation (ISO) to detect the bidding strategies and assist 
      in the investigation has resulted in $124 million returning to 
      California ratepayers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The suspicious bidding behavior was first identified by the ISO in 
      January 2011. The ISO gained quick approval by FERC to tighten market 
      rules, limiting the financial exposure to the ISO market. JPMorgan, 
      however, persisted in testing market rules, engaging in exploitative 
      bidding behavior to capture tens of millions of dollars of excessive 
      profits. After the ISO provided necessary evidence, FERC has acted to 
      send every dollar in overcharges back to California ratepayers. With 
      this settlement, FERC has exercised its full enforcement authority 
      authorized by Congress under the Federal Power Act.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The California ISO is extremely pleased with the FERC-ordered 
      settlement with JPMorgan. This is a vindication for California 
      ratepayers and for market participants who play by the rules and work to 
      support an effective market,&#8221; said ISO General Counsel Nancy Saracino.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fact that JPMorgan&#8217;s conduct was detected, stopped and punished 
      illustrates the effectiveness of ongoing market oversight, which is 
      essential for healthy competition. The California ISO continues to 
      monitor energy trading with the same degree of vigilance the outcome of 
      this case demonstrates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our market safeguards are working,&#8221; Saracino added. &#8220;FERC&#8217;s office of 
      enforcement acted swiftly when we reported the suspicious bidding 
      behaviors, and this historic settlement demonstrates that FERC has 
      delivered on its promise to protect the integrity of wholesale energy 
      markets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the $68 million in disgorgement the ISO had requested in 
      public filings with FERC since 2011, the settlement sends another $56 
      million back to California ratepayers associated with additional schemes 
      the ISO market monitor had identified.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The settlement also references JPMorgan waiving all rights to pursue 
      further legal proceedings. This includes a case JPMorgan filed in 2012, 
      challenging the ISO&#8217;s application of its tariff to mitigate high bids 
      submitted by JPMorgan during times that the power plant units it 
      controlled were needed for reliability purposes. To ensure that 
      suppliers cannot exercise market power under certain conditions, FERC 
      has approved rules requiring that suppliers be paid the market rate, 
      rather than what they bid, when the units are needed for reliability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ISO applied those rules and mitigated JPMorgan&#8217;s bids throughout 
      2012. The tariff rule worked to mitigate significant excess costs of 
      $227 million in 2012, almost all of which is attributable to JPMorgan 
      units. Those dollars were never paid out to JPMorgan; instead, JPMorgan 
      received the same amount that other generators received for power that 
      was delivered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second proceeding where JPMorgan is waiving its right to challenge 
      an ISO action relates to a matter where the ISO had sought FERC&#8217;s 
      approval to resettle bid cost recovery payments because generators were 
      overpaid due to a misapplication of the market rules. In June of this 
      year, FERC ruled that the ISO could recover $52 million from generators 
      who were overpaid, approximately $35 million of which was paid to 
      JPMorgan. JPMorgan challenged that FERC decision by filing a rehearing 
      request. Under the conditions of the settlement, it will forego the 
      challenge.

&lt;p&gt;July 30 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co agreed on
Tuesday to pay $410 million to settle allegations of power
market manipulation in California and the Midwest, the latest in
a series of high-profile inquiries by U.S. federal energy
regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, announced by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC), will allow Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to
close the books on one of several costly run-ins with regulators
over the past year. It came days after the bank said it was
quitting the physical commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corp, the commodity trading unit
that became one of the biggest U.S. electricity traders with the
2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns, agreed to pay a civil penalty
of $285 million and disgorge $125 million for "manipulative
bidding strategies" September 2010 through November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the second largest penalty in FERC history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has already sold the rights to buy the gas and sell
the power from its California plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said the settlement would
"not have a material impact on our earnings" because the bank
had previously set aside reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC said JPMorgan admitted the facts in the agreement, but
"did not admit or deny the violations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has moved this year to resolve multiple government
investigations and correct problems that regulators have found
at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal also came amid unprecedented political scrutiny of
Wall Street's involvement in the raw materials supply chain.
Lawmakers have questioned whether banks should own metals
warehouses and power plants, while the U.S. Federal Reserve
reviews a landmark 2003 decision that first let them trade
commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the FERC deal did not cite specific traders or
JPMorgan's commodities chief Blythe Masters, who spent billions
of dollars over the past five years to build JPMorgan's oil,
power, gas and metals business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had vowed in May to fight the FERC charges and
dispute allegations that employees lied or acted inappropriately
in the matter. But it later entered settlement discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that one of its energy 
      subsidiaries, J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corporation, has agreed to a 
      settlement with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission resolving 
      the agency&#8217;s investigation of the Firm&#8217;s bidding and offering of 
      electricity from certain power plants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the agreement, J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy agreed to pay, 
      without admitting or denying any violations, disgorgement, penalties and 
      interest totaling $410 million. J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy is pleased 
      to have reached an agreement with FERC to put this matter behind it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The settlement relates to power offered from plants largely acquired in 
      connection with J.P. Morgan&#8217;s acquisition of Bear Stearns in 2008.&#160;This 
      settlement resolves claims by the FERC&#8217;s Office of Enforcement that 
      these offers violated FERC rules.

&lt;p&gt;The deal closes the book on a probe that dates back more
than two years, when California's power grid operator noticed
the Wall Street bank was using an "abusive" trading strategy
that effectively forced the grid to pay for plants to sit idle,
ultimately adding to customers' costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported second-quarter earnings slightly ahead of estimates on Tuesday as the largest U.S. drugmaker lines up a business split that could lead to the spinoff of its generics division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, hit by falling sales of its now off-patent cholesterol fighter Lipitor, reaffirmed its financial outlook for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second quarter, adjusted income fell 10 percent to $4.00 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $4.45 billion, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 7 percent to $12.97 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, expected second-quarter income of 55 cents a share, on revenue of $13.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss said improved profit margins, helped by cost controls, were responsible for the slightly better-than-expected profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it planned to separate its commercial operations into two units for branded products and a third for generics. Chief Executive Ian Read has been reviewing the group's structure after divesting its nutrition and animal health businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said Pfizer's new model would help revitalize its innovation-based core drugs business, while enhancing the value of consumer and off-patent established brands and maximizing the use of capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's generics business, which represents 17 percent of total sales, has far lower profit margins than its patent-protected drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts have urged Pfizer to spin off generics so it can focus on core branded pharmaceuticals, although such a move is unlikely before 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the core drugs division, revenues from cancer medicines increased by 28 percent in the second quarter, helped by new products like Inlyta and Xalkori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read also said he expected business in emerging markets to accelerate in the second half of the year, led by China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a total company view, we are tracking to our expectations for the full year and continue to capitalize on the investments we are making to better position Pfizer for long-term success," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer reiterated that it expected full-year earnings of $2.10 to $2.20 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIPITOR, PREVNAR TAKE HITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reported global sales of $12.97 billion, slightly lower than Wall Street estimates of $13.02 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 7 percent fall in quarterly revenue reflected an operational decline of 4 percent and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest hit came from losses of exclusivity on Lipitor, while shifts in government purchasing patterns for bulk orders of Pfizer's Prevnar pneumococcal vaccine also took a toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugmaker's determination to reshape its business is part of a wider trend among pharmaceutical companies around the world to divest slower-growing and maturing operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbott Laboratories' decision to split off its innovative drugs into AbbVie Inc, in particular, has fueled a rethinking across the industry as to whether other companies or groups of investors may be better owners for certain assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, GlaxoSmithKline Plc is also selling off certain non-core brands, and in April it took a similar tack to Pfizer by opting to bundle many of its established drugs into a new unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last November, Pfizer sold its nutrition business to Nestle SA for $11.85 billion in cash, and in February spun off its animal health business into a new company called Zoetis Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Hirschler in London and Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Patrick Graham and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Lipitor sales drag in quarter, cancer drugs strong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Results come day after plan for branded, generics split&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported
second-quarter earnings slightly ahead of estimates on Tuesday
as the largest U.S. drugmaker lines up a business split that
could lead to the spinoff of its generics division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, hit by falling sales of its now off-patent

$4.00 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $4.45 billion, or 59
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 7 percent to
$12.97 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, expected second-quarter income of 55
cents a share, on revenue of $13.01 billion, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss said improved
profit margins, helped by cost controls, were responsible for
the slightly better-than-expected profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it planned to separate its commercial operations
into two units for branded products and a third for generics.
Chief Executive Ian Read has been reviewing the group's
structure after divesting its nutrition and animal health
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said Pfizer's new model would help revitalize its
innovation-based core drugs business, while enhancing the value
of consumer and off-patent established brands and maximizing the
use of capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's generics business, which represents 17 percent of
total sales, has far lower profit margins than its
patent-protected drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts have urged Pfizer to spin off generics so it
can focus on core branded pharmaceuticals, although such a move
is unlikely before 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the core drugs division, revenues from cancer
medicines increased by 28 percent in the second quarter, helped
by new products like Inlyta and Xalkori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read also said he expected business in emerging markets to
accelerate in the second half of the year, led by China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a total company view, we are tracking to our
expectations for the full year and continue to capitalize on the
investments we are making to better position Pfizer for
long-term success," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer reiterated that it expected full-year earnings of
$2.10 to $2.20 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIPITOR, PREVNAR TAKE HITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reported global sales of $12.97 billion, slightly lower
than Wall Street estimates of $13.02 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 7 percent fall in quarterly revenue reflected an
operational decline of 4 percent and an unfavorable impact from
foreign exchange of 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest hit came from losses of exclusivity on Lipitor,
while shifts in government purchasing patterns for bulk orders
of Pfizer's Prevnar pneumococcal vaccine also took a toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugmaker's determination to reshape its business
is part of a wider trend among pharmaceutical companies around
the world to divest slower-growing and maturing operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbott Laboratories' decision to split off its
innovative drugs into AbbVie Inc, in particular, has
fueled a rethinking across the industry as to whether other
companies or groups of investors may be better owners for
certain assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, GlaxoSmithKline Plc is also selling off
certain non-core brands, and in April it took a similar tack to
Pfizer by opting to bundle many of its established drugs into a
new unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last November, Pfizer sold its nutrition business to Nestle
SA for $11.85 billion in cash, and in February spun
off its animal health business into a new company called Zoetis
Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

      Paperless Archive but at a more than significant savings over direct 
      system purchase and maintenance costs,&#8221; said Joseph Torano, ACOM 
      Solutions&#8217; Channel Division Vice President.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is an exceptional development for middle-market organizations that 
      are without the immediate budget or ready funding to implement the 
      technology solution they require. ACOM&#8217;s Intelligent Invoice Automation 
      now brings what was previously affordable to companies with higher 
      invoice volumes now to organizations that process up to 30,000 invoices 
      annually,&#8221; Mr. Torano added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      ACOM combines powerful process automation technology with industry 
      leading Readsoft intelligent Capture to provide the technology solutions 
      that enable clients to reduce operating costs, improve information 
      accuracy, and streamline processing; the result is in helping to make 
      them more agile; giving them greater ability to focus on their core 
      businesses and service delivery. From accelerating the financial 
      decision process to direct write-through to Dynamics GP or Sage GL and a 
      compliance-ready electronic archive &#8211; ACOM Solutions provide clients the 
      tools they need to improve financial performance, reduce risk and ensure 
      future flexibility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The market demand for affordable financial processing solutions has 
      been accelerating over the past year, and organizations with serious 
      requirements find it more difficult to accept the limited functionality 
      available in lower-cost alternatives. This low entry subscription model 
      provides them the right answer to their requirements and our client 
      surveys and industry research shows that it&#8217;s great timing,&#8221; said Warren 
      Glick, ACOM Director, Corporate Marketing. &#8220;Subscription-based 
      pricing provides a powerful answer for Sage and Microsoft mid-market 
      companies to take real control of their financial processing at 
      significant cost savings and without compromise in the technology 
      solution they require,&#8221; Mr. Glick added.

&lt;p&gt;July 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, the largest U.S.
drugmaker, reported second-quarter adjusted income slightly
ahead of analysts' estimates and reaffirmed its financial
outlook for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second quarter, Pfizer's adjusted income fell 10
percent to $4.00 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $4.45
billion, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 7 percent to $12.97 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, were expecting second-quarter income
of 55 cents a share, on revenue of $13.01 billion, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;

			EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ian Read, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, &#8220;I am pleased 
      with our recent accomplishments focused on creating greater value for 
      our shareholders, including the completion of the full disposition of 
      Zoetis(1) which generated over $17 billion in value as well 
      as the announcement of our new commercial model. This new model 
      represents the next step in Pfizer&#8217;s journey to further revitalize our 
      innovative core, enhance the value of our consumer and off-patent 
      established brands and maximize the use of our capital to create value 
      for Pfizer and our patients, consumers and shareholders.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Within our innovative businesses, during second-quarter 2013, revenues 
      in our Oncology business increased 28% operationally due to the uptake 
      of new products, primarily Inlyta and Xalkori in several major markets, 
      and various key products performed well, notably Lyrica, which grew 14% 
      operationally in developed markets, and Celebrex, which grew 13% in the 
      U.S. We continue to expect our Emerging Markets business growth to 
      accelerate in the second half of the year, led by China. From a total 
      company view, we are tracking to our expectations for the full year and 
      continue to capitalize on the investments we are making to better 
      position Pfizer for long-term success,&#8221; Mr. Read concluded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Frank D&#8217;Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, &#8220;Overall, I am pleased 
      with our financial performance so far this year, despite the continued 
      impact of product losses of exclusivity and a challenging operating 
      environment. We are reaffirming all components of our 2013 adjusted 
      financial guidance, which reflects our performance to date, confidence 
      in the business, financial flexibility and a rigorous expense-management 
      process. We continue to expect to repurchase in the mid-teens of 
      billions of dollars of our common stock this year, with $8.7 billion 
      repurchased through July 29, given our strong operating cash flow and 
      proceeds generated from our portfolio actions.&#8221;

			QUARTERLY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Second-Quarter 
      2013 vs. Second-Quarter 2012)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Revenues decreased $995 million, or 7%, which reflects an operational 
        decline of $603 million, or 4%, and the unfavorable impact of foreign 
        exchange of $392 million, or 3%. The operational decrease was 
        primarily the result of the losses of exclusivity of Lipitor in 
        developed Europe in second-quarter 2012, as well as the impact of 
        multi-source generic competition for Lipitor in the U.S. beginning in 
        late-May 2012. Additionally, revenues were negatively impacted by 
        other product losses of exclusivity, government purchasing patterns 
        for Prevnar/Prevenar in various markets, and certain other events, 
        primarily within the Emerging Markets unit highlighted below.
      
			
        Business unit revenues were impacted by the following:

        
					
            Primary Care: Revenues decreased 15% operationally, primarily due 
            to the shift in the reporting of Lipitor revenues in developed 
            Europe and Australia to the Established Products unit beginning 
            January 1, 2013, as well as the losses of exclusivity of certain 
            other products in various markets and the termination of the 
            co-promotion agreement for Aricept in Japan in December 2012. 
            Additionally, in the U.S., Australia, Canada and certain European 
            countries, the co-promotion agreements for Spiriva are in the 
            final year, which has resulted in a decline in Pfizer&#8217;s share of 
            Spiriva revenues per the terms of those agreements. These declines 
            were partially offset by the strong performance of Lyrica in 
            developed markets and Celebrex in the U.S.
          
					
            Specialty Care: Revenues were flat operationally, primarily due to 
            the shift in the reporting of Geodon and Revatio revenues in the 
            U.S. and Xalabrands revenues in developed Europe and Australia to 
            the Established Products unit beginning January 1, 2013, which was 
            essentially offset by growth in Enbrel, Rebif and the hemophilia 
            portfolio (BeneFIX and ReFacto AF/Xyntha) in the U.S. 
            Prevnar/Prevenar revenues continue to be impacted by a large U.S. 
            government purchase in fourth-quarter 2012, which has resulted in 
            fewer purchases so far in 2013, and also were impacted by the end 
            of the supplemental dose program in Asia.
          
					
            Emerging Markets: Revenues grew 4% operationally, primarily due to 
            strong volume growth in China, most notably for Lipitor and 
            Prevenar, which was partially offset by the impact of the transfer 
            of certain product rights to the Pfizer-Hisun joint venture in 
            first-quarter 2013 and the timing of government purchases 
            of&#160;Enbrel and Prevenar in certain other emerging markets. 
            Operational revenue growth in emerging markets is expected to 
            accelerate in the second half of the year to a high-single-digit 
            percentage, with the full-year 2013 operational revenue growth now 
            expected to be a mid-single-digit percentage.
          
					
            Established Products: Revenues decreased 7% operationally, 
            primarily due to multi-source generic competition in the U.S. for 
            Lipitor beginning in late-May 2012. This decrease was partially 
            offset by revenues from products in certain markets that were 
            shifted to the Established Products unit from other business units 
            beginning January 1, 2013 and the contribution from the 
            collaboration with Mylan Inc. to market generic drugs in Japan.
          
					
            Consumer Healthcare: Revenues increased 5% operationally, 
            primarily due to strong growth globally for Centrum as a result of 
            several recent product launches in key international markets, as 
            well as increased promotion in the U.S. following the announcement 
            of favorable results from a landmark study that evaluated the 
            long-term health benefits of multivitamins for men age 50 and 
            older.
          
					
            Oncology: Revenues increased 28% operationally, driven by the 
            continued solid uptake of new products, most notably Inlyta and 
            Xalkori in several major markets.
          
				
			
		
		
			
        Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SIA expenses and adjusted RD 
        expenses(2) in the aggregate decreased $241 million, or 3%, 
        primarily reflecting the favorable impact of foreign exchange and, to 
        a much lesser extent, the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity 
        initiatives, including a reduction in the number of colleagues and 
        more streamlined corporate support functions. Adjusted cost of sales(2) 
        as a percentage of revenues was favorably impacted by foreign 
        exchange, while unfavorably impacted by the decline in revenues 
        contributing to a shift in geographic and business mix given the 
        aforementioned products that lost exclusivity in various markets.
      
			
        The effective tax rate on adjusted income(2) reflected a 
        0.6 percentage point decrease, primarily due to the jurisdictional mix 
        of earnings and the extension of the U.S. research and development tax 
        credit that was signed into law in January 2013.
      
			
        The diluted weighted-average shares outstanding declined by 
        approximately 420 million shares, primarily due to the company&#8217;s 
        ongoing share-repurchase program.
      
			
        In addition to the aforementioned factors, second-quarter 2013 
        reported earnings were favorably impacted by the gain associated with 
        the full disposition of Zoetis(1), income from a litigation 
        settlement with Teva and Sun for patent-infringement damages resulting 
        from their &#8220;at-risk&#8221; launches of generic Protonix in the U.S. and 
        lower charges related to other legal matters. Reported earnings were 
        unfavorably impacted by a 5.1 percentage point increase in the 
        effective tax rate on reported income(3) from continuing 
        operations, primarily attributable to the tax liability associated 
        with the aforementioned settlement.

				Xeljanz
				
					
            The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review a 
            supplemental new drug application for the Xeljanz 
            moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) indication 
            seeking expansion of the label to include inhibition of 
            progression of structural damage. The FDA will review the 
            application and is expected to provide a decision by February 2014.
          
					
            The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the 
            European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a negative opinion for 
            Xeljanz for the treatment of adult patients with 
            moderate-to-severe active RA. Pfizer appealed this opinion and 
            sought a re-examination of the opinion by the CHMP. Upon 
            re-examination, the CHMP reached a negative opinion. The company 
            is currently evaluating the feedback from the CHMP, will determine 
            next steps to resubmit a Marketing Authorization Application to 
            the EMA and anticipates that this will result in a several-year 
            delay.
          
					
            The phase 3 Xeljanz psoriasis program continues to progress. Due 
            to the large size and complexity of the database, Pfizer has 
            encountered challenges in analyzing the data. As a result, the 
            company now expects to announce the topline results from the first 
            two phase 3 studies by the end of 2013, and the topline results 
            from the two phase 3 pivotal studies in second-quarter 2014. This 
            unexpected delay is not the result of any safety issues.
          
				
			
			
				Prevenar -- The European Commission (EC) approved Prevenar 13 
        for an expanded indication to include adults aged 18 to 49 years for 
        active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease caused by 
        vaccine-type Streptococcus pneumoniae. The EC is the first 
        regulatory authority to approve Prevenar 13 to offer protection 
        against invasive disease at all stages of life.
      
			
				Eliquis
				
					
            The FDA accepted for review a supplemental new drug application 
            for Eliquis for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis, which may 
            lead to pulmonary embolism, in adult patients who have undergone 
            hip or knee replacement surgery. The FDA will review the 
            application and is expected to provide a decision by March 15, 
            2014.
          
					
            The phase 3 AMPLIFY trial presented at the 24th Congress of the 
            International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis demonstrated 
            that Eliquis as a single-agent achieved the primary efficacy 
            endpoint of noninferiority to current standard of care in the 
            reduction of the composite endpoint of recurrent symptomatic acute 
            venous thromboembolism (VTE) or VTE-related death and met the 
            primary safety endpoint of superiority to current standard of care 
            for major bleeding. Pfizer, along with its partner Bristol-Myers 
            Squibb, plan to file for the initial and long-term treatment of 
            VTE, as well as for extended prevention of recurrent VTE, with the 
            FDA and the EMA by the end of the year.

        ozogamicin in patients with relapsed or refractory CD22+ aggressive 
        non-Hodgkin lymphoma who are not candidates for intensive high-dose 
        chemotherapy was discontinued due to futility. This compound continues

			Business Development/Portfolio Review
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Pfizer accepted 405.1 million shares of its common stock valued at 
        $11.4 billion in exchange for its remaining 80.2% stake in Zoetis(1) 
        pursuant to a registered exchange offer to Pfizer&#8217;s shareholders. As a 
        result, Pfizer no longer has an ownership interest in Zoetis(1) and 
        recorded a gain of $10.5 billion (pre-tax) on the disposition. As of 
        June 24, 2013, those 405.1 million shares are no longer outstanding, 
        which will have a favorable impact on earnings per share over time.
      
			
        Pfizer entered into a worldwide (except Japan) collaboration agreement 
        with Merck  Co., Inc. to develop and commercialize ertugliflozin and 
        ertugliflozin-containing fixed-dose combinations with metformin and 
        Januvia&#174; (sitagliptin) tablets. Ertugliflozin is 
        Pfizer&#8217;s investigational medicine for type 2 diabetes, with phase 3 
        trials expected to begin later in 2013.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Pfizer announced plans to move forward to internally separate its 
        commercial operations into three business segments, two of which will 
        include Innovative business lines and a third which will include the 
        Value business line. Each of the three segments will include developed 
        markets and emerging markets. The changes will be implemented in 
        fiscal 2014 in countries that do not require a consultation with works 
        councils or unions, and will be implemented in countries that require 
        consultation after the successful conclusion of those processes. 
        Beginning with the first-quarter 2014 financial results, the company 
        will provide greater financial transparency for each of these three 
        business segments, which will include a 2014 baseline management view 
        of profit and loss for each segment.
      
			
        The Board of Directors authorized a new $10 billion share repurchase 
        program to be utilized over time. This new program is in addition to 
        the $3.1 billion of authorization currently remaining under the 
        previous share repurchase program.
      
			
        Pfizer and Nycomed (now part of Takeda), the owner of the U.S. patent, 
        reached a $2.15 billion litigation settlement with Teva and Sun for 
        patent-infringement damages resulting from their &#8220;at-risk&#8221; launches of 
        generic Protonix in the U.S. prior to the January 2011 expiry of the 
        patent for the active ingredient. Pfizer and Takeda will divide the 
        proceeds of the settlement, with Pfizer receiving $1.4 billion 
        (pre-tax).

          On June 24, 2013, Pfizer completed the full disposition of Zoetis, 
          Inc. (Zoetis) and, as a result, Pfizer now reports the financial 
          results of its Animal Health business as a discontinued operation in 
          the condensed consolidated statements of income for second-quarter

          Pfizer transferred substantially all of its animal health assets and 
          liabilities, an initial public offering of a 19.8% interest in 
          Zoetis and an exchange offer for the remaining 80.2% interest. The 
          financial results of Zoetis, the standalone public company, may 
          differ from the financial results of the Animal Health business 
          reflected in Pfizer&#8217;s condensed consolidated statements of income as 
          a discontinued operation, as the components of this business 
          differed from Zoetis.

            Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's 
            Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 
            31, 2013, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to 
            set performance goals and to measure the performance of the 
            overall company. We believe that investors' understanding of our 
            performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. See the 
            accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP 
            adjusted information for the second quarter and first six months 
            of 2013 and 2012, as well as reconciliations of full-year 2013 
            guidance for adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS to full-year 
            2013 guidance for reported net income(3) and reported 
            diluted EPS(3). The adjusted income and its components 
            and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be 
            viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components 
            and diluted EPS.

          The 2013 financial guidance reflects the following:
        
			
		
		
			
        The financial results of the Animal Health business from January 1, 
        2013 to June 24, 2013, as well as the gain on disposal of Zoetis(1), 
        are presented as a discontinued operation. As a result, they have been 
        excluded from all components of the financial guidance except Reported 
        Diluted EPS(3). Reported Diluted EPS(3) guidance 
        includes the gain on disposal of Zoetis(1), as well as the 
        financial results of the Animal Health business as follows:

        
					
            January 1, 2013 to February 6, 2013: 100% of Zoetis(1) 
            financial results are included
          
					
            February 7, 2013 to June 24, 2013: 80.2% of Zoetis(1) 
            financial results are included; 19.8% of Zoetis(1) 
            financial results are excluded, as this interest in Zoetis(1) 
            was no longer owned by Pfizer
          
					
            June 24, 2013 through December 31, 2013: no actual or projected 
            financial results of Zoetis(1) are included
          
				
			
		
		
			
        The weighted-average shares outstanding used in the computation of 
        Adjusted(2) and Reported(3) Diluted EPS guidance 
        reflects the reduction in shares of Pfizer&#8217;s outstanding common stock 
        as a result of the Zoetis(1) exchange offer. Since this 
        reduction occurred on June 24, 2013, Pfizer will only recognize a 
        partial-year benefit to its Adjusted(2) and Reported(3) 
        Diluted EPS guidance.
      
			
        Reported Diluted EPS(3) guidance includes the income from a 
        litigation settlement with Teva and Sun for patent-infringement 
        damages resulting from their &#8220;at-risk&#8221; launches of generic Protonix in 
        the U.S.
      
			
        Does not assume the completion of any business development 
        transactions&#160;not completed as of June 30, 2013, including any one-time 
        upfront payments associated with such transactions.
      
			
        Excludes the potential effects of the resolution of litigation-related 
        matters not substantially resolved as of June 30, 2013.
      
			
        Exchange rates assumed are a blend of the actual exchange rates in 
        effect through June 2013 and the mid-July 2013 exchange rates for the 
        remainder of the year.
      
			
        Reconciliation of the 2013 Adjusted Income(2) and Adjusted 
        Diluted EPS(2) guidance to the 2013 Reported Net Income 
        Attributable to Pfizer Inc. and Reported Diluted EPS Attributable to 
        Pfizer Inc. common shareholders guidance:

          Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted 
          diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for 
          U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. Despite the 
          importance of these measures to management in goal setting and 
          performance measurement, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components 
          and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are Non-GAAP financial measures 
          that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, 
          therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of 
          the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its 
          components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net 
          income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to 
          the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Non-GAAP 
          Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS 
          are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand 
          how management assesses performance.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON Aug 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' 
effort to diffuse intensifying pressure over its commodity
business by throwing open its metal warehouse doors likely comes
too late to head off further scrutiny of Wall Street's commodity
trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks of escalating criticism of banks that own
commodity assets and trade raw materials has shaken executives
and the industry, with little sign of the pressure relenting.
Britain's financial watchdog is considering its own
investigation of metals warehouses, sources said, and two
lawmakers questioned whether power regulators were tough enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years of growing frustration over long waiting times and
rising prices at metals warehouses across the world spilled into
Washington this month, with lawmakers questioning why financial
banks are so deeply involved in commercial activity and metal
users including American brewer MillerCoors calling for a
clamp-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its first major effort to appease consumers, Goldman
offered on Wednesday to immediately swap aluminum for any
end-users holding metal at its Metro International warehouses,
allowing them to avoid year-long waits and high premiums. It
also refuted the notion that it was causing a shortage of metal,
saying none of its customers had yet taken up the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the effort met with a skeptical response among some
traders who said the bank had failed to address the big
financial incentives paid by warehouses to attract metal into
their facilities, which critics say have stoked prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also took issue with the bank's decision to limit the
offer to end-users, excluding the hedge funds and other traders
who are believed to account for most of the stockpiled metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It sounds to me like they're offering ice in the winter,"
said U.S. anti-trust lawyer Robert Bernstein, a partner at New
York-based Eaton &amp; Van Winkle LLP, who works on behalf of U.S.
copper fabricators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is the latest effort by Wall Street's biggest banks
to fend off a barrage of criticism of their role in the raw
materials supply chain, where they do everything from
stockpiling metal for clients to shipping gasoline to New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co said it was getting
out of the physical commodity business, quitting a sector it
paid billions of dollars over five years to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman's Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn defended the
bank's role in commodities and J Aron, its commodities trading
arm, calling it a "core" business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Commodity hedging is a core competence and one of the most
important things we do in the firm and our clients really need
us to be in that business," Cohn, who once ran J Aron, said on
CNBC. "We are staying in the commodity hedging business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the measures will ease pressure from
Washington, where a handful of lawmakers are pressing regulators
including the Federal Reserve and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) to bring banks to account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOUBTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's move will intensify scrutiny of other merchants
and banks, including Glencore Xstrata and JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co that have bought warehouses in the past three years,
and also the London Metals Exchange itself, which is in the
midst of its third effort to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lengthy waits to receive metal shipments are "a systemic
problem which goes broader than Metro International," said
American Beverage Association spokesman Christopher
Gindlesperger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In London, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is weighing
whether to launch a probe of the London Metal Exchange (LME)
warehousing system, an about-face from the past few years when
the agency said it did not have authority to delve beyond
derivative markets into the physical trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice industrial clients needing metal sometimes have
to queue for up to a year while warehouse companies -
increasingly owned by banks or trading houses - benefit from
rents they charge during the wait or traders focus on using
metal in finance deals rather than providing it to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source at a competing warehousing company was critical
of Goldman's offer: "If they had said we're going to deliver out
faster, that would be a different story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEN SEPTEMBER COMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the commotion over commodities trade has focused most
intensely on the warehousing issue, lawmakers are also looking
more broadly at whether banks should be allowed in the
commercial business of crude oil cargoes and power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While welcoming Goldman's effort as "great news", Democrat
CFTC commissioner Bart Chilton said the "the larger issue of
banks owning physical commodities, warehousing and delivery
mechanisms" remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of increasingly frenetic activity and vocal
debate, many industry officials expect the din to subside during
August, typically a slow month for the markets and also a
five-week hiatus for legislators in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may again reach fever pitch in September, with
Senator Sherrod Brown expected to call Federal Reserve and bank
officials to another hearing of the powerful banking committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That month also marks the end of a five-year grace period
granted to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to comply
with commercial banking regulations after they gave up their
independence at the height of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman has already sold its power plants and trades
little physical oil, Morgan Stanley faces an unknown outcome for
its massive global oil business, its 49 percent share in oil
tanker firm Heidmar and its cherished U.S. logistics and
pipelines business TransMontaigne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the banks say they should be allowed to trade and
invest in commodity businesses more broadly than their rivals
because of an exemption granted to investment banks in a 1999
law, it is unclear how much the Fed will allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed announced earlier this month that it was "reviewing"
the landmark 2003 decision that first allowed banks to trade
physical commodities, a shock decision that raised the specter
of even deeper restrictions than banks had been bracing for. It
is unclear when that review may conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The banks went a little bit too far with the Fed's
authorization to get into the commercial side of commodities
business and I think that the Senate is more than shocked about
what they saw when they started investigating into this
situation," said Richard Bove, a veteran banking analyst
currently working as an equity research analyst for Garden City,
New York-based Rafferty Capital Markets LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I doubt that any bank will have any, if you will,
commercial commodities business in 12 to 18 months from now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPENING THE DOOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately on Wednesday, two Democratic senators questioned
whether a landmark $410 million settlement with JPMorgan earlier
this week over alleged power market manipulation had included
"adequate refunds to defrauded ratepayers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The penalty is the second-largest ever by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), but is "equal to roughly 1.3
percent of JPMorgan's 2012 profits", Senators Elizabeth Warren
and Edward Markey, both of Massachusetts, wrote to the FERC
chairman. They also questioned why JPMorgan executives were not
punished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crack-down is opening opportunities for less-restricted
competitors, particularly foreign banks not overseen by the Fed,
potentially leading to the biggest reshuffling of market power
since the 1990s era of the "Wall Street refiners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's Grupo BTG Pactual SA, the privately held bank run
by billionaire Andr&#233; Esteves, is forging ahead with a $300
million-plus expansion plan to create a global powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just months after hiring former Noble Group Chief Executive
Ricardo Leiman to lead the drive, BTG has recruited nearly a
dozen traders, managers and analysts in London, Geneva and New
York to cover everything from freight to grains to natural gas,
according to headhunters and a source familiar with the plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a regulatory perspective they may try to become like
Macquarie, a representative of a foreign bank," said Peter
Henry, senior consultant at Commodity Search Partners in New
York. "There's an angle there."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs responded to mounting political pressure and regulatory scrutiny of its Metro International metals business on Wednesday, by offering customers immediate access to aluminum stored in its warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement outlining the bank's proposals to cut waiting times at all London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses, Goldman said it would let major consumers swap aluminum held in its warehouses for metal the bank has acquired, without the need to pay a steep cash premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers and U.S. lawmakers have accused Goldman Sachs and other warehouse owners of artificially inflating wait times and lines to boost rents for warehouse owners and cause metal prices to rise. One major customer estimated the delays have cost consumers more than $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel horrible for consumers if they can't get metal. We don't believe that to be the fact," Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn, said on CNBC. Cohn, who started his career in Goldman's commodity business, said the bank had secured metal from producers over the past week, but had yet to find a single customer ready to take it up on the offer to swap metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it marks the bank's first effort to address years of complaints over the long waits, an issue that finally erupted last week as U.S. senators questioned why banks should be involved in owning warehousing and chartering oil tankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's move came as a surprise to traders and end-users, many of whom had been bracing for a drawn-out investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also highlights a sharp divide in how Wall Street's biggest banks are responding to scrutiny of their physical commodity businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, whose J. Aron trading unit is one of the most renowned in the business, vowed to hold onto Metro, despite having considered a sale earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will end up selling Metro at an appropriate time," Cohn said. Goldman Sachs bought Metro under as a private equity exemption, he said, which allows the firm to keep it as an investment for up to 10 years. "We are staying in the commodity hedging business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rival JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said on Friday that it was quitting the business due in part to regulatory pressures, selling or spinning off the group that includes metals warehousing firm Henry Bath &amp; Sons, the fourth-largest storage business in the LME system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressure is expected to shift to traders like Glencore and Trafigura, which also bought warehouse operators following Goldman's purchase of Metro International Trade Services for some $550 million in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metro's flagship facility in Detroit stores more than 1.4 million metric tons of aluminum, a quarter of the LME's stockpile. Over 60 percent of that is waiting to be delivered out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO TAKERS YET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news met with some positive reaction in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's great news and any pricing manifestations due to warehousing issues will hopefully resolve going forward," said CFTC commissioner Bart Chilton, a frequent critic of the role of banks and other financial firms in commodity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators including the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission have begun preliminary investigations into Wall Street banks and other large commodity traders which own metal warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday sources said Britain's regulator was also considering a deeper investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs is contacting end users to offer to swap any aluminum currently in the queue for immediately available aluminum so that they have access to the metal they need to make or package their products," the bank said. A Goldman source said the metal would be swapped out at the LME price, allowing end-users to avoid paying a cash market premium. (For a link to the Goldman statement: r.reuters.com/cyv99t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said its offer applies only to large metal consumers like carmakers and soft drink producers, not to financial traders like hedge funds, or rival merchant commodity traders like Glencore Xstrata or Trafigura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warehouse owners and outgoing LME CEO Martin Abbott have said the complaints over long lines are unjustified, arguing there is no shortage of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they said the long lines have been created by traders trying to move metal to rival warehouses that are offering financial incentives in a bid to boost their own rental income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman didn't address questions about offering financial incentives for companies to store their metal at Metro sheds, which some say contributed to the backlog of aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It sounds to me like they're offering ice in the winter," said U.S. anti-trust lawyer Robert Bernstein, a partner at New York-based Eaton &amp; Van Winkle LLP, who works on behalf of U.S. copper fabricators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is the queues have jacked up the premiums."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate Banking Committee held its first hearing on the warehousing issue last week, when aluminum users represented by brewer MillerCoors LLC said high physical prices have cost consumers an extra $3 billion a year in expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warehouses and the LME, which oversees the storage outlets in its network, say the big stockpiles and high physical prices are the result of low interest rates and a market structure known as contango, which makes it profitable to sell metal forward and store it for months or years at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also the byproduct of LME rules, which require warehousing companies to deliver a minimum amount of tonnages of metal each day. According to current rules, facilities with 900,000 metric tons or more metal have to load out 3,500 metric tons of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LME has proposed an overhaul of its warehousing policy that would come into effect in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Josephine Mason in New York and Susan Thomas in London; Editing by Jonathan Leff, Lisa Von Ahn and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are investigating how International Business Machines Corp reports revenue from its cloud computing business, the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
said on Wednesday that it would offer customers of its Metro
International metals warehouse business immediate access to
aluminum held up in queues through an exchange deal with the
bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In light of the concerns that end-users have raised about
their access to aluminum they are holding in warehouses, Goldman
Sachs is contacting end users to offer to swap any aluminum
currently in the queue for immediately available aluminum so
that they have access to the metal they need to make or package
their products," the bank said in a statement outlining ways to
speed up aluminum delivery from London Metal Exchange
warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has come under regulatory and political pressure in
recent weeks as major consumers of aluminum have complained
about waiting excessive amounts of time to get access to the
metal, boosting prices for companies and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators including the U.S. Department of Justice and the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission have both launched
preliminary investigations into Wall Street banks and other
large commodity traders who own metal warehouses, Reuters has
reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are
investigating how International Business Machines Corp 
reports revenue from its cloud computing business, the company
said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said it learned of the investigation, being conducted by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in May. The company
made the disclosure in its quarterly report filed with the SEC.
It gave no details on the probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, which does not break out its cloud computing revenue
separately, has said it aims to generate $7 billion annually in
revenue from cloud services by the end of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing lets companies rent computing power, storage
and other services from data centers shared with other customers
- typically cheaper and more flexible than maintaining their
own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said the SEC probe likely would not affect IBM
much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At first glance, this may appear to be a concerning issue;
however, we believe cloud revenue recognition can be 'cloudy' at
times, given the nascent stages of its development, and we do
not expect a material impact on IBM from this investigation,"
said Topeka Capital Markets analyst Brian White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that cloud computing can include software, server,
storage, network or databases used in different layers of the
cloud, and not all have "clear-cut revenue recognition
policies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month IBM expanded its cloud offerings with the $2
billion acquisition of SoftLayer Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said it was cooperating with the SEC and repeated a
disclosure made on April 30 that the Department of Justice is
investigating allegations of illegal activity by a former IBM
employee in Poland, as well as transactions in Argentina,
Bangladesh and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the Justice Department is also still seeking
information regarding the company's global compliance with the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and its public sector business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other investigations were recently settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 25 a federal judge signed off on a 2011 settlement
IBM made with U.S. regulators over charges of foreign bribery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM in March 2011 agreed to pay $10 million to resolve SEC
charges over improper gifts to government officials in South
Korea and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares were down 0.2 percent to $195.58 in midday
trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - Jurors began deliberating
Wednesday over whether to hold former Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 trader Fabrice Tourre liable for defrauding investors in
a complex deal tied to subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in New York dispatched the five women and
four men on the jury to consider the fate of Tourre, 34, who for
more than three years has fought against U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission claims he misled investors in a deal called
Abacus 2007-AC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest told jurors it was
their job to determine if the SEC had by a preponderance of the
evidence met its burden of proof to hold Tourre liable. "You are
the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury deliberations follow more than two weeks of
testimony in the civil trial. The jurors who will decide the
case include a school principal, a medical school graduate, a
former stockbroker turned art history teacher, an animator and
an Episcopal priest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A victory for the SEC could help answer critics who say the
agency was not aggressive enough in bringing enforcement actions
against individuals on Wall Street who played roles in the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC disputes the criticism, pointing to charges it
brought against 157 entities and individuals in financial
crisis-linked cases and enforcement actions that produced $2.68
billion from defendants, largely in settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC received $550 million in an accord with Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. Originally a defendant with Tourre, the
investment bank agreed in July 2010 to settle without admitting
or denying wrongdoing, although it acknowledged Abacus marketing
materials contained incomplete information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'WALL STREET GREED'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case against Tourre was a story of "Wall Street greed,"
with the former Goldman vice president selling investors in a
"land of make believe" costing them $1 billion, Matthew Martens,
the lead SEC lawyer said during closing arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally filed in April 2010, the SEC's lawsuit accuses
Tourre of misleading investors in the Ababus synthetic
collateralized debt obligation (CDO) in 2007 by failing to
disclose that billionaire John Paulson's hedge fund company
helped pick its assets and planned to bet against - or short -
the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC also claims Tourre duped ACA Capital Holdings Inc, a
company brought in to select the 90 mortgage securities tied to
Abacus, into believing Paulson &amp; Co Inc would be an equity
investor in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors, including ACA Capital and IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG, lost over $1 billion when the deal turned sour
after the U.S. housing meltdown, while Paulson reaped about the
same amount in gains thanks to the hedge fund's short position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre has denied the charges. He told jurors Friday he had
not "done anything wrong, as I'm here literally to tell the
truth and clear my name."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyers contend the information about Paulson wasn't
material to investors in the deal since a synthetic CDO by its
nature had to have both a long and short investor in order to
work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's attorneys contend ACA Capital knew Paulson would
short the deal, pointing to testimony by an ex-Paulson executive
as well as widespread news reports that the hedge fund was in
the midst of a broad bet against the U.S. housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIENA/MILAN (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors probing Monte dei Paschi's 2007 acquisition of a smaller rival are investigating U.S. investment bank JP Morgan over an alleged crime committed by one of its employees, according to a prosecutors' document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document, seen by Reuters, said the alleged crime was the obstruction of Italian regulators by an unknown JP Morgan employee relating to a 1 billion euro ($1.3 billion) hybrid financial instrument used to partly fund Monte dei Paschi's purchase of Antonveneta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan denied any wrongdoing and said it would defend itself vigorously. "We believe that JP Morgan and its employees acted correctly at all times," it said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monte dei Paschi is also under investigation in the probe for a range of alleged crimes including market manipulation and making false statements to the market, as are its former chairman Giuseppe Mussari, its former director general Antonio Vigni and seven other former bank employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Italy's 231 law, a company can be held responsible if it is deemed that it failed to prevent, or attempted to prevent, a crime by an employee that benefited the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the document, Italian prosecutors allege the JP Morgan employee failed to inform the Bank of Italy of a deal which they say violated requirements set by the central bank over the hybrid instrument, known as FRESH 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They allege the unknown employee had "a representative, administrative and management role" at the U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document, which wraps up a preliminary investigation started in October 2011 and was sent to all the parties involved, says the alleged crime was committed "in the interest and to the benefit of JP Morgan".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FRESH 2008 instruments in question were essentially notes convertible into Monte dei Paschi's shares that JP Morgan sold to a number of investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutors allege that Monte dei Paschi struck a so-called indemnity agreement with JP Morgan which protected the U.S. bank from potential losses related to FRESH 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP MORGAN DENIES ALLEGATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said it never benefited from the indemnity, which it said "only existed for a matter of days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No claim was ever made under this indemnity ... either for the benefit of JP Morgan or any of its employees," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FRESH notes were issued as part of a deal under which JP Morgan underwrote a 950 million euro capital increase in Monte dei Paschi to help the Italian bank fund the acquisition of Antonveneta from Spain's Santander. The acquisition was announced in November 2007 and completed in May 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege the deal hid the real risks faced by Monte dei Paschi, which was already stretched and struggling to afford the 9 billion euro price tag for Antonveneta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also allege the indemnity agreement violated requirements set by the Bank of Italy by making FRESH 2008 work like a bond rather than an hybrid equity instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monte dei Paschi needed to show the Bank of Italy that it had sufficient equity capital in place to win approval for Antonveneta takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the information officially received from the bank, the regulator allowed Monte dei Paschi to calculate those notes as core Tier 1 capital, a measure of a bank's financial strength which is closely monitored by regulators, boosting its capital base and allowing it to demonstrate its finances were solid enough to absorb the Antonveneta deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central bank had initially raised objections about the FRESH operation, saying in its original form its was too similar to a bond, and demanded changes to ensure that if Monte dei Paschi made no profit, it would have no financial obligations towards JP Morgan or the investors in FRESH 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, prosecutors allege the secret indemnity agreements violated that requirement, putting the financial burden of the operation squarely on Monte dei Paschi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monte dei Paschi probe widened this year to loss-making derivative contracts carried out by its previous management. The lender received a 4 billion euros state bailout in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7547 euros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Silvia Aloisi; Editing by Patrick Graham and Mark Potter)&lt;/p&gt;

sold to a number of investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutors allege that Monte dei Paschi struck a
so-called indemnity agreement with JP Morgan which protected the
U.S. bank from potential losses related to FRESH 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP MORGAN DENIES ALLEGATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said it never benefited from the indemnity, which
it said "only existed for a matter of days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No claim was ever made under this indemnity ... either for
the benefit of JP Morgan or any of its employees," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FRESH notes were issued as part of a deal under which JP
Morgan underwrote a 950 million euro capital increase in Monte
dei Paschi to help the Italian bank fund the acquisition of
Antonveneta from Spain's Santander. The acquisition was
announced in November 2007 and completed in May 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege the deal hid the real risks faced by
Monte dei Paschi, which was already stretched and struggling to
afford the 9 billion euro price tag for Antonveneta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also allege the indemnity agreement violated
requirements set by the Bank of Italy by making FRESH 2008 work
like a bond rather than an hybrid equity instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monte dei Paschi needed to show the Bank of Italy that it
had sufficient equity capital in place to win approval for
Antonveneta takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the information officially received from the bank,
the regulator allowed Monte dei Paschi to calculate those notes
as core Tier 1 capital, a measure of a bank's financial strength
which is closely monitored by regulators, boosting its capital 
base and allowing it to demonstrate its finances were solid
enough to absorb the Antonveneta deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central bank had initially raised objections about the
FRESH operation, saying in its original form its was too similar
to a bond, and demanded changes to ensure that if Monte dei
Paschi made no profit, it would have no financial obligations
towards JP Morgan or the investors in FRESH 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, prosecutors allege the secret indemnity agreements
violated that requirement, putting the financial burden of the
operation squarely on Monte dei Paschi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monte dei Paschi probe widened this year to loss-making
derivative contracts carried out by its previous management. The
lender received a 4 billion euros state bailout in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			Research and Markets: China Tablet PC Market - 2013 Report Featuring 
      Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, and Others
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/2zclcp/research_and) 
      has announced the addition of the "Research 
      and Development Forecast of China Tablet PC Market, 2013" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since Apple launched iPad in 2010, the global sales volume of tablet PCs 
      has been increasing rapidly. From 2010 to 2012, the global sales volume 
      increased by 6.6 times, from 19.4 million units to 128.3 million units. 
      By the end of 2013 the global sales volume will increase to nearly 240 
      million, which will be higher than the estimated shipments of laptops 
      with 207 million units.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      From Q3 of 2011 to Q4 of 2012, Apple had been ranked first all over the 
      world as for the sales volume of tablet PCs (the highest market share 
      during this period was 64.6%), but it is worth noticing that since Q2 of 
      2012, the market share of Apple has declined gradually due to the 
      pressures come from Samsung, Amazon and other tablet PC manufacturers. 
      In Q4 of 2012, Samsung's and Amazon's market shares reached 15.1% and 
      11.5% respectively, and Apple's market share dropped to 40%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2012 Apple's dominant position in the market was challenged by users' 
      complaints about user experience and innovation ability, the rapid 
      development of enormous Android brands and the emergence of Microsoft's 
      Surface. However, there is still no single brand that can compete with 
      Apple in the current tablet PC market.

&lt;p&gt;Analysts at JPMorgan Securities led by Sa&#250;l Mart&#237;nez updated
their earnings estimates for Brazilian bank Ita&#250; Unibanco
Holding SA following the lender's release of second-quarter
results. JPMorgan increased its local-currency earnings estimate
for 2013 by 2.4 percent to 15.066 billion reais ($6.5 billion),
or the equivalent to 3.03 reais a share, from a prior estimate
of 14.706 billion reais, or 2.96 reais a share. "This is mainly
as a result of higher net interest income and fees," Mart&#237;nez
wrote in a client note on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2014, JPMorgan's estimates for Ita&#250; rose 0.1 percent to
16.336 billion reais, or 3.29 reais per share, from a prior
16.313 billion reais, or 3.28 reais a share. The analysts
maintained the "overweight" recommendation on preferred shares
of Ita&#250; and the 2013 year-end price target of 34
reais per share, or $15 per U.S. traded share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIENA, Italy, July 31 (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors
probing Monte dei Paschi's 2007 acquisition of a
smaller rival are investigating U.S. investment bank JP Morgan
 in relation to a crime they allege was committed by one
of its employees, according to a prosecutors' document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crime involved is the alleged obstruction of Italian
regulators by an unknown employee relating to a 1 billion euro
hybrid financial instrument used to partly fund the 2007
acquisition of regional lender Antonveneta, the document said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
