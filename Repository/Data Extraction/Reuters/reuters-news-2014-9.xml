&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese anti-trust regulator said on Monday it has given Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) 20 days to reply to queries on the compatibility of its Windows operating system and Office software suite amid a probe into the world's largest software company.&lt;/p&gt;

Their use "may have violated China's anti-monopoly law", the official Xinhua news agency said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verification codes are typically used by software companies as an anti-piracy mechanism. They are provided with legitimate copies of software and can be entered to entitle customers to updates and support from the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has long suffered from piracy of its software within China.

of that regulator's investigation of the San Diego-based firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NDRC said earlier this year that the U.S. chipmaker is
suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in
wireless communication standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Nadella is expected to make his first visit to
China as chief executive later this month.

		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - September 02, 2014) - After the Consulate General of Switzerland in Chicago closed in July 2014, residents of the greater Chicago area and the rest of the Midwest had to travel to Washington, D.C. or New York City to obtain their Schengen visas if Switzerland was their point of entry. Switzerland has therefore made an arrangement with Lithuania to offer better service to residents of the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin who are traveling to the Schengen area as tourists or on business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applicants who qualify for a Schengen tourism or business visa can now submit their applications to the Consulate General of Lithuania in Chicago. The Consulate General of Lithuania will examine applications for tourism and business visas for short stays of up to 90 days within a 180-day period in the Schengen area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This arrangement makes it possible to provide better service to residents of the greater Chicago area and the rest of the Midwest who plan to enter the Schengen area through Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More Info at: https://chicago.mfa.lt/cikaga/en/travel-and-residence/coming-to-lithuania/visas/schengen-visas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa inquiries: Embassy of Switzerland at was.visa@eda.admin.ch; Consular section of the Consulate General of the Republic of Lithuania in Chicago, e-mail: cons.chicago@mfa.lt; kons.cikaga@urm.lt: phone: +1 (312) 397-0382, ext. 201 or ext. 207, fax: +1 (312) 397-0385&lt;/p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="None" date="2014-09-02T18:00:00+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/02/ks-sprint-idUSnBw026195a+100+BSW20140902"><headline>Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure to Speak Sept. 11 at Goldman Sachs Communacopia Conference; Live Audio Webcast Available&lt;S.N&gt;</headline><body>

      2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A GTL is the refinery process of converting natural gas into long chain 
      hydrocarbon products such as GTL diesel and GTL gasoline. Natural gases 
      are converted into liquid fuels either via direct conversion or by using 
      syngas as an intermediate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the key emerging trends in the market is increased investment in 
      the market to improve GTL technology. Many market vendors are investing 
      in different equipment, processes, and technology to enhance the quality 
      of production and reduce the cost of production. Huge investments are 
      being made to integrate various technologies for the production of 
      various quality products such as combining oxygen with natural gas to 
      form syngas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers in this market is the 
      growing need to reduce gas flaring from refineries. With increased 
      demand for oil products worldwide, refinery activity has significantly 
      increased resulting in high flaring of gas leading to a shift in focus 
      toward alternative technology such as GTL to produce various liquid 
      fuels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges confronting 
      the market is the capital-intensive nature of GTL plants. The 
      establishment of a GTL facility requires strong technical expertise and 
      use of advanced technology, which increases the overall cost of these 
      projects.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Key milestone in creating one of the nation&#8217;s largest retirement 
      services providers across all market channels and segments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Great-West Financial&#174; today announced it has completed its 
      acquisition of the J.P. Morgan Retirement Plan Services large-market 
      recordkeeping business, a major step in building one of the nation&#8217;s 
      premier retirement services firms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The combined Great-West Financial retirement organization becomes the 
      second largest provider in the U.S. defined contribution market with 
      nearly 7 million participants. It also record keeps more than $400 
      billion in retirement plan assets. Terms of the transaction, which was 
      originally announced in April, were not disclosed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today marks an important day in our quest to create the foremost 
      provider of retirement services to the U.S. marketplace,&#8221; said Robert L. 
      Reynolds, President and Chief Executive Officer of Great-West Financial.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This development follows an announcement in March that the retirement 
      business of Putnam Investments, which specializes in the large-plan 
      corporate segment, is combining with Great-West Financial.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As we move forward as one organization, Great-West Financial will seek 
      to help millions of working Americans achieve more successful, dignified 
      outcomes in preparing for retirement. We will deliver a new generation 
      of savings vehicles, employee engagement strategies and innovative 
      educational resources, client service and leading-edge technology. 
      Ultimately, we aim to address the country&#8217;s retirement savings challenge 
      and make great strides towards solving it.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reynolds said Great-West Financial now serves every segment of the 
      employer-sponsored retirement plan market: small, mid and large-sized 
      corporate 401(k) clients, government 457 plans and non-profit 403(b) 
      entities as well as the private label recordkeeping business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      key organizational and leadership announcements related to the combined 
      retirement organization.

&lt;p&gt;BARCELONA (Reuters) - Though speculation is rife of a new Pfizer bid, AstraZeneca's chief executive is not holed up with advisers in London or New York. Instead, he has spent the last three days immersed in heart science in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The only thing I can tell you is I am here - and imagine where I would be if something was happening!" Pascal Soriot told Reuters on the sidelines of the European Society of Cardiology congress, the world's largest heart meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strict British takeover rules limit what Soriot and other players can say about Pfizer's abortive attempt to buy AstraZeneca and the possibility of a resumption of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But chatter among investors that Pfizer will come back has boosted shares in Britain's second biggest drugmaker more than 10 percent since the middle of last month, and the ending of the first of a two-stage cooling-off period on Aug. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Pfizer cannot launch another public bid until late November, AstraZeneca can now invite it back for talks and Pfizer also has one shot at making a private approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the saga may not be over, Soriot remains adamant AstraZeneca has a strong independent future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are making good progress with the pipeline and everything so far &#8211; touch wood &#8211; is going in the right direction," he said. "We&#8217;re back to normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soriot has spent his time in Barcelona focused on the heart drug Brilinta, which AstraZeneca flagged as worth a potential $3.5 billion-a-year in a strategy update that formed a central plank of its defense against Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of the drug have disappointed investors so far, totaling only $216 million in the first half of 2014, but they should pick up following the closure of a U.S. probe into a big clinical trial that had worried some doctors, Soriot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very clear that Brilinta will, actually, in the end make it," Soriot said, adding he had been encouraged by feedback from key opinion leaders in Barcelona, as well a new study showing the drug was safe to use in ambulances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CANCER DRUGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next focus for AstraZeneca's research team is the European Society of Medical Oncology in Madrid at the end of September, when it will showcase new clinical data on cancer drugs seen as the highlight of its forthcoming products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors and investors are looking particularly for news about a novel two-drug combination for lung cancer designed to boost the body's immune system, although Soriot said the amount of patient data available in Madrid on the treatment - MEDI4736 plus tremelimumab - would be less than initially expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is that the product was well tolerated and we&#8217;ve explored additional dosing regimens, but the other side of that is that it is delaying us probably by six to eight weeks in terms of ability to scale up and expand the patient cohort," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large element of AstraZeneca's defense against Pfizer's takeover attempt was the argument that a mega-merger would disrupt important drug development programs, especially in cancer, at a time when the science is delivering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frantic weeks in April and May when Soriot worked round the clock on the Pfizer bid - as well as having to answer to politicians agitated by what would have been Britain's biggest ever foreign takeover - had been "very, very distracting", he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soriot also argued that recent advances in research laboratories across the pharmaceutical industry showed that companies should be spending their money on innovation rather than cost-cutting - and tax-saving - acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimism about drug industry innovation, at a low ebb a couple of years ago, has recovered lately thanks to a number of advances with practice-changing new medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Turning to a model of slash-and-burn I don&#8217;t think is the way forward for the industry. I think there is enough innovation," Soriot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the biggest advances have been seen in cancer treatment but cardiologists also had something to celebrate this week in Barcelona, after a new Novartis drug produced strikingly good results in heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Sophie Walker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its price target on Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO)(BDRBF.PK) and reiterated a "sell" rating on shares of the train and plane maker on Tuesday, warning it expected the CSeries aircraft's entry into service to be delayed again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman's price cut came just days after a Swedish carrier backed out as the first customer to start commercial flights with its new CSeries jet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malmo Aviation, owned by Sweden's Braathens Aviation, was slated to be the first CSeries customer to take delivery of the new jet in the second half of 2015, but the airline said on Friday that will no longer be the case. It cited worries about further delays after a May engine failure grounded the jets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the CSeries will negatively impact Bombardier's financial results and create negative catalysts for the next&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;several years," Goldman analyst Noah Poponak said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poponak reiterated the "sell" rating and trimmed his price target to C$3 from C$3.20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSeries aircraft, which will compete with Boeing Co's (BA.N) 737 MAX as well as the Airbus (AIR.PA) A320neo, has been grounded for more than three months. Bombardier, following an initial test flight in September 2013, had earmarked roughly two years for testing after a delay in the development process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poponak said the aircraft has completed just 330 hours of flight testing since its first flight, out of a planned 2,400 total hours, meaning Bombardier has achieved less than 15 percent of planned flight test hours, while using nearly half of the time it had allotted toward testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He contended if flight tests resumed in September, Bombardier would need to complete an average of about 160 test flight hours per month to achieve the currently planned second half of 2015 entry into service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see that as very unlikely given the pace achieved before grounding, momentum (not just time) lost during grounding, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the high risk of new problems occurring other than this engine incident," said Poponak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Bombardier closed more than 3 percent lower at C$3.66 on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange after the Swedish carrier said it was backing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Euan Rocha; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

 veteran, had joined the company as a partner in its
advisory business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green will focus on providing strategic and financial advice
to technology, media and telecommunications companies. He will
be based in San Francisco, Perella Weinberg said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green was named partner at Goldman Sachs in 2002 and held a
number of positions in the company, including chief operating
officer and head of investment banking services for Europe, the
Middle East and Africa region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear if Green joined Perella
Weinberg directly from Goldman. Perella Weinberg did not reply
to an e-mail seeking clarification.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - A Scottish vote for independence from the United Kingdom this month could have serious consequences for the Scottish and UK economies, Goldman Sachs said in a research note on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs economist Kevin Daly said that while the Wall Street bank still felt the most likely outcome was for Scotland to vote to stay in the United Kingdom, a surprise victory for the "Yes" campaign to break away would have a drastic impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Opinion polls suggest that the gap between the 'Yes' and the 'No' camps has narrowed but that a 'Yes' vote in favor of independence remains unlikely," Daly wrote in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the event of a surprise 'Yes' vote, the near-term&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;consequences for the Scottish economy, and for the UK more broadly, could be severely negative," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STERLING HITS NEW LOWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote takes place on Sept. 18, and Daly said the threat of a break-up would give investors a strong incentive to sell Scottish-based assets and withdraw deposits from Scottish-based banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part-nationalized British bank Lloyds (LLOY.L), which owns Bank of Scotland, is considering having its registered office in London rather than Edinburgh should Scots vote for independence, banking industry sources have told Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daly added that the Bank of England would be unable to credibly commit to a sterling GBP= currency union remaining unbroken in case of a "Yes" vote later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pound hit a new seven-month trough against the dollar on Wednesday despite some upbeat British data, as investors fretted that Scotland may yet vote to break up the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daly said uncertainty over whether or not an independent Scotland could keep sterling as its currency could lead to a crisis. He drew a comparison with the euro currency bloc, where weaker and more indebted economies have come under intense financial market pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The UK government's position is that an independent Scotland would not be able to retain sterling as its currency. Pro-independence campaigners argue that, in the event of a 'Yes' vote, the UK government would quickly change its stance because retaining a monetary union would be 'overwhelmingly' in its interests," said Daly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, in our view, the threat to disband the sterling monetary union with Scotland is credible," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the main lessons from the euro area crisis is that a reasonably high degree of fiscal and/or financial integration is necessary, as a means of effective risk sharing, for a monetary union to work. Without political and fiscal integration, it is difficult to see the rest of the UK agreeing to provide a monetary and financial backstop to Scotland."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Better Together" campaign, which has recently lost some of its advantage over the rival "Yes" campaign in favor of independence, latched onto Goldman Sachs' warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackie Baillie, who is a Labour Party member of the Scottish parliament, said the Goldman Sachs note showed that voting for independence could in fact lead to cuts to vital public services such as healthcare and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that independence would push up costs on everyday things like energy and shopping bills. Today's expert intervention spells out the reality for our schools and hospitals too," Baillie said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Yes" campaign for independence, led by politician Alex Salmond, has for its part argued that breaking away could enable Scotland to resist any cuts to public spending set out by the government in London. Salmond has also pledged to keep the sterling currency for an independent Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter on Wednesday from several leading Scottish businessmen, including former Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) chairman Sir George Mathewson, said the UK government was "playing politics" on the currency question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A poll earlier this week showed that support for Scottish independence rose dramatically in August, leaving the "Yes" campaign just six points behind advocates of staying in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Jemima Kelly and Alistair Smout; Editing by Anirban Nag/Ruth Pitchford)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state judge on Wednesday ruled against a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc trader who wanted the court to toss an arbitration panel&#8217;s decision in his pay dispute against the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten, who  ruled from the bench in her Manhattan courtroom, confirmed a March decision by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration panel to dismiss a case filed by the ex-trader, Deeb Salem. She also denied a request by Salem's lawyer to throw out the arbitration ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salem's New York-based lawyer, Jonathan Sack, said he plans to appeal. A Goldman spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deeb Salem, known for his role in shorting the U.S. housing market in the run-up to the financial crisis, had alleged in court papers that FINRA arbitrators improperly dismissed his case at Goldman's request in March, before he fully presented his evidence and witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salem filed the court case in June after a recording revealed that an arbitrator described his case as "bullshit," according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salem, who worked on Goldman's mortgage trading desk, had been seeking more than $21 million in compensation as well as legal costs and other penalties, according to the FINRA panel ruling. Salem wanted higher bonuses for 2010 and 2011, and a bonus and deferred compensation that he did not receive for 2012. He left the Wall Street bank that year to take a job at GoldenTree Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gained some notoriety after the financial crisis because a U.S. Senate panel included his own performance review for 2007. In the review, Salem detailed what he described as Goldman's plan to put a "short squeeze" on the mortgage market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sack, Salem's lawyer, told Bransten during a hearing on Wednesday that arbitrators did not give him the chance to call witnesses whom he wanted to testify in the arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Sack &#8220;failed to show evidence that the material excluded was pertinent to this case,&#8221; Bransten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FINRA arbitration panel accepted Salem's testimony during the arbitration and "thereafter found there was no reason to go forward,&#8221; Bransten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bransten also ordered that filings in the case be redacted. She told Sack that it wasn't proper for him to have included the arbitration transcript in the public record. Goldman submitted a motion in June to seal the filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA, Wall Street's industry-funded watchdog, also runs the arbitration forum where investors and licensed brokerage employees must typically resolve their legal disputes against brokerages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbitration rulings are typically binding. However, courts may overturn them in limited circumstances, such as when an arbitrator is biased.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc should not have been ordered to pay former programmer Sergey Aleynikov's legal fees to defend against criminal charges that he stole secret code from the bank's computers, a divided federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversing a lower court ruling, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it was ambiguous whether Aleynikov's former title as a Goldman vice president made him an "officer" under the bank's bylaws, qualifying him for reimbursement for fees  exceeding $3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing for a 2-1 majority, Circuit Judge D. Michael Fisher returned the case to U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty in Newark, New Jersey. The dissenting judge, Julio Fuentes, would have construed the ambiguity against Goldman, and ordered the bank to advance legal fees to Aleynikov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Marino, a lawyer for Aleynikov, said he will ask the panel or the entire 3rd Circuit to reconsider the decision, saying the ambiguity "compels judgment in Mr. Aleynikov's favor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last October, McNulty ordered Goldman to cover legal fees, then exceeding $700,000, that Aleynikov had incurred in defense against a New York state criminal case, which remains pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNulty also denied Aleynikov's bid to recoup more than $2.3 million of fees to defend against prior federal charges, pending more evidence on the total sum actually due. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3rd Circuit also rejected Goldman's request to dismiss Aleynikov's fee request altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Manhattan federal jury had in December 2010 convicted Aleynikov of stealing code from Goldman as he was preparing to join a Chicago high frequency trading start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov had served 11 months of an 8-year prison term when a federal appeals court in February 2012 voided his conviction, saying prosecutors had improperly applied federal laws on corporate espionage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a surprise move six months later, the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr charged Aleynikov with state crimes based on the same alleged misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Goldman Sachs Group Inc v. Aleynikov, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-4237.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details from decision, byline)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sept 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc should not
have been ordered to pay former programmer Sergey Aleynikov's
legal fees to defend against criminal charges that he stole
secret code from the bank's computers, a divided federal appeals
court ruled on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three judges on a panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals agreed that Goldman's bylaws were "ambiguous" as to
whether Aleynikov's title as a vice president made him an
"officer" eligible to recoup fees, which now exceed $3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing for a 2-1 majority, however, Circuit Judge D.
Michael Fisher said more evidence was needed to determine
Aleynikov's eligibility for the fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dissenting judge, Julio Fuentes, would have construed
the ambiguity against Goldman, and ordered the Wall Street bank
to advance the fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three judges rejected Goldman's request to dismiss
Aleynikov's fee request altogether. The case was returned to
U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty in Newark, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Marino, a lawyer for Aleynikov, said he will ask the
panel or the entire 3rd Circuit to review the decision, saying
the bylaw ambiguity "compels judgment in Mr. Aleynikov's favor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision is the latest twist in a more than five-year
case in which Aleynikov was convicted, went to prison and was
later acquitted, only to be prosecuted a second time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was arrested in July 2009 for having allegedly
stolen code from Goldman as he prepared to join a Chicago high
frequency trading startup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convicted in December 2010, Aleynikov had spent 11 months in
prison when a New York federal appeals court in February 2012
voided his conviction, saying prosecutors improperly applied
federal laws on corporate espionage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a surprise move six months later, the office of
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr charged Aleynikov
with state crimes based on the same alleged misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last October, McNulty ordered Goldman to cover Aleynikov's
legal fees, then exceeding $700,000, in the New York state case,
which is still pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also refused to let Aleynikov recoup more than $2.3
million of fees in the federal case, pending more evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wednesday's decision, Fisher said it was improper to
construe Goldman's bylaws against the bank to help determine
whether Aleynikov deserved to benefit from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said Goldman had considerable discretion in paying
legal fees, having over a six-year period covered 51 people,
including 15 vice presidents, out of 53 considered for fee
advancement or reimbursement at its Goldman Sachs &amp; Co unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his dissent, Fuentes said a ruling for Aleynikov would
serve the public policy of encouraging companies to draft "clear
corporate instruments" that can be applied predictably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's current prosecution took an unexpected turn in
June when Justice Ronald Zweibel of the State Supreme Court in
Manhattan threw out much of the evidence, saying it was gathered
in violation of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Goldman Sachs Group Inc v. Aleynikov, 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-4237.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A decision by Scotland to vote in
favour of independence from the United Kingdom could have
serious consequences for the Scottish and UK economies, Goldman
Sachs said in a research note on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Opinion polls suggest that the gap between the 'Yes' and
the 'No' camps has narrowed but that a 'Yes' vote in
favour of independence remains unlikely," Goldman Sachs'
economist Kevin Daly wrote in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the event of a surprise 'Yes' vote, the near-term
consequences for the Scottish economy, and for the UK more
broadly, could be severely negative," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daly also said that the threat of a break-up would investors
with a strong incentive to sell Scottish-based assets and
withdraw deposits from Scottish based banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the Bank of England would be unable to
credibly commit to a sterling currency union remaining
unbroken in case of a "Yes" vote later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling has already fallen to a five-month low against the
dollar on worries about Scotland away from the United Kingdom.

			Microsoft (Nokia) Improves Most as Apple and Samsung Maintain 
      Leadership Positions in ABI Research&#8217;s Enterprise Smartphone Competitive 
      Assessment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The updated Enterprise Smartphone Competitive Assessment from ABI 
      Research concludes that, overall, Apple is number one followed closely 
      by Samsung, with BlackBerry maintaining its third place ranking. The 
      vendor matrix ranks companies based on nineteen criterion spread across 
      two general categories of Implementation and Innovation. Nine smartphone 
      OEMs were compared on criteria such as EMM device activations, workspace 
      management solutions, and partnerships.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The vendor matrix score separating the two industry leaders was less 
      than a single point. Apple continues to receive high marks in 
      Implementation for device activations within EMM solutions and ongoing 
      usage by business professionals. Samsung, on the other hand, received 
      higher marks for Innovation as the company continues to improve the 
      Samsung KNOX platform and offer varying levels of security needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BlackBerry maintained its third place ranking, but Microsoft (Nokia) 
      showed the most improvement. While BlackBerry was able to maintain its 
      ranking, lower than expected device shipments hindered the company&#8217;s 
      overall score. Microsoft (Nokia), on the other hand, saw a rising number 
      of devices enrolled in EMM programs. Couple this with security updates 
      to the Windows Phone platform enabled the company to improve the overall 
      score significantly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Senior analyst Jason McNicol comments, &#8220;The enterprise smartphone market 
      has intensified in the past six months. Leaders Apple and Samsung have 
      made significant improvements in their device and software offerings 
      making both OEMs more appealing to the enterprise. Apple, however, with 
      its recent announcement with IBM was able to squeeze past Samsung for 
      the number one ranking.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Not to be ignored, though, are BlackBerry and Microsoft (Nokia),&#8221; 
      states practice director Dan Shey. &#8220;Despite the struggles BlackBerry 
      faced last year, the company is still here and proving it can offer a 
      valuable solution. The question though is can it win back lost 
      customers? Microsoft (Nokia), on the other hand, continues to leverage 
      its years of experience in the enterprise to improve upon the Windows 
      Phone platform.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc should not
have been ordered to pay former programmer Sergey Aleynikov's
legal fees to defend against criminal charges that he stole
secret code from the bank's computers, a divided federal appeals
court ruled on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversing a lower court ruling, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals said it was ambiguous whether Aleynikov's former
title as a Goldman vice president made him an "officer" under
the bank's bylaws, qualifying him for reimbursement for fees 
exceeding $3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing for a 2-1 majority, Circuit Judge D. Michael Fisher
returned the case to U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty in
Newark, New Jersey. The dissenting judge, Julio Fuentes, would
have construed the ambiguity against Goldman, and ordered the
bank to advance legal fees to Aleynikov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Marino, a lawyer for Aleynikov, said he will ask the
panel or the entire 3rd Circuit to reconsider the decision,
saying the ambiguity "compels judgment in Mr. Aleynikov's
favor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last October, McNulty ordered Goldman to cover legal fees,
then exceeding $700,000, that Aleynikov had incurred in defense
against a New York state criminal case, which remains pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNulty also denied Aleynikov's bid to recoup more than $2.3
million of fees to defend against prior federal charges, pending
more evidence on the total sum actually due.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3rd Circuit also rejected Goldman's request to dismiss
Aleynikov's fee request altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Manhattan federal jury had in December 2010 convicted
Aleynikov of stealing code from Goldman as he was preparing to
join a Chicago high frequency trading start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov had served 11 months of an 8-year prison term when
a federal appeals court in February 2012 voided his conviction,
saying prosecutors had improperly applied federal laws on
corporate espionage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a surprise move six months later, the office of
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr charged Aleynikov
with state crimes based on the same alleged misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Goldman Sachs Group Inc v. Aleynikov, 3rd U.S.

      2014

      PolyBase and SQL Server query optimization guru Dr. Rimma Nehme, senior 
      research engineer at the Microsoft Jim Gray Systems Lab, will kick off 
      Day 2 at PASS Summit 2014 in Seattle, WA, Nov. 6, with Black Girls CODE 
      founder Kimberly Bryant headlining the conference&#8217;s popular Women in 
      Technology (WIT) luncheon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rimma, who has helped prepare Dr. David DeWitt&#8217;s celebrated PASS Summit 
      keynotes since 2010, is known for her work on PolyBase, which integrates 
      SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW) with Hadoop, as well as the SQL 
      Server PDW query optimizer, a partial results framework for database 
      systems, an automated partitioning advisor for parallel database 
      systems, and more. With her keynote, &#8220;Cloud Databases 101,&#8221; Rimma will 
      be taking Summit&#8217;s 5,000+ SQL Server and BI professionals deep into the 
      what, why and how of data processing in the cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s an honor to help carry on PASS Summit&#8217;s rich tradition of helping 
      SQL Server and BI professionals get the most out of their database 
      environments, and I&#8217;m thrilled to be sharing some of the exciting work 
      done in the field around working with data in the cloud,&#8221; Rimma says. 
      &#8220;When talking about cloud databases, people often mean different things. 
      Some may be referring to a pay-per-use service; others may be speaking 
      about a speci&#64257;c piece of software. In this keynote, we will look under 
      the covers of cloud databases and try to dispel some of the myths.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WIT luncheon speaker Kimberly Bryant, an electrical engineer&#160;working 
      in&#160;biotech, was inspired by her daughter in 2011 to launch the 
      non-profit Black Girls CODE (BGC), with the mission of supporting and 
      promoting the underrepresented female and African demographic (25%&#160;and 
      3%,&#160;respectively, in 2012) within the technology industry. BGC has grown 
      to 3,000 students across 7 US states as well as in&#160;Johannesburg,&#160;South 
      Africa, and has received support from many companies both within and 
      outside of the technology industry. Kimberly will be taking questions 
      from the onsite audience and from Twitter during the Nov. 6 live-stream 
      event, hosted by PASS&#8217;s WIT Chapter and sponsored by SQL Sentry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The motto of Black Girls CODE is &#8216;Imagine. Build. Create,&#8217;&#8221; Kimberly 
      notes. &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to share with the PASS WIT and data communities how 
      we can all imagine a world where everyone is given the tools to succeed, 
      and get even more data professionals involved in building ways for 
      everyone to access information and create a new age of women and women 
      of color in technology.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global SMB IT Spending Market 2014-2018 - Key 
      Vendors are Cisco Systems, Dell, HP  IBM
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hw2dlq/global_smb_it) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      SMB IT Spending Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global SMB IT Spending market to grow at a CAGR of 5.54 percent over 
      the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Small and medium-sized (SMB) businesses are defined based on the number 
      of employees and annual revenue generated. Micro businesses are those 
      that have less than 10 employees, small businesses are those that employ 
      less than 100 employees, and mid-sized businesses are those that have 
      more than 100 but less than 1,000 employees. The IT requirement of an 
      SMB differs based on business size.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SMBs have dynamic needs but limited resources. From the last few 
      decades, SMBs have been the growth engine of the IT industry as they 
      account for the majority of businesses. Moreover, the number of SMBs is 
      set to increase rapidly in the coming years with a rise in IT component 
      investment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the predominant trends expected in this market is the growing 
      popularity of cloud-computing services. Cloud computing allows SMBs to 
      access technologies such as infrastructure, platforms, and software that 
      need proper IT support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the increased spending on mobile devices such 
      as tablets is considered as the major source for the growth for the 
      Hardware segment. SMBs have adopted modern and mobile technologies such 
      as Voice over Internet Protocol to compete with other enterprises.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges that the 
      market faces is the threat to data security and privacy in the Software 
      segment. Advanced technologies such as social networking, communication 
      technologies, mobile devices, and cloud computing have increased the 
      scope for data theft.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global SMB IT Spending market is categorized into three main 
      segments:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Hardware

&lt;p&gt;BUCHAREST, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Romania's top oil and gas
group Petrom and U.S. major ExxonMobil will
need to invest $4-5 billion to extract gas from a Black Sea
field, provided additional data confirms their find, President
Traian Basescu said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies jointly own Domino-1, the first deep water
exploration well in Romanian waters and in 2012, they said they
had discovered 1.5-3 trillion cubic feet (42-84 billion cubic
metres (bcm)) of gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Petrom and Exxon began drilling a second
deepwater well in the Black Sea in the European Union state,
needed to assess the size and commercial viability of the gas
field previously discovered at Domino-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basescu said the new gas field would likely help Romania
cover both its gas needs and those of eastern neighbour Moldova
by 2018-2019.

			Intensity 
      Therapeutics, Inc., a privately-held specialty pharmaceutical 
      company developing novel products to treat solid tumor cancers, 
      announced today that Ian B. Walters M.D., MBA, has been appointed as 
      Vice President, Clinical Development  Chief Medical Officer. Dr. 
      Walters, who will initially work part-time, will oversee the company's 
      clinical strategy and activities, including direct supervision of 
      clinical research, clinical operations, medical affairs and drug safety 
      and surveillance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "I am exceptionally pleased that Ian is joining the Intensity team," 
      said Lewis 
      H. Bender, President and CEO of Intensity Therapeutics. "Throughout 
      his career, Ian has consistently demonstrated both leadership and 
      expertise in drug development, including the advancement of multiple 
      cancer compounds from research stages through approval. He has an 
      impressive track record with extensive experience in clinical and 
      regulatory processes, both domestically and internationally. Following 
      our recently completed type B, pre-IND meeting with the U.S. Food and 
      Drug Administration&#8217;s (FDA) Division of Oncology Products, we have a 
      development plan that we anticipate will lead to initial human testing 
      of our first cancer drug product, INT230-6, in the second half of 2015.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. Walters remarked, &#8220;I am excited to help Intensity Therapeutics 
      develop and execute its first clinical trial. I believe in situ 
      chemovaccination is a novel platform that leverages the patient&#8217;s own 
      tumor antigens to activate a specific and durable anti-tumor immune 
      response. This technology should enable highly personalized therapy 
      without complicated ex-vivo processing.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. Walters brings over 15 years of oncology/immunology drug development 
      experience to Intensity Therapeutics. Dr. Walters has been a consultant 
      to biotech, pharma and investment companies specializing in the 
      evaluation, prioritization, and development of innovative technologies 
      in the treatment of severe diseases. He has worked in multiple biotech 
      companies on corporate development, translational medicine, clinical 
      development and medical affairs. Dr. Walters spent seven years at 
      Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), where he led clinical research and matrix 
      development teams. During his tenure there he contributed to the 
      development of multiple immuno-oncology products (Yervoy&#174; and 
      Nivolimumab (anti-PD-1)), as well as the licensing and partnering 
      strategy for other immuno-oncologic agents. Before entering the private 
      sector, Dr. Walters was a lead investigator at the Rockefeller 
      University and initiated cutting edge immunology research to understand 
      the mechanism of action of several compounds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. Walters received his MD from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine 
      and an MBA from the Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania.

			About Intensity Therapeutics, Inc.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Intensity Therapeutics, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company whose 
      mission is to greatly extend the lives of patients with solid tumor 
      cancers. Intensity Therapeutics is pioneering a new approach to treat 
      cancer referred to as in 
      situ chemovaccination. The Company creates novel, proprietary 
      formulations of proven chemotherapy drugs. These products, when injected 
      directly into tumors result in significantly greater tumor growth 
      inhibition and increased survival compared to conventionally delivered 
      chemotherapy. The technology attenuates (kills) a tumor in a manner that 
      allows for the adaptive immune system to recognize the cancer to attack 
      untreated tumors and prevent disease recurrence. Further information can 
      be found at www.intensitytherapeutics.com.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI BEACH Fla. (Reuters) - Nearly three tons of cocaine packed in bricks marked with smiley faces and black Lamborghini sports cars was offloaded by the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami Beach, Florida on Thursday after being seized in Caribbean waters near Panama last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cocaine, worth an estimated $93 million, was confiscated as part of the U.S. government's Operation Martillo, (Spanish for "hammer"), to halt the increased flow of drugs through the Caribbean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cocaine will be destroyed after being analyzed in the hopes of determining its country of origin, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Mexican, Colombian and Central American cartels have turned to using speedboats in the Caribbean for illicit shipments into the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coast Guard has seized approximately 30 tons of cocaine in the Caribbean since October 2013, spokesman Ryan Doss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 14 percent of U.S.-bound cocaine shipments, about  42 tons, was trafficked through the Caribbean during the first six months of 2013, double the share shipped through the region in the first half of 2012, according to the DEA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 23, two Coast Guard boats stopped a speedboat north of the Gulf of Uraba near northwestern Colombia after a helicopter spotted its crewmembers throwing packages overboard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-two bales of cocaine were recovered, the Coast Guard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five days later, the Coast Guard boarded a Panamanian-flagged vessel off that country's coast and recovered roughly 3,300 pounds (1,497 kg) of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Zachary Fagenson; Editing by Jonathan Kaminsky and Grant McCool)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - In the last week of August, Twitter entertained dozens of potential young recruits at a chic studio, while Facebook served drinks and snacks to job-seekers at its own office. More than 175 showed up to a similar event at Google in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco? No, Seattle, home of Microsoft Corp and Amazon and fast becoming a second home for Silicon Valley companies looking to access the city's plentiful pool of relatively cheap tech talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft alumni are now running the Seattle offices of Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Google Inc, and they look to their former employer as a source for new talent. Microsoft has always suffered some loss of talent to competitors, but it now has to battle attractive companies in its own backyard to hire the tech stars it needs to reposition itself as a leader in mobile and the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of our top engineers are from Microsoft and they are doing really well," said Rohit Wad, who leads Facebook's Seattle office after an 18-year career at Microsoft. "The deep computer science knowledge they have is directly applicable to a lot of work we do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook has more than 400 employees in Seattle, up from 125 only two years ago, vastly outstripping the social network's overall growth. It recently took over a second floor in its rented offices to handle the overflow, and is starting to fill a third. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a depth of engineering talent and experienced engineers here," said Wad, whose team does a lot of work relating to Facebook's platform and mobile development. "That's a big contingent here in Seattle because we can get people who are proficient in that. There is meaty, fulfilling work here." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google now has more than 1,400 employees in two centers in the Seattle area, with the engineering work run by Microsoft veteran Chee Chew. Twitter opened its Seattle office in January and has almost 100 employees under Jeff Currier, another former Microsoft manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a huge talent pool in the city," said Hillel Cooperman, a former Microsoft executive who founded his own software firm and design consultancy in Seattle with former colleagues called Jackson Fish Market. "It's less expensive to hire them up here, so why wouldn't you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software developer salaries start at about $95,000 in Seattle, compared to about $109,000 in San Francisco, according to recruiting company Robert Half Technology. Washington was the fifth fastest-growing state for computer-related jobs in the first half of this year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Oregon were the four fastest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It&#8217;s really hard to find great talent in any market, but the Bay Area is a freakin' knife fight," said Brett Thompson, who runs human resources and recruiting at Seattle-based data visualization firm Tableau Software Inc.&#160;"That's why you see a lot of companies from the Bay Area coming up here. It actually feels like there's a more plentiful amount of talent in Seattle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICROSOFT, AMAZON ANCHOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Amazon are the engines that power tech employment in the Seattle area, bringing in thousands of graduates and qualified programmers every year from around the United States and the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many subsequently leave those companies, but don't want to give up the laid-back, relatively cheap Seattle way of life. They often go to one of the Silicon Valley invaders, or the rash of startups that are becoming forces in their own right, such as Zillow, Tableau and Zulily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft people tend to leave after their reviews in the summer and then September when they get their bonuses," said Jerry Taylor, president of Executive Recruiters Inc in Seattle, who has been placing tech candidates in the city since 1977.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turnover has been heating up this summer, after Microsoft began laying off 1,351 around the Seattle region in July, many of them involved in testing Windows software. Microsoft currently has 1,289 vacancies in the area on LinkedIn, almost half of them with the word 'cloud' in the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albert Squiers, director of technology recruiting at Fuel Talent in Seattle, said the ripple effect of the layoffs was starting to be felt in the region, and he has already been contacted by a handful of job-seekers from Microsoft. Taylor said he has seen an "influx."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ebb of talent from Microsoft is potentially damaging to the software giant if it continues to lose mobile-savvy people to younger rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I definitely think that Microsoft is challenged to bring in top talent," said Scott Ruthfield, a former Microsoft and Amazon manager who founded the tech recruiting and consulting firm Rooster Park. "There are growth companies that tell a more exciting story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives declined to discuss the issue, but a spokesman said Seattle's growth as a tech hub was good for everybody: "It is a boon to both the local tech industry and the overall regional economy, and benefits companies of all sizes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUALITY OF LIFE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the more frequent rain, many rising tech stars end up liking Seattle more than the Bay Area for the space and low rents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People like the quality of life in the Pacific Northwest, the outdoors, the traffic and the cost of living," said Megan Slabinski, who runs Robert Half Technology's&#160;recruiting business on the west coast. "Oftentimes, candidates are not as willing to relocate to the Bay Area, once they live in the Pacific Northwest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shravan Goli, president at online tech job site Dice.com, a former Microsoft employee now working in the Bay Area, said it was hard to get his old colleagues to join him. California's state income tax is as high as 12.3 percent for top earners, compared to zero in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a huge cost of living differential, and state tax," he said. "I felt the pinch when I moved down." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One employee even kayaks across Seattle's Lake Union to work at Tableau, which is now worth more than $4 billion after going public last year and has expanded its workforce by 65 percent in the last 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's so hard to hire people now," said Goli at Dice. "That's driving the necessity for companies to get more creative and find other pockets, like Seattle, to go set up shop." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by John Pickering)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is reviving plans to raise at least $500 million with its first issue of Islamic bonds, a sign that Islamic finance is going mainstream as big conventional banks seek to tap Middle Eastern money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank will meet investors in Qatar next Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on the following day to discuss  selling sukuk, a document from lead managers of the sale said on Thursday.

&lt;p&gt;* Expected to be at least $500 million with 5-year tenor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Five banks will arrange it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Investor roadshows in Middle East next week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Sukuk market now big enough for global banks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Changes structure after issue plan in 2011 hit controversy

 (Adds details of plan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Archana Narayanan and Al-Zaquan Amer Hamzah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI/KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs 
is reviving plans to raise at least $500 million with its first
issue of Islamic bonds, a sign that Islamic finance is going
mainstream as big conventional banks seek to tap Middle Eastern
money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank will meet investors in Qatar next Wednesday
and the United Arab Emirates on the following day to discuss 
selling sukuk, a document from lead managers of the sale said on
Thursday. The sukuk are expected to have a tenor of five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the issue goes ahead after the investor meetings, Goldman
will become only the second non-Islamic bank to sell sukuk,
after the Middle Eastern unit of HSBC did a $500
million deal in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underlying assets in Goldman's sukuk issue would be
linked to commodities and crude oil, a source with knowledge of
the plan said, adding that the proceeds would be used in the
commodities business of J. Aron &amp; Co, a Goldman unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other global banks are poised to follow Goldman. In recent
months, France's Societe Generale and Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan's largest lender, have been
preparing to issue sukuk in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An initial attempt by Goldman to sell sukuk in 2011 ran into
controversy and was called off as some in the industry accused
it of failing to follow Islamic principles, which include bans
on the payment of interest and pure monetary speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. bank is now returning to the market as the
Islamic finance industry grows rapidly, fuelled by booming
economies in the Gulf and southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New issues of sukuk so far this year total $85.9 billion
through 456 deals globally, up from $74.9 billion through 558
deals a year earlier, according to data from Zawya, a Thomson
Reuters company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those volumes remain small compared to conventional finance,
but are now big enough to make it worthwhile for Western
borrowers to get in on the act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments in non-Muslim countries are also starting to
issue sukuk; in June, Britain became the first Western
government to do so, while Hong Kong, South Africa and
Luxembourg all plan sales this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For global sukuk pipeline, click:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glossary of Islamic finance terms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTROVERSY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some investors, Goldman is a symbol of Western banking,
and its first attempt to enter the sukuk market - a $2 billion
issuance programme registered with the Irish Stock Exchange
three years ago - was dogged by suspicions that it might exploit
Islamic finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts suggested Goldman might use the proceeds of
the issue to lend money to clients for interest, or that the
issue might not trade at par value, which could also contravene
sharia principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Goldman insisted that these concerns were unfounded
and Islamic scholars had given its 2011 plan adequate
certification, it never went ahead with the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the U.S. bank appears to be taking pains to avoid
controversy. The document from lead arrangers said it would use
a wakala structure for its sukuk, instead of the murabaha
structure planned in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murabaha is a cost-plus sale arrangement which is commonly
used in some parts of the Islamic world but has been criticised
by some scholars for being too close to conventional financial
engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's latest plan may indicate that wakala, in which one
party manages assets on behalf of another, is becoming the
structure of choice for big global banks. The HSBC issue in 2011
was wakala, and Societe Generale and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ have both chosen that structure for their plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Islamic financial instruments are checked for
religious permissibility by sharia scholars engaged by the
issuer. Goldman sought advice for its latest plan from three
prominent scholars: Abdul Sattar Abu Ghuddah, Mohammed Elgari
and Sheikh Nizam Yaquby, the source familiar with the plan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman wanted to do something accepted by the market and
has worked very hard on the structure with their sharia board
and advisers, and also sought endorsements from the sharia
boards of the joint lead managers, besides other experts," the
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman chose itself, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank,
Emirates NBD, National Bank of Abu Dhabi and
the investment banking arm of Saudi Arabia's National Commercial
Bank IPO-NACO.SE to arrange the investor meetings, the
document from lead managers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial indications are that Goldman's new plan may be
received positively by the market. The involvement of top
Western banks could help to develop Islamic finance by expanding
its investor base and the pool of expert bankers involved in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has always been my view that it's good for them to make
a comeback. This is a market that welcomes all kinds of
issuers," Daud Bakar, chairman of the sharia advisory council
under Malaysia's central bank, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to make sure there is full disclosure on what the
underlying project is. Also they need to consult with sharia
scholars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohamad Akram Ladlin, executive director at the
International Shari'ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance,
said: "As with any issuance it is encouraged if the purpose of
it is for good: to develop infrastructure, to enhance Islamic
finance, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The earlier controversy was with their background, their
image in the industry. There were also issues with the structure
of the sukuk. If they can overcome these, why not?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sukuk would be issued through a vehicle called JANY
Sukuk Co and be guaranteed by Goldman Sachs. The issue is
expected to be rated A-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's and A by Fitch
Ratings, identical to the ratings of the investment bank, the
document added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue would be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange;
trading wakala sukuk is less controversial than trading murabaha
instruments, many scholars believe.

&lt;p&gt;* Google case started with EU investigation in late 2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* EU's Almunia has 2 months to decide before leaving office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Deal will only escalate market abuse, Google rival says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft and
publishers across Europe attacked Google's antitrust
deal with EU regulators, calling it a "catastrophic" proposal
that would serve only to entrench its dominance of the online
search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia is
preparing to decide on the case after spending three years
examining whether Google squeezes out rival services in online
search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 66-year-old Spaniard, who reached a preliminary deal
with the world's most popular Internet search engine in
February, has around two months to issue the final decision
before he leaves office. He has told 18 complainants that he
intends to rebuff their grievances and is now examining their
responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has become highly politicised, with sources saying
about a third of Almunia's colleagues in the Commission are
opposed to the deal. Sources told Reuters the EU may close the
current case and open another one into Google's Android mobile
operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of British price-comparison site Foundem, Shivaun
Raff, said the Commission had no evidence that Google's offer to
let three rivals display their logos and web links in a box and
allow content providers to decide what material Google can use
for its own services would resolve competition issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(Google's proposals) are not a remedy. They are a
catastrophic escalation of the abuse," Raff told a news
conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's director of competition law, Jean-Yves Art, said
the U.S. software company was particularly concerned about
Google's contractual curbs on advertisers making it difficult
for them to switch to other online platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proposals don't cure or eliminate all restrictions that
we and rivals see. There are still restrictions preventing them
from providing interoperability," he said at the news
conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives from newspapers and magazine publishers
across Europe, online travel site Expedia and a host of
complainants from Germany and Britain were also present at the
event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almunia's spokesman Antoine Colombani declined to comment.
Google spokesman Al Verney did not immediately reply to emails
and telephone calls.

			&lt;p&gt;SOUTH WINDSOR, CT--(Marketwired - Sep 4, 2014) - Sisters Elsa and Anna will trade their winter boots for ice skates as they visit dozens of cities across the U.S. with Disney&#174; On Ice: Frozen. Tickets for the highly-anticipated ice show -- which starts in Orlando, FL -- are available at TicketNetwork.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney&#174; On Ice: Frozen begins its stay in Orlando Sept. 4 at 7 p.m. at the Amway Center. There will be a total of eight shows over the course of four days, with the final performance on Sept. 7 at 6:30 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's easy to see why this show has been among our top-selling events since it was announced back in June," says Crystal Maldonado, theater specialist for TicketNetwork.com.

It'll feel like audiences are really transported to Arendelle, and they can sing along with Elsa and Anna to their favorite songs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsa and Anna will be joined by the whole cast from the film, including the clueless but lovable snowman Olaf; the musical, magical trolls; and Kristoff alongside his reindeer friend, Sven. Hosted by Mickey and Minnie Mouse, the performance features singing, dancing, and special effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following its Orlando stint, the tour will travel along the East Coast and Midwest.

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN (Reuters) - Fresh from acquiring Nokia's handset business, Microsoft unveiled the first of its new range of Lumia smartphones on Thursday, priced to challenge a market dominated by volume leader Samsung and Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week before Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone 6, Microsoft, which paid $7.2 billion this year to acquire the Nokia business, introduced at the IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin its new "affordable flagship" phone, the Lumia 830.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Lumia will sell globally at a price of around 330 euros ($433), before taxes, or upward of 400 euros($525) in all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As previously expected, Microsoft also introduced a five megapixel, front-facing camera phone called the Lumia 735 which has been dubbed the 'selfie-phone' since it was demonstrated in-house to Microsoft employees in July and features a wide-angle lens for close-in photos of small groups or individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumia 735 will be available globally this month for 219 euros, before taxes or subsidies, for a version designed for the latest 4G networks while the third new phone, the Lumia 730, is  priced at 199 euros, excluding tax, which will run on more commonly available 3G networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new phones flesh out the upper end of the Lumia line-up, which has regularly won good reviews from technology experts but has yet to gain a significant following from consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smartphones run on Microsoft's Windows software, mostly Lumias, captured only 2.7 percent of the global smartphone market in the second quarter, down from 3.8 percent the year before, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, Google Android phones had a smartphones market share of 85 percent, while Apple&#8217;s iPhone had 11.9 percent, down from 13.4 percent a year ago. Samsung, the market leader among Android-based phone makers and in smartphones overall, had a market share of 25.2 percent, down from 32.6 percent a year ago, as a result of increasingly stiff competition from lower-cost Chinese makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said Microsoft is focusing on a mid-tier strategy with a good mix of hardware and software that represents "another step in the right direction".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the Lumia line is gaining some traction among marketers and app developers that it needs to draw in consumers with creative software and services, he said Microsoft must become a bigger player before the industry considers it a third, "must-support" mobile platform as Android and Apple already are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s new chief executive, Satya Nadella, has often said the company must be &#8220;mobile first, cloud first&#8221; in order to compete in new tech markets and extend its dominance in computing beyond the PC into phones and Web-based software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (1 US dollar = 0.7617 euros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Eric Auchard and Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Expects to Rate Goldman Sachs' Sukuk Programme 'A'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings expects to assign a long-term debt rating of 'A' to The 
      Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s (Goldman) JANY Sukuk Company Limited (JANY) 
      guaranteed trust certificate issuance programme.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificate programme's expected rating is equalized with Goldman's 
      Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating of 'A', due to 
      the Sukuk's structure, which is expected to include the following 
      features:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Upon a trust dissolution event, J. Aron  Company (J. Aron) will be 
      obliged under the Murabaha Agreement to acquire or arrange for a third 
      party purchaser to acquire, JANY's beneficial interest in the 
      commodities comprised in the Wakala portfolio.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The deferred payment price payable to the issuer under the Murabaha 
      contract will be sufficient to fund payment of the face amount and any 
      periodic distribution amounts due on the certificates upon (and any 
      additional periodic distribution amounts accruing for a period of up to 
      14 days following) the occurrence of a trust dissolution event or the 
      scheduled dissolution date of the trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Goldman will unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee the payment 
      obligations of J. Aron under the Murabaha contract, including an 
      obligation to pay the face amount and any periodic distribution amounts 
      due on the certificates upon (and any additional periodic distribution 
      amounts accruing for a period of up to 14 days following) at the 
      occurrence of a trust dissolution event or the scheduled dissolution 
      date of the trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and 
      unsubordinated indebtedness of the Guarantor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has given no consideration to any underlying assets or any 
      collateral provided, as Fitch understands that the issuer's ability to 
      satisfy payments due on the certificates will ultimately depend upon J. 
      Aron and Goldman satisfying their unsecured payment obligations to the 
      issuer under the transaction documents described in the prospectus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By assigning such ratings to the programme and certificates to be issued 
      under it, Fitch does not express an opinion on the programme structure's 
      compliance with Shari's principles or whether the relevant transaction 
      documents are enforceable under applicable law.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Sukuk program does not benefit from a cross-default provision within 
      the guarantee documents, while other Fitch-rated Goldman debt issuances 
      benefit from these provisions. In the event of Goldman's bankruptcy or 
      insolvency, Fitch believes this could result in time-related 
      subordination of the Sukuk notes relative to other creditors of Goldman 
      whose claims would be accelerated in the event of default. However, the 
      outcome for the Sukuk notes would be uncertain, and would depend on the 
      remaining maturity of the notes, the performance of the reference 
      collateral and the actions of the regulatory authorities in a bankruptcy 
      scenario.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's ratings continue to be supported by its investment banking 
      franchise, solid liquidity position, better-than-average capital 
      position, and strong risk management. The ratings are constrained by 
      Goldman's focus on capital market activities and relatively higher 
      wholesale funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating of the programme will be influenced by changes in Goldman's 
      long-term IDR. A downgrade of Goldman's IDR would result in a downgrade 
      to JANY's long-term debt rating. Depending on the magnitude of a 
      downgrade of Goldman, this could potentially result in notching between 
      the Sukuk programme and Goldman's IDR to reflect potential time-related 
      subordination associated with the lack of a cross-default provision.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's rating upside is viewed as limited given the firm's current 
      business and funding profiles. A material diversification of the firm's 
      revenue sources which result in increased performance stability combined 
      with further improvement and diversification in Goldman's funding 
      profile could potentially result in moderate upward rating momentum.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downward rating pressure for Goldman could be triggered by a material 
      loss, significant increase in leverage and/or deterioration in liquidity 
      levels. Similarly, any unforeseen or outsized fines, settlements or 
      charges could also have adverse ratings implications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch expects to assign the following ratings:

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 4 (IFR) - JP Morgan has lured Kiran Karia a FIG

put three bankers in that division at risk, according to market

&lt;p&gt;In July, JP Morgan put Veenay Chheda, an executive director
in the hybrid structuring team, Ian Haywood, a UK and Ireland
FIG DCM coverage banker, and Lily Brown, a French FIG DCM
banker, at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karia is being hired as a vice president, according to a
source, and is expected to begin his new role by the end of the
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Morgan Stanley, he was vice president of global capital
markets focusing on the Benelux and Nordics, according to his
LinkedIn profile page.

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Fresh from acquiring Nokia's
handset business, Microsoft unveiled the first of its
new range of Lumia smartphones on Thursday, priced to challenge
a market dominated by volume leader Samsung and
Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week before Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone 6,
Microsoft, which paid $7.2 billion this year to acquire the
Nokia business, introduced at the IFA consumer electronics fair
in Berlin its new "affordable flagship" phone, the Lumia 830.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Lumia will sell globally at a price of around 330
euros ($433), before taxes, or upward of 400 euros($525) in all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As previously expected, Microsoft also introduced a five
megapixel, front-facing camera phone called the Lumia 735 which
has been dubbed the 'selfie-phone' since it was demonstrated
in-house to Microsoft employees in July and features a
wide-angle lens for close-in photos of small groups or
individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumia 735 will be available globally this month for 219
euros, before taxes or subsidies, for a version designed for the
latest 4G networks while the third new phone, the Lumia 730, is 
priced at 199 euros, excluding tax, which will run on more
commonly available 3G networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new phones flesh out the upper end of the Lumia line-up,
which has regularly won good reviews from technology experts but
has yet to gain a significant following from consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smartphones run on Microsoft's Windows software, mostly
Lumias, captured only 2.7 percent of the global smartphone
market in the second quarter, down from 3.8 percent the year
before, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, Google Android phones had a
smartphones market share of 85 percent, while Apple's iPhone had
11.9 percent, down from 13.4 percent a year ago. Samsung, the
market leader among Android-based phone makers and in
smartphones overall, had a market share of 25.2 percent, down
from 32.6 percent a year ago, as a result of increasingly stiff
competition from lower-cost Chinese makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said Microsoft is focusing
on a mid-tier strategy with a good mix of hardware and software
that represents "another step in the right direction".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the Lumia line is gaining some traction among
marketers and app developers that it needs to draw in consumers
with creative software and services, he said Microsoft must
become a bigger player before the industry considers it a third,
"must-support" mobile platform as Android and Apple already are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new chief executive, Satya Nadella, has often
said the company must be "mobile first, cloud first" in order to
compete in new tech markets and extend its dominance in
computing beyond the PC into phones and Web-based software.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, Sept 4 (Reuters) - The Irish government has
expressed serious concern about a U.S. court order for Microsoft
 to hand over emails held on servers in Ireland to U.S.
prosecutors, saying it would create significant legal
uncertainty about data protection in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge on Friday lifted a suspension on her order directing
Microsoft to turn over a customer's emails, but the software
company said it would not release any emails while it appeals
the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland is home to the European headquarter of several large
U.S. technology companies and is a major host of data servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland's minister for data protection, Dara Murphy, said
the country would be open to a request for the emails under the
2001 Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which governs the transfer
of information in criminal cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he described as "objectionable" the process being used,
whereby a U.S. court was making a direct order about data held
in another jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The possible implications of this ruling are very serious
for Ireland and the European Union," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Compliance with the warrant may result in Microsoft, and
any other U. companies with operations in the EU which are
served with such warrants in the future, being in breach of the
Irish Data Protection Acts and the EU Data Protection
Directive," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prospect of emails held in Ireland being handed over has
drawn concern from technology companies - fearful of losing
revenue from foreign customers worried that U.S. law enforcement
might win broad power to seize their data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft in particular was stung by revelations last year
by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and
has been at pains to prove to customers that it does not allow
the U.S. government unchallenged access to personal data on its
servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case appeared to be the first in which a corporation has
challenged a U.S. search warrant seeking data held abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murphy said that he had held talks with the European
Commission about the implications of the ruling and would
discuss the matter with the US Charg&#233; d'Affaires and the
American Chamber of Commerce in Dublin.

&lt;p&gt;Other banks working on the e-commerce company's IPO were eager for the role, also known as the stabilization agent, because of the status and the potential of additional fees associated with it, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stabilization agents support the share price by purchasing additional shares on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc will be the lead floor trader at the New York Stock Exchange, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A date for the IPO has not been announced but is expected next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba, which powers 80 percent of all online commerce in the world's second-largest economy, is expected to raise more than $20 billion and could top the $16 billion pulled in by Facebook Inc FB.O when it listed in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Amrutha Penumudi in Bangalore)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - ExxonMobil is to pump more money into European refining, with the upgrade of a unit at its Slagen refinery in Norway, bucking an industry trend which has seen some plants in the region closing, and others on death watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon said on Thursday it planned to install a new processing unit to enable the production of high quality vacuum gas oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new residual flash tower will produce the gasoil, replacing the production of lower value heavy fuel oil, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The new unit will enable improvement in the product yield in a highly energy-efficient manner that will help further strengthen the industry-leading position of our assets," said Stephen Hart, regional director of ExxonMobil Refining and Supply.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman declined to disclose the cost of the upgrade, but said that around 50 to 60 staff would add to the 375 staff at the plant during the 12 month building process, and that production would not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes after Exxon said in July it would invest $1 billion in its 320,000 barrels per day (bpd) Antwerp refinery, even as many firms pull back from a European industry hammered by low refining margins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's investments will likely pile on pain for others in the sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thin margins forced Essar to cut production at its Stanlow plant in England this year, while the Coryton plant, also in England, closed in 2012 following the bankruptcy of its owner Petroplus, and Mantua refinery in Italy, owned by Hungary's MOL, closed in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon had a refining capacity in Europe of 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) from its European refineries out of a total worldwide throughput of 5.3 million bpd in 2013, according to its financial and operating review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Simon Falush; Editing by Mark Potter)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Fair Lawn Dentist Discusses the Cost of Invisalign Orthodontic Treatment&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jody Bardash Explains How Invisalign(R) Teeth Aligners Can Be a Cost-Effective, Comfortable, and Discreet Alternative to Metal Braces&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;FAIR LAWN, NJ--(Marketwired - Sep 4, 2014) - Dr. Jody Bardash of Dental Professionals of Fair Lawn says the convenience provided by Invisalign&#174; teeth aligners make it a favorite orthodontic treatment for his patients. Dr. Bardash is an advocate for the Invisalign&#174; system because he says it can solve many minor and complex teeth alignment issues in a more comfortable, less noticeable way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invisalign&#174; uses a sequence of clear, removable teeth aligners to gradually shift teeth into a straighter position. Once a patient has been evaluated and a customized series of aligners has been created, they will then be given the aligners to take home. After one set is used for two weeks, the patient moves on to a new set of slightly modified aligners -- a process that works to gently reposition the teeth. Dr. Bardash notes that it usually takes about 9 to 15 months for the best results, although treatment times vary with each patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His latest blog post on the practice's website, titled, "How Much Do Invisalign&#174; Teeth Aligners Cost?," shares more details about how the cost of treatment is calculated. In the blog, the New Jersey dentist reveals that, although the national average for Invisalign&#174; treatment is around $5400, the cost of the procedure is ultimately based on each patient's individual needs. As a result, the cost for one patient's Invisalign&#174; treatment may not be the same as another patient's treatment. The number of aligners and the total treatment length are determining factors of the total cost of Invisalign&#174;, Dr. Bardash explains. He says his practice works with their patients to find a suitable payment option, and many dental insurance plans offer coverage for orthodontic procedures. Dr. Bardash notes his office also works with CareCredit&#174;, a third party financing company that offers flexible payment terms for qualified applicants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients interested in Invisalign&#174;, Dr. Bardash says dentists should be able to determine if they are good candidates during their initial consultation. Once the consultation is complete, the patient can get a detailed estimate about how much his or her customized treatment will cost. Dr. Bardash says, since Invisalign&#174; teeth aligners are clear and can be removed for eating, drinking, and daily oral hygiene routines, the treatment can be a very good option for patients looking to straighten misaligned teeth more comfortably and discreetly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Jody Z. Bardash, DMD

to its financial and operating review.

			With Ipanema, KBC, Bank-Insurance Group, Delivers Excellent Quality 
      of Experience to Microsoft Lync  Microsoft Office 365 Users, Increasing 
      Productivity  Reducing Telecom Costs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			KBC, 
      an integrated bank-insurance group, headquartered in Belgium, partnered 
      with Ipanema 
      Technologies to ensure full and quick adoption of Microsoft Lync 
      online and Microsoft Office 365. The objective was to increase 
      employees&#8217; productivity and give the business the flexibility to 
      introduce quick new business applications. This objective had to be 
      obtained without a negative impact on the network and telecom costs. 
      Ipanema Technologies helped KBC to guarantee business application 
      performance and allow the IT department to dynamically adapt to new 
      usages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBC sought to reduce operational costs and provide employees with better 
      integrated services in order to improve productivity. KBC partnered with 
      Ipanema on several key IT initiatives to achieve these goals:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Deploy Microsoft Lync Online and Microsoft Office 365
      
			
        Foster employees&#8217; collaboration and mobility
      
			
        Improve IT department flexibility &#8211; faster troubleshooting and 
        application deployment
      
			
        Reduce IT costs by reviewing the global infrastructure, avoiding 
        non-justified bandwidth upgrades and moving to Microsoft Lync and 
        Microsoft Office 365 applications in the cloud
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Ipanema solution was deployed in 827 bank branches, which will allow 
      KBC to quickly adapt to IT changes. KBC experienced a smooth roll-out of 
      Microsoft Lync and Microsoft Office 365 within six months. Besides that, 
      a new BYOD policy has been developed during the summer, allowing 
      employees to work from every place, every device, increasing mobility 
      and productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;After the full roll-out there will be 15,000 users on Microsoft Lync 
      spread in our bank branches and headquarters, so we couldn&#8217;t take the 
      risk that they didn&#8217;t get an optimum quality of experience. Therefore we 
      chose Ipanema to guarantee the quality of service of our network as well 
      as the performance of our business critical applications such as bank 
      transactions and VoIP&#8221;, explains Bart Adriaensen, Head of 
      Telecom and UC&#178; eWorkplace, KBC Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The smooth adoption of Microsoft Lync was evidenced by P2P sessions 
      reaching 140,000 per week and Microsoft Lync conferences increasing from 
      92 to 3700 per week. This will allow for Telco cost savings due to 20% 
      less landline extensions on PBX, travel savings of 7 million kilometres 
      and a boost in tele-working with 4,900 people being able to tele-work.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Thanks to Ipanema, KBC avoided costly bandwidth upgrades and stopped 
      using their Telco&#8217;s Class of Service (CoS), which equated to a 
      substantial cut in network costs. Troubleshooting has become faster and 
      proactive while application deployment is now taking an average of six 
      months rather than the previous average of two years.

      Research and Markets: Poland IT Market Report 2014-2018: Asseco Poland, 
      HP, IBM  Microsoft Dominates the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4rj7vs/it_market_in) 
      has announced the addition of the "IT 
      Market in Poland 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the IT market in Poland will grow at a CAGR of 
      5.59 percent over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IT market in Poland is categorized into three main segments: 
      Hardware, Software, and IT Services. The report also covers IT 
      investment across key end-user segments and discusses the role of cloud 
      computing in optimizing the business process of the IT market in the 
      country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the emerging growth trends in the market is the rapid expansion 
      of cloud computing in Poland, which is expected to increase in the 
      future because of the efficiency and cost advantage associated with the 
      service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, increase in the number of IT professionals is 
      one of the major drivers in the market. Many IT students graduate from 
      Polish universities every year. The IT sector in Poland focuses on the 
      latest technological skills and thus provides the best training to its 
      professionals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the increasing use of open-source 
      software is a major challenge faced by the IT market in Poland. The 
      majority of enterprises, public schools and government agencies are 
      adopting open-source software solutions as it is less expensive than 
      premium paid software. Open-source providers offer source code access to 
      developers which lead to the commoditization of software with various 
      functionalities, which results in an increase in the incidence of bugs 
      and usability issues. When this occurs, users have to re-learn new 
      software and incur a switching cost.

		&lt;/p&gt;

      senior vice president of specialties, aromatics and styrenics for 
      Chevron Phillips Chemical. &#8220;And to ensure its long-term success, Chevron 
      Phillips Chemical determined its stand-alone PPS business is a better 
      strategic fit for Solvay, a company with a strong engineering polymers 
      portfolio.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the transaction, Solvay intends to purchase Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical&#8217;s Ryton&#174; PPS resin manufacturing assets in Borger, Texas, its 
      pilot plant along with its PPS research and development assets in 
      Bartlesville, Oklahoma, its compounding plant in Kallo-Beveren, Belgium, 
      and certain intellectual property relating to Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical&#8217;s Ryton&#174; PPS business. The compounding plant in La Porte, 
      Texas, will remain part of Chevron Phillips Chemical and will be 
      operated by Chevron Phillips Chemical exclusively for Solvay for some 
      period of time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In addition, the Ryton&#174; PPS business currently has about 200 employees 
      and most will have the opportunity to join Solvay,&#8221; said Corn. &#8220;We 
      intend to work with Solvay to enable safe and reliable operations and a 
      smooth business transition for customers and employees.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the 
      completion of the transaction is expected in the fourth quarter of 2014.

      Research and Markets: Global Document Management Systems (DMS) Market 
      2014-2018: Key Vendors are EMC, IBM, Microsoft  OpenText
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hd8trq/global_document) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Document Management Systems (DMS) Market 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Document Management Systems market to grow at a CAGR of 
      13.63% over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A document management system is used for the storage as well as 
      organization of documents, content creation, and sharing of the content 
      within an organization. This system helps organizations centralize 
      unstructured documents and unmanaged documents in place. The use of 
      document management systems also helps reduce time and cost associated 
      with document management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One major trend in the market is the emergence of SaaS-based DMSs. The 
      increasing adoption of SaaS-based models has helped reduce the cost of 
      deploying valuable IT infrastructure, which increases an organization's 
      efficiency. The time involved in task completion will reduce using a DMS 
      as it can be accessed at any time and in any place and by multiple users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers of this market is the 
      need to increase efficiency. Document management enables employees to 
      easily manage and access all structured content and documents using one 
      piece of software. It brings an organization closer to a paperless 
      environment and helps the company take a big step forward in improving 
      employee efficiency and reducing its environmental impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that concern over data security is one of the 
      major challenges that the market faces. Data security and privacy are 
      major concerns in any organization. With the deployment of SaaS-based 
      DMS solutions, the data resides in the cloud servers of vendors, which 
      increases the security concerns. There is always a risk of information 
      leakage, which could result in the misuse or manipulation of data. For 
      organizations, data security is a vital aspect of cloud infrastructure 
      and applications.

      Research and Markets: Global Fracking Chemicals and Fluid Market 
      2014-2018: Key Vendors are Baker Hughes, Chevron Phillips Chemical, 
      Halliburton, Schlumberger  Weatherford
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hr2gng/global_fracking) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Fracking Chemicals and Fluid Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Fracking Chemicals and Fluid market to grow at a CAGR of 9.0 
      percent over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fracking chemicals and fluids are used in the fracturing technique 
      commonly known as hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing or fracking 
      is a technique of well stimulation, in which a fluid at high pressure 
      (typically water mixed with sand and chemicals) is injected into a well 
      to create minor fractures in the deep rock foundations to allow natural 
      gas, petroleum, and brine to move upwards in the well from the deep 
      reserves. Fracking is commonly used for shale gas and oil recovery. Such 
      stimulation is usually carried out once during the productive life of a 
      well and helps eliminate fluids (gas and oil), thus increasing the 
      productivity of the well. Hydraulic fracturing is used when the field 
      production of a well has declined. The composition of fracking chemicals 
      and fluid varies depending on the type of fracturing used, the 
      conditions of the specific welfare fractured, and the characteristics of 
      water in the field. A typical fracture treatment uses between 3 to 12 
      chemicals additives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the key trends in this market is the shift of the Oil and Gas 
      Drilling industry toward horizontal drilling which requires more 
      fracking fluids and chemicals than vertical drilling.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      increased consumption of oil and gas, which has forced companies and 
      governments to increase their production by investing in the Oil and Gas 
      sector, which has ultimately led to the market growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the proper management of flowback fluids. The proper isolation 
      of flowback fluid from its surrounding environment is a major challenge 
      because the recycling of this fluid is a tedious task and the recycling 
      methods are still in the development stage.

&lt;p&gt;CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa has denied a visa to the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, for the third time in five years, one of his  representatives said on Thursday, intensifying speculation about the extent of Beijing's sway over Pretoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India and is at loggerheads with China over Tibet, had been hoping to join a Nobel peace conference in Cape Town next month but withdrew his visa application after being told it would be unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have informally received contact His Holiness won't get his visa," Nangsa Chodon, the Dalai Lama's South Africa-based representative, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South African foreign ministry confirmed that its High Commission in India had received a visa application but denied it had been rejected, saying it was being subjected to "normal due process".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It then said the Dalai Lama had canceled his trip. It did not provide details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang thanked South Africa for its "support". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(China) highly appreciates the respect given by the South African government on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and the support given to China on this issue," Qin told reporters on Friday at a regular press briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that South Africa will continue to support China's sovereignty and territorial integrity," Qin said, adding that the Dalai Lama had "destroyed" China's ethnic unity "under the guise of religion".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China brands the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule of Tibet, a separatist. The Dalai Lama says he is seeking more autonomy for his Himalayan homeland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A South African court ruled two years ago that officials had "unreasonably delayed" a decision on granting the Dalai Lama a visa in 2011, largely out of fear of angering China, now a major African and South African trading partner and investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the delay, the Dalai Lama was unable to attend the 80th birthday of his friend and fellow Nobel peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu in Cape Town in October 2011. The previous visa denial, in 2009, was also for a peace conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We remain hopeful that the national government will grant the visa in order to spare South Africa the international humiliation of failing to do so," opposition politician and Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille, who is organizing next month's event, said prior to the Dalai Lama's withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Wendell Roelf, Additional reporting by Sui-Lee Wee in BEIJING; Editing by Ed Cropley and Robert Birsel)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK (Reuters) - To make vacationing in a country still under martial law a little more attractive, Thailand&#8217;s military junta is offering tourists from China free visas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese are the biggest visitors to Thailand, accounting for 18 percent of total arrivals in July, but they also proved among the most nervous, with numbers slumping more than other nationalities after May's military coup. Tourism accounts for about 10 percent of the Thai economy, and the imposition of martial law in May after the coup hit the industry hard. Winning back the Chinese visitors is imperative - spending by mainland tourists jumped 80 percent to $6 billion in 2013 from 2012.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slump in tourist numbers after the coup was much more pronounced among visitors from East Asia than from Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen Wei, the manager of an outbound travel department for Asia at Shanghai Huating Overseas Tourist Co, said his firm had only one group of 20 tourists a week traveling to Thailand this month, compared with two to three groups a week of more than 30 tourists each last year.The number of visitors from China fell 41 percent in June - the first full month under military rule - from Hong Kong 46 percent, Japan 25 percent, and Korea 29 percent, while arrivals from Europe fell by three percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tourism Authority of Thailand said its new tourism promotion measures included a 30-day extension of stay for visitors from 48 countries and one territory, in addition to the free visa for Chinese guests, although tourists from many other countries don't need holiday visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The return of some normality to Thailand, and possibly the 1,000 baht ($30) visa saving, could be starting to work with visa applications from China rising, while tourism operators say visitor numbers picked up last month.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less than half their rooms filled, compared with occupancy rates of 60 to 65 percent in July 2013, Thailand&#8217;s hoteliers are impatient for martial law to be lifted now that political unrest has subsided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was eerily quiet in June and July," said Boonchai Suwatsakulsawasd, general manager of the Centara Duangtawan Hotel in Chiang Mai, which targets Chinese tourists. "It only got better in August."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fall in Chinese tourist numbers was keenly felt in Chiang Mai. The northern city became a favorite with Chinese tourists in 2012 after featuring in the Chinese box-office comedy hit "Lost in Thailand", which portrayed the travel adventures of two Chinese men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatcha Riddhimat, general manager of the Dusit D2 Chiang Mai hotel, said the number of Chinese guests at his hotel fell nearly 90 percent in June and July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTIAL LAW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the number of Chinese visitors appears to be on the rise again, the total for this year is forecast to fall short of the record 4.6 million who visited in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has revised up its estimates for mainland visitor numbers this year to 4.3 million from about 4 million, said Thawatchai Arunyik, governor of the TAT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would still be down over 6.5 percent on the year. In January-July this year, Thailand had 2.2 million Chinese visitors, down about 24 percent from last year. The agency expects a total of 25.5 million tourists this year, about a million less than in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign tourists may have ruled out Thailand because most travel insurance policies have exemptions specifying that claims will not be paid if they are a result of martial law or civil unrest, and many countries have maintained travel warnings on Thailand.But from late July, international tourists visiting Thailand can buy  special insurance coverage known as the "Thailand Travel Shield" set up by the TAT in cooperation with four well-known Thai insurance companies, which might have helped with the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The military government said it was considering lifting martial law, particularly in areas that attract a lot of tourists, a junta spokesman said on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to lift martial law to get business going quickly," said Surapong Techaruvichit, president of Thai Hotels Association. Thai tourism has bounced back before, recovering quickly from protests in 2010 that closed parts of central Bangkok for weeks before a military crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse forecast a sharp rise in tourist numbers for 2015, and consequently increased its 2015 economic growth forecast to 4.5 percent from 3.9 percent. It sees growth of only 0.9 percent for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 32.0 Thai Baht)    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Shanghai Newsroom and Kitiphong Thaichareon; Editing by Simon Webb and Eric Meijer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goodwin Procter Expands IP Litigation Group with Addition of Five 
      Partners from Kenyon  Kenyon
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goodwin 
      Procter announced today that five attorneys have joined as partners 
      in the firm&#8217;s Intellectual Property Litigation Practice. They come to 
      Goodwin from Kenyon  Kenyon, a specialty intellectual property firm 
      known for litigating high-stakes patent cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Joining Goodwin Procter in New York are Elizabeth 
      J. Holland, Robert 
      V. Cerwinski, Huiya 
      Wu, and Cynthia 
      Lambert Hardman, and joining in Washington, D.C. is William 
      G. James. The group has significant patent litigation experience 
      relating to pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and other life sciences, as 
      well as Hatch-Waxman ANDA litigation, trade secret and ITC litigation, 
      and inter partes review at the U.S. Patent  Trademark Office.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted that this distinguished and talented group has chosen 
      Goodwin as the firm that best complements their respected intellectual 
      property practices,&#8221; said Regina 
      M. Pisa, chairman of Goodwin Procter. &#8220;Their arrival gives our 
      clients a distinct advantage when facing intellectual property 
      challenges and related matters in an increasingly complex marketplace.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Elizabeth Holland is an experienced trial lawyer focusing 
      exclusively on patent infringement and related litigation. With more 
      than 25 years&#8217; experience, she has litigated patents in a wide array of 
      technical areas and industries, including those involving 
      pharmaceutical, chemical, medical device, and consumer products. She has 
      particular expertise in Hatch-Waxman litigation, having tried numerous 
      cases in this area on behalf of both branded and generic drug companies. 
      She chaired Kenyon  Kenyon&#8217;s Diversity Committee and was the first 
      woman to serve on its Management Committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			William James, who also served on Kenyon&#8217;s Management Committee, 
      focuses his practice on patent litigation related to pharmaceutical and 
      biotechnology products. He has significant experience with Hatch-Waxman 
      litigations, representing both plaintiffs and defendants, including 
      first-to-file cases and multi-defendant ANDA drug challenges. He also 
      advises pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies on 
      freedom-to-operate, due diligence, licensing, and prosecution issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Robert Cerwinski has extensive experience litigating intellectual 
      property matters. For more than a decade, he has successfully 
      represented both plaintiffs and defendants in patent and trade secret 
      litigation before federal and state courts across the country. His 
      primary focus is on litigation involving pharmaceutical and biological 
      products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Huiya Wu has practiced intellectual property law for over a 
      decade, focusing on patent and related litigation. She represents both 
      plaintiffs and defendants before federal district and state courts, as 
      well as before the International Trade Commission. She handles all 
      phases of U.S. patent litigation, including pre-trial investigation, 
      fact and expert discovery, and motion, trial and appellate practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Cynthia Hardman has over a decade of experience litigating 
      complex intellectual property cases, from developing initial strategy 
      through appeal. She appears in cases before federal district courts, the 
      U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the International 
      Trade Commission, and represents clients in the pharmaceutical, medical 
      device, nutritional supplement, and consumer product industries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our group is excited to join Goodwin Procter, &#8221; said Elizabeth Holland. 
      &#8220;We believe that Goodwin&#8217;s first-rate IP litigation team combined with 
      the firm&#8217;s full-service capabilities will provide us an outstanding 
      platform from which to serve our clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have known Elizabeth and her colleagues for some time, and we are 
      thrilled to have attracted such a strong group of IP litigators,&#8221; said Douglas 
      Kline, chairman of Goodwin&#8217;s IP Litigation Group. &#8220;They are 
      excellent lawyers who will join a team committed to delivering 
      outstanding service to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goodwin Procter&#8217;s&#160;Patent 
      Litigation Practice is ranked by Corporate Counsel as one of 
      the nation&#8217;s most active patent litigation practices, drawing on the 
      firm&#8217;s more than 150 IP attorneys and scientists dedicated to actively 
      protecting and promoting client assets. Goodwin routinely works with 
      clients to take cases from pre-suit investigations through discovery 
      proceedings and trials and its attorneys provide counsel on 
      infringement, validity and patentability issues, and when necessary, 
      litigate patents in federal district courts throughout the country. The 
      firm has substantial experience before the Federal Circuit, the 
      International Trade Commission, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and 
      the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 8 (IFR) - The Republic of Kazakhstan has
mandated Citi, HSBC and JP Morgan to arrange a potential new
Eurobond, according to sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bond is likely to be in US dollars. Timing of the deal
has yet to be determined, added the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sovereign hired the same group for a deal last year,
though a bond never materialised. Kazakhstan then re-tendered
the bond mandate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan is rated Baa2 by Moody's and BBB+ by both
Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks declined to comment.

		&lt;h1&gt;Cisco Claws Back Enterprise Collaboration Leadership From Microsoft&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;RENO, NV--(Marketwired - Sep 8, 2014) - New Q2 data from Synergy Research Group shows that just one quarter after Microsoft had finally caught up with Cisco in enterprise collaboration infrastructure revenues, Cisco has regained the top spot, though the gap between the two is small. Revenues from collaboration -- which includes enterprise voice, UC applications, telepresence, email software, enterprise content management, enterprise social networks and hosted communications and applications -- were $7.7 billion in the quarter, with Cisco's overall share standing at 16.0% and Microsoft just behind at 15.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total revenues for the quarter were up 2% year on year, with continued declines in the enterprise voice and telepresence markets being countered by strong growth in other segments. Of the larger segments, particularly strong growth was seen in hosted voice  UCaaS (up 17%), enterprise social networking (up 20%) and hosted web conferencing (up 9%). On a rolling annual basis revenues reached $30.5 billion, up 3% from the preceding four quarters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In Q2 Cisco bounced back from a poor start to the year in the enterprise voice segment and also saw strong growth in WebEx, though telepresence revenues remained soft" said Jeremy Duke, Synergy Research Group's founder and Chief Analyst. "One issue that Cisco faces is that a substantial amount of its collaboration revenue comes from mature markets which are flat or declining. In contrast Microsoft achieved sequential growth in all ten of the segments in which it is active, and grew year on year in nine of them." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Synergy Research Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synergy provides quarterly market sizing and segmentation data on enterprise collaboration and related markets, including vendor revenues by segment and by region.

		&lt;h1&gt;IBM and Intel Bring New Security Features to the Cloud&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;SoftLayer First to Offer Added Security Down to the Chip Level to Boost Hybrid Cloud Deployments&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;DALLAS, TX--(Marketwired - Sep 8, 2014) -  IBM today announced that SoftLayer will be the first cloud platform to offer its customers bare metal servers powered by Intel&#174; Cloud Technology that provides monitoring and security down to the microchip level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel&#174; Trusted Execution Technology (Intel&#174; TXT) provides hardware monitoring and security controls that help assure businesses that a workload from a known location on SoftLayer infrastructure is running on trusted hardware. This assurance provides an essential level of confidence -- and even compliance certification -- for organizations moving sensitive and mission-critical operations to the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These new security capabilities put IBM at the forefront of security innovation helping organizations develop solutions around areas such as governance, compliance, audit, application security, privacy, identity and access management and incident response. IBM will also be offering services to help customers implement this new capability into their applications and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Security perception remains the biggest hurdle for wide-spread enterprise cloud adoption," said Marc Jones, CTO for SoftLayer. "SoftLayer is the only bare-metal cloud platform offering Intel TXT, leading the industry in enabling customers to build hybrid and cloud environments that can be trusted from end-to-end." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel TXT is especially advantageous for large enterprises subject to compliance and audit regulations, such as healthcare, financial services and government organizations. It helps ensure that trusted resources can be integrated, managed and reported on with the relevant compliance frameworks (HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP, ISO, FISMA, SSAE16). With IBM Cloud and SoftLayer infrastructure, these organizations will be able to certify a cloud computing pool is appropriately secured for workloads with exposures such as governance and enterprise risk, information and life-cycle management, compliance and audit, application security, identity and access management and incident response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is becoming increasingly important to provide cloud environments with the same, if not greater levels of security as your on premise technology environments," said Rick Echevarria, Vice President of Intel Security Group, General Manager, Intel Security Platform and Solutions Divisions. "By building on IBM's history of security innovation, with this solution based on Intel TXT, SoftLayer is demonstrating that such levels of cloud security are now possible and available."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel TXT verifies the components of a computing system from its operating system or hypervisor all the way to its boot firmware and hardware. Combined with attestation (root of trust software) this verification is then used to permit or deny a workload from running on that select server system. Hybrid cloud solutions can leverage partner software and Intel TXT, to limit data decryption to specific geo-located servers, in support of local data privacy laws. And because Intel TXT is activated during boot up, this added security does not add any performance overhead to applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use Intel TXT, SoftLayer customers need only order bare metal servers available with a Trusted Platform module (TPM) installed. Once activated and deployed with attestation software Intel TXT allows clients to build trusted computing pools of IT resources in the cloud with an added level of visibility and control. Designed to measure the execution environment and protect sensitive information from software-based attacks Intel TXT operates with TPM, an industry-standard device that can securely store the measurement artifacts, to verify the integrity of the hardware, firmware and software. This assurance provides an essential level of confidence -- and even certification -- for organizations moving sensitive and mission-critical operations to the SoftLayer Infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Softlayer is a member of the Intel Cloud Technology program, which identifies CSPs using Intel processors for reliable industry-leading performance and quality. Intel TXT is available today on SoftLayer bare metal servers with the following Intel processors:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Intel&#174; Xeon&#174; E5-2600 v2
				Intel &#174; Xeon&#174; E3-1200 v3
				Intel &#174; Xeon&#174; E5-4600 
			&lt;p&gt;More SoftLayer bare metal server configurations will be available with the technology in the future.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our partnership from INSTEON was born from our mutual love of making 
      the home better through technology,&#8221; said Barry Wosk, President, Sound 
      Developments, a leading North American distributor of audiovisual 
      products and accessories. &#8220;We truly value the partnerships that we have 
      with top brands like INSTEON and cannot wait to connect with our current

      INSTEON formally announced its integration with Cortana in July 2014. 
      Cortana is Microsoft&#8217;s intelligent assistant that uses natural language 
      understanding and text to respond to users&#8217; inquiries, launch 
      applications and set/send reminders. The all-new digital assistant also 
      offers proactive suggestions, providing useful recommendations as she 
      gets to know each unique user. Integrating Cortana with INSTEON products 
      enables users to accomplish a variety of tasks by simply speaking to 
      Cortana.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our Microsoft Cortana voice-activated technology integration shows

      Research and Markets: Global SaaS-based Content Security Market Report 
      2014-2018: Cisco Systems, McAfee, Microsoft  Symantec Lead the Market
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/bb5mtk/global_saasbased) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      SaaS-based Content Security Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global SaaS-based Content Security market to grow at a CAGR of 17.60 
      percent over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Increased demand from small business segments is one of the key trends 
      in the market. Advances in technology have forced small and medium 
      enterprises to use SaaS-based content security solutions to increase 
      their market share. Companies from different sectors are increasingly 
      adopting SaaS-based content security solutions because of the various 
      benefits offered such as low investment costs and the availability of 
      pay-per-use models.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the main driver for the Global SaaS-based 
      Content Security market is the rise in the cloud services-specific 
      attacks. Driven by multiple factors such as flexibility, cost saving, 
      and availability of data, many companies are transferring their data to 
      the cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that inconsistent network connection issues 
      are one of the major challenges that the market confronts. For the 
      proper functioning of the SaaS-based applications, organizations require 
      a reliable internet connection. High-speed internet connection comes 
      with an additional charge, which increases the total operational cost.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/nscx8z/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Transportation System and Analytics Market 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Transportation Systems and Analytics market to grow at a CAGR 
      of 15.46% over the period 2013-2018.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Globalization and hyper-urbanization have created the need for an 
      efficient transportation system. Various advanced transportation systems 
      and analytical tools help transportation agencies to make real-time 
      decisions, improve operational efficiencies, and provide safe and secure 
      services to customers. Since transportation systems comprise of a vast 
      network including road, rail, air, and sea, many initiatives have been 
      taken to bring together physical and digital infrastructure, creating 
      intelligent networks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Transportation Systems and Analytics market can be segmented 
      into three: Solutions, Applications, and Products. As a result of an 
      increase in the global population, there has been a rise in congestion 
      and pollution. To control these factors, the Transportation industry 
      needs advanced solutions, applications, and devices, which help 
      transportation agencies to reduce the travel time for passengers and 
      provide safe and reliable services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major emerging trends in this market is the increasing number 
      of smart vehicles and the growing usage of smart roads which will make 
      use of information technology to reduce road accidents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      change in travel demands of people. As people have busier schedules, 
      efficient and time-savvy transportation systems are in demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the slow growth of infrastructure is one 
      of the major challenges in the market. The conventional or existing 
      transportation infrastructure is not compatible with many new 
      technologies that are introduced in the market. There is an urgent need 
      to upgrade the infrastructure in tune with advanced technologies.

      Saudi Basic Industries  Sinopec
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/lcz76k/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Polyethylene Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Polyethylene market to grow at a CAGR of 3.71 percent over 
      the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Polyethylene, also known as polythene, is the most commonly used 
      plastic. It is chemically synthesized from ethylene. Polyethylene is 
      used in various products, such as packaging products, pond liners, 
      pipes, molds, wires, cables, general purpose tubes, drums, carrier bags, 
      and household goods as it can be easily remolded. There are three major 
      types of polyethylene: high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density 
      polyethylene (LDPE), and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the 
      Global Polyethylene market for the period 2014-2018. In terms of type, 
      the Global Polyethylene market can be segmented into three: HDPE, LDPE, 
      and LLDPE.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the emerging trends in this market is the use of swing technology 
      in upcoming polyethylene projects. Many manufacturers are implementing 
      swing technology, which helps in producing either High-density 
      Polyethylene or Linear Low-density Polyethylene, depending on the market 
      demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the most important driver in the market is the 
      increased consumption of packaging materials. Consumers worldwide prefer 
      flexible packaging compared to rigid packaging.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges confronting 
      the market is raw material volatility. The market is experiencing 
      fluctuations in prices of raw materials such as naphtha, which affect 
      the production of polyethylene.

      of hybrid cloud computing models. Computing resources are accessed from 
      the public cloud infrastructure as and when required. Enterprises also 
      increasingly use hybrid clouds because they may host critical 
      applications on private clouds and applications with relatively low 
      security concerns on the public cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one major driver in the market is the increased 
      productivity of the network infrastructure. Organizations that adopt 
      private clouds increasingly use virtualization, which enhances 
      efficiency. Most organizations prefer to invest in private clouds as it 
      helps reduce hardware infrastructure costs. A virtualized network 
      increases an organization's performance and productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one major challenge is migrating legacy 
      applications on a private cloud computing platform. Legacy applications 
      limit information to a certain number of end-users. In addition, the 
      private cloud imposes restrictions when managing and validating data, 
      which forces organizations to think twice before migrating to a private 
      cloud.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Sosei Group Corporation (&#8220;Sosei&#8221;)(TOKYO:4565) confirms the new data from 
      three clinical trials presented by Novartis at the European Respiratory 
      Society (ERS) International Congress, September 6-10, in Munich, Germany.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The LANTERN study demonstrated that once-daily Ultibro&#174; 
      Breezhaler&#174; (indacaterol/glycopyrronium bromide) was superior 
      in reducing exacerbations (flare ups) and improving lung function 
      compared to twice-daily Seretide&#174;
			Accuhaler&#174;*
			(salmeterol/fluticasone (SFC)), in patients with 
      moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The 
      study showed Ultibro&#174; Breezhaler&#174; significantly 
      reduced the rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations by 31% compared to 
      SFC1, in moderate-to-severe COPD patients with a history of 
      one exacerbation or none in the previous year. In addition, Ultibro&#174; 
      Breezhaler&#174; patients had significantly increased lung 
      function (trough FEV1 0.075 L (p0.001); AUC0-4h 0.122 
      L (p0.001)), as compared to SFC after 26 weeks of treatment.
			The 
      safety profile of Ultibro&#174; Breezhaler&#174; was 
      comparable to SFC1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new findings from LANTERN support the use of Ultibro&#174; 
      Breezhaler&#174; as an alternative steroid-free treatment to SFC 
      in moderate-to-severe COPD patients1. This approach is 
      consistent with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung 
      Disease 2014 guidelines3.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Analyses from the QUANTIFY study demonstrated that Ultibro&#174; 
      Breezhaler&#174; significantly improved lung function and 
      shortness of breath in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, compared 
      to the combination of tiotropium plus formoterol2. Results 
      also showed that Ultibro&#174; Breezhaler&#174; is 
      comparable to tiotropium plus formoterol in improving health-related 
      quality of life2.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Data from the GLISTEN trial showed that Seebri&#174; Breezhaler&#174; 
      (glycopyrronium bromide) when added to LABA/ICS provided significant 
      improvements in lung function, health status and rescue medication use 
      in moderate-to-severe COPD patients when compared to LABA/ICS alone3. 
      This study provides much-needed evidence for add-on therapy to LABA/ICS 
      in COPD, to support physicians care choices where very little data exist4.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The safety profiles of Ultibro&#174; Breezhaler&#174; and 
      Seebri&#174; Breezhaler&#174; were similar to those of their 
      respective study comparators in the LANTERN, QUANTIFY and GLISTEN studies1,2,3.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COPD symptoms can have a major negative impact on a patient&#8217;s ability to 
      breathe and function, reducing their quality of life4,5. 
      Essential daily activities such as climbing stairs can become very 
      difficult as the condition gradually worsens6. There is a 
      need for newer treatment options in COPD because many patients remain 
      symptomatic despite medical therapy7.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Furthermore, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd has announced that it had 
      signed an exclusive promotion agreement for Ultibro&#174; 
      Breezhaler&#174; and Seebri&#174; Breezhaler&#174; in 
      the United Kingdom with Pfizer Limited (&#8220;Pfizer&#8221;). Under the terms of 
      this agreement, Pfizer will assume sole responsibility for commercial 
      activities relating to Ultibro&#174; Breezhaler&#174; and 
      Seebri&#174; Breezhaler&#174; in the UK, while Novartis will 
      continue to be responsible for the manufacture, sale and distribution of 
      both medicines, in addition to regulatory, pharmacovigilance and medical 
      information commitments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is estimated that there are three million people living with the COPD 
      in the UK17. The UK market is estimated to be the second 
      largest globally in terms of COPD market value18.

			About LANTERN
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LANTERN was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 26-week study 
      involving 744 patients and conducted at 56 sites across China, 
      Argentina, Chile and Taiwan8. The primary objective of the 
      study was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Ultibro&#174; 
      Breezhaler&#174; 110/50 mcg to SFC 50/500 mcg in terms of lung 
      function (trough FEV1) after 26 weeks of treatment in stable 
      patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, with a history of one 
      exacerbation or none in the previous year1. Ultibro&#174; 
      Breezhaler&#174; demonstrated non-inferiority and additionally 
      showed superior efficacy versus SFC for the primary objective. In this 
      study, exacerbations were a pre-specified exploratory endpoint.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About QUANTIFY
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      QUANTIFY was a 26-week treatment, multicenter, randomized, parallel 
      group, blinded study to assess the efficacy and safety of once-daily 
      Ultibro&#174; Breezhaler&#174; in 934 patients with 
      moderate-to-severe COPD, versus the free-combination of tiotropium 18 
      mcg plus formoterol 12 mcg. The primary objective of QUANTIFY was to 
      demonstrate non-inferiority of Ultibro&#174; Breezhaler&#174; in 
      HRQoL, as assessed by the St. George&#8217;s Respiratory Questionnaire-COPD 
      (SGRQ-C), versus tiotropium plus formoterol after 26 weeks of treatment 
      in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD2. Secondary 
      endpoints included transition dyspnea index (TDI) score, trough FEV1, 
      forced vital capacity (FVC) and safety and tolerability2.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About GLISTEN
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The primary objective of GLISTEN was to demonstrate non-inferiority of 
      Seebri&#174; Breezhaler&#174; 50 mcg versus tiotropium 18 
      mcg when added to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 mcg on trough FEV1 
      after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD3. 
      The secondary endpoints included comparison of Seebri&#174; 
      Breezhaler&#174; 50mcg added to salmeterol/fluticasone compared 
      with salmeterol/fluticasone plus placebo3.

			About COPD
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COPD affects an estimated 210 million people worldwide13 and 
      is projected to be the third leading cause of death by 20204. 
      It is progressive (usually gets worse over time), and can be a 
      life-threatening disease4,13. COPD makes it difficult to 
      breathe, with symptoms that have a destructive impact on patients&#8217; 
      function (i.e. activity limitation, decreased mobility) and quality of 
      life4,13. It is often considered to be a disease of later 
      years, but estimates suggest that 50% of those with COPD are now less 
      than 65 years old, resulting in increases in absenteeism, premature 
      retirement and reductions in workforce participation14,15.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ITOCHU Migrates Global Communication Infrastructure to NTT 
      Communications Enterprise Cloud and Microsoft Office 365
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Cloud-based Delivery of Software Expected to Increase Employee 
      Productivity -
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			NTT 
      Communications Corporation (NTT Com), the ICT solutions and 
      international communications business within the NTT Group (NYSE:NTT), 
      announced today that it is building next-generation ICT infrastructure 
      incorporating the company&#8217;s Enterprise 
      Cloud service, as well as Microsoft&#8217;s Office 365 and other 
      applications delivered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), to provide ITOCHU 
      Corporation, one of the leading sogo shosha (general trading 
      companies), with advanced ICT capabilities for employees worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All applications are being provided from the cloud and can be accessed 
      via the Internet as well as private network environments of ITOCHU 
      offices globally. By leveraging NTT Com&#8217;s Enterprise Cloud, which is 
      backed by 11 cloud delivery centers around the world, together with 
      Office 365, ITOCHU&#8217;s next-generation ICT infrastructure obtained a 
      robustness, security and convenience that allows employees to access 
      smoothly from anywhere and on any devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ITOCHU is leading trade conglomerate with approximately 130 bases in 67 
      countries and over $50 billion in revenue. ITOCHU engages in a wide 
      range of industries, including&#160;textile, machinery, metals, minerals, 
      energy, chemicals, food, information and communications technology, 
      realty, general products, insurance, logistics services, construction 
      and finance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commencing in June, ITOCHU began using the Lync Online unified 
      communication application, the Yammer internal SNS application and the 
      SharePoint Online internal and external information sharing and 
      management application, and from this month it has begun using Microsoft 
      Exchange Server and Microsoft Exchange Online mailer and scheduler. Some 
      6,000 IDs have been issued to ITOCHU&#8217;s workforce to date. Additional 
      applications and services are being assessed at this time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Exchange Server and Exchange Online, both of which require high security 
      and flexibility, will be available principally from a private cloud 
      created with NTT Com&#8217;s Enterprise Cloud, as well as from a public cloud 
      using Office 365 as backup, helping to realize an extra convenient and 
      robust communications environment. Mail is transferred to Office 365 in 
      real time, which would enable ITOCHU to use this backup data for 
      business continuity in the event of a disaster.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ITOCHU, which emphasizes the individual potential of each employee, has 
      been a forerunner in creating advanced work environments for frontline 
      employees, ultimately for improved efficiency. Using next-generation ICT 
      infrastructure designed and constructed by NTT Com, ITOCHU employees are 
      now working in extra-efficient office environments worldwide, regardless 
      of location or type of device. Going forward, ITOCHU expects to achieve 
      greater worldwide competitiveness as a result of deploying its NTT 
      Com-provided global cloud environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Enterprise Cloud
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Enterprise 
      Cloud is provided from 11 bases in nine countries/regions globally. 
      ITOCHU uses Enterprise 
      Cloud as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) for its new integrated 
      mailer and scheduler.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About NTT Communications Corporation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      cloud services to optimize the information and communications technology 
      (ICT) environments of enterprises. These offerings are backed by the

			&#8220;Apple is a critical piece of the mobile payments jigsaw&#8221; &#8211; Steve 
      Perry, Chief Digital Officer, Visa Europe
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa today confirmed that it will&#160;support consumer payments with the 
      iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and Apple Watch. Participating&#160;financial 
      institutions, initially in the U.S. and eventually in other markets, 
      will be able to add&#160;Visa debit and&#160;credit cards&#160;to Apple Pay and enable 
      their customers to&#160;make easy and secure purchases at select merchants 
      both in stores&#160;and in apps.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Steve Perry, Chief Digital Officer at Visa Europe, commented: &#8220;Apple&#8217;s 
      entry to the market represents a critical piece of the mobile payments 
      jigsaw. This is a pivotal moment for digital payments and one that 
      demonstrates the momentum behind mobile and contactless services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa Europe has led the rollout of NFC and mobile payments ever since 
      we launched the first contactless cards and terminals in 2007. Today 
      there are more than 1.5 million Visa contactless terminals in stores 
      across Europe &#8211; all ready to take mobile payments. Apple&#8217;s decision to 
      enter the market reflects the scale of opportunity that exists in 
      digital payments today. Its support will drive awareness and usage of 
      contactless services around the world &#8211; we anticipate a &#8220;halo effect&#8221; 
      that will benefit all players in the mobile payments ecosystem.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are working closely with Apple and with our member banks to bring 
      this new service to market in Europe.&#8221;

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to JPMCC 2014-FL5
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. (KBRA) is pleased to announce the 
      assignment of preliminary ratings to 21 classes of JPMCC 2014-FL5, a 
      $671.3 million large loan floating rate CMBS transaction (see ratings 
      listed below).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The collateral for the transaction consists of ten first-lien mortgage 
      loans, with eight loans (92.4%) secured by hospitality properties and 
      the remaining loans (7.6%) secured by office properties. Nine (96.9%) of 
      the ten loans have been participated into a pooled component and a 
      non-pooled component, which total $516.7 million and $154.6 million, 
      respectively. Each non-pooled loan component serves as the sole source 
      of cash flow for a loan-specific class of certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction involved a detailed evaluation of the 
      underlying cash flows using our CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines and 
      the application of our CMBS Single-Borrower  Large Loan Rating 
      Methodology. The results of the analysis yielded KNCF for the underlying 
      collateral properties that was, on average, 3.1% less than issuer cash 
      flow. KBRA applied our stressed capitalization rates to KNCF to arrive 
      at valuations of the underlying properties. The KBRA values were, on 
      average, 41.7% less than the appraiser&#8217;s as-is valuation. The resulting 
      KBRA in-trust Loan to Value (KLTV) was 78.8%. Six loans (52.0%) have 
      additional financing in the form of mezzanine debt and three loans 
      (27.1%) have subordinate B-notes in place. The weighted average all-in

      Visa and Apple Opening a New Era of Payments on Mobile Devices
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Visa Token Service facilitates secure consumer payments with new 
      Apple devices;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Service to be available to all U.S. financial institutions starting 
      in the fourth quarter of 2014
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), the global leader in payments, today announced 
      it&#160;is&#160;supporting consumer payments with the new iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus 
      and Apple Watch. Thanks to a new capability&#160;called Visa Token&#160;Service, 
      participating&#160;financial institutions in the U.S., and eventually abroad, 
      will be able to add&#160;Visa debit and&#160;credit cards&#160;to Apple Pay, Apple&#8217;s 
      new payment service, and enable their customers to&#160;make easy and secure 
      purchases at select U.S. merchants both in stores&#160;and in apps.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa&#160;Token Service technology works by replacing sensitive payment 
      account&#160;information found on plastic cards&#160;with a digital account number 
      or &#8220;token&#8221; that&#160;can be safely stored on mobile devices and used for in 
      store and in app&#160;purchases. Visa will roll out the service to financial 
      institutions in phases&#160;-- initially supporting early participants&#160;in the 
      Apple Pay launch, and then extending the&#160;service availability to all of 
      its U.S. clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Combining the trust, scale and security of&#160;Visa payments with Apple Pay 
      will accelerate adoption of mobile&#160;payments,&#8221;&#160;said Charlie Scharf, Chief 
      Executive Officer, Visa Inc. &#8220;We said from the beginning that token 
      services would&#160;provide&#160;great new consumer and merchant experiences, and 
      you&#8217;re seeing it today in our efforts with Apple, and there&#8217;s more to 
      come.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Apple Pay lets you&#160;make purchases in&#160;some of the most highly visited 
      stores and within apps on the App Store&#160;with&#160;just the touch of a finger, 
      using the new iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch. Visa account 
      holders&#160;will continue to receive all of the rewards,&#160;benefits and 
      security offered&#160;by Visa credit and debit cards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By enabling Visa account holders to also&#160;make purchases in store and in 
      app with their new iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch,&#160;consumers 
      will&#160;now have a seamless experience with their preferred form of payment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The combination of new digital experiences&#160;from Apple with new network 
      capabilities from Visa provides for great&#160;payment experiences&#160;and 
      enhanced security for millions of Visa account holders, merchants 
      and&#160;financial institutions,&#8221; said&#160;Scharf.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CyberSource&#160;and&#160;Authorize.Net, two Visa-owned payment platforms, have 
      also integrated with&#160;Apple Pay, providing&#160;online merchants with payment 
      management solutions and supporting them to securely&#160;accept in app 
      payments from the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch.

      Visa Launches Innovative Token Service
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Creates secure environment to help accelerate innovation in ecommerce 
      and mobile payments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), the global leader in payments, today announced the 
      launch of Visa Token Service &#8211; an innovative technology that provides a 
      secure environment to help drive innovation in online and mobile 
      commerce.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Token Service replaces sensitive payment account information found 
      on plastic cards with a digital account number or &#8220;token&#8221;. Because 
      &#8220;tokens&#8221; do not carry a consumer&#8217;s payment account details, such as the 
      16-digit account number, they can be safely stored by online merchants 
      or on mobile devices to facilitate ecommerce and mobile payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;When you make the payment environment safer, you open up a world of 
      possibilities where commerce can take place in different forms and 
      consumers can shop anywhere, on any device, with confidence,&#8221; said 
      Charlie Scharf, Chief Executive Officer, Visa Inc. &#8220;Visa Token Service 
      is yet another example of where we have opened up our network to create 
      meaningful solutions in the form of new standards, tools and services 
      that can enable digital payment experiences that are both engaging and 
      secure.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Token Service will be available to Visa Inc. issuing financial 
      institutions globally, starting with U.S. financial institutions next 
      month, and followed by a phased roll-out overseas beginning in 2015. The 
      technology has been designed to support payments with mobile devices 
      using all major mobile platforms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Over the past year, Visa has led the global payments industry in the 
      development of new payments standards and services designed to protect 
      consumers&#8217; account information when shopping online and with mobile 
      devices,&#8221; said Ryan McInerney, President, Visa Inc. &#8220;More than 750 staff 
      from across the Visa organization globally were involved in the effort, 
      working closely with our initial launch partners - financial 
      institutions, merchants and processors - to ensure the ecosystem was 
      ready. Today, we are making these services available to our clients, and 
      believe it will help transform connected devices and wearables into 
      secure payment vehicles.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Technology That Drives Industry Innovation and Protects Consumers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Token Service provides a seamless experience for consumers making 
      purchases online and with mobile devices, while preserving the integrity 
      of the Visa payment transaction. Key benefits of Visa Token Service 
      include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Consumer Protection: Tokens replace the 16-digit account 
        information found on plastic cards with a numeric substitute. This new 
        identifier is called a digital account number and it can facilitate 
        payment transactions without sharing sensitive personal account 
        information.
      
			
				Customized Usage: Tokens can be limited to specific merchants, 
        mobile devices or types of purchases &#8211; providing another form of 
        innovation and security.
      
			
				Convenience and Cost Effectiveness: Tokens linked to lost or 
        stolen mobile devices can be instantly reissued without changing 
        account numbers or reissuing plastic cards.
      
			
				Easy Processing: Tokens are based on existing International 
        Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards and can therefore be 
        processed and routed by merchants, acquirers and issuers like 
        traditional card payments.

      Market 2014-2018 - Key Vendors are CA Technologies, HP Co, Microsoft  
      Oracle
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/gmt3bh/global_project) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Project and Portfolio Management Software Market 2014-2018" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global PPM software market to grow at a CAGR of 11.25 percent over 
      the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It presents the vendor landscape and a corresponding detailed analysis 
      of the top four vendors in the market. The report describes the size of 
      the market based on the total software revenue, which is generated from 
      the issue of new licenses, installations, updates, and subscriptions. It 
      excludes the revenue from professional services and sales of hardware. 
      In addition, the report discusses the major drivers that influence the 
      growth of the Global PPM Software market. It also outlines the 
      challenges faced by the vendors and the market at large, as well as the 
      key trends emerging in the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One major emerging trend in the market is the shift toward agile project 
      management. Many vendors in the market have started offering PPM 
      software, integrating agile project management methods, which are 
      currently popular.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers in this market is the need for business 
      optimization. The deployment of PPM software helps organizations improve 
      efficiency and productivity, which helps them meet their business 
      demands quickly and remain competitive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that a major challenge that the market faces 
      is deployment and usage issues related to PPM software. Companies 
      sometimes are unable to properly use PPM software. Enterprises need to 
      get involved with vendors to solve any business problems and test the 
      software.

      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Custom Application Development Services Market 2014-2018" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Custom Application Development Services market to grow at a 
      CAGR of 5.18% over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand for cloud-based services in the market has increased. Advantages 
      of these services include low cost, faster deployment rates, and ease of 
      installation. Increased demand for mobile applications because of a 
      change in the working environment of many organizations is expected to 
      drive the growth of the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one major driver in this market is the need for 
      enhanced business productivity. Custom application development services 
      help organizations increase the efficiency of their business processes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the market is facing issues related to 
      integration with existing legacy systems. The integration of new custom 
      applications with existing legacy systems is an irritant to most 
      organizations in the market. Lack of sound understanding of the existing 
      systems has been a nagging issue for the vendors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/tp7q3d/application) 
      has announced the addition of the "Application 
      Management Services Market in the US 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Application Management Services Market in the US to grow at a CAGR 
      of 5.35% over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the 
      Application Management Services market in the US for the period 
      2014-2018. To calculate the market size, the report considers the 
      revenue generated through the issue of enterprise business services, 
      software, subscription, support and maintenance, and updates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the predominant trends in this market is increased demand for 
      outsourcing. Many organizations have adopted application management 
      services to improve the prospects and revenue of the business as well as 
      reducing the costs, so organizations follows the outsourcing of 
      processes to a team of specialists to manage and decrease operational 
      costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One major driver of the market is the need to improve service quality to 
      maintain customer-supplier relationships. Application management 
      services enable centralized management of enterprise data, which 
      improves the decision-making process of an organization and its overall 
      performance. These services enhance the service quality of an 
      organization, which drives efficiency, enables business growth, improves 
      core processes, boosts performance, and helps an organization gain 
      competitive advantages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one major challenge that the market 
      faces is the complexity involved maintaining applications as they need 
      to be updated/changed as per business needs.

			Medimaps Group appoints General Electric Healthcare as Global 
      Distribution Partner for TBS iNsight&#174; &#8211; a Novel 
      Osteoporotic Fracture Assessment Diagnostic Tool
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Medimaps Group announced today that
			a novel method for improving 
      osteoporotic fracture risk assessment, TBS iNsight&#174;, is now 
      globally available to clinicians through a distribution partnership with 
      General Electric Healthcare (NYSE: GE). GE Healthcare provides 
      transformational medical technologies and services to meet the demand 
      for increased access, enhanced quality and more affordable healthcare 
      around the world and is the market leader in the development and 
      manufacture of Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) bone densitometry 
      systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On June 10, 2014, Medimaps Group &#8211; developers of the TBS iNsight&#174; 
      diagnostic tool &#8211; and General Electric Healthcare have signed a 
      distribution agreement to distribute TBS iNsight&#174; on a global 
      basis leveraging GE Healthcare&#8217;s extensive direct sales and distribution 
      organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TBS iNsight&#174; is a unique, easy-to-use software application 
      that assesses bone texture - an index of bone microarchitecture &#8211; which 
      in turn is expressed as the Trabecular Bone Score (TBS). The measurement 
      is performed seamlessly using DXA images acquired from a bone mineral 
      densitometry (BMD) scan. No&#160;additional patient scan time or radiation 
      exposure is required and results are easily interpreted by physicians to 
      enable them to better manage patients with high risk of fractures. TBS 
      iNsight&#174; has been cleared for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prof. Didier Hans, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Medimaps 
      Group states; &#8220;It is well documented that 40-50% of osteoporotic 
      fracture occurs in patients who are not determined to be osteoporotic by 
      BMD alone, yet BMD remains the only diagnostic method available to most 
      clinicians. A significant body of literature, including a recent study 
      of over 29,000 women, has demonstrated that TBS, when combined with hip 
      and/or spine BMD and FRAX&#174; clinical factors, can help improve 
      the prediction of future osteoporotic fracture risk in a clinically 
      meaningful way. We&#8217;re very pleased to partner with General Electric 
      Healthcare to bring this valuable new predictive tool for better 
      management of osteoporotic patients across the globe.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley, the
largest U.S. securities brokerage by sales force, hired
top-producing financial adviser Peter Risch away from JP Morgan
Securities in Columbus, Ohio, according to Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risch joined Morgan Stanley just before the Labor Day
holiday from JP Morgan, a division of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At JP Morgan, he produced $2 million in revenue in the last
year and managed $250 million in client assets, according to a
source familiar with the hire who did not have permission to
speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JP Morgan spokeswoman confirmed that the broker had worked
there but declined to comment on his departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley did not respond to requests for comment on
Risch's hire. The company does not always publicly announce new
hires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Reuters records of Morgan Stanley's recent hires
show several high-producing brokers joined Morgan Stanley in
late August. Including Risch, the company hired seven brokers
who managed a combined $1.9 billion and produced $9.5 million in
annual revenue at their previous employers, according to Reuters
records of Morgan Stanley hires.

			Walter Reed Bethesda Joins Novilase Clinical Trial
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Groundbreaking Study of Laser Treatment for Breast Cancer Now Has 11 
      Active Trial Sites in United States and United Kingdom
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novian Health, developer of Novilase&#174; Breast Therapy, announced today 
      that Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (Bethesda, Md.) is now 
      a participating study site in the BR-002 Novilase 
      Clinical Trial. The multi-center study is evaluating the 
      effectiveness of Novilase Breast Therapy as an alternative to lumpectomy 
      surgery for the treatment of small, early-stage breast cancers. Novian 
      Health has already received FDA clearance for&#160;the use of Novilase Breast 
      Therapy as an alternative to surgery for the treatment of benign breast 
      tumors (fibroadenomas).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Patients appreciate taking part in this clinical trial because they 
      know they&#8217;re contributing to the possible improvement of breast cancer 
      treatment in the future,&#8221; said Barbara Schwartzberg, M.D. &#8220;Because our 
      enrollees have stepped forward, women someday may be able have their 
      tumors treated as a convenient outpatient procedure, instead of an 
      invasive surgery with anesthesia and a long recuperation."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. Schwartzberg is principal investigator of the BR-002 Novilase 
      Clinical Trial. She is also the principal investigator at Rose 
      Medical Center (Denver, Col.), one of the 11 breast centers in the 
      BR-002 breast cancer study.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Known as &#8220;the Nation&#8217;s Medical Center,&#8221; Walter Reed National Military 
      Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland serves military families, active 
      duty personnel, returning war heroes, veterans, and the nation&#8217;s leaders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Col. Craig D. Shriver, M.D., U.S. Army, is the principal investigator 
      for the BR-002 Novilase Clinical Trial at Walter Reed, where he directs 
      the institution&#8217;s Murtha Cancer Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to Walter Reed, ten other sites have been enrolling patients 
      for the early-stage breast cancer study. The sites include:

		&lt;p&gt;
      Novilase Breast Therapy is an image-guided, minimally invasive 
      alternative for lumpectomy that uses heat from a laser to ablate 
      (destroy) small breast tumors. The BR-002 Novilase Clinical Trial is 
      evaluating the rate of complete tumor ablation of breast cancers that 
      are up to 2 centimeters. It is also examining the correlation of the 
      pathology of post-ablation lumpectomy specimens with MRI, ultrasound and 
      mammography in detecting any residual tumor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If the multi-center trial and subsequent trials are successful, Novilase 
      Breast Therapy may provide women who have early-stage breast cancer with 
      a treatment option that has several potential advantages, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Fewer re-treatments or repeat surgeries
      
			
        Minimal scarring or changes in the contour of breast tissue
      
			
        Less risk of infection
      
			
        Shorter recovery time and quicker return to normal activities
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novilase Breast Therapy does not preclude any additional treatment, if 
      necessary. For example, radiation therapy, systemic adjuvant therapy, or 
      any other treatment that is medically indicated can still be used.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Sep 9, 2014) -  J.P. Morgan is No. 1 on the All-America Fixed-Income Research Team, Institutional Investor's annual ranking of the nation's best sell-side bond and credit analysts, for a fifth consecutive year.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Complete results can be found at www.institutionalinvestor.com. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan researchers appear in 48 of the 55 categories that produced publishable results&#160;--&#160;and nearly half of this year's total, 23, are for analysts and teams deemed the best in their respective sectors.

			&lt;p&gt;In second place for a third straight year is Bank of America Merrill Lynch, with 41 spots, followed by Barclays at No. 3, with 30. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The sectors are grouped into three broad areas of coverage: Economics  Strategy, High Yield and Investment Grade. When the results of each category are viewed independently, J.P.

      at a CAGR of 4.77% over the period 2013-2018.

      Application outsourcing is the process of arranging a wide variety of 
      application services, including new application development and 
      maintenance and management of packaged applications from an external 
      provider. Application outsourcing helps in lowering the total cost of 
      ownership and expanding geographical reach while leveraging technology. 
      It comes into play when increasingly complex banking systems and rapid 
      adoption of changing technology make it difficult and exorbitant to 
      manage and maintain the applications that support business needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Application Outsourcing market in the Banking sector can be 
      segmented into three divisions: Application Development and Maintenance, 
      Independent Software Testing, and Other Services. This report covers 
      information about the market share of the Global Application Outsourcing 
      market in the Banking sector by application.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report, the Global Application Outsourcing Market in the Banking 
      Sector 2014-2018, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis 
      with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the Americas and

      Research and Markets: Global Infectious Disease Treatment Market

      JJ Merck  Pfizer
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4kmzqk/global_infectious) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Infectious Disease Treatment Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Infectious Disease Treatment market to 
      grow at a CAGR of 3.43% over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Infectious diseases can be caused by various pathogenic microorganisms 
      such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, or viruses. These diseases can be 
      transmitted from one individual to another through either direct contact 
      or indirect contact. Anti-infective drugs are used to kill (cidal) or 
      stop the growth (static) of infectious agents. Based on the target 
      organism, anti-infective drugs can be categorized into antibacterial, 
      antiviral, antifungal, and antiparasitic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the emerging trends in this market is the emergence of 
      Interferon-free regimens. Various all-oral, IFN-free regimens are under 
      development and are expected to attain higher sustained virologic 
      response and cause fewer side effects than the currently approved 
      therapies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the launch of Direct-acting Antivirals is one 
      of the major drivers for the Global Infectious Disease Treatment market. 
      DAAs are administered in combination with other antiviral drugs such as 
      ribavirin and PEG-IFN and increase the efficacy of treatment and 
      decrease the duration of therapy and this leads to increased preference 
      for this treatment among patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that a generic erosion of marketed drugs is 
      one of the major challenges faced by the market. A loss of patent 
      protection and market exclusivity generally triggers the entry of 
      low-cost alternatives for drugs, which, in turn, decreases the sales of 
      innovator-approved drugs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue 
      generated through the sales of various drugs administered to treat 
      various infectious diseases caused by bacteria, virus, fungi, and 
      parasites, which include:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Antibacterial drugs (beta-lactams, macrolides, aminoglycosides, 
        phenicols, quinolones, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and other 
        antibacterials)
      
			
        Antiviral drugs (HIV, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and other antivirals)
      
			
        Antifungal drugs (azoles, pyrimidines, echinodians, polyenes, 
        allylamines, and other antifungal drugs)

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's Grupo Salinas said on Wednesday its chairman will buy out its partner Grupo Televisa's (TLVACPO.MX) 50 percent stake in the country's No. 3 wireless operator Iusacell for $717 million and seek a strategic partner to build up the carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa said separately it will make a book loss of around $320 million on the sale. It had already written down the bulk of what is a nearly $900 million loss on its original purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buyout, which is subject to regulatory approval,  effectively reverses a deal approved two years ago after Televisa fought regulators for 14 months to be able to buy half the company for $1.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's notoriously concentrated telecoms and broadcast sectors are in a period of flux after the government pushed through a major reform this year to try and foster competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Carlos Slim's America Movil (AMXL.MX) has said it would sell off some assets in order to reach below 50 percent market share in Mexican telecoms, after it was deemed a dominant market player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC) said in July it was in talks over a possible deal in Mexico, with sources saying it was targeting Iusacell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grupo Salinas spokesman Luis Nino de Rivera said the idea would be for billionaire owner Ricardo Salinas' future partner to take an equity stake in Iusacell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking at all those interested in Mexico," Nino de Rivera told Reuters when asked if Telefonica was a candidate for strategic partner. He said around four or five companies were interested.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months, Televisa has been turning its attention to the cable television market, where in August it paid $654 million for the rest of Cablecom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a pretty tough blow for Televisa," said Jose Otero, president of Signal Telecoms Consulting, saying that Televisa's remaining options to break into mobile were an alliance with the likes of Telefonica or starting a Mexican mobile virtual network operator (MVNO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salinas had said via Twitter in late July that the company's stake in Iusacell was not for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grupo Iusacell comprises two brands, Iusacell and Unefon. Some 25 percent of Iusacell's subscribers are post-paid subscriptions with higher income users, while Unefon serves the lower end of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, around 14 percent of America Movil's subscribers in Mexico are post-paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Simon Gardner, Tom Brown and Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&#8212;To look for a strategic partner to further boost the company's solid growth&#8212;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&#8212;Grupo Iusacell will take advantage of extensive market opportunities made possible by new telecommunications legal framework in Mexico&#8212;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	MEXICO CITY, Sept. 10, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grupo Salinas (www.gruposalinas.com), a group of dynamic, fast-growing and technologically advanced companies, deeply committed to the modernization of the countries in which it operates, announces today that its Chairman, Ricardo B. Salinas, will buy 50% of the shares of Grupo Iusacell from Grupo Televisa, for US$717 million. With this transaction, Mr. Salinas will fully own the equity of Grupo Iusacell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ricardo Salinas thanks the trust and support of Grupo Televisa during these past three years of partnership. "I express my recognition and gratitude to President and CEO of Grupo Televisa, Emilio Azcarraga, and his executive team for the administrative talent that resulted in solid added value for the development of the company and for furthering competition in the telecommunications sector".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mr. Salinas is in the process of selecting a world-class strategic partner to strengthen the robust performance of the company and jointly boost the most competitive telecommunications offer in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Grupo Iusacell is currently the most dynamic telecommunications operator in the country; in the last three years, it doubled its customer base to 8 million today, and increased its revenue by approximately 50%, based on core strengths of the company that has allowed to outperform its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	By means of its two widely recognized brands, Iusacell and Unefon, the company attacks different parts of the market to maximize growth; with the Iusacell brand, 25% of its subscribers are postpaid users, with higher income and superior loyalty, while the Unefon brand serves the mass market with low-cost value oriented offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	With its spectrum, the company has coverage throughout the country, and a fiber optic network with a dense urban deployment in large cities that allows maximum data transmission speed. With its commercial network comprised of more than 550 Iusacell branded points of sales across Mexico, the company provides timely, top quality customer service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The recently approved legal framework in Mexico favors competition, thanks to access to the preponderant's infrastructure, asymmetric interconnection, national roaming at a regulated price, and the unblocking of prepaid terminals that allows users to switch companies, without the subsidy cost to the new operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Under the new rules, Grupo Iusacell will deploy its commercial and technology infrastructure to more markets in Mexico. This, together with the most innovative plans and high-tech equipment, generates continuing opportunities for the company's expansion, in one of the top ten global markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The purchase of shares of Grupo Iusacell represents a vote of confidence by Ricardo Salinas in the growth perspective of the company, as well as in the Mexican economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Grupo Salinas believes that the purchase of shares of Grupo Iusacell, under the proposed terms, further strengthens the leading telecommunications service, with superior technology platforms in benefit of millions of families and companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The transaction is subject to the authorization of the Federal Telecommunications Institute of Mexico and the opinion of the Ministry of Communications and Transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Alison Frankel&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When my whip-smart Reuters colleague Dan Levine noticed Tuesday that George Riley and several other lawyers from OMelveny  Myers had entered appearances as defense counsel for Samsung in its month-old dispute with Microsoft over allegedly unpaid patent royalties, my immediate thought was that OMelvenys new assignment was another sign of the waning tensions between Apple and the South Korean electronics company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OMelveny, after all, regularly represents Apple and has done so since Steve Jobs 1997 return to the company he founded. Riley was a close friend and adviser to Jobs and has appeared for Apple in everything from patent litigation and securities cases to the no-poaching antitrust collusion suit underway in federal court in San Jose, California. Apple and Samsung, as all the world knows, have been at each others throats in global smartphone litigation for the past four or five years, but the two companies called a partial truce in August, when they agreed to drop all of their patent litigation against one another in jurisdictions outside of the United States. I figured that OMelveny wouldnt have agreed to defend Samsung against Microsofts royalties claims if Apple hadnt blessed the assignment, reflecting Apples recent overseas detente with Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have jumped to the wrong conclusion. OMelveny declined to comment on its client relationships, but the public record shows that the firm has been representing Samsung for years  even in patent litigation over component smartphone parts and even as OMelveny counseled Apple in the smartphone wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, after all, was a supplier of memory chips and graphics components before it started making and selling devices that compete with Apple iPhones and iPads. Apple, in fact, was a major Samsung customer. OMelvenys work for Samsung, which dates back to at least 2008, even includes patent infringement cases in which Samsung and Apple were co-defendants. Only after I saw the extent of OMelvenys relationship with Samsung did I understand why Riley and his OMelveny partners havent represented Apple in its patent litigation against the Korean company; the firm was obviously conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its presumably clear to defend Samsung against Microsofts breach-of-contract allegations in Manhattan federal district court, even though Microsoft and Apple have (broadly speaking) been allied in protesting supposedly unwarranted patent licensing demands for essential smart device components. Defending Samsung doesnt seem to raise any positional conflict concerns since Microsofts suit raises highly specific claims about Samsung payments based on licensing agreements between the two companies and Nokia, the handset maker Microsoft agreed to acquire last fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than proof of burgeoning cooperation between Apple and Samsung, OMelvenys new assignment is yet another example of the delicate balancing act required of law firms that represent global technology conglomerates whose alliances may shift from case to case. Sometimes Apple and Samsung are co-defendants; sometimes theyre the most bitter of enemies. Sometimes Microsoft and Apple are allies; sometimes theyre suing each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech engagements arent as plentiful as they were in the smartphone wars, when Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Motorola and other smart device companies deployed elite IP cadres to courthouses and regulatory agencies across the United States, Europe and beyond. As Ive said before, it took years of fighting and untold tens (if not hundreds) of millions of dollars in legal fees for all concerned to realize that patent litigation is not a viable strategy for global domination of the smartphone market. So its all the more important for firms like OMelveny to maintain solid ties with clients they represented before the smartphone wars began  which, in OMelvenys case, means both Apple and Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANNAPOLIS Md. (Reuters) - A Maryland man alleged to have cocaine on his face and clothes and be driving while drunk was arrested after he told an officer he thought he was in Chicago, a Maryland State Police spokesman said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artis Ray Gordon, 69, of Baltimore, was arrested on Friday night when a state trooper responded to a car accident outside of Baltimore, the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trooper found Gordon sitting behind the wheel of his car with the engine running. He noticed "a trail of a white powdery substance, suspected cocaine, on his nose and around his nostrils, around his mouth and chin, on the front of his shirt and the front of his pants," according to charging documents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordon's speech was slurred and he appeared disoriented, the documents said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gordon told me he lives in Chicago and was on his way home when he got lost," the trooper's report said. "Gordon stated he thought he was still in Chicago and wasn't sure how to get home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordon was carrying a vial with a substance that later tested positive for cocaine. He faces drug, alcohol and traffic charges and is being held without bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by John Clarke; Editing by Ian Simpson and James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Series 4474 Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4474 'AA+/F1'; Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA+', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4474 
      PUTTERs and series 4474 DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch has 
      assigned to the City of Orlando, Florida Contract Tourist Development 
      Tax Payments Revenue Bonds, Series 2014A (rated 'AA+', Stable Outlook) 
      that have been deposited in the series 4474 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4474 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (rated 
      'A+/F1', Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on June 1, 2015, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, 
      unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday revived part of a patent lawsuit brought by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen against AOL, Apple, Google and Yahoo, saying a lower court incorrectly found that the tech companies didn't infringe one of its patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent, held by Allen's Interval Licensing, relates to the ubiquitous pop-ups that computer users routinely see while surfing the Web or shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said that Chief Judge Marsha Pechman of the federal district court in Seattle had made an "erroneous" interpretation of the patent in 2013 and it sent the case back to her for further hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Circuit Judge Raymond Chen agreed with Pechman for invalidating certain claims made over the same Interval patent, and a second one, declaring them too ambiguous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval Licensing is the patent-licensing arm of a Silicon Valley research entity that Allen financed, Interval Research Corp, which shut down in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval Licensing sued the tech companies in 2010 for allegedly infringing four of its patents, although only two became the subject of the appeal. It said they infringed the patents through products and software that use pop-up notifications, court documents said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Interval could not immediately be reached for comment. Nor could attorneys for the defendants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen and partner David Liddle founded Interval Research in 1992. It employed over 110 scientists and engineers and was granted 300 patents during its existence, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Interval Licensing v. Aol Inc, Apple Inc, Google Inc, and Yahoo! Inc, U.s. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Nos, 2013-1282, -1283, -1284 and -1285. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting By Andrew Chung' editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

			About The William J. Gies Foundation: The William J. Gies 
      (pronounced guys) Foundation was established in 1950 by 
      colleagues and admirers of Dr. Gies with seed funds raised by the 
      American College of Dentists. It was a private foundation and the first 
      U.S. foundation to support dental education and scholarship. In 2002, 
      The William J. Gies Foundation joined with the American Dental Education 
      Association (ADEA) to form ADEAGies Foundation, a public foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About William J. Gies and the Gies Report: William Gies was a 
      Columbia University biochemistry professor and founder of the College of 
      Dental Medicine at Columbia University where he was interested in dental 
      education, science and clinical applications. In 1926, as part of a 
      series of studies on U.S. professional education, funded by the Carnegie 
      Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Dr. Gies published a 
      landmark report that established the importance of dentistry as a 
      healing science and an essential component of higher education in the 
      health professions. The Gies Report, Dental Education in the United 
      States and Canada, which took five years to research and write, 
      consists of 250 pages of text and more than 400 pages of appendices, 
      including lengthy descriptions and evaluations of the existing dental 
      schools, each of which Dr. Gies visited. Since the Gies Report, there 
      have been many other reports on dental education in the context of 
      health professions education. However, Dental Education in the United 
      States and Canada remains to this day the most relevant survey of 
      dental education and critical issues within the field.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Kroger Co has been a
strong performer in 2014, rising almost 31 percent year-to-date,
but Goldman Sachs thinks investors are underestimating the
grocery-store chain and recommends buying calls in the company
ahead of its results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman analyst Stephen Grambling expects the company to
raise its full-year profit outlook when it reports results on
Sept. 11. His forecast for Kroger's earnings in the current
quarter are also ahead of consensus expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past eight quarters, Kroger shares moved an average
of 4.2 percent in the seven sessions following the release of
its earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This quarter," Goldman wrote, "options are implying a
+/-3.8 percent move, despite our analyst's view that Kroger
results could surprise by 7 percent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broker recommended calls for investors who "would like
to lock in these strong gains [over the past 12 months] but
still participate if there is further upside potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroger's September $52.50 calls suggest "that calls
underprice the potential for shares to trade higher on results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Kroger closed Tuesday at $51.74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futures snapshot at 8:20 a.m. (1230 GMT):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S 500 e-minis are down 1 point, or 0.05 percent,
with 186,257 contracts changing hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Nasdaq 100 e-minis are down 2 points, or 0.05
percent, in volume of 28,378 contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow e-minis are down 3 points, or 0.02 percent,
with 27,280 contracts changing hands.

      Fitch to Rate JPMBB 2014-C23 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
      Certificates; Presale Issued
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on J.P. Morgan Chase 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust's JPMBB 2014-C23 commercial 
      mortgage pass-through certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$49,525,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      --$15,251,000ac class X-D 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (a) Notional amount and interest only.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (b) Class A-S, class B, and class C certificates may be exchanged for a 
      related amount of class EC certificates, and class EC certificates may 
      be exchanged for class A-S, class B, and class C certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (c) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Sept. 10, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $62,697,834 class 
      NR, or the $62,697,834 interest only class X-E. Fitch does not expect to 
      rate the $12,257,000 class UH5, which will only receive distributions 
      from, and will only incur losses with respect to, the non-pooled 
      component of the U-Haul Self-Storage Portfolio mortgage loan. Fitch does 
      not expect to rate the $10,500,000 class WYA, which will only receive 
      distributions from, and will only incur losses with respect to, the 
      non-pooled component of the Wyvernwood Apartments mortgage loan. Fitch 
      does not expect to rate the $15,000,000 class RIM, which will only 
      receive distributions from, and will only incur losses with respect to, 
      the non-pooled component of the Residence Inn Midtown East mortgage 
      loan. Such class will share in losses and shortfalls on the related 
      componentized mortgage loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 65 loans secured by 101 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.36 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association; Barclays Bank PLC; Redwood 
      Commercial Mortgage Corporation; MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage 
      Finance, LLC; General Electric Capital Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 68.4% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis on 82%, and asset summary reviews on 82% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.11x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 110.8%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 8.6%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 9% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher Leverage than Recent Transactions: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV 
      are 1.11x and 110%, respectively, which is worse than the first-half 
      2014 and 2013 averages of 1.19x and 105.6% and 1.29x and 101.6%, 
      respectively. However, two top 10 loans with above-average LTVs are 
      secured by high-quality, strong performing retail properties located in 
      New York City and Los Angeles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Limited Amortization: 20.9% of the pool is full-term interest-only, 
      53.3% of the pool is partial term interest-only, and 1.64% of the pool 
      is fully amortizing. The remainder of the pool (28 loans, 24.1%) 
      consists of amortizing balloon loans with loan terms of five to 10 
      years. Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, the pool will have 
      paid down 10.4%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit Opinion Loan: The fourth largest loan in the pool, Grapevine 
      Mills (5.9%), has a Fitch credit opinion of 'BBB-sf' on a stand-alone 
      basis. The loan is collateralized by a 1.6 million-sf regional shopping 
      center located in Grapevine, TX
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.45% below the 
      most recent NOI (for properties that a recent NOI was provided, 
      excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). 
      Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and could result 
      in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the 
      sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMBB 2014-C23 certificates and 
      found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further 
      declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' 
      could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 
      30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 
      'BBB-sf' could result.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      rated 'CMS1-' by Fitch. The special servicer will be CWCapital Asset 
      Management, LLC, rated 'CSS1-' by Fitch.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp co-founder Paul Allen's charitable foundation on Thursday will announce it is donating $9 million to support U.S. efforts to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, a source familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gift to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) comes at a time when international groups, including Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization, have said resources to contain the epidemic and treat those affected are falling tragically short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen said the donation from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation will help CDC establish emergency operations centers in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed about 2,300 people and shows no sign of slowing six months after it began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The tragedy of Ebola is that we know how to tackle the disease, but the governments in West Africa are in dire need of more resources and solutions," Allen wrote in an essay scheduled to be posted on his blog. "The developed world needs to step up now with resources and solutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Allen's foundation donated $2.8 million to the American Red Cross for its work on the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation pledged $50 million to United Nations agencies and other international groups to purchase supplies, such as protective gear for healthcare workers treating Ebola patients, and to expand the emergency response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress for $88 million in new Ebola funding, including $25 million for CDC, but this week congressional leaders said they would provide no more than $40 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen said his foundation's gift would help CDC establish and equip emergency operations centers in the three most-affected countries, focusing on public health, not patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centers will use "data management and communication systems for disease and patient contact tracing, to detect and stop the disease from spreading," Allen wrote. They will also expand lab testing to identify new outbreaks, and disseminate information about the epidemic to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A winnable battle should never be lost," Allen wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC has just over 100 public health experts in the Ebola zone, and plans to send more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ebola is raging through parts of West Africa like an out-of-control forest fire but it can be controlled if the world comes together," CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a statement issued by the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC Foundation, which was established by Congress in 1994 to raise funding to augment what CDC gets from Congress, recently committed $1 million to the Ebola response, including money for computers, personal protective equipment and thermal scanning thermometers for airport screeners, and training for healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since resigning from Microsoft in 1983, Allen has become a prominent philanthropist, supporting scientific research through the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. He also owns the Seattle Seahawks football team and the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Sharon Begley)&lt;/p&gt;

			Visa Inc. Announces Decision to Fund Litigation Escrow Account
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) today announced it had decided to deposit $450 
      million (the &#8220;Loss Funds&#8221;) into the litigation escrow account previously 
      established under the Company&#8217;s retrospective responsibility plan (the 
      &#8220;Plan&#8221;). Under the terms of the Plan, when the Company funds the 
      litigation escrow account, the value of the Company&#8217;s Class B shares &#8211; 
      which are held exclusively by U.S. financial institutions and their 
      affiliates and successors &#8211; are subject to dilution through an 
      adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock 
      to shares of class A common stock. This has the same effect on earnings 
      per share as repurchasing the Company&#8217;s class A common stock, by 
      reducing the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted 
      class A common stock share count. The deposit of the Loss Funds will be 
      conducted in accordance with the Company&#8217;s certificate of incorporation 
      currently in effect.

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to JPMBB 2014-C23
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of 
      preliminary ratings to 17 classes of the JPMBB 
      2014-C23 transaction (see ratings below). JPMBB 2014-C23 is a $1.4

      commercial mortgage loans that are secured by 101 properties.

      The underlying collateral properties are located in 34 different states

      10.0% of the pool balance: New York (19.5%), California (18.3%), and 
      Texas (12.8%). There is exposure to all of the major property type 
      segments, with four that each account for over 15.0% of the pool: 
      multifamily (22.6%), office (18.7%), retail (17.0%), and lodging 
      (15.8%). The loans have principal balances ranging from $2.2 million to 
      $105.0 million for the largest loan in the pool, 17 State Street (7.7%), 
      a 560,210 sf, 42-story, Class-A office building located in the downtown 
      area of New York City&#8217;s Borough of Manhattan. The five largest loans, 
      which also include Columbus Square Portfolio (2nd largest, 
      7.7%), Wyvernwood Apartments (3rd largest, 7.6%), Grapevine 
      Mills (4th largest, 5.9%), and Stevens Center Business Park (5th 
      largest, 4.4%), represent 33.3% of the initial pool balance, while the 
      ten largest loans represent 50.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower 
      rating process that begins with our analysts' evaluation of underlying 
      collateral properties' financial and operating performance, which 
      determine KBRA&#8217;s estimate of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA 
      value using our CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines. On an aggregate 
      basis, KNCF was 4.9% less than the issuer cash flow. KBRA capitalization 
      rates were applied to each asset&#8217;s KNCF to derive values that were, on 
      an aggregate basis, 34.1% less than third party appraisal values. The 
      pool has an in-trust KLTV of 102.5% and an all-in KLTV of 112.9%. The 
      model deploys rent and occupancy stresses, probability of default 
      regressions, and loss given default calculations to determine losses for 
      each collateral loan, which are then used to assign our credit ratings.

			Quadrant Software Introduces Business i&#8482; for IBM i Business 
      Intelligence
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Solution set helps businesses make better decisions with self-serve 
      access to IBM i web reports and dashboards from any device.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Quadrant Software LLC., a leading provider of document 
      distribution and spool file beautification solutions, has announced the 
      release of their IBM i business intelligence (BI) solution set, Business 
      i.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Accessing and analyzing IBM i business data can be difficult and time 
      consuming for organizations because many users rely on overburdened IT 
      departments to run sales, inventory, A/R and other reports. Users rely 
      on this data to make decisions, which is difficult when the information 
      is outdated, incomplete or hard to access.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Many organizations have pieces of the business intelligence puzzle in 
      place, but disparate solutions don&#8217;t satisfy user requirements,&#8221; says 
      Steve Woodard, Quadrant LLC&#8217;s CEO. &#8220;Business i helps organizations 
      leverage their DB2 and other data, and maximize their investment in IBM 
      i. It&#8217;s a cohesive, IBM i-focused solution set that meets a wide variety 
      of BI requirements and eliminates the need to purchase solutions from 
      multiple vendors.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Business i empowers users to:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Create real-time web reports with minimal help from IT.
      
			
        Quickly find dashboards and reports in a secure, menu-driven portal.
      
			
        Extract and analyze data from virtually any computer-generated report.
      
			
        Transform data into the format they want (HTML, PDF, XLS and more).
      
			
        Access reports and charts 24/7 from PCs and mobile devices.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Business i is also quick to set up, so you can be up and running in 
      hours - not days or months. With Business i, users get the data they 
      need, when they need it, in the format they want.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Shares in Mexico's leading broadcaster, Grupo Televisa, fell on Thursday, a day after it said it would sell its stake in Iusacell, the country's No. 3 wireless operator, at a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa said after the markets closed on Wednesday it would sell back its 50 percent stake in Iusacell to Grupo Salinas for $717 million but will book a loss of about $320 million on the sale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa shares (TLVACPO.MX)(TV.N) shed 1 percent to 94.58 pesos in early trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broadcaster, which also is the country's top cable television provider, had already written down the bulk of what is a nearly $900 million loss on its original $1.6 billion investment in Iusacell, which has struggled to expand its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale, which is subject to regulatory approval, effectively reverses a deal approved two years ago after Televisa fought regulators for 14 months to be able to buy half of the company and gain a foothold in the mobile market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Carlos Slim's firms dominate Mexico's telecommunications market, but the sector could see a flurry of deals as regulators use a new law to try to foster greater competition and cut his back his share of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slim owns America Movil AMXL.MZ(AMX.N), the top mobile provider, and a Iusacell competitor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Williamsburg Area Learning Tree (WALT) Seminar on Real Estate in Williamsburg: Is It a Seller's or Buyer's Market?&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;WILLIAMSBURG, VA--(Marketwired - Sep 11, 2014) - &#160;The topsy-turvy state of the real estate market is a challenge to buyers and sellers and REALTOR Elaine VonCannon will be addressing this in an upcoming presentation: "Riding the Rollercoaster: Is it a Seller's Market or a Buyer's Market in Williamsburg, Virginia?" VonCannon's educational and informational seminar is open to the public and is sponsored by Williamsburg Area Learning Tree (WALT). It is scheduled for Wednesday October 8th from 6:30-7:30 p.m. at Walsingham Academy on Jamestown Road, in Williamsburg Virginia. Cost is $15. Seating is limited.&#160;Participants may register and pay for the WALT class online to ensure a seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Hurd, a Loan Officer with Movement Mortgage in York County, Virginia will be present to speak briefly about current trends in mortgage lending and answer questions.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaine VonCannon is an award winning REALTOR. She is an author and a regular guest on the radio show "Ask the Expert" on WNBG 740 am in Williamsburg, Virginia, which also streams on the Web. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Wilson, owner of the brokerage VonCannon works for, Coldwell Banker Traditions in Williamsburg, has assessed the local real estate market as follows: "Supply and demand dictates the market. The overall real estate market in Williamsburg, Virginia continues to struggle to get any appreciation and/or momentum. The homes on the market need to be turnkey, ready to go, and must be priced correctly.&#160;The sellers must be ready to beat the market with the condition of the home and be priced to compete. This is especially true for the upper end."&#160;There are still many distressed homes and foreclosed properties on the market, and coming onto the market regularly. This means that homeowners who want to list their property must make sure it is move in ready, because sellers have the option of buying bank owned 'fixer uppers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaine VonCannon also frequently presents information on the real estate market in the Williamsburg area with John Starke, a financial planner.&#160;VonCannon speaks at investment seminars Starke hosts.&#160;Her articles on real estate have been reprinted in national publications and she is recognized in the region as a reliable real estate expert, with her finger on the pulse of the market.&#160;VonCannon has been in the real estate profession for 15 years.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, Ohio, Sept. 11, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - EmpowerID, the leader in workflow-based Identity and Access Management (IAM), today announced the release of Office 365 Manager, a new module that enables organizations to extend their existing on-premise security and audit control model to the Microsoft Office 365 and Azure Active Directory Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations are rapidly adopting Microsoft Office 365 to streamline platform management, to boost user productivity and to reduce the cost of IT operations. Office 365, however, presents challenges for IT security professionals because it offers only basic audit controls and a limited ability to delegate administrative tasks. The release of EmpowerID's new Office 365 Manager provides organizations with the first and only Identity and Access Management solution that applies existing security practices for on-premise Active Directory and Exchange to the management of Office 365 in the Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Customers report that the key challenge to adopting Office 365 for their enterprises is the inability to provide the secure delegation and flexible administration that they use for their behind the firewall systems. Office 365 Manager addresses a key shortcoming of Office 365 which runs on Azure Active Directory and lacks a hierarchical structure that forces the placement of all users, groups, mailboxes and contacts in a single location. By extending the existing structure of a customer's on-premise Active Directory, LDAP, or HR system to Office 365, Office 365 Manager can securely delegate responsibilities by role, department, business unit and location. Office 365 Manager empowers users, reduces the workload on IT, and adds robust audit controls to the management of Office 365," said Patrick Parker, CEO of EmpowerID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	With Office 365 Manager's Single Sign-On capabilities, employees can continue to use their existing Active Directory username and password when logging in to Outlook, OWA, Lync, and SharePoint after they have been migrated to the Office 365 cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Top 10 features and benefits in EmpowerID's new Office 365 Manager:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	1. Role-Based Delegated Administration to Reduce IT Staff Workload&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	2. Automated Provisioning and Sync for Better Productivity and Security&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	3. Dynamic Group Management for Improved Group Security&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	4. Single Sign-On for Ease of Use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	5. Multi-Factor Authentication for Improved Access Security&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	6. Mobile Device Security (BYOD) To Properly Secure Mobile Device Access&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	7. Self-Service Password Management to Reduce Help Desk Workload&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	8. Shopping Cart Style Self-Service to Automate Request Fulfillment and Audit Tracking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	9. Access Recertification and Audit Reporting For Better Access Governance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	10. Mailbox and Folder Permission Audit, Management, and Self-Service For Improved Productivity and Governance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	EmpowerID's Office 365 Manager flexibility sets a new standard for creating a seamless user experience for employees, IT staff and auditors seeking a consistent method for accessing and managing Office 365. It can be run as a standalone product or used in conjunction with third party federation or provisioning products to manage Office 365. It also integrates with the entire EmpowerID suite of Manager modules to manage all of an organization's on-premise and cloud directories and applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIO TAMBO PERU (Reuters) - Peru destroyed more than 37 makeshift runways in the Amazon this week, part of bid to stop a growing number of small planes from smuggling cocaine out of the world's top producer, military officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security forces plan to wipe out 58 so-called narco runways by Monday - a record number in such a short period of time, Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Vega said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The runways, carved into remote corners of the rainforest, help move tens of tonnes of cocaine out of Peru every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the cocaine cargo flown from Peru go to Bolivia before ending up in Brazil, the world's second biggest cocaine consumer after the United States, as well as to Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of cocaine smuggled out of Peru by small aircraft has spiked in the past year and is now moving a large part of the illicit drug, according to Peru and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 150 and 180 tonnes of cocaine were moved out of Peru by small aircraft last year, according to an estimate by Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the VRAEM, the lawless jungle region where most of Peru's coca is grown, a special forces unit blew up several runaways on Thursday with bundles of dynamite, leaving behind 30-meter wide holes that officials hope will make future landings impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The runways, which can stretch 600-meters long and sometimes feature drainage systems, are built by villagers who rent them to traffickers for $8,000 to $10,000 per use, according to Peru's police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this week's operation, Peru had destroyed 60 runways used for smuggling this year, Vega said, adding that security forces must make sure that the same runways are not rebuilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We might destroy the runways, but locals financed by drug traffickers will come to put them together again so the flights continue," said Vega from the district of Rio Tambo in the VRAEM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peru's President Ollanta Humala told Reuters in July that he wanted to start a program of intercepting aircraft suspected of smuggling drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar policy helped curb drug trafficking by air in the past but was abandoned in 2001 when Peru accidentally shot down an airplane carrying missionaries, killing a U.S. citizen and her baby and sparking international criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vega said Peru could intercept airplanes without shooting them down as it did in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Non-lethal interdiction, getting close to the aircraft and ordering it to land," Vega said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peru is considered the world's top producer of cocaine and coca by the United States and United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations estimated in 2008 that Peru makes some 300 tonnes of cocaine every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting By Marco Aquino, Writing by Mitra Taj; Editing by Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is adding a new attraction based on the movie "Frozen" to its Epcot theme park in Orlando, Florida, the media company's latest move to capitalize on the popularity of the blockbuster animated film.&lt;/p&gt;

It will replace a boat ride called Maelstrom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attraction "will take our guests to Arendelle and immerse them in many of their favorite moments and music from the film," Tom Staggs, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said on Friday on the Disney Parks blog.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters - Pfizer Inc and India's Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd on Friday won dismissal of a U.S. antitrust lawsuit accusing them of conspiring to delay sales of generic versions of the best-selling cholesterol drug Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Peter Sheridan in Trenton, New Jersey, ruled that the plaintiffs, retailers and distribution companies that bought Lipitor directly from Pfizer, failed to plead their case with enough detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in 2012, stems from a 2008 settlement of a patent lawsuit filed by Pfizer against Ranbaxy over Ranbaxy's plan to make generic Lipitor.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft&#8217;s impending purchase of Mojang, the Swedish developer with 100 million players of its open world Minecraft game, is more aimed at pulling users onto the software company's obscure mobile platform than its better known PC system or Xbox game console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software company's Windows Phone system has only 2.5 percent of the world's smartphone market, and its Surface tablet barely more, according to tech research firm IDC. Growth is hampered because many app and game developers ignore it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Minecraft, which is the top paid app both on Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iOS and Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android systems. Microsoft will unveil a $2.5 billion deal to buy its owner on Monday, according to a source briefed on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seems like Microsoft is looking at Mojang and Minecraft as a way to tap into&#160; this enormous cultural phenomenon," said Dave Bisceglia, Chief Executive of independent game studio Tap Lab. "If you look at iOS, Minecraft has been a top-grossing game for quite some time, if Microsoft could on Windows phones give players a unique and compelling experience that you can't get on the other platforms, that could be a driver to sell devices to existing Minecraft fans.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does not disclose numbers of users of Windows Phones, and declined comment on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minecraft was launched five years ago as a PC game, but 54 million sales later, about 40 percent of copies are downloaded onto phones and tablets. Left to their own devices, it does not seem likely that Mojang's 40-strong team would ever get round to designing a Windows Phone version of Minecraft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markus Persson, the game's creator and co-founder of Mojang, said last year that Windows phones are so insignificant in terms of market share that they are not worth developing for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because it's tiny," Persson wrote in an email to Reuters last June, when asked why his company only made mobile versions of its games for iOS and Android, but not Windows Phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both Symbian and Blackberry have more users than Windows Phone," wrote Persson, referring to Nokia's discontinued operating system and the fading Canadian smartphone pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is focused on the mobile benefits for Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don&#8217;t view this acquisition as a signal of Microsoft's intent to double down on Xbox but consider it an attempt to better address mobile on a cross-platform basis," said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund in a note to clients this week. "This also appears to be consistent with (Microsoft) CEO Satya Nadella&#8217;s mobile and cloud strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is expected to pay close to $2.5 billion for Mojang, or about 8 times sales last year. That is small change for Microsoft, which has $86 billion in cash and short-term investments. But it is relatively large and expensive for game company acquisitions, which do not have a stellar record of success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's SoftBank Corp (9984.T) paid $1.53 billion for a 50 percent stake in Finnish game maker Supercell last year at about 3.5 times projected annual sales. Electronic Arts' (EA.O) $750 million acquisition of PopCap in 2011 was valued around 10 to 11 times sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joost&#160;van Dreunen, Chief Executive of research firm&#160;SuperData, said the price tag &#8221;seems like a lot for a title that has certainly not peaked but is certainly not in its initial frenzy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He doubts that Minecraft can really help Windows phone sales: &#8220;Minecraft itself has done very well on the iOS platform, but it&#8217;s better on the iPad, the screen is bigger," he said. "I don&#8217;t see why this could drive handset sales.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Malathi Nayak in San Francisco; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - CVR Energy Inc is
bound by agreements to pay Goldman Sachs Group Inc and
Deutsche Bank AG more than $36 million in fees and
expenses stemming from billionaire investor Carl Icahn's 2012
tender offer for the oil refiner, a New York state judge has
ruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks had each sued CVR in 2012, claiming CVR had hired
them to provide financial advice on Icahn's ultimately
successful tender offer for its stock, and agreed to the fees
based on the size of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2012, Icahn won control of CVR with an 80 percent
stake after a majority of shareholders accepted his $30 per
share tender offer, which valued the Sugar Land, Texas-based
company at about $2.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn instructed the company not to pay invoices the banks
had submitted for about $18 million each in fees, the complaints
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan Supreme Court Justice O. Peter Sherwood said in a
Sept. 8 decision "the undisputed record conclusively
demonstrates that CVR is bound" by the fee agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herbert Beigel, a lawyer for CVR and Icahn, declined to
comment. A Goldman spokesman said the bank was pleased with the
decision. Deutsche Bank did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, CVR sued its law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp;
Katz for professional malpractice, saying it did not disclose
the terms of its revised fee agreements to company directors.
That case remains pending in Manhattan federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are Goldman Sachs &amp; Co v. CVR Energy Inc, New York
State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 652149/2012; and
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc v. CVR Energy in the same court,
No. 652800/2012.

      Fitch Rates Coca-Cola's $2B Notes Issuance 'A+'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The Coca-Cola Company's 
      (Coca-Cola) issuance of EUR2 billion senior notes including EUR800 
      million of 1.125% notes due 2022 and EUR1.2 billion of 1.875% notes due 
      2026. The Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had approximately $40.2 
      billion of debt as of June 27, 2014. A complete list of ratings follows 
      at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the 
      company's senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net 
      proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may 
      include working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions of or 
      investments in businesses or assets, redemption and repayment of 
      short-term or long-term borrowings and purchases of our common stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Strong Global Brands
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola's ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest 
      global beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola 
      has 17 $1 billion brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, 
      Powerade, Minute Maid, and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated 
      soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage portfolio, the ratings 
      consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in the U.S., growing 
      scrutiny over artificial sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand in North 
      America, and modest CSD growth in other developed countries. However, 
      this risk is mitigated by Coca-Cola's market strength in developing, 
      higher growth geographies with low per capita consumption 
      characteristics that should provide an important longer-term offset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Debt Structure, Elevated Leverage
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch remains concerned with Coca-Cola's high gross leverage that has 
      been elevated by substantial commercial paper (CP) balances. Coca-Cola's 
      gross leverage is weak for the rating category at 3.0x on a total 
      debt-to-operating EBITDA basis for the second quarter ending June 27, 
      2014, up from 2.4x at the end of 2012. FFO adjusted leverage was 3.9x 
      and FFO fixed charge coverage was 14.8x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola's commercial paper (CP) balance remains substantial at $19.9 
      billion as of June 27, 2014. The CP mix is approximately half of the 
      firm's overall capital structure which Fitch believes increases 
      Coca-Cola's financial risk. Coca-Cola has indicated that $20 billion is 
      the upper limit for its CP program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch between its 
      U.S. cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows which 
      the company has not felt a need to repatriate at this time. Coca-Cola 
      maintains a comparable cash balance along with its committed bank lines 
      to provide backup to its CP borrowings. Fitch believes Coca-Cola should 
      advance a longer-term plan to address the structural mismatch and the 
      large CP balance including any reduction in cash matching any 
      corresponding reduction in CP levels, thus lowering gross debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Strong Cash Generation, Liquidity
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to consistently 
      generate considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash 
      flow (FCF). For the LTM period ending June 27, 2014, Coca-Cola generated 
      $11.1 billion and $3.5 billion (after adjusting for dividends) of CFFO 
      and FCF, respectively, after generating $10.6 billion and $3.3 billion 
      for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects Coca-Cola's FCF in 2014 to be in excess of $3.5 billion 
      driven in part by reduced pension contributions and improved working 
      capital. Coca-Cola has committed to $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net 
      share repurchases in 2014, after repurchasing a net $3.5 billion in 
      2013. Net share repurchases was $1.3 billion for the first half of 2014. 
      LTM dividends were $5.1 billion representing a cash flow payout ratio of 
      59%. Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months was $1.5 
      billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of June 27, 2014, Coca-Cola's $27.9 billion liquidity position 
      consisted of $18.1 billion of cash and short-term investments, $3.5 
      billion of marketable securities, and $6.3 billion of availability under 
      its committed credit lines and revolving credit facility that mature 
      August 2019. As part of Fitch's corporate policy, off shore cash is 
      viewed as not readily accessible due to a general reluctance of firm's 
      to repatriate because of incremental tax cost although Fitch recognizes 
      the significant cash balances that back Coca-Cola's CP program is a key 
      mitigating ratings factor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consistent Operating Performance
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency in the past 
      with top-line and cash flow growth driven by increasing volume, 
      price/mix and improved operating expense leverage. Persistent global 
      macroeconomic pressure, higher taxes, negative perceptions of artificial 
      sweeteners and weather-related issues has made past volume growth more 
      challenging. During the six-month period ended June 27, 2014, 
      consolidated net operating revenue excluding the negative effects of 
      currency and structural changes grew 3%. Concentrate volumes rose 1% 
      while price/mix contributed 2%. Operating income increased 6% excluding 
      the impacts of currency and structural changes. Coca-Cola's first half 
      2014 performance was in line with Fitch's expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola's expectations for an incremental $1 billion in productivity 
      savings by 2016 that will be primarily redirected for increased media 
      investments should further support brand development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MA Investments
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings also consider the potential for future acquisitions given 
      the company's transaction history. Fitch views KO's investments in 
      minority positions of Monster Beverage and Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. 
      as relatively low risk and having key strategic benefits of improving 
      product diversification and distribution. The shifting secular trends 
      within the soft drink industry make these investments essential to 
      create an additional avenue for growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) Ratings
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and 
      CCR issued obligations, since default risk is very low at this level on 
      the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the notes 
      issued by Coca-Cola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch currently rates The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its 
      subsidiaries as follows:

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
CHICAGO, September 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+'
rating to The 
Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) issuance of EUR2 billion senior
notes including 
EUR800 million of 1.125% notes due 2022 and EUR1.2 billion of
1.875% notes due 
2026. The Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had
approximately $40.2 billion 
of debt as of June 27, 2014. A complete list of ratings follows
at the end of 
this release. 
The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with
the company's 
senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net
proceeds from the 
offering for general corporate purposes, which may include
working capital, 
capital expenditures, acquisitions of or investments in
businesses or assets, 
redemption and repayment of short-term or long-term borrowings
and purchases of 
our common stock.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Strong Global Brands
Coca-Cola's ratings are supported by its position as the world's
largest global 
beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola
has 17 $1 
billion brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite,
Powerade, Minute Maid, 
and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks
(CSDs) in Coca-Cola's 
beverage portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline
in CSD volumes in 
the U.S., growing scrutiny over artificial sweeteners affecting
diet CSD demand 
in North America, and modest CSD growth in other developed
countries. However, 
this risk is mitigated by Coca-Cola's market strength in
developing, higher 
growth geographies with low per capita consumption
characteristics that should 
provide an important longer-term offset.
Debt Structure, Elevated Leverage
Fitch remains concerned with Coca-Cola's high gross leverage
that has been 
elevated by substantial commercial paper (CP) balances.
Coca-Cola's gross 
leverage is weak for the rating category at 3.0x on a total
debt-to-operating 
EBITDA basis for the second quarter ending June 27, 2014, up
from 2.4x at the 
end of 2012. FFO adjusted leverage was 3.9x and FFO fixed charge
coverage was 
14.8x. 
Coca-Cola's commercial paper (CP) balance remains substantial at
$19.9 billion 
as of June 27, 2014. The CP mix is approximately half of the
firm's overall 
capital structure which Fitch believes increases Coca-Cola's
financial risk. 
Coca-Cola has indicated that $20 billion is the upper limit for
its CP program. 
The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch
between its U.S. 
cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows
which the company 
has not felt a need to repatriate at this time. Coca-Cola
maintains a comparable 
cash balance along with its committed bank lines to provide
backup to its CP 
borrowings. Fitch believes Coca-Cola should advance a
longer-term plan to 
address the structural mismatch and the large CP balance
including any reduction 
in cash matching any corresponding reduction in CP levels, thus
lowering gross 
debt. 
Strong Cash Generation, Liquidity
Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to
consistently generate 
considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash flow
(FCF). For the 
LTM period ending June 27, 2014, Coca-Cola generated $11.1
billion and $3.5 
billion (after adjusting for dividends) of CFFO and FCF,
respectively, after 
generating $10.6 billion and $3.3 billion for the year ended
Dec. 31, 2012.
Fitch expects Coca-Cola's FCF in 2014 to be in excess of $3.5
billion driven in 
part by reduced pension contributions and improved working
capital. Coca-Cola 
has committed to $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net share
repurchases in 2014, 
after repurchasing a net $3.5 billion in 2013. Net share
repurchases was $1.3 
billion for the first half of 2014. LTM dividends were $5.1
billion representing 
a cash flow payout ratio of 59%. Coca-Cola's long-term debt
maturing in the next 
12 months was $1.5 billion.
As of June 27, 2014, Coca-Cola's $27.9 billion liquidity
position consisted of 
$18.1 billion of cash and short-term investments, $3.5 billion
of marketable 
securities, and $6.3 billion of availability under its committed
credit lines 
and revolving credit facility that mature August 2019. As part
of Fitch's 
corporate policy, off shore cash is viewed as not readily
accessible due to a 
general reluctance of firm's to repatriate because of
incremental tax cost 
although Fitch recognizes the significant cash balances that
back Coca-Cola's CP 
program is a key mitigating ratings factor. 
Consistent Operating Performance
Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency in the
past with 
top-line and cash flow growth driven by increasing volume,
price/mix and 
improved operating expense leverage. Persistent global
macroeconomic pressure, 
higher taxes, negative perceptions of artificial sweeteners and
weather-related 
issues has made past volume growth more challenging. During the
six-month period 
ended June 27, 2014, consolidated net operating revenue
excluding the negative 
effects of currency and structural changes grew 3%. Concentrate
volumes rose 1% 
while price/mix contributed 2%. Operating income increased 6%
excluding the 
impacts of currency and structural changes. Coca-Cola's first
half 2014 
performance was in line with Fitch's expectations. 
Coca-Cola's expectations for an incremental $1 billion in
productivity savings 
by 2016 that will be primarily redirected for increased media
investments should 
further support brand development.
M Investments
The ratings also consider the potential for future acquisitions
given the 
company's transaction history. Fitch views KO's investments in
minority 
positions of Monster Beverage and Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. as
relatively low 
risk and having key strategic benefits of improving product
diversification and 
distribution. The shifting secular trends within the soft drink
industry make 
these investments essential to create an additional avenue for
growth. 
Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) Ratings
Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola
Company and CCR 
issued obligations, since default risk is very low at this level
on the rating 
scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the notes issued
by Coca-Cola.
Fitch currently rates The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its
subsidiaries as 
follows:
The Coca-Cola Company
--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+';
--Bank credit facilities 'A+';
--Senior unsecured debt 'A+';
--Short-term IDR 'F1';
--CP 'F1'. 
Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments

--Long-term IDR 'A+';
--Senior unsecured debt 'A+';
--Senior shelf 'A+'.

&lt;p&gt;STOCKHOLM/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has agreed to acquire the Stockholm-based developer of the wildly popular Minecraft video game for $2.5 billion, as it tries to lure a new and mostly young audience into its mobile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minecraft - a construction game in which players can build nearly anything imaginable, block by block, in a digital, Lego-like world - has spread like wildfire since its full release by developer Mojang in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minecraft is the top paid-for app both on Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iOS and Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android systems and helped Mojang, which employs just 40 people, bring in 2.05 billion crowns ($287 million) in revenue in 2013, giving it an 896 million crown ($126 million) operating profit for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director of website Gamesbrief Nicholas Lovell described Minecraft as a hugely successful product which has "captured the imagination of pretty much everybody under the age of 15", saying the game could help Microsoft broaden its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Mojang team will join Microsoft studios behind global franchises such as "Halo" and "Fable", its three co-founders, who have been chased by the likes of Napster co-founder and early Facebook Inc (FB.O) investor Sean Parker, will be leaving to start new projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if to erase any doubts about the importance of gaming, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said it was a "top activity" spanning devices from PCs and consoles to tablets and mobiles,  with billions of hours devoted to it each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Minecraft is more than a great game franchise &#8211; it is an open world platform, driven by a vibrant community we care deeply about, and rich with new opportunities for that community and for Microsoft," Nadella said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has spent lavishly in the Nordic region in recent years, buying the handset business of Nokia for $7.2 billion in a deal which closed this year. In 2011, it spent $8.5 billion on Skype, which has its roots in Scandinavia and the Baltics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts were positive about the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The news robustly dismisses the idea that games are no longer at the core of Microsoft's strategic direction and also underlines the growing importance of independent titles alongside big-budget games," Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at&#160;IHS Technology, wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBR Capital Markets said the deal gave Nadella "the right product at the right time," as Microsoft invests in its Xbox strategy and moves into the intensely competitive mobile phone sector with Nokia under its hood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just five years old, Mojang was co-founded by Markus Persson, who developed the hit Minecraft game after previously working at Sweden's King Digital Entertainment Plc (KING.N), maker of the Candy Crush Saga game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT ABOUT THE MONEY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the Microsoft deal surprised some Minecraft players who know Persson, or "Notch" as he is commonly known, more for his anti-big business stance. But he explained the reasons behind the deal in a blog shortly after the deal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As soon as this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I'll probably abandon it immediately," Persson said in the blog posted on his Twitter feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can't be responsible for something this big," he said. "It's not about the money. It's about my sanity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notch, 35, owns 71 percent of Mojang through his company Notch Development AB and stands to become a billionaire if the deal goes through. JP Morgan was the sole advisor to Mojang on the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said Microsoft's purchase of Mojang is more aimed at pulling users onto its obscure mobile platform than its better known PC system or Xbox game console. [ID:nL1N0RD02Q]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minecraft was launched as a PC game, but about 40 percent of copies are downloaded onto phones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In accounting terms, Microsoft expects the acquisition, which should close late in 2014, will break even in its current 2015 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A $2.5 billion deal for Mojang, or about 8 times sales last year, is small change for Microsoft, which has $86 billion in cash and short-term investments. But it is relatively large and expensive for game company acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's SoftBank Corp (9984.T) paid $1.53 billion for a 50 percent stake in Finland's Supercell last year at about 3.5 times projected annual sales. Electronic Arts Inc's (EA) (EA.O) $750 million acquisition of PopCap in 2011 was valued at around 10 to 11 times sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nordic region, also home to Angry Birds maker Rovio, has emerged as an important player in the gaming world, thanks to its long, dark winters and highly connected societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EA snapped up Swedish video game maker DICE, best known for the Battlefield franchise, in 2006, and the sale of Mojang comes hard on the heels of King's listing on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's another acknowledgement of the Swedish games industry and the technology that we produce, that a company like Microsoft wants to invest enormous amounts here," said Per Stromback, spokesman for the Swedish Games Industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Alistair Scrutton and David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Mia Shanley and Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STOCKHOLM/SEATTLE, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp
 has agreed to acquire the Stockholm-based developer of
the wildly popular Minecraft video game for $2.5 billion, as it
tries to lure a new and mostly young audience into its mobile
world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minecraft - a construction game in which players can build
nearly anything imaginable, block by block, in a digital,
Lego-like world - has spread like wildfire since its full
release by developer Mojang in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minecraft is the top paid-for app both on Apple Inc's
 iOS and Google Inc's Android systems and
helped Mojang, which employs just 40 people, bring in 2.05
billion crowns ($287 million) in revenue in 2013, giving it an
896 million crown ($126 million) operating profit for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director of website Gamesbrief Nicholas Lovell described
Minecraft as a hugely successful product which has "captured the
imagination of pretty much everybody under the age of 15",
saying the game could help Microsoft broaden its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Mojang team will join Microsoft studios behind
global franchises such as "Halo" and "Fable", its three
co-founders, who have been chased by the likes of Napster
co-founder and early Facebook Inc investor Sean Parker,
will be leaving to start new projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if to erase any doubts about the importance of gaming,
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said it was a "top activity"
spanning devices from PCs and consoles to tablets and mobiles, 
with billions of hours devoted to it each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Minecraft is more than a great game franchise - it is an
open world platform, driven by a vibrant community we care

longer at the core of Microsoft's strategic direction and also
underlines the growing importance of independent titles
alongside big-budget games," Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games
at IHS Technology, wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBR Capital Markets said the deal gave Nadella "the right
product at the right time," as Microsoft invests in its Xbox
strategy and moves into the intensely competitive mobile phone
sector with Nokia under its hood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just five years old, Mojang was co-founded by Markus
Persson, who developed the hit Minecraft game after previously
working at Sweden's King Digital Entertainment Plc,
maker of the Candy Crush Saga game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT ABOUT THE MONEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the Microsoft deal surprised some Minecraft players

its long, dark winters and highly connected societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EA snapped up Swedish video game maker DICE, best known for
the Battlefield franchise, in 2006, and the sale of Mojang comes
hard on the heels of King's listing on the New York Stock
Exchange earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's another acknowledgement of the Swedish games industry
and the technology that we produce, that a company like
Microsoft wants to invest enormous amounts here," said Per
Stromback, spokesman for the Swedish Games Industry.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Wintergreen Advisers Renews Call for Withdrawal of Coca-Cola Equity 
      Plan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Move comes as several leading fund managers disclose votes against 
      the plan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wintergreen Advisers today renewed its call for The Coca-Cola Company 
      (NYSE: KO) to withdraw its 2014 Equity Plan in light of new disclosures 
      about significant shareholder opposition to the plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As recently reported in the media, several of Coca-Cola&#8217;s largest 
      shareholders did not support the plan, according to proxy-voting records 
      filed with the SEC. Those filings show that funds managed by State 
      Street, Fidelity and Capital Group voted against the Plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Opposition by these funds is in addition to public pension funds that 
      also voted against the plan, including the Florida State Board of 
      Administration, State of Wisconsin Investment Board, Ontario Municipal 
      Employees&#8217; Retirement System, Ontario Teachers&#8217; Pension Plan, and Canada 
      Pension Plan Investment Board.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      David Winters, CEO of Wintergreen Advisers, said: &#8220;When large 
      shareholders reject your plan, a responsible company should take pause. 
      And while the public is only now learning of these votes, the Coca-Cola 
      board has known about the level of opposition to the plan for months. 
      These new proxy voting disclosures &#8211; taken with the decision by 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s largest shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A, 
      BRK.B), to abstain from voting &#8211; suggest the Chairwoman of Coca-Cola&#8217;s 
      compensation committee should never have said the plan had &#8216;broad-based 
      investor support.&#8217;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In our view, Coca-Cola&#8217;s plan does not have sufficient investor support 
      to justify its implementation, and the board should do the right thing 
      and set it aside without further delay. This is a test of whether the 
      Coca-Cola board truly is prepared to act in the interests of 
      shareholders. If it is not, the board should be replaced.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While the Coca-Cola 2014 Equity Plan was approved by a majority of the 
      votes cast, fewer than half of Coca-Cola&#8217;s total outstanding shares 
      (2.19 billion out of 4.41 billion) were voted in favor of the plan. By 
      contrast, 66% of the total outstanding shares were voted in favor of 
      Coca-Cola's previous equity plan in 2008.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STOCKHOLM, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday
it has agreed to acquire Stockholm-based games developer Mojang
and the company's wildly popular Minecraft video game franchise
for $2.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in a statement it expects the acquisition to
be break-even in fiscal year 2015 on a GAAP basis. The deal is
expected to close in late 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gaming is a top activity spanning devices, from PCs and
consoles to tablets and mobile, with billions of hours spent
each year," said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Minecraft is more than a great game franchise - it is an
open world platform, driven by a vibrant community we care
deeply about, and rich with new opportunities for that community
and for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it plans to continue to make Minecraft
available across all the platforms on which it is available
today: PC, iOS, Android, Xbox and PlayStation.

      Research and Markets: Global SaaS Security Market 2014-2018: Leading 
      Vendors are CA Technologies, IBM, McAfee, Symantec  Trend Micro
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6njw66/global_saas) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      SaaS Security Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global SaaS Security market to grow at a CAGR of 20% over the 
      period 2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One predominant trend emerging in this market is the availability of 
      integrated service offerings from vendors. Vendors have started 
      providing offerings such as remote vulnerability management coupled with 
      security information and event management services, data loss 
      prevention, and email gateway. Such solutions decrease the business 
      costs for the customer, which, in turn, will see more spending toward 
      such offerings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one major driver of the market is the adoption 
      of SaaS applications. Benefits such as automation and resource 
      efficiency have encouraged these organizations to adopt SaaS security.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that security risks associated with SaaS 
      offerings are one of the major challenges of the market. The perception 
      that the cloud is not safe has stopped enterprises, especially large 
      ones, from investing in SaaS security as they fear the loss of 
      confidential data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/xrqvwg/global_hosted) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Hosted Application Management Services Market 2014-2018" report 
      to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Hosted Application Management Services market to grow at a 
      CAGR of 16.16% over the period 2013-2018
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report covers the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the 
      Global Hosted Application Management Services market during the period 
      2014-2018. To calculate the market size, the report considers the 
      revenue generated by the market vendors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major trends emerging in this market is high adaptability. 
      Hosted applications are highly recommended for upcoming businesses. 
      Hosted application management services provide solutions to automate the 
      business operation and the enterprise operation in an efficient manner 
      through optimized solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, dynamic scalability is one of the driving 
      factors of the market. It provides a wide range of options to enhance 
      enterprise operations and an extra processing buffer without any capital 
      investment or contingency fees for users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is cloud security policies. Hosted application management service 
      providers often experience a fluctuation in revenue because of security 
      concerns, which adversely affects their profitability.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/fn2wsn/global_enterprise) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Enterprise Social Software (ESS) Market 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Enterprise Social Software market to grow at a CAGR of 19.4% 
      over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The convergence of social software and collaboration software into a 
      single solution offering is creating a positive effect in the market. 
      The market is witnessing a shift from single-point solutions to 
      comprehensive platforms that provide all the required social software 
      capabilities such as blogs, email, wikis, and forums.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the increased adoption of social media sites is 
      a major driver in the market. The penetration of social media sites is 
      at its peak. Employees are demanding a similar experience in their 
      organizations. An increased number of use cases of social software and 
      successful case studies of organizations generating a positive return on 
      investment are propelling the market forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the cost of deploying ESS solutions 
      remains a key hindrance to market growth. The organizations are 
      concerned about ROI when deploying these software solutions because of 
      several factors such as low adoption rate, lack of security, and lack of 
      support on mobile devices.

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/2dr57c/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Cloud-based Database Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Cloud-based Database market to grow at a CAGR of 62.1% over 
      the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the emerging market trends is the increased use of mobile and web 
      applications, which has resulted in increased demand for advanced 
      database solutions that can manage a large number of users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in the market is the 
      increased generation of structured and unstructured data. Data are being 
      generated from various sources in increasing variety, which calls for 
      advanced database solutions, which is leading to increased demand for 
      cloud-based database management as it provides large and cost-effective 
      data storage space.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report security concerns constitute one of the major 
      challenges confronting this market. Frequent cyber-attacks through the 
      cloud on organizations have slightly decreased the demand for 
      cloud-based database products.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Indonesia expects crude output
from Exxon Mobil Corp's Cepu oil block to peak in July
or August next year, an official from the country's oil and gas
regulator said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Banyu Urip field, part of the Cepu block near Surabaya
in East Java, is expected to produce on average 119,000 barrels
per day (bpd) next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will reach a peak in the third quarter, or beginning in
July or August, at 165,000 bpd," said Johanes Widjonarko, head
of the regulator, SKKMigas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is developing the Banyu Urip field along with state
energy firm Pertamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With contribution from Cepu, Indonesia is targeting total
crude output of 845,000 bpd in 2015.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Tuesday announced the smallest percentage increase in its quarterly dividend since 2009 and appointed new directors to replace two board members who decided not to seek re-election.&lt;/p&gt;

It did not increase the dividend in recession-hit 2009, when it laid off more than 5,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares rose slightly in after-hours trading to $46.85. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new annual dividend would equal about 2.6 percent of that share price, the same as Intel Corp's (INTC.O) 2.6 percent but higher than Apple's 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said on Tuesday that Teri List-Stoll, 51,  CFO of Kraft Foods Group Inc (KRFT.O), and Charles Scharf, 49, chief executive of Visa Inc (V.N), will join the board on Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incumbent board members Dave Marquardt and Dina Dublon will retire from the board at the end of their current terms in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marquardt, 65, has been involved with Microsoft since its early days, joining the board in 1981. Dublon, 61, joined the board in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has made several changes to its board recently as it undergoes a change in leadership under new CEO Satya Nadella.

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised $500 million with its debut sale of Islamic bonds on Tuesday, becoming the first conventional U.S. bank to issue sukuk as Islamic finance develops beyond its traditional homes in the Middle East and southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank (GS.N) drew about $1.5 billion of orders for the five-year sukuk, reflecting heavy demand among cash-rich Islamic funds for new credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An initial attempt by Goldman to sell sukuk in 2011, when it registered a $2 billion issuance program with the Irish Stock Exchange, ran into suspicions among some analysts that it might violate Islamic bans on interest payments and monetary speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the bank insisted that those concerns were unfounded, it never went ahead with the 2011 issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, Goldman adjusted the sukuk structure and enlisted several heavyweight Gulf banks to arrange the sale, and it appeared to avoid any controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they have worked hard to address the issues people had the last time around," said Abdul Kadir Hussain, who oversees about $700 million as chief executive of Gulf financial firm Mashreq Capital (DIFC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman sukuk, which will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, is only the second such deal from a conventional bank outside a predominantly Muslim country; HSBC (HSBA.L) issued $500 million of sukuk in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other conventional banks, and possibly Western corporations, may follow as they seek to tap into a large new source of funding: France's Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (8306.T) set up sukuk programs in Malaysia this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governments of Britain and Hong Kong made debut sukuk issues earlier this year, while South Africa and Luxembourg are poised for their first sovereign issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having these kinds of issuers broadens the issuer base in the sukuk market, which will be positive for the market," Hussain said of Goldman's sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year-to-date, sukuk issuance totals $88.9 billion through 475 deals globally, up from $76.4 billion through 574 deals a year earlier, according to Zawya, a Thomson Reuters company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman priced its issue at a spread of 90 basis points over midswaps, a document from lead arrangers showed, tighter than initial guidance in the area of 95 bps. The sukuk carry a profit rate of 2.844 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pricing represented a small premium to Goldman's conventional 2.625 percent 2019 bonds 38145XAA1=, which were trading at a Z-spread of 80 bps, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman picked itself, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank ADIB.AD, Emirates NBD ENBD.DU, National Bank of Abu Dhabi NBAD.AD, Qatar's QInvest and the investment banking arm of Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank IPO-NACO.SE to arrange the issue. Investor roadshows took place only in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman's 2011 sukuk plan envisaged using a murabaha structure, this week's issue is predominantly based on wakala, in which one party manages assets on behalf of another; many scholars consider it a less controversial structure because of its clearer link to the assets backing the sukuk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proceeds of the issue will be used in the commodities business of J. Aron &amp; Co, a Goldman unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sukuk were to be issued through a vehicle called JANY Sukuk Co and guaranteed by Goldman Sachs. They were expected to be rated A-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's and A by Fitch Ratings, identical to the ratings of the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Andrew Torchia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) will complete a $500 million debut sukuk issue later on Tuesday, with price guidance tightened slightly from earlier indications due to strong demand from investors, a document from lead managers showed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest price guidance for the five-year transaction was revised to a range of between 90 and 95 basis points over midswaps, the document showed, having been marked earlier in the day in the area of 95 bps over the same benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer, expected to be rated A-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's and A by Fitch Ratings, has garnered orders worth $1.4 billion from investors. Books will close at 1000 GMT, the document added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sukuk is being issued through a vehicle called JANY Sukuk Co and will be guaranteed by Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank ADIB.AD, Emirates NBD ENBD.DU, National Bank of Abu Dhabi NBAD.AD, QInvest, the investment banking arm of Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank IPO-NACO.SE and Goldman Sachs itself are arranging the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Archana Narayanan; Editing by David French)&lt;/p&gt;

oversees about $700 million as chief executive of Gulf financial
firm Mashreq Capital (DIFC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman sukuk, which will be listed on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange, is only the second such deal from a conventional
bank outside a predominantly Muslim country; HSBC 
issued $500 million of sukuk in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other conventional banks, and possibly Western corporations,
may follow as they seek to tap into a large new source of
funding: France's Societe Generale and Japan's Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ set up sukuk programmes in
Malaysia this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governments of Britain and Hong Kong made debut sukuk
issues earlier this year, while South Africa and Luxembourg are
poised for their first sovereign issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having these kinds of issuers broadens the issuer base in
the sukuk market, which will be positive for the market,"
Hussain said of Goldman's sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year-to-date, sukuk issuance totals $88.9 billion through
475 deals globally, up from $76.4 billion through 574 deals a
year earlier, according to Zawya, a Thomson Reuters company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman priced its issue at a spread of 90 basis points over
midswaps, a document from lead arrangers showed, tighter than
initial guidance in the area of 95 bps. The sukuk carry a profit
rate of 2.844 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pricing represented a small premium to Goldman's
conventional 2.625 percent 2019 bonds, which were
trading at a Z-spread of 80 bps, according to Thomson Reuters
data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman picked itself, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank,
Emirates NBD, National Bank of Abu Dhabi,
Qatar's QInvest and the investment banking arm of Saudi Arabia's
National Commercial Bank IPO-NACO.SE to arrange the issue.
Investor roadshows took place only in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman's 2011 sukuk plan envisaged using a murabaha
structure, this week's issue is predominantly based on wakala,
in which one party manages assets on behalf of another; many
scholars consider it a less controversial structure because of
its clearer link to the assets backing the sukuk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proceeds of the issue will be used in the commodities
business of J. Aron &amp; Co, a Goldman unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sukuk were to be issued through a vehicle called JANY
Sukuk Co and guaranteed by Goldman Sachs. They were expected to
be rated A-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's and A by Fitch Ratings,
identical to the ratings of the investment bank.

		&lt;p&gt;MONTREAL, CANADA and MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA--(Marketwired - Sep 16, 2014) - 
				Fresche Legacy, a leading provider of legacy application management and modernization solutions, announced today its merger with looksoftware, a company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia specializing in web, cloud and mobile solutions for the IBM i, and particularly in GUI modernization. The merger combines Fresche Legacy's deep modernization product and service expertise with looksoftware's extensive product suite, including newlook, the most advanced design and development environment for IBM i GUI modernization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, looksoftware becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Fresche Solutions Pty. The company and its products will continue to be marketed and sold under the looksoftware name.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the merger, IBM i users can now turn to one partner to address full life-cycle application management and all levels of modernization.

&lt;p&gt;The Portuguese government is seeking to sell Novo Banco swiftly to recover 4.9 billion euros ($6.34 billion), mostly public funds, poured into the lender last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a great opportunity for any bank that wants to have a foothold in Portugal," Antonio Esteves, who is Portuguese, told a conference in Lisbon, adding that the bank's dossier had to be studied thoroughly first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know its dossier at this moment, (but) I think there might be, and will be, potential foreign bidders," said Esteves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BES (BES.LS), once Portugal's largest listed lender, had to be rescued last month after the collapse of the business empire of its founding Espirito Santo family, whose main holding firms are under creditor protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Portugal last month named BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) as adviser in the Novo Banco sale process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local media have mentioned Spain's Santander (SAN.MC) and BBVA BBVA.LS as among the potential bidders, as well as Portugal's Banco BPI (BBPI.LS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks have declined to comment on the reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his optimism about foreign bidders, Esteves warned that Portuguese banks were still unprofitable, so any bid would be a bet on the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esteves said the BES case had hit the investor risk perception of Portugal after its successful exit from an international bailout in May, and it was "difficult to sell Portugal abroad".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it's not mission impossible ...

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The private equity
owner of Phoenix Services LLC, which provides services to global
steel producers including ArcelorMittal SA , is
exploring a sale that it hopes will value the company at more
than $800 million, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private equity firm Olympus Partners took a major ownership
stake in Phoenix through its 2009 debt and equity investment in
Atlas Industrial Services, the holding company that owns
Phoenix. Olympus is working with Goldman Sachs Group to
assist with the sale effort, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has estimated annual earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization of between $110 million and
$120 million and could be valued at roughly seven times that
amount, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the people asked not to be named because the matter is
not public. Olympus Partners and Phoenix could not immediately
be  reached for comment, while Goldman Sachs declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unionville, Pennsylvania-based Phoenix, founded in 2006,
offers services including slag handling, the recovery of metal
from slag, scrap handling and processing, raw material and
finished product handling, and the marketing of slag, according
to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are concerns about significant customer concentration
with half of Phoenix's revenue derived from one client,
ArcelorMittal, according to one person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically a U.S.-focused business, Phoenix in 2012 bought
France's Gagneraud Industrie to expand into Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1988, Olympus manages more than $5 billion, and
invests in a broad range of companies from business services to
healthcare.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The share of investors who are bearish on U.S. longer-dated Treasuries and reckon their yields will rise climbed to its highest level since late July, according to a J.P. Morgan Securities survey released on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of investors who said on Monday they are "short" longer-dated U.S. government debt rose to 42 percent from 36 percent the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the largest share of investors who were "short" Treasuries since July 28, the firm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By holding fewer longer-dated Treasuries, investors reduce the duration risk or sensitivity of their portfolios in anticipation of a rise in interest rates. A rate rise causes the prices of longer-dated bonds to fall more than the prices of shorter-dated debt, resulting in larger losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, longer-dated Treasuries produce higher returns than short-term debt in a market rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steady flow of solid U.S. economic data helped push the  benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield above 2.60 percent to its loftiest in two months on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research paper from the San Francisco Federal Reserve published last week said investors expect the Fed to keep rates lower for longer, and to increase them more slowly, than U.S monetary policy makers themselves expect. It stoked worries the market might be underestimating how quickly the central bank might tighten policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Open Market Committee will begin a two-day policy meeting later Tuesday. There has been a growing view the Fed's policy-setting group would signal in a statement due at 2 p.m. on Wednesday that it is leaning to move away from its near zero interest rate policy by the end of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of long investors or those who said they held more longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks rose to 13 percent from 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are those investors who believe the U.S. economy is fragile and the Fed is not ready to send out a hawkish sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of neutral investors, or those who said they were holding long-dated securities equal to their portfolio benchmarks, fell to 45 percent from last week's 53 percent.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp is rolling out a cognitive tool powered by its Watson supercomputer that uses companies' internal data to answer questions about performance and efficiency, and predict outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said the tool - the latest in a series of Watson products unveiled by IBM - will make more widely available data analytics capabilities long reserved for research scientists. The move is part of IBM's effort to shift resources away from a slumping hardware sector into more profitable fields like cloud computing and analytics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, IBM launched Watson Discovery advisor, a tool scientists can use to identify patterns in data.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The share of investors who are
bearish on U.S. longer-dated Treasuries and reckon their yields
will rise climbed to its highest level since late July,
according to a J.P. Morgan Securities survey released on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of investors who said on Monday they are "short"
longer-dated U.S. government debt rose to 42 percent from 36
percent the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the largest share of investors who were "short"
Treasuries since July 28, the firm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By holding fewer longer-dated Treasuries, investors reduce

monetary policy makers themselves expect. It stoked worries the
market might be underestimating how quickly the central bank

Fed's policy-setting group would signal in a statement due at 2
p.m. (1800 GMT) on Wednesday that it is leaning to move away
from its near zero interest rate policy by the end of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of long investors or those who said they held more
longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks rose to 13 percent
from 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are those investors who believe the U.S. economy is
fragile and the Fed is not ready to send out a hawkish sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of neutral investors, or those who said they were
holding long-dated securities equal to their portfolio
benchmarks, fell to 45 percent from last week's 53 percent.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Sept. 16, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - Globanet&#8482;, a leading developer and reseller of data migration, archiving, compliance and eDiscovery solutions worldwide, provides a data migration software that is capable of reconstructing Bcc data during an Exchange Web Services (EWS) migration. Globanet Migrate&#8482; features patent-pending technology that is designed for the specific purpose of efficiently and reliably migrating data between on-premise and cloud-based archive environments. The software's newly discovered EWS capability is a unique feature that allows organizations to continue to search against Bcc data during regulatory investigations or eDiscovery once the data is migrated to Microsoft Office 365 or Microsoft Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations that choose to migrate their journal data from legacy archives to Microsoft Office 365 or Microsoft Exchange can leverage Globanet Migrate to ensure that data integrity is maintained. Exchange Web Services is the most efficient migration method to deliver archived email data to Microsoft Office 365 or Microsoft Exchange personal archives. Most migration solutions are unable to reconstruct mail envelopes through EWS, which prevents the retention of Bcc data and creates inconsistent results between migrated data and native Exchange data. Globanet Migrate is able to keep Bcc data intact and transfer all metadata while migrating through the EWS tunnel with speeds twice as fast as the average migration solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Bcc data can play a crucial role in eDiscovery and regulatory investigations. To prevent legal risks, organizations need a data migration solution that is capable of reconstructing the envelope during an EWS migration, " says Sam Elbeck, Senior Director of Business Development and Client Services at Globanet. "Globanet Migrate is able to provide organizations with peace of mind, knowing that all of its data has been safely migrated to a new archiving solution and is ready for eDiscovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Key Globanet Migrate features include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		Chain of Custody and Reporting: Ensures and verifies that data integrity remains intact
			
		Enhanced Auto-Tuning: Optimizes the use of available hardware to produce a smoother and more efficient migration
			
		Advanced PST Technology: Increases data integrity by removing the prerequisite to install Microsoft Outlook
			
		Selective Migration: Target scoping allows for focus and flexibility in migrating specific subsets of data
			
		No Staging area needed: Able to migrate directly Microsoft Office365 without the need to go to PST first
			
		Supports Multiple Environments: Ability to migrate data to and from a variety of sources and targets including but not limited to:
			
		Symantec Enterprise Vault
			
		Symantec Enterprise Vault.cloud
			
		Microsoft Office 365
			
		Microsoft Exchange 2007-2013
			
		EMC EmailXtender
			
		EMC SourceOne
			
		HP Autonomy ZANTAZ EAS
		&lt;p&gt;
	Pricing  Availability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Globanet Migrate is available now. The software is typically priced on a per-terabyte basis regardless of the number of archives. Please contact Globanet at (888) 427-5505 or click here to request pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;MedGenesis Enters Into Agreement with Pfizer Inc. for Potential Treatments for Parkinson's Disease&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;VICTORIA, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Sep 16, 2014) -  MedGenesis Therapeutix Inc. ("MedGenesis"), a privately held biotechnology company focused on the development and precision delivery of definitive treatments for neurologic diseases, announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer"), granting Pfizer an exclusive, worldwide option to license its glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) protein and convection enhanced delivery (CED) technology to be used in research for potential treatments for Parkinson's disease.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Erich Mohr, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of MedGenesis commented, "We believe that delivering drugs, including proteins, precisely to the regions of the brain where they are required will allow the potential for better treatments for a whole range of central nervous system (CNS) disease, and opens up the opportunity for the potential development of truly disease-modifying treatments of neurological diseases. We are delighted to be collaborating with Pfizer to complete our GDNF program, and we hope that this collaboration will result in potential treatments for people living with Parkinson's that could radically alter the course of their disease."

			Macomb Community College and JPMorgan Chase Launch $2.7 Million 
      Innovation Fund to Support Detroit-Area Entrepreneurs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Macomb&#8217;s 60th anniversary 
      celebration is stage for exciting initiative to stimulate economic 
      development and is part of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s $100 million commitment to 
      Detroit&#8217;s economic recovery
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Commended by Michigan Governor Snyder and Detroit Mayor Duggan, 
      Innovation Fund will provide start-ups and emerging businesses with 
      capital and internship opportunities for Macomb students
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Macomb Community College and JPMorgan Chase today announced the 
      Innovation Fund, a nearly $3 million effort to stimulate economic 
      development and job growth among promising Detroit-area entrepreneurs 
      and next-stage companies with high-growth potential.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Part of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s $100 million commitment to Detroit&#8217;s economic 
      recovery and managed by Macomb Community College, the Innovation Fund 
      will provide valuable capital to entrepreneurs when it&#8217;s needed most &#8211; 
      providing bridge funding at a pivotal time in business development 
      between &#8220;family and friends&#8221; funding and the ability to attract 
      mainstream financial investor funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Formally known as the Innovation Fund Macomb Community College, Powered 
      by JPMorgan Chase  Co., this fund will provide grants, which do not 
      have to be repaid, of up to $25,000 for start-up businesses that are 
      taking the initial steps to get their very early stage idea ready for 
      market introduction. The fund will make larger awards of up to $100,000 
      to advance the progress of emerging companies toward larger-scale equity 
      funding. These larger awards, which must be matched dollar for dollar by 
      the company, may be required to be paid back or the company may have to 
      provide an equity interest to the Innovation Fund. This approach 
      sustains the Innovation Fund and also instills fund recipients with a 
      long-term commitment to enhancing the region&#8217;s entrepreneurial 
      environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s contribution is not only a commitment to the economic 
      future of Macomb County, but a commitment to fostering an 
      entrepreneurial ecosystem in southeast Michigan,&#8221; said Dr. James 
      Jacobs, president, Macomb Community College, at an event today 
      announcing the Innovation Fund. &#8220;Macomb County&#8217;s success is integrally 
      tied to metro Detroit&#8217;s success. The Innovation Fund Macomb Community 
      College represents an important, grow-your-own element in our local 
      economic development strategy, while at the same time serves to 
      cultivate the interests, skills and innovation of Macomb students and 
      community residents, fueling economic momentum, investment and regional 
      growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase, through its foundation, is contributing $1 million to 
      launch the Innovation Fund. Macomb is also providing $1 million from its 
      Strategic Fund, which was authorized by the college board of trustees in 
      late August 2014. Macomb will raise another $700,000, bringing the total 
      commitment to $2.7 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Detroit-area entrepreneurs are vital to southeast Michigan&#8217;s continued 
      economic recovery, and the Innovation Fund will be a catalyst for 
      creating sustained growth and employment throughout the region,&#8221; said Chauncy 
      Lennon, managing director for workforce readiness at JPMorgan Chase. 
      &#8220;This is a win-win for small businesses and Macomb students. Small 
      businesses, like those in advanced manufacturing, receive needed capital 
      and Macomb students obtain on-the-job training to prepare them for 
      success in the workplace after school.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Innovation Fund is an integral part of the college&#8217;s new Center for 
      Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which was also announced today, at the 
      college&#8217;s 60th anniversary celebration. While the event 
      honored the achievements of the past, it focused on new initiatives and 
      commitments designed to contribute to the region&#8217;s future economic 
      vitality. The center will be located on the college&#8217;s Center Campus in 
      Clinton Township, initially providing meeting space and resources, such 
      as mentors, for students seeking to start their own businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This major commitment and investment by Macomb Community College and 
      JPMorgan Chase take the energy and momentum that are driving our 
      communities, region and state forward to new levels,&#8221; said Michigan 
      Governor Rick Snyder. &#8220;Michigan is home to unlimited talent and 
      entrepreneurial spirit that will be further unleashed by this 
      collaboration, resulting in more and better jobs. The entire region is 
      primed for continued growth and this announcement and effort is an 
      exciting step in that process.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both start-ups and emerging companies that are funded by the Innovation 
      Fund will be required to provide meaningful employment opportunities for 
      Macomb Community College students through internships. These experiences 
      will contribute to students learning and developing valuable workplace 
      skills, as well as exposing them to innovative approaches and inspiring 
      them to develop entrepreneurial mindsets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Entrepreneurs are finding Detroit and its&#160;neighboring communities to be 
      great places to start and grow their businesses,&#8221; said Detroit Mayor 
      Mike Duggan. &#8220;The Innovation Fund will help fuel the economic growth 
      of our entire region, and it is a great example of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 
      ongoing commitment to a stronger Detroit.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Selection of proposals to fund will be accomplished through an engaging 
      and competitive process that benefits entrepreneurs participating, 
      whether or not funding is granted. An advisory board composed of 
      successful, local entrepreneurs will evaluate proposals and make funding 
      recommendations, and serve as mentors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Innovation Fund Macomb Community College is modeled after a highly 
      successful program established in 2007 by Lorain County Community 
      College (LCCC), located in northeast Ohio. In five years, LCCC received 
      more than 5,000 inquiries about their program, accepted more than 600 
      applications and made 99 awards valued at $5.7 million to 85 companies. 
      As a result, the companies funded raised $61 million in add-on capital, 
      provided more than 150 internships to students and created 314 jobs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase made a five-year, $100 million 
      commitment to Detroit&#8217;s economic recovery. Working with community 
      partners, JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s commitment is focused on supporting economic 
      development, blight reduction, workforce development and small business 
      growth. For more information, visit www.jpmorganchase.com/Detroit.

      with no signs of slowing down. Microsoft Lync Enterprise Voice and 
      Office 365 are significant solutions driving this growth. CallTower is 
      the industry leader of hosted voice-enabled Lync solutions for large and 
      mid-size enterprises. Its solutions are also available to other service 
      providers as a white-label offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Voxbone is the market leader in providing licensed international inbound 
      SIP trunks (also known as DIDs), and the only to be certified 
      with Microsoft Lync 2013. It allows 
      enterprises and hosted service providers such as CallTower to provide a 
      local telephone service in over 50 countries without any capital network 
      investments and with minimal carrier relations management. Voxbone&#8217;s 
      local telephone numbers can be used not only as local SIP trunks, but 
      also as audio conferencing dial-in numbers, or virtual international 
      phone numbers for Lync-powered contact centers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As our customer base and partner network grows, demand for expanding 
      our UC services internationally has grown,&#8221; said Bret England, President 
      and CEO of CallTower. &#8220;Three elements made us choose Voxbone as a 
      partner to achieve this: its Lync 2013 certification, its reputation for 
      providing high quality services, and its real-time provisioning 
      capability.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the few years since it was introduced, Microsoft Lync quickly became 
      the dominant enterprise UC platform, and is likely to become the basis 
      for most market-leading cloud communications services,&#8221; said Voxbone CEO 
      Itay Rosenfeld. &#8220;We strongly believe that CallTower&#8217;s long-standing 
      experience in deploying Microsoft Lync, combined with its unique 
      enterprise voice add-on, positions the company for a successful 
      international expansion.&#8221;

      Surface Pro 3 is in a category of its own. With a stunning 12&#8221; full HD 
      display in a sleek magnesium frame, it has all the power and performance 
      of a laptop, but in an incredibly thin, lightweight form.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Large Screen, Thinner, Lighter.

      Type Cover for Surface Pro 3 even better - more rigid with a 40% larger 
      trackpad.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Write Naturally.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

Sukuk Co and will be guaranteed by Goldman Sachs. The issue is
expected to be rated A-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's and A by Fitch

      visibility and control for Microsoft Lync, Microsoft Office 365 and 
      GoogleApps.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;As enterprises adopt more cloud based, peer-to-peer and demanding 
      applications, a more sophisticated approach to guaranteeing the 
      performance of those applications is needed&#8221;, said B&#233;atrice 
      Piquer-Durand, VP Marketing of Ipanema. She continued, &#8220;With this

      user experience.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With this release of the Ipanema 
      ANS version 8, enterprises can regain control of application usages 
      and ensure adoption for Microsoft Lync (on-premise and on-line), 
      GoogleApps or Microsoft Office 365 thanks to a unique integrated 
      platform that:
    &lt;/p&gt;

        application flow,
      
			
        Dynamically adapts to the real usage and conditions of the network

      ANS 8 also reduces Ipanema partners&#8217; cost of operations by simplifying 
      on-site installation, reducing deployment  in-life operations workloads 
      by around 50 per cent, cutting time to service enablement and avoiding 
      configuration errors.

      take full advantage of the expected benefits of their application 
      investment, from cost reduction, productivity increase to ease of

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and BlackRock Inc have seen their unconstrained bond funds double in size over the past 12 months as investors continue to search for yield in this low interest rate environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional bond funds, where managers have to stick to a mandate, unconstrained bond fund managers can invest across the fixed income market. They are often called "go anywhere" bond funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically investors have been wary of such funds because they were not sure where they fit in carefully designed portfolios, said Barry Fennell, an analyst with Lipper, a division of Thomson Reuters. However, with interest rates so low, investors have increasingly been willing to "push the envelope," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no longer just retail investors moving into these funds to avoid interest rate risk, said Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing pension funds and state funds grow significantly in this space to take advantage of this flexibility," Rieder told Reuters in an interview at BlackRock's offices on Wednesday.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 months, investors have poured more than $17 billion into Goldman's Strategic Income Fund, the  biggest U.S. unconstrained bond fund at $25.8 billion in assets, according to Morningstar. The fund has returned 3 percent over the past year. The Barclays Aggregate Bond Index has returned 5.66 percent for the past year, according to Lipper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BlackRock's Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, the second biggest fund of this kind at more than $20 billion, has seen $11 billion in inflows over the past 12 months. The fund has returned over 6 percent over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These funds tend to be more expensive than traditional bond funds. According to Lipper the average fees for unconstrained bond funds is 1.29 percent, compared to 0.83 percent for core bond funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both BlackRock and Goldman may have benefited from a general outflow at Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), the Newport Beach, California, firm that has seen fallout from a leadership shakeup and mediocre returns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 months, investors have pulled a net $8 billion from the $21.6 billion Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund, one of the firm&#8217;s most important offerings. The fund has returned 2.5 percent over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even PIMCO co-founder and chief investment officer Bill Gross, who took over management of the portfolio in December, has not been able to stem the cash outflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieder declined to comment specifically on Pimco but did say he believed that his fund is getting attention because it has provided returns and low volatility compared to competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pimco and Goldman did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the fund's popularity, Rieder does not anticipate capacity issues soon.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds detail on card security breaches, byline)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is
replacing some credit and debit cards following the security
breach at Home Depot Inc, a company spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company began sending notices on Tuesday to some card
holders, advising them that they will soon receive new cards
because the breach put them "at risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the notices said the company would mail a new card on
Sept. 30. The existing card can be used in the meantime, but the
notice advised monitoring the account for unrecognized
purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Paul Hartwick could not immediately say
how many cards are likely to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home Depot disclosed on Sept. 8 that its payment security
systems had been breached. The company is investigating how much
account data might have been taken as customers paid for
purchases in the United States and Canada from April through
August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesman could not immediately say why the bank moved
now to replace the cards or discuss how it balanced the goals of
thwarting fraud and minimizing inconvenience to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After card data was taken from Target Corp stores in
December, JPMorgan quickly canceled some debit cards that were
threatened and asked customers to go to branches for
replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and one of the
biggest card issuers. It issues cards under its Chase brand and
under co-branding relationships with some airlines and hotel
chains, such as United, Southwest and Marriott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notice to card holders said customers will not be liable
for unauthorized transactions that they report promptly to the
company. The company said it would continue to monitor accounts
to help identify unusual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After confirming the breach, Home Depot promised free
identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to
any potentially affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retailer had said earlier it will roll out PIN- and
chip-enabled cards at all its U.S. stores by the end of the year
to prevent card fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Krebs, who runs the security website KrebsOnSecurity
and first reported the Home Depot breach, said earlier this
month that it could be larger than the attack on Target in which
hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70
million other pieces of customer data during that retailer's
busiest season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Target has spent $146 million to resolve data breach-related
issues since the fourth quarter of 2013. Most of the expenses
were for settling actual and potential breach-related claims,
mainly by payment card networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest known breach at a U.S. retailer was uncovered in
2007 at TJX Cos Inc TJX.N, operator of the T.J. Maxx and
Marshalls chains, which had more than 90 million credit cards
stolen over about 18 months.

	The end of service for Windows Server 2003, set for July 14, 2015, has the potential to affect 24 million servers that run large and small businesses. As a Microsoft services partner that works with a wide range of businesses and organizations on IT solutions, Insight has identified this IT transition as more time consuming and complex than the end of support for Windows XP, which impacted many unprepared businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"When Microsoft ended support for Windows XP in April, about one quarter of U.S. businesses were still using the operating system, which caused a series of operational issues and potential security challenges," said David Mayer, practice director, Microsoft Solutions for Insight Enterprises. "While XP was primarily a desktop issue, we're advising our clients that Server 2003 end of service affects entire servers, with the potential to have widespread impact on many more business operations. With less than a year to begin addressing the issue, we're outlining for clients we work with a series of timely steps and options to start exploring now so they can implement their own outcome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Risks on the Horizon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	An estimated 39% of all installed Microsoft Server operating systems are the 2003 edition. Underscoring the type of support the software needs, there were 37 critical updates released for Windows 2003 in 2013. Operating outdated server software systems is risky and expensive. Threats to data centers running the outdated software will likely increase, and businesses will have to deal with added costs for intrusion detection systems, more advanced firewalls and network segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Businesses that deal with sensitive or critical information, such as healthcare records or credit card payment data, could fail to be regulatory compliant, resulting in lost business or a dramatic increase in the cost of doing business in the form of high transaction fees and penalties. Without addressing the issue, organizations will likely fail to meet industry compliance standards, i.e., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			The Solution: A Phased Approach &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	To ensure a smooth transition, Insight recommends businesses start immediately, as it could take longer than one year to migrate all systems. An outline of steps to move businesses along includes:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Phase I: Discovery and analysis &#8211; Businesses need to undertake a detailed environmental discovery to uncover which servers and applications are operating on the software
			
				Phase 2: Actual migration &#8211; Options for mitigation include:
		
					
				Software upgrades &#8211; including enterprise-class datacenter and hybrid cloud solutions that can be simple to deploy, cost-effective, application-focused, and user-centric
					
				Hardware upgrades &#8211; Windows Server 2012 requires new powerful hardware, which can deliver improved energy efficiency
					
				Cloud-based solutions &#8211; A flexible platform that allows businesses to rapidly build, deploy, and manage applications across a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters
				
			
			
				Phase 3 &#8211; Monitoring &#8211; Ensuring zero downtime and zero negative impact through post migration monitoring for 24-48 hours
		&lt;p&gt;
	"There isn't one solution for all businesses. Based on our experience working with clients, we're seeing this issue cut across all industries and company sizes, and every business may need to budget time, finances and human resources to address it," Mayer said. "Whether the businesses we work with choose to replace servers, upgrade software or migrate to the cloud there are critical decisions to be made that could take a good part of the coming year to address."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 18 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has halted
drilling an offshore oil well in Russia's remote Arctic just a
few days after the United States and European Union barred
companies from helping Russia exploit Arctic, deep-water or
shale-oil fields, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States and European Union were planning to stop
billions of dollars in oil exploration in Russia by the world's
largest energy companies including Exxon and BP Plc, U.S.
government sources told Reuters last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon signed a $3.2 billion agreement in 2011 with Russian
company Rosneft Oil Co to develop the Arctic. The
Texas-based multinational was considered one of the few
companies capable of drilling in the harsh, deep waters there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies were hoping for a major discovery in the
Kara Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still assessing the sanctions but will comply with
all laws and regulations," Exxon Mobil spokesman Richard Keil
told Reuters. He declined to comment on whether the company had
stopped drilling the well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft Oil was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. sanctions, meant to punish Russia for escalating
tensions in Ukraine, gave American companies until Sept. 26 to
stop all restricted drilling and testing services, the report
said. (bloom.bg/1rhh7wf)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The well could have tapped into 9 billion barrels of crude -
worth about $885 billion at current prices - that is estimated
to be deep under the floor of the Kara Sea, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Seadrill Ltd's North Atlantic Drilling
 unit were under pressure to finish or temporarily seal
the $700 million well, the Bloomberg report quoted Chris
Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at brokerage Prime
Executions Inc as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia, along with the United States and Saudi Arabia, is
one of the world's top oil producers and is the main energy
supplier to Europe. But with conventional oil fields in decline,
it needs to move to frontier sources in Siberia and the Arctic
to keep the oil flowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's shares were little changed on the New York Stock
Exchange on Thursday.

			ExxonMobil Continues to Increase Wolfcamp Position in Permian Basin
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced it entered into a 
      non-monetary exchange agreement with LINN Energy, LLC (NASDAQ: LINE) to 
      add 17,800 net acres in the Permian Basin to its U.S. oil and natural 
      gas portfolio managed by subsidiary XTO Energy Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the exchange, LINN Energy will receive interest in about 500 net 
      acres from ExxonMobil&#8217;s South Belridge Field, near Bakersfield, 
      California.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the agreement, ExxonMobil will receive 17,000 net acres in the 
      Midland Basin core area in west Texas that is most prospective for 
      horizontal Wolfcamp and Spraberry development, currently producing about 
      4,700 oil-equivalent barrels per day. ExxonMobil will also receive 800 
      net acres in the New Mexico Delaware Basin. Both acreage positions will 
      be operated and developed by XTO Energy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the second non-monetary exchange agreement with LINN Energy this 
      year. In May, ExxonMobil added nearly 26,000 acres in the Permian Basin. 
      In that agreement, LINN Energy received a portion of ExxonMobil&#8217;s 
      interest in the Hugoton gas field in Kansas and Oklahoma.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We continue to expand our leasehold position in a prolific area that is 
      poised for profitable volumes growth from multiple horizons in the 
      Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations,&#8221; said Randy Cleveland, president of 
      XTO Energy. &#8220;Our operated-acreage position in the Midland Basin Wolfcamp 
      core is now around 120,000 net acres. We continue to increase drilling 
      activity in the play, currently operating six horizontal rigs, and are 
      very encouraged by initial well results.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This agreement extends XTO&#8217;s leasehold position across the entire 
      Permian Basin to more than 1.5 million acres and net oil-equivalent 
      production to more than 95,000 barrels per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LINN Energy will acquire ExxonMobil&#8217;s interests in the South Belridge 
      Field, which currently produces approximately 3,400 barrels of oil per 
      day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This transaction further strengthens XTO&#8217;s significant presence in one 
      of the major U.S. growth areas for onshore oil production,&#8221; Cleveland 
      said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, Sept. 18, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LINN Energy, LLC (Nasdaq:LINE) ("LINN" or the "Company") and LinnCo, LLC (Nasdaq:LNCO) ("LinnCo") announced today that LINN has signed a definitive agreement to trade a portion of its Permian Basin properties to Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) ("ExxonMobil") for operating interests in California's South Belridge Field. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014 with an effective date of June 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	LINN will receive ExxonMobil's interest in its Hill Property located in the South Belridge Field, which is currently producing approximately 3.4 MBoe/d (~100 percent oil) with a shallow base decline of approximately ten percent. Proved reserves are estimated to be approximately 27 MMBoe, 51 percent of which is developed. LINN has identified significant upside potential through optimization projects, increased steam injection and extensive down spacing from more than 300 future drilling locations. LINN currently estimates total resource potential for the Hill Property to be approximately 67 MMBoe (~100 percent oil).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In exchange, ExxonMobil will receive approximately 17,000 net acres prospective for horizontal Wolfcamp drilling in the Midland Basin and approximately 4.7 MBoe/d of current production. Proved reserves are estimated to be 19 MMBoe. Additionally, ExxonMobil will receive approximately 800 acres in the New Mexico Delaware Basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Our California team has done an excellent job this year of growing Diatomite production and managing our legacy fields," said Mark E. Ellis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are very excited to add ExxonMobil's Hill Property to our inventory of development opportunities in the San Joaquin Valley. Today's trade announcement is another strategic portfolio improvement for our Company that reinforces our commitment to mature, long-lived oil and natural gas assets with low and predictable decline rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Significant benefits LINN expects to receive from the ExxonMobil trade:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		Excellent mature assets with a decline rate of approximately ten percent and reserve life of approximately 22 years;
			
		Hill Property currently generates more operating cash flow than Permian Basin properties traded and is expected to be accretive to excess of net cash provided by operating activities after distributions to unitholders;
			
		Total resource potential of approximately 67 MMBoe and approximately 27 MMBoe of proved reserves;
			
		Approximately 300 future drilling locations, significantly increasing the Company's California inventory;
			
		Tax efficient exchange of assets; and
			
		Credit positive from increased cash flow and reserves.
		&lt;p&gt;
	Following the closing of this transaction with ExxonMobil, LINN will have remaining production of approximately 10 MBoe/d and approximately 13,000 net acres in the Midland Basin that is prospective for horizontal Wolfcamp drilling. Mr. Ellis noted, "We continue to see strong interest in the market for a trade or sale of these remaining assets and believe there is significant additional value for our unitholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The transaction with ExxonMobil is subject to satisfactory completion of title and environmental due diligence, as well as the satisfaction of closing conditions.&#160;The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014 with an effective date of June 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Company based on management's experience and perception of current conditions, historical trends, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. These include risks relating to the Company's financial performance and results, availability of sufficient cash flow to pay distributions and execute its business plan, prices and demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, the ability to replace reserves and efficiently develop current reserves and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected as described in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

			Reserve Estimates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			The SEC permits oil and natural gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves that meet the SEC's definitions for such terms. The Issuers may use terms in this press release that the SEC's guidelines strictly prohibit in SEC filings, such as "estimated ultimate recovery" or "EUR," "resources," "net resources," "total resource potential" and similar terms to estimate oil and natural gas that may ultimately be recovered. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves as used in SEC filings and, accordingly, are subject to substantially greater uncertainty of being actually realized. These estimates have not been fully risked by management. Actual quantities that may be ultimately recovered will likely differ substantially from these estimates. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of the Company's actual drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, commodity prices, availability of drilling services and equipment, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, field spacing rules, actual recoveries of oil and natural gas in place, length of horizontal laterals, actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and other factors. These estimates may change significantly as the development of properties provides additional data. &lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: LINN Energy, LLC and LinnCo, LLC

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will close its Silicon Valley research-and-development operation as part of 2,100 layoffs announced on Thursday, as it moves toward its new CEO's goal of cutting 18,000 staff, or about 14 percent of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News of the closure of the Microsoft Research lab at the company's campus in Mountain View, California, was first made public on Twitter by employees. The company later confirmed the move and said it would involve the loss of 50 jobs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman said Microsoft Research, which has over 1,000 scientists and engineers worldwide working on new product ideas, will consolidate its U.S. work at Microsoft's main campus in Redmond, Washington, and in offices in New York and Boston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the cuts, Microsoft said it will still have 2,500 employees at its Mountain View campus, not far from rival Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is cutting 160 jobs in California on Thursday, and another 747 in the Seattle area, a spokesman said, as part of a total of 2,100 layoffs around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second wave of cuts after it laid off 13,000 in July, which marked the start of Chief Executive Satya Nadella's plan to lay off 18,000 people overall. That means 2,900 more layoffs coming over the next nine months or so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's cuts were spread over different countries and teams, the spokesman said. The last wave of cuts mostly affected the handset business of Nokia, which Microsoft bought earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

public on Twitter by employees. The company later confirmed the
move and said it would involve the loss of 50 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman said Microsoft Research, which has over 1,000
scientists and engineers worldwide working on new product ideas,
will consolidate its U.S. work at Microsoft's main campus in
Redmond, Washington, and in offices in New York and Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the cuts, Microsoft said it will still have 2,500
employees at its Mountain View campus, not far from rival Google
Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is cutting 160 jobs in California on Thursday, and
another 747 in the Seattle area, a spokesman said, as part of a
total of 2,100 layoffs around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second wave of cuts after it laid off 13,000 in
July, which marked the start of Chief Executive Satya Nadella's
plan to lay off 18,000 people overall. That means 2,900 more
layoffs coming over the next nine months or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's cuts were spread over different countries and
teams, the spokesman said. The last wave of cuts mostly affected
the handset business of Nokia, which Microsoft bought earlier
this year.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp made a
second round of layoffs on Thursday, moving towards its target
of cutting 18,000 staff, or about 14 percent of its workforce,
as Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella tries to slim down the
giant software company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gave notice to 2,100 employees on Thursday, 747 of
those in the Seattle area, a company spokesman said. That is in
addition to 13,000 laid off in July, which means a further 2,900
are set to be laid off over the next nine months or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's cuts were spread over different countries and

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Monitise Plc lost more than a third of its market value after Visa Inc, its biggest customer, revealed plans to divest its stake in the company and pursue development of its own mobile payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, said it was "considering its options" regarding its 5.5 percent stake in Monitise, which processes mobile payments, purchases and transfers worth $88 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visa intends to continue increasing its investment in its own in-house capabilities and, as a result, reducing its use of external resources," Visa said on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitise, co-managed by a former Visa executive, is contracted to provide mobile banking services to Visa until 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 290 million pounds (about $475 million) of Monitise's market capitalization was wiped off on Thursday, making it the biggest percentage loser on the London Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With tech giants Google Inc and Apple Inc launching free mobile payment systems, the role of traditional mobile payment companies are under question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I were Visa, I would ask: What is Monitise bringing to the table in a world of Apple and Google?

The U.S.-based hedge fund manager owns an 11.27 percent stake in the company, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc first invested in Monitise in 2009, when the company's revenue was about 3 million pounds and the mobile payments market was still young. It has reduced its original 14.4 percent stake over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitise, founded in 2003, has had a tumultuous 2014, with its stock falling about 37 percent this year through Wednesday's close.

			New AQtime 8.22 by SmartBear Supports Visual Studio 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SmartBear 
      Software, the choice of more than two million software professionals 
      for building and delivering the world&#8217;s best applications, has added 
      functionality to its already popular AQtime 
      Pro tool for application runtime analysis and performance profiling, 
      including full support for Visual 
      Studio 2013. AQtime Pro allows developers to profile applications 
      directly within the IDE as well as extend Visual Studio test projects 
      with AQtime Pro projects and run them in Visual Studio or as part of 
      team builds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the past, Visual Studio developers had to bounce between their 
      environment and profiling tool, slowing them down during crucial 
      development steps. New AQtime Pro 8.22 eliminates the back-and-forth 
      with simple to use functionality built right into their environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to supporting Visual Studio 2013, AQtime Pro now includes 
      support for 64-bit 
      C++Builder. AQtime Pro can now profile applications created with 
      64-bit versions of C++Builder XE3-XE6. AQtime Pro traces exceptions that 
      occur in 64-bit C++Builder applications and displays the exception text, 
      the call stack along with class and function names in the Event View 
      panel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to provide AQtime Pro support for Visual Studio 2013 and 
      64-bit C++Builder,&#8221; said Mark 
      Hammer, Senior Product Director at SmartBear. &#8220;AQtime is a premier 
      tool that developers rely on for profiling and detecting performance 
      bottlenecks, memory leaks and other issues. These integrations allow a 
      whole new group of developers to take advantage of this functionality.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Panzura's Patented Global File Locking Enables Customers to Use Microsoft Azure for Cross-Site Collaboration and All Tiers of Storage&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;CAMPBELL, CA--(Marketwired - Sep 18, 2014) -  Panzura, the pioneer of next generation enterprise storage infrastructure for the cloud era, announced today it is adding support for Microsoft Azure, helping to transform cloud storage into a globally distributed, enterprise class file system.&#160;Panzura adds this new offering so that customers can enable collaboration between users at distributed offices and use Microsoft Azure Storage not just for DR and backup, but also as primary storage.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panzura's patented global file locking technology and Azure Storage enable enterprises to treat their globally disbursed operations as one infinitely large workgroup.&#160;Using Panzura and Azure Storage enables companies to keep the in-office performance they need while centralizing their data with infinite scalability, better cost models and a higher level of security.&#160;Panzura works with Microsoft Azure to provide the storage fabric that solves cross-site collaboration issues with latency and bandwidth sensitive applications and provides all tiers of storage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recent price reductions in cloud storage are setting up the cloud as the new generation in storage and file systems," said Randy Chou, co-founder and CEO of Panzura. "Panzura's global file system with patented file locking is the transformative technology that turns cloud storage into an enterprise class file system. But there has to be a new storage architecture that takes advantage of this new datacenter concept. Using Microsoft Azure encourages CIOs to rethink their storage strategy and determine whether they need to continue buying on-premise storage arrays or focus on storage as a utility."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Panzura is at the cutting edge of the transformation of cloud storage into enterprise-wide file systems," said Danielle Allen, Senior Product Marketing Manager, Microsoft Azure at Microsoft Corp. "The economics of cloud storage alone are compelling. There are also significant business benefits to cross-site collaboration, and Panzura is driving innovation in this area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panzura has been proven to empower customers to work cohesively across multiple sites, regardless of location. Panzura's unique file locking capability reduces file open and sync time of users in distributed sites from 20 minutes to 10 seconds, truly enabling all users to work as if they were in the same room. In one customer case, Panzura enables collaboration across 265 different sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is essential for our business to be able to collaborate across sites for projects without corrupting each other's files," said Sam Ghnaim, Director of IT at Essex Property Trust. "At Essex Property Trust, we tried many different products out there and vendors would initially tell you they had a file locking system in place. As we got deeper into the meetings and tried out the technology, it wasn't a true file locking solution. Panzura had the only true file locking system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More Information and Availability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panzura's new solution will be available for release in September 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Panzura&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panzura is the catalyst in the transformation of cloud storage into high-performance enterprise file systems.&#160;Panzura's revolutionary global locking file system seamlessly combines the flexibility, performance and productivity benefits of distributed storage with the manageability, security and economics of centralized storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Panzura, the cloud -- public or private -- not only serves as every tier of storage, it becomes the fabric that enables globally distributed teams rapid file access and easy collaboration.&#160;Panzura delivers one file system across hundreds of offices that allows users to work together as if they were in the same room.&#160;For more information, visit www.panzura.com.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Hosting Infrastructure Services Market 
      2014-2018: Leading Vendors are Amazon Web Services, ATT, Go Daddy, 
      Google, HP  IBM
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hk9slp/global_hosting) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Hosting Infrastructure Services Market 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Hosting Infrastructure Services market 
      to grow at a CAGR of 8.68% over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hosting infrastructure services is a provision model where an enterprise 
      outsources IT equipment to support business operations such as storage, 
      hardware, networking, and servers, or rents out the services of an 
      entire infrastructure from a third-party vendor. Hosting infrastructure 
      services include website infrastructure management and digital content 
      management. These services help enterprises to reduce the operational 
      costs of setting up an enterprise infrastructure and concentrate on core 
      business activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The emergence of cloud-based computing is an emerging trend in the 
      market, which has increased the adoption of hosting infrastructure 
      solutions among enterprises.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      growing need among enterprises to reduce the costs associated with 
      organizational infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges that this 
      market faces is the inability to comply with service level agreements. 
      The decreasing cost of hosting services and the advances in technology 
      are leading to service delivery problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Hosting Infrastructure Services market is divided into four: 
      managed hosting, colocation services, hybrid hosting, and virtual 
      private servers.

&lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - A string of missteps at a $10 billion Angolan liquefied natural gas venture has hurt Chevron Corp's reputation as a top-notch operator of profitable energy projects around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer John Watson vowed Chevron will learn from the stumbles, which include multiple electrical fires, pipeline leaks, and even a worker's death after a rig collapsed last summer. The company plans to have the LNG project up and running by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, we're accountable for it," Watson said in an interview with Reuters. "There have been some lessons learned on that (Angolan) project. But I don't point fingers. This is our responsibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frank comments, unusual for a major corporate leader, come as Wall Street pressures major energy companies to maintain or boost production to keep profits flowing - a goal made increasingly harder by the rising costs of finding remote oil and natural gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Angolan trouble led Chevron to create an internal project management system to better track contractors and subcontractors on major projects, Watson said. Chevron is the largest stakeholder in the Angolan project, with partners that include Total SA, BP Plc, ENI SpA and Angola's Sonangol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've learned from the experiences at Angola LNG and other projects, working to make sure those same issues, or issues like them, don't happen on the next generation of projects," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson's comments on the Angola project should help assuage concern the delay could cause the company to miss its 2014 production goals, roughly 2.61 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're still on track to reach that," Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Angolan mishaps will help Chevron as it moves forward on engineering and design for its Kitimat LNG project in British Columbia, Watson said, an indication Chevron is unlikely to pull the plug even after Apache Corp quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is also nearing completion on two massive LNG projects off the Australian coast to supply Asian markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHALE THREAT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as Chevron works on LNG projects, the rise of the North American shale industry has boosted global supplies of natural gas. Chevron is a major natural gas producer in Pennsylvania's Marcellus region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the company is struggling to lock-in sales contracts for its Gorgon LNG plant in Australia, the world's most-expensive LNG operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Australia, seven LNG projects should be online by 2017, which, taken with the North American shale renaissance, have raised concerns about global oversupply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brushing aside any worry, Watson referenced Japan, which is fazing out nuclear power, and China, with a rapidly rising middle class, as major customers. Chevron has said global LNG demand will double from 2012 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the demand will be strong for LNG for many years to come," Watson added. "Many countries that don't have these resources will continue to be major sources of demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Terry Wade and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

      Visa to Undertake Assessment of Stake in Monitise
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Follows Multi-Year Global Alliance with Monitise for Mobile Money 
      Platform Development Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Longstanding partners in the mobile sector Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and 
      Monitise plc entered into an alliance agreement in 2009. At the same 
      time, Visa began investing in Monitise. Given the maturation of Monitise 
      as a company, Visa is considering its options with respect to the 
      investment and has engaged J.P. Morgan Securities Plc to assist. Visa 
      will also be lessening its dependence on external mobile development 
      resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2009, in conjunction with its commercial partnership, Visa invested 
      in Monitise as a 14.4% owner of the company in order to provide capital 
      support to a leader in the evolution of the mobile payments sector. Over 
      time, Visa&#8217;s holdings have been reduced to its current 5.5% stake in the 
      company. This reduction in ownership and associated influence is 
      consistent with Visa&#8217;s investment practice to seed emerging players and, 
      over time, taper that influence as the partner company grows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under their agreement, Monitise will provide Visa with mobile platform 
      development services through 2016. As both Visa and the payments 
      industry evolve at a rapid pace, Visa intends to continue increasing its 
      investment in its own in-house capabilities and, as a result, reducing 
      its use of external resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa has benefited substantially from our relationship with and 
      financial investment in Monitise,&#8221; said Bill Sheedy, EVP of Corporate 
      Strategy, Visa Inc. &#8220;Visa invested in Monitise as an early thought 
      leader with a vision of making mobile banking mainstream and extending 
      that functionality to mobile payments. Over the past 5 years, Monitise 
      has successfully demonstrated its leadership in the sector underscored 
      by the company&#8217;s marquee clients, multiple network partnerships and 
      recent agreement with IBM. Consistent with Visa&#8217;s increased investment 
      in our in-house capabilities, and the substantial growth in Monitise, 
      Visa is considering its options with regard to its Monitise stake.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Middle Eastern banks bought the
vast majority of a debut $500 million sukuk issue by Goldman
Sachs, a positive sign for other conventional banks
hoping to tap the region's liquidity by issuing Islamic debt,
according to data from lead managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman priced its five-year sukuk on Tuesday at a profit
rate of 2.844 percent, drawing about $1.5 billion of investor
orders, after roadshows in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only the second sukuk issue from a conventional bank
outside a predominantly Muslim country; HSBC issued
$500 million of sukuk in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle East investors bought 87 percent of the Goldman
sukuk, while 11 percent went to Europe and 2 percent to Asian
investors, a document from lead arrangers showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks bought 77 percent of the bonds, asset managers bought
22 percent and private banks bought 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An initial attempt by Goldman to sell sukuk three years ago,
when it announced a $2 billion issuance programme, ran into
controversy after some analysts said it might violate Islamic
bans on interest payments and monetary speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the bank insisted that those concerns were
unfounded, it never went ahead with the 2011 issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, Goldman adjusted the sukuk structure and enlisted
heavyweight Gulf banks to arrange the sale, and it appeared to
avoid any controversy. Goldman picked itself, Abu Dhabi Islamic
Bank, Emirates NBD, National Bank of Abu
Dhabi, Qatar's QInvest and the investment banking arm
of Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank IPO-NACO.SE to
arrange the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France's Societe Generale and Japan's Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ set up sukuk programmes in
Malaysia this year, but have not issued yet.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said on Friday it will wind down drilling in Russia's Arctic in the face of U.S. sanctions targeting Western cooperation with Moscow's oil sector, after the Obama administration granted a brief extension to safely mothball its operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington extended sanctions on Russia last week over its aggression in Ukraine. The new measures seek to stop billions of dollars worth of cooperation between Western and Russian energy companies on oil drilling in Russia's Arctic, in Siberia and offshore. Companies have until Sept. 26 to stop the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department gave Exxon a short extension to wind down a rig, beyond the 14 days outlined in the sanctions, the Texas-based oil major said on Friday without elaborating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following the short time extension, the license is non-renewable and no further work is permitted," Exxon spokesman Richard Keil told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Exxon began moving a rig called West Alpha from Norway to the Russian Arctic. The company is hoping for a major crude discovery in the Kara Sea with Russian state oil company Rosneft, with which it signed a $3.2 billion agreement in 2011 to develop the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said the Treasury granted a license to it and other U.S. contractors and individuals involved with the University-1 well, where the rig was drilling, "to enable the safe and responsible winding down of operations" related to the well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sanctions could affect other major oil companies, including BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analyst said Friday's move showed the Obama administration's willingness to tailor sanctions to accommodate challenges associated with complicated business projects in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The flexibility it demonstrates offers serious relief to international oil and gas companies concerned about the reach and effect of tough U.S. sanctions," said Elizabeth Rosenberg, who worked on sanctions at the Treasury Department and now heads the energy program at the Center for a New American Security.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department said it does not comment on license applications or requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. sanctions seek to slow Russia's future oil production by banning U.S. and European Union cooperation on all energy services and technology in Russia's unconventional oil fields. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia is one of the world's top crude producers and the biggest supplier to Europe, but its reservoirs are in decline and it must look to new sources to retain its positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DELAYS IN THE KARA SEA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Exxon ceases operations, it must take measures to stabilize the well that could include plugging it with cement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment bank Simmons said the Kara Sea well, estimated to cost over $600 million, is one of the most important exploration prospects in the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stoppage could delay plans for fully developing the Kara Sea fields in 2016 and 2017. Drilling results from the well had been expected to be revealed later this year, Simmons added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A drillship owned by North Atlantic Drilling Ltd, a unit of Seadrill Ltd, had reportedly been hired to do the work for more than half a million dollars per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Friday, Russian Natural Resources Minister Sergei Donskoi told Reuters that Exxon was continuing exploration drilling in the Kara Sea. He declined to provide details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources close to the project have said Exxon has no U.S. personnel on the rig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prospect of sanctions on Russia has been a big issue for Exxon this year. It spent $6 million on lobbying the U.S. government in the first half of 2014, and listed Russian sanctions as one of its lobbying issues, according to disclosures filed to the U.S. Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon also paid about another $170,000 to four outside firms for lobbying in the second quarter, largely tied to Russian sanctions, the disclosures show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares closed up about 0.5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange at $97.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Timothy Gardner, additional reporting by Anna Driver and Terry Wade in Houston and Jason Lange and Anna Yukhananov in Washington; Editing by Grant McCool, Paul Simao and Tom Brown)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
has promoted Gary Rapp to head of U.S. investment grade trading,
people familiar with the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapp had previously been the head credit trader in the
financials sector at the Wall Street bank, said the people, who
were not authorized to publicly discuss internal personnel
matters. His promotion was announced in a memo earlier this
week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapp is a managing director who joined Goldman in 1999. He
reports to Jason Brauth, a partner who heads both investment
grade and high-yield credit trading for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credit trading business, overseen globally at Goldman
Sachs by Justin Gmelich, involves trading corporate bonds,
municipal bonds, bank loans and related derivatives.

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2011-PLSD; Revises Outlooks
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust 2011-PLSD and revised Rating Outlooks on 
      classes D and X-B to Negative from Stable. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.

      The affirmations are the result of sufficient credit enhancement 
      relative to the current ratings. Property performance has generally 
      remained stable. At issuance the property was 91.6% leased and 90% 
      occupied. Per the second quarter of 2014 (2Q'14) rent roll, the property 
      was 94.5% occupied and 95.4% leased. While occupancy has improved at the 
      property, the year-end (YE) 2013 debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) has 
      declined to 1.67x from 1.85x at issuance, due to a lower aggregate base 
      rent figure. The Negative Outlooks on classes D and X-B are assigned 
      based on increased competition in the subject's local market and the 
      risk of higher expenses should certain tax abatements not be renewed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The loan is secured by 1.94 million square feet (sf) of the 2.26 million 
      sf Palisades Center, a super-regional mall located in West Nyack, NY. 
      The anchors, Macy's and Lord  Taylor, own their own spaces. The in-line 
      tenancy consists of over 200 diverse retail and entertainment tenants.

      The opening of Shops at Nanuet in October 2013, a 750,000 sf 
      redevelopement located approximately five miles away from the subject, 
      has slightly affected the subject's collateral performance. A number of 
      former tenants, including The Gap, Apple Store, and Banana Republic, 
      vacated the subject upon lease expiration as they have opened stores at 
      the new location. Several tenants also with a presence at the Shops at 
      Nanuet have upcoming lease expirations at the Palisades Center, 
      including Gap Body, Ann Taylor, Loft, and White House and Black Market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of its review, Fitch analyzed the performance of the loan and 
      its underlying collateral. Fitch modeled cash flow based on the YE 2013 
      OSAR and 2Q'14 rent roll. The real estate tax expense was based on 
      actual 2014 tax bill. Fitch stressed the cash flow by excluding revenue 
      from month-to-month leases and several tenants with lease rollover in 
      2014 and 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fitch stressed DSCR for the loan is 1.38x, compared to 1.40x at 
      issuance which was based on trailing 12 month (TTM) Sept. 30, 2011 
      financials. The Fitch stressed loan-to-value ratio is 66.1%, which is 
      based on capitalization of the Fitch-adjusted net cash flow at a rate of 
      8%, compared to 63.3% at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates are collateralized by a five-year fixed rate (5.658%) 
      loan that is amortizing on a 30-year schedule. The current balance of 
      the loan is $361.7 million, reduced 3.4% from $374.6 million at 
      issuance. The loan matures in November 2016. In addition, there is a 
      $150 million mezzanine debt held outside the trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch will continue to monitor the leasing activity at the center. Since 
      issuance, the tenant mix has shifted as large national chain stores 
      moved out after their lease expirations. Mall sales per square foot 
      (psf) have decreased significantly from issuance. As of YE 2013, sales 
      for in-line tenants at the property declined to $433 psf from $537 psf 
      at YE 2012 ($463 excluding Apple), and $529 psf at issuance. Although 
      occupancy has increased, the net operating income (NOI) decreased 9.7% 
      from issuance. In 2014, the property benefitted from a large real estate 
      tax reduction after a reassessment. In the event the property is 
      assessed to a higher value in the future, property cash flow could be 
      affected. Fitch will review this transaction in early 2015. If 
      performance continues to deteriorate, future downgrades to classes D and 
      X-B are possible.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. has put its Torrance, California, refinery on the block, according to two people familiar with the matter, making it the latest big oil company to consider exiting the state amid tougher environmental standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Torrance has been looked at extensively," said one of the people, who was not authorized to speak about the sale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 155,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery, in the south part of Los Angeles, is Exxon's only refinery in California and the second-smallest of its half-dozen plants in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon Mobil spokesman said the company does not comment on market rumors or speculation, adding that the firm "regularly evaluates its global portfolio of businesses and opportunities for growth, restructuring or divestment, in accordance with the company&#8217;s overall strategic business objectives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said ExxonMobil remains committed to conducting business in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP halted refining in the state with the sale of its Carson, California, plant to Tesoro last year.&#160;Shell sold its Wilmington refinery to Tesoro in 2007, leaving it with a single plant in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California's environmental regulations make it a difficult state for refiners to operate in. Refiners including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Tesoro and Valero already operate two or more refineries in the state, limiting their ability to buy others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite regulatory difficulties, PBF Energy Inc has said it has mulled refinery purchases in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBF has been "looking at opportunities particularly in California, and we say particularly in California because that's where most of the opportunities have been, it's a market where we have as a team experience, it's a very difficult market," Executive Chairman Tom O'Malley said on the company's earnings call last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I always warn our team that when we look at California, we must look at it to some degree almost as a different country and as a different set of requirements, but we're familiar with them and certainly we have lived with them in the past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potential buyers could include private equity firms, according to the two people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's Torrance refinery has imported crude from Australia, Ecuador, and Chad since 2012, according to Energy Information Administration data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting By Jessica Resnick-Ault; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has hired an investment bank to identify potential buyers of its 54,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Kapolei on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, a company official said. &lt;/p&gt;

			JPMorgan Chase  Co. Announces Two-Year, $35 Million Commitment to 
      Improve Consumer Financial Security
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Multi-year effort will help struggling consumers avoid costly payday 
      loans by providing proven, affordable financial solutions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Former First Lady of California Maria Shriver commends JPMorgan Chase 
      for the development of innovative solutions to help customers solve 
      financial insecurity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JPMorgan 
      Chase  Co. today announced a two-year, $35 million commitment 
      to help individuals and families save money, build credit and improve 
      economic opportunities in communities around the world. The grants will 
      provide best-in-class national and regional nonprofit organizations with 
      the resources to help individuals acquire the knowledge, skills and 
      tools needed to promote financial security while avoiding costly 
      services like payday loans or check cashing outlets for assistance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This commitment builds on the efforts of the Financial Solutions LabSM, 
      a separate five-year, $30 million program developed earlier this year by 
      JPMorgan Chase and the Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI), 
      to identify, test and scale innovative financial products and services 
      to improve financial security.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;To successfully manage their daily finances and plan for the future, 
      individuals need more than basic financial literacy,&#8221; Sally Durdan, 
      Executive Vice President and Head of Strategy, Chase Consumer  
      Community Banking, will say today during the Corporation for 
      Enterprise Development&#8217;s (CFED) Assets Learning Conference in 
      Washington, D.C. &#8220;They need actionable, well-timed information and 
      sustainable financial&#160;products&#160;designed around their needs.&#160;With this 
      $35 million commitment, JPMorgan Chase will help individuals around the 
      world increase savings, improve credit and build assets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ramifications of financial insecurity go well beyond the individuals 
      who struggle to save money and build credit. According to recent 
      research from the University of North Carolina Center for Community 
      Capital and JPMorgan Chase, financial insecurity reduces worker 
      employability and productivity; increases demand for public services; 
      impedes recovery from the recent recession; and undermines long-term 
      economic growth and productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The financial insecurity of American families is one of the most 
      commonly discussed societal problems,&#8221; said Maria Shriver, former 
      First Lady of California and founder of The Shriver Report. &#8220;As we 
      reported in the most recent Shriver Report: 'A Woman&#8217;s Nation Pushes 
      Back from the Brink,&#8217;&#160;today, more than one in three Americans&#8212;more than 
      100 million people&#8212;live in poverty or on the edge of it. This challenge 
      requires new financial solutions, and it&#8217;s great that JPMorgan Chase is 
      providing the necessary support to tackle financial insecurity head on.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To address these challenges, the $35 million grant commitment, some of 
      which is already being put to use by nonprofit organizations, from 
      JPMorgan Chase will focus on three key areas to promote financial 
      security:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Innovate by investing in the development of affordable, 
        easy-to-use and technology-driven consumer products and services 
        designed to meet consumer needs;
      
			
				Expand the availability of these innovative products and 
        services; and
      
			
				Inform community partners and providers by sharing best 
        practices to enhance financial capability efforts.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      For example, at today&#8217;s CFED conference, JPMorgan Chase announced a 
      two-year, $1.75 million grant to support CFED&#8217;s Platforms for Prosperity 
      Fund. This new initiative will support the ability of nonprofits to 
      integrate financial capability strategies into existing social service 
      programs, such as workforce training, affordable housing and health care 
      programs. The Fund will help low-to-moderate income individuals become 
      more financially secure and improve the capacity of asset building 
      organizations throughout the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Notable Statements of Support
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The funding provided by JPMorgan Chase will allow us to continue our 
      work to build the capacity of nonprofit partners so that they are better 
      able to incorporate financial capability training into their existing 
      programs,&#8221; said Andrea Levere, President, CFED. &#8220;The value in 
      this integration comes when individuals and families receive targeted 
      financial coaching and products that empower them to not only make 
      immediate, important financial decisions with the support of their 
      community partner, but also gives them the tools they need to make 
      decisions on their own in the future.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;We&#8217;re honored to be the recipient of a $300,000 grant to support 
      an expansion of our goal-based savings platform that incentivizes LMI 
      individuals to save and invest in their futures,&#8221; said Nga Chiem, 
      interim CEO, EARN. &#8220;This support will help 2,500 new LMI savers open 
      savings accounts and 2,125 individuals save for&#160;6 consecutive months 
      with an average increase in savings of $120.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - ExxonMobil is still drilling in the Russian Arctic, a Russian minister said on Friday, in move that if confirmed will anger Washington after the U.S. administration slapped sanctions on Moscow to suspend such operations by Western oil majors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint drilling project in the Kara Sea between Exxon and the Kremlin's state oil firm Rosneft has become one of the most watched projects by the oil industry after the West ratcheted up sanctions on Moscow for its incursion in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two previous waves of sanctions have failed to stop Exxon from sending an oil drilling rig from Norway to the Russian waters in August in the hope to confirm billions of barrels of new oil reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the United States imposed sanctions banning joint exploration activities in the Russian Arctic, shale and deep water resources and giving companies 14 days to suspend projects, including those under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon is continuing exploration drilling in the Kara Sea," Russian Natural Resources Minister Sergei Donskoi told Reuters. He declined to provide details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft declined to comment, Exxon was not available for immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Exxon had halted drilling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources close to the project have said Exxon has no U.S. personnel on the rig. The company might also argue that an abrupt stoppage could increase operational and ecological risks, two sources said citing research done by lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rig was meant to finish drilling the well and leave the Russian waters in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Polina Devitt; Additional reporting by Denis Pinchuk; Editing by Elizabeth Piper and Susan Thomas)&lt;/p&gt;

			JPMorgan Chase  Co. Announces Two-Year, $35 Million Commitment to 
      Improve Consumer Financial Security
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Multi-year effort will help struggling consumers avoid costly payday 
      loans by providing proven, affordable financial solutions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Former First Lady of California Maria Shriver commends JPMorgan Chase 
      for the development of innovative solutions to help customers solve 
      financial insecurity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JPMorgan 
      Chase  Co. today announced a two-year, $35 million commitment 
      to help individuals and families save money, build credit and improve 
      economic opportunities in communities around the world. The grants will 
      provide best-in-class national and regional nonprofit organizations with 
      the resources to help individuals acquire the knowledge, skills and 
      tools needed to promote financial security while avoiding costly 
      services like payday loans or check cashing outlets for assistance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This commitment builds on the efforts of the Financial Solutions LabSM, 
      a separate five-year, $30 million program developed earlier this year by 
      JPMorgan Chase and the Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI), 
      to identify, test and scale innovative financial products and services 
      to improve financial security.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;To successfully manage their daily finances and plan for the future, 
      individuals need more than basic financial literacy,&#8221; Sally Durdan, 
      Executive Vice President and Head of Strategy, Chase Consumer  
      Community Banking, will say today during the Corporation for 
      Enterprise Development&#8217;s (CFED) Assets Learning Conference in 
      Washington, D.C. &#8220;They need actionable, well-timed information and 
      sustainable financial&#160;products&#160;designed around their needs.&#160;With this 
      $35 million commitment, JPMorgan Chase will help individuals around the 
      world increase savings, improve credit and build assets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ramifications of financial insecurity go well beyond the individuals 
      who struggle to save money and build credit. According to recent 
      research from the University of North Carolina Center for Community 
      Capital and JPMorgan Chase, financial insecurity reduces worker 
      employability and productivity; increases demand for public services; 
      impedes recovery from the recent recession; and undermines long-term 
      economic growth and productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The financial insecurity of American families is one of the most 
      commonly discussed societal problems,&#8221; said Maria Shriver, former 
      First Lady of California and founder of The Shriver Report. &#8220;As we 
      reported in the most recent Shriver Report: 'A Woman&#8217;s Nation Pushes 
      Back from the Brink,&#8217;&#160;today, more than one in three Americans&#8212;more than 
      100 million people&#8212;live in poverty or on the edge of it. This challenge 
      requires new financial solutions, and it&#8217;s great that JPMorgan Chase is 
      providing the necessary support to tackle financial insecurity head on.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To address these challenges, the $35 million grant commitment, some of 
      which is already being put to use by nonprofit organizations, from 
      JPMorgan Chase will focus on three key areas to promote financial 
      security:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Innovate by investing in the development of affordable, 
        easy-to-use and technology-driven consumer products and services 
        designed to meet consumer needs;
      
			
				Expand the availability of these innovative products and 
        services; and
      
			
				Inform community partners and providers by sharing best 
        practices to enhance financial capability efforts.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      For example, at today&#8217;s CFED conference, JPMorgan Chase announced a 
      two-year, $1.75 million grant to support CFED&#8217;s Platforms for Prosperity 
      Fund. This new initiative will support the ability of nonprofits to 
      integrate financial capability strategies into existing social service 
      programs, such as workforce training, affordable housing and health care 
      programs. The Fund will help low-to-moderate income individuals become 
      more financially secure and improve the capacity of asset building 
      organizations throughout the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Notable Statements of Support
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The funding provided by JPMorgan Chase will allow us to continue our 
      work to build the capacity of nonprofit partners so that they are better 
      able to incorporate financial capability training into their existing 
      programs,&#8221; said Andrea Levere, President, CFED. &#8220;The value in 
      this integration comes when individuals and families receive targeted 
      financial coaching and products that empower them to not only make 
      immediate, important financial decisions with the support of their 
      community partner, but also gives them the tools they need to make 
      decisions on their own in the future.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;We&#8217;re honored to be the recipient of a $300,000 grant to support 
      an expansion of our goal-based savings platform that incentivizes LMI 
      individuals to save and invest in their futures,&#8221; said Nga Chiem, 
      interim CEO, EARN. &#8220;This support will help 2,500 new LMI savers open 
      savings accounts and 2,125 individuals save for&#160;6 consecutive months 
      with an average increase in savings of $120.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;JPMorgan Chase committed $150,000 to enhance MoneyThink&#8217;s smart 
      phone app and curriculum to help 11th- and 12th-grade students build 
      better financial awareness, skills and habits in their daily lives,&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;SOCHI, Russia, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Russia's biggest oil
producer Rosneft said on Saturday that Exxon Mobil
 was still continuing exploration drilling at their joint
project in the Arctic Kara Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The work on the University well is continuing according to
plan. We are satisfied with the decision of the U.S. regulator
which gave the relevant permission to Exxon," Larisa Kalanda, a
vice president of Rosneft, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said on Friday that the U.S. Treasury Department gave
it a short extension to wind down a rig at the well, beyond the
14 days outlined in the sanctions targeting Western cooperation
with Russia's oil sector in response to Moscow's role in the
Ukraine crisis.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Repairs on the 120,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit, shut since late July, at Exxon Mobil Corp's 344,600 bpd Beaumont, Texas refinery are expected to continue for another 30 days, sources familiar with operations at the refinery said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has scaled back a planned overhaul, set to begin in October, of a hydrocracking unit at the Beaumont refinery to devote resources to the FCCU repairs, said the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the HCU work is being rescheduled to an overhaul planned at the refinery for March, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon spokesman confirmed on Monday that the FCCU remained out of production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to work toward restoring normal operations," said Exxon spokesman Lee Dula. "We anticipate some impact to production but contractual commitments continue to be met."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCCU was shut in late July due to a boiler malfunction. Initially repairs were expected to take between one week and three weeks. An attempt to restart the cat cracker failed on Aug. 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They aren't making as much money as they want to be with the FCC still down," said one of the sources. "They're spending an astronomical amount of money getting it fixed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work on the 65,000-bpd hydrocracker has already been pushed back from late August to October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hydrocracker uses hydrogen to make motor fuels from gas oil produced by a refinery crude unit. Unlike the FCC, the hydrocracking unit makes nearly equal amounts of diesel and gasoline. Increasing diesel production has been lucrative for U.S. refiners that have increased profits with diesel exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by David Gregorio and Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RICHMOND (Reuters) - Virginia said on Monday it had dropped lawsuits against two units of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co JPM.N that accused them of defrauding the state's retirement fund in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and WaMu Capital Corp, were among 13 that Virginia Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring sued last week. He is seeking $1.15 billion in damages, charging the banks misled the Virginia Retirement System about the quality of loans in investments purchased between 2004 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herring's office said in a statement it had identified a confidential settlement agreement for $3 million that barred further action against J.P. Morgan Securities and WaMu Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herring's Republican predecessor, Ken Cuccinelli, and the previous governor, Robert McDonnell, had approved the terms, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Accordingly, we have 'non-suited' them, meaning they have been removed as defendants," the statement said. It added that state law allowed Virginia to revive the claims within six months if circumstances permitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herring said last week that an analysis showed nearly 40 percent of the mortgages that backed 220 securities the fund purchased were fraudulently represented as posing a lower risk of default than they actually did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the fund lost $383 million when it was forced to sell the securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case follows many other states' resolution of similar cases over losses that state funds suffered from pools of mortgages considered to be at the center of the 2008 financial crisis.

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Mexican cartels are working from within Colombia to traffic cocaine and taking a more active role in production of illegal drugs, Colombia's anti-narcotics director said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have discovered that there are Mexican cartels which have arrived in Colombia basically to negotiate and transport the drug themselves," General Ricardo Restrepo of the national police told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gives them better returns and means Colombian traffickers are at less risk of being captured or caught in foreign judicial investigations," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombian authorities have said for years that Mexican cartels have ties to local cocaine producers, but this is the first time they have mentioned the presence of active foreign traffickers in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not name the cartels involved in sending operatives, but Colombian authorities have previously reported arrests of alleged members of the Sinaloa and the Zetas cartels, as well as seizures of drugs shipments presumably destined for those groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia is one of the world's largest producers of cocaine, with an estimated output of 290 tons per year, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation's once-prolific drug cartels now act primarily as producers, after being weakened by a U.S.-backed military offensive and losing control of trafficking routes to Mexican groups, which now take the lead in smuggling narcotics like cocaine, heroin and marijuana to the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leftist rebel groups, as well as crime gangs made up of right-wing ex-paramilitaries, are said to be deeply involved in narcotics production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Steve Cho, Former Executive at Kiip and IBM, Joins Lootsie as Chief 
      Operating Officer
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lootsie, a mobile loyalty reward company, has snapped up a recognizable 
      name in the mobile rewards space to become the company&#8217;s Chief Operating 
      Officer. Steve Cho is joining the company from Kiip, a rewards network, 
      where he served as vice-president of business development and was 
      instrumental in building Kiip&#8217;s Reward Network with top developers 
      resulting in 160x growth. Cho brings more than 10 years leadership 
      experience in sales, management, and business development and will be 
      based out of Lootsie&#8217;s Los Angeles headquarters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lootsie offers a new type of engagement platform for brands and 
      developers that focuses exclusively on building emotional connections 
      between brands and their audience, while better engaging and retaining 
      users within apps. Lootsie works a lot like credit card rewards points, 
      but for mobile apps. Consumers earn points for hitting achievements in 
      all their favorite apps that they can redeem for real-world rewards 
      (like a $25 gift card to BCBG or a free cupcake from Sprinkles Cupcakes) 
      which Lootsie directly partners with brands to offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While at Kiip, Cho led all business development efforts, which includes 
      all vertical expansion of the network, strategic partnerships, and 
      alliances. He grew the Kiip Network from 9 mobile games to more than 
      2,000, expanded the company&#8217;s presence into new app verticals, such as 
      in Health and Fitness, Productivity, Lifestyle, and Music, and managed 
      all facets of developer relations from partnership, integration, 
      operations, and community. Prior to Kiip, Cho served as Software Sales 
      Leader with IBM Software Group solutions, leading sales efforts with 
      strategy, planning, management, and execution to create a multi-million 
      dollar business within IBM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While at Kiip, Steve built out complete infrastructures from the ground 
      up in an industry that is just beginning to scratch the surface of its 
      potential and he has a track record for driving hyper growth at scale. 
      He has a keen sense of where this space is heading and how important it 
      is to create more effective and creative solutions for brands and 
      developers who want to acquire new customers and create new revenue 
      streams while providing a rich and valuable experience for users,&#8221; said 
      Marc Mitchell, CEO and Co-Founder of Lootsie. &#8220;When it comes to the 
      intersection of mobile advertising and mobile rewards, there's not a 
      single person better equipped to take on this role as we enter into the 
      next chapter of our growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In his new role, Cho will focus on business strategies and partnerships 
      to help shape the direction of Lootsie&#8217;s future product and business 
      initiatives as Lootsie begins to expand both internationally and across 
      verticals. He will also oversee the business development team and 
      efforts to bring on-board developer partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Compared to obtrusive and annoying banner ads and pop-ups, rewards are 
      becoming one of the most effective engagement tools in mobile both for 
      brands and developers, as they&#8217;re the first offering to create a 
      reciprocal value exchange with users to ensure that brands and 
      developers have a leg up in the battle for a user's attention. While in 
      beta, Lootsie's platform is already showing conversion rates over 40X 
      the industry average, and has quickly become the go-to mobile 
      acquisition channel for top brands, developers and publishers, to 
      monetize and build loyalty with their audience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I'm a long-time avid mobile gamer and earning rewards in mobile gaming 
      is what got me into this space, which I'm still in love with to this 
      day. A few years ago rewarding users was a great concept, but today 
      you're seeing focused attention and allocation of resources from 
      developers and brands around user loyalty with retention and engagement, 
      and how rewards in gaming and apps can move the needle on both,&#8221; said 
      Steve Cho, COO of Lootsie. "Lootsie is one of just a handful of 
      companies that know how to tap into brand dollars in the space and the 
      product is uniquely positioned above them all to drive true loyalty in 
      mobile apps and games."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cho holds a B.S., International Political Economy from University of 
      Puget Sound and a MBA, Marketing from University of California, Davis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Lootsie
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lootsie is the simplest way to connect brands with their audience by 
      introducing the loyalty experience into mobile apps and games. Lootsie's 
      platform drives meaningful user engagement for brands by offering a

&lt;p&gt;(This version of the Sept. 19th  story corrects company name in paragraph 7 to Phillips 66, not ConocoPhillips)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jessica Resnick-Ault &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reuters)- Exxon Mobil Corp. has put its Torrance, California, refinery on the block, according to two people familiar with the matter, making it the latest big oil company to consider exiting the state amid tougher environmental standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Torrance has been looked at extensively," said one of the people, who was not authorized to speak about the sale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 155,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery, in the south part of Los Angeles, is Exxon's only refinery in California and the second-smallest of its half-dozen plants in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon Mobil spokesman said the company does not comment on market rumors or speculation, adding that the firm "regularly evaluates its global portfolio of businesses and opportunities for growth, restructuring or divestment, in accordance with the company&#8217;s overall strategic business objectives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said ExxonMobil remains committed to conducting business in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP halted refining in the state with the sale of its Carson, California, plant to Tesoro last year.&#160;Shell sold its Wilmington refinery to Tesoro in 2007, leaving it with a single plant in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California's environmental regulations make it a difficult state for refiners to operate in. Refiners including Chevron, Phillips 66, Tesoro and Valero already operate two or more refineries in the state, limiting their ability to buy others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite regulatory difficulties, PBF Energy Inc has said it has mulled refinery purchases in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBF has been "looking at opportunities particularly in California, and we say particularly in California because that's where most of the opportunities have been, it's a market where we have as a team experience, it's a very difficult market," Executive Chairman Tom O'Malley said on the company's earnings call last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I always warn our team that when we look at California, we must look at it to some degree almost as a different country and as a different set of requirements, but we're familiar with them and certainly we have lived with them in the past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potential buyers could include private equity firms, according to the two people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's Torrance refinery has imported crude from Australia, Ecuador, and Chad since 2012, according to Energy Information Administration data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting By Jessica Resnick-Ault; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

      A man's failure to sustain an erection that is adequate enough for 
      sexual activity is known as erectile dysfunction. It also refers to the 
      inconsistency to do so, or the inability to endure it for an extended 
      period. Erectile dysfunction can be due to a number of reasons including 
      aging, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, depression, smoking, 
      nerve or spinal cord damage, alcoholism, and low testosterone levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Treatments for erectile dysfunction include adopting a healthy 
      lifestyle, oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, vacuum 
      devices, and surgery. Erectile dysfunction affects the quality of life 
      and leads to stress, anxiety, and self-confidence problems. New research 
      is undergoing in the field of erectile dysfunction to find more enhanced 
      and effective therapies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the emerging trends in this market is an increase in awareness of 
      erectile dysfunction. The acceptability of erectile dysfunction drugs is 
      expected to increase owing to increasing public awareness about erectile 
      dysfunction and the need to treat it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers in the market is the 
      increase in aging population. The number of patients suffering from 
      erectile dysfunction is growing owing to increasing aging population 
      both in developing and developed countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges in the market 
      is the high cost of erectile dysfunction drugs. Despite numerous 
      benefits, the high cost of erectile dysfunction drugs hinders 
      acceptability among patients. Many patients do not have the required 
      budget for investing in high-cost treatment options.

		&lt;h1&gt;AVST Aligns Best-of-Breed UC Applications With Microsoft&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New IP Integration Between Lync and CX-E Elevates Enterprise Capabilities of Lync&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;FOOTHILL RANCH, CA--(Marketwired - Sep 22, 2014) -  Applied Voice  Speech Technologies, Inc. (AVST), a leading developer of software-based Unified Communications (UC) solutions, today announced a new direct IP integration between Microsoft&#174; Lync&#174; 2013 and AVST's CX-E UC platform.&#160;This integration creates an easy migration path for enterprises looking to transition their call control (PBX) infrastructure to Lync and enables the centralization of voice applications across multiple locations and an evolving PBX environment.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major trend in the UC market is Microsoft Lync's increasing market share, with the enterprise transition to Lync taking shape in one of two ways: either a business will move to Lync as its sole PBX platform or a business will integrate Lync into its existing PBX environment for a specific department or branch office.&#160;Regardless of which path an enterprise chooses, AVST's best-of-breed CX-E UC platform enables and extends Lync's Enterprise Voice core capabilities with mission-critical UC applications that include voicemail, speech automated attendant, personal assistant, call center, interactive voice response, notification and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lync 2013 becomes more viable as a PBX replacement with AVST's CX-E," said Dave Michels, Senior Analyst at Wainhouse Research. "One of the biggest considerations when deploying Lync as a standalone solution is that many customers do not want to store voicemail messages in Microsoft Exchange for confidentiality or compliance reasons.&#160;CX-E offers alternatives for voicemail storage while still offering a variety of mobile, web and desktop client applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AVST introduced its new Lync 2013 integration to augment Lync's core voice capabilities with the following CX-E UC applications:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Enterprise-class Voicemail -&#160;to support confidentiality and compliance requirements
            
				Speech and DTMF Automated Attendant - enterprise wide or department implementations
            
				Intelligent Call Completion - based on schedules and user presence
            
				Personal Assistant - enabling a mobile workforce
            
				Call Center - TeamQ&#8482; providing a cost-effective informal call center
            
				Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and Notification
			&lt;p&gt;Additionally, CX-E offers telephone user interface (TUI) emulations that minimize employee retraining; find-me/follow-me functionality based on presence information; and extensive automated attendant capabilities including menus based on day of week, time of day or specific location.&#160;All of these CX-E features strengthen and enhance the core capabilities of Lync 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to AVST President  CEO Hardy Myers, "The transition to Microsoft Lync is a significant trend that will shake up the overall enterprise communications landscape for years to come.&#160;Our corporate objective is to remain at the forefront of the major UC market trends by delivering the broadest interoperability on the market and developing UC applications that provide next generation communications capabilities for our customers while providing a bridge to their digital future.&#160;Our new integration to Microsoft Lync is the next step in this ongoing process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CX-E's Lync IP integration is available globally through AVST's established reseller channels.

      Research and Markets: Global Discrete  Embedded Application Management 
      Services Market 2014-2018: Leading Vendors are Accenture, IBM, Infosys  
      TCS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/wslr3b/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Application Management Services Market 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Application Management Services market to grow at a CAGR 
      of 5.5% over the period 2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major trends in the market is the increased demand for hosted 
      application management services. The hosted solution offers 
      organizations various advantages such as low cost, improved efficiency, 
      and easy installation. This has led to the vendors trying to provide 
      customized solutions for their clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one key driver in this market is the need to 
      enhance business productivity. Application management services help an 
      organization increase the efficiency of its business process, improve 
      business productivity, and reduce operating costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one major challenge in this market is 
      integration issues with existing legacy systems. Companies have to 
      undergo several checks to ensure the application management service 
      integrates seamlessly with other applications and is able to effectively 
      operate with existing systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer Announce Charitable Donations of More 
      Than $1 Million to Support Cardiovascular Education for Patients and 
      Caregivers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer 
      Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced charitable donations totaling more 
      than $1 million to be granted between 2014 and 2016 to seven nonprofit 
      organizations that support patients with cardiovascular disease. The 
      donations will fund the independent development of innovative 
      educational materials about stroke risk reduction in patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The materials, accessible to 
      both patients and caregivers, will address disease awareness, 
      identification of signs and symptoms, access to care, appropriate 
      treatment options, shared decision making and medication adherence. 
      National Stroke Association, Heart Rhythm Society, American College of 
      Physicians, American Heart Association Founders Affiliate, Regents of 
      the University of Michigan/Society for Vascular Medicine, WomenHeart and 
      American College of Emergency Physicians will each receive a charitable 
      donation to support their independent educational initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer are committed to helping patients 
      living with NVAF better understand their increased risk for stroke and 
      how to take action to appropriately manage this risk,&#8221; said Christoph 
      Koenen, vice president, U.S. Medical, Cardiovascular, Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb. &#8220;We are proud to support these organizations in their efforts to 
      help educate and empower patients and caregivers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of irregular heartbeat. 
      It is estimated that more than 5.8 million Americans have AF. One of the 
      most serious medical concerns for individuals with AF is the increased 
      risk of stroke, which is five times higher in people with NVAF than in 
      those without it. In North America it is estimated that 98 percent of 
      patients with AF have NVAF. NVAF is a type of AF that is not due to 
      rheumatic mitral heart valve disease, a prosthetic heart valve, or a 
      repairing of the heart&#8217;s mitral valve.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These seven nonprofit organizations were chosen because they do 
      essential work each and every day to connect with patients and they are 
      critical in continuing to raise awareness of devastating cardiovascular 
      diseases,&#8221; said Brian Klee, group lead, U.S. Medical Affairs, 
      Cardiovascular, Pfizer. &#8220;The Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer Alliance is 
      honored to be able to support these organizations in providing 
      innovative, educational resources to both patients and caregivers.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - A campaign manager working in the south Texas town of Donna has been charged with buying votes in a school board election by paying voters with cash and cocaine, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment said Francisco Garcia, 47, who managed campaigns for four candidates for the Donna School Board in the November 2012 election, bought votes and worked with other campaign workers to pay voters by giving them either $10 or a small bag of cocaine if they voted for his slate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia was charged with conspiring to buy votes, paying for votes and aiding and abetting others to buy votes, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Garcia was not immediately available for comment. Garcia was arrested this month and his indictment had been under seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of Garcia's campaign workers were arrested earlier this year and pleaded guilty to vote-buying charges in connection with the same election, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials declined to identify the candidates Garcia worked for or whether they won the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jim Forsyth; Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Peter Cooney)&lt;/p&gt;

      distinguished by their respective initial fixed-rate period, with 
      mortgages featuring fixed-rate periods of 5 years (8.6% of the aggregate 
      pool), 7 years (58.8%) and 10 years (32.6%). The pool is characterized

      examination of the results from loan file reviews performed by 
      independent third-party firms, cash flow modeling analysis of the 
      transaction&#8217;s payment structure, reviews of key transaction parties and 
      an assessment of the transaction&#8217;s legal structure and documentation.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Spain's Telefonica is
considering a range of tie-up options in Mexico with broadcaster
Grupo Televisa, including creating a new telecommunications
company together, a person with knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexican regulators are using new legislation to try to break
billionaire Carlos Slim's stranglehold on the local telecoms
market, and the new rules are expected to fuel a flurry of deals
by companies seeking to grow in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. 2 mobile carrier Telefonica has struggled for
years to gain a bigger chunk of the market and a partnership
could help it convert customers with mobiles on Slim's network
to its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This idea is in play ... It could take lots of different
forms," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is studying several options that would allow it to
leverage Televisa's 5.4 million cable video, broadband and voice
subscriptions, excluding recently purchased Cablecom, the source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include Televisa creating a mobile virtual network
operator (MVNO) on Telefonica's network, an alliance with
Televisa's cable companies and creating an entirely new company
together, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any combined company could offer television, broadband,
mobile and fixed-line services, known as "quad play".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Telefonica spokesman declined to comment, and a spokesman
for Televisa did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies are not yet in formal talks and, before
starting any, Telefonica will first decide whether it is
interested in pursuing an outright purchase of No.3 carrier
Iusacell from billionaire Ricardo Salinas, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming months the structure of Mexico's notoriously
concentrated telecoms and broadcast sectors could change
completely, driven by the government reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slim's America Movil said it would sell some
assets in order to fall below 50 percent market share in
telecoms, aiming to bring in a new large foreign competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The telecoms regulator could lift a 24-year ban on Slim's
Telmex fixed-line operation offering television services, if it
believes any sale has resulted in genuine market competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telefonica said in July it was in talks over a possible deal
in Mexico, with sources saying it had been targeting Iusacell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal with Telefonica is now one of few options open to
Televisa it if it wants to continue competing in Mexican mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month Televisa, which is Mexico's largest
broadcaster, agreed to sell its 50 percent stake in Iusacell
back to Salinas at an overall loss of nearly $900 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ricardo Salinas is now looking for a new strategic partner
in Iusacell and said in September he would announce one "soon".

			invisibleCRM Announces New Integration Technology with the SAP&#174; Jam 
      Social Software Platform to Improve Social Collaboration for Microsoft 
      Outlook Users
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      invisibleCRM, through close collaboration with SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), 
      continues to deliver new capabilities for the SAP&#174; Jam&#8482; social software 
      platform. SAP Jam delivers business social collaboration connecting 
      communities of customers, partners and colleagues with information, 
      networking applications and processes to help solve business-critical 
      problems and to drive faster results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      invisibleCRM&#8217;s unique integration technology for Microsoft Office 
      Outlook now allows users of SAP Jam to enhance their collaboration with 
      the ability to easily post e-mail and associated attachments to SAP Jam 
      groups, which speeds up the decision-making process. This add-in, 
      released in Q2 2014 for SAP Jam and Microsoft Office Outlook, was 
      engineered by invisibleCRM to make it easier for users to take content 
      from e-mail and publish it directly to SAP Jam. This enhancement also 
      allows users to see other team members&#8217; status, respond to issues in 
      real time, participate in group discussions, and update personal and 
      team activities directly from Outlook without having to toggle between 
      platforms. Content can be used to create or update a wiki page, blog 
      post, forum question or launch a discussion group idea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vlad Voskresensky, invisibleCRM&#8217;s CEO, states, &#8220;We are excited to expand 
      our relationship with SAP in creating a truly integrated platform to 
      enhance collaboration within SAP Jam, thereby increasing the activity 
      between users and ultimately increasing the customer&#8217;s return on 
      investment. To help avoid collaboration silos, organizations are looking 
      to embed social capabilities and processes into business applications 
      such as customer relationship management, human capital management or 
      financial applications. Our technology solutions bridge the gap between 
      Outlook and Lotus Notes with enterprise cloud applications to provide 
      &#8216;social glue&#8217; to bring together what&#8217;s needed to get work done more 
      effectively, efficiently and quickly.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As our customers work in many applications, our goal for SAP Jam is to 
      ensure that customers can collaborate when and where they need it. The 
      relationship with invisibleCRM helps enable SAP Jam customers to 
      smoothly bridge between productivity applications, collaboration and 
      enterprise applications,&#8221; comments Daisy Hernandez, VP Enterprise Social 
      Software at SAP.

			Spectrum Brands Holdings to Acquire Procter  Gamble&#8217;s European Pet 
      Food Business
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Leading IAMS&#174; and Eukanuba&#174; Brands Offer Solid Growth Potential and 
      Further Expand the Company&#8217;s European Companion Animal Product Line
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPB), a global and diversified 
      consumer products company with market-leading brands, announced today 
      the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Procter  Gamble&#8217;s 
      (NYSE: PG) European pet food business, consisting of the complementary 
      IAMS&#174; and Eukanuba&#174; premium brands for dogs and cats. Financial terms of 
      the transaction were not disclosed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The business has approximately $200 million of annual sales and will 
      provide Spectrum Brands&#8217; United Pet Group division access to the $21 
      billion European dog and cat food market which is growing at an 
      estimated 3 to 5 percent annually.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Eukanuba, a premium brand in the pet specialty channel, is the product 
      of choice for the Federation Cynologique Internationale, a global 
      federation of kennel clubs, as well as top breeders and veterinarians 
      with leading shares in many large markets, including Sweden, Norway and 
      Belgium. IAMS, a premium brand with broad consumer appeal, has a 
      leadership share of the premium dry dog food market in the U.K. 
      primarily through the food and mass merchandiser channel with 
      opportunities to grow further across Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This acquisition will expand and further strengthen our United Pet 
      Group&#8217;s broad companion animal product portfolio and help to achieve our 
      objective for more balance between our two products segments of aquatics 
      and companion animals,&#8221; said Dave Lumley, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of Spectrum Brands Holdings. &#8220;We already have a strong European 
      pet supplies infrastructure in place that will enable us to leverage 
      these well-known pet food brands in the U.K and Europe. We also see 
      important synergies in overhead, SGA and distribution over the next few 
      years.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Eukanuba&#8217;s patented formula targets consumers who desire the best 
      nutrition for their pets and is positioned as &#8220;extraordinary nutrition 
      for extraordinary beings.&#8221; IAMS is positioned for consumers who treat 
      their pets as family members and view the food they feed their pets as a 
      way to make them happy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are adding complementary brands in an adjacent category to expand 
      our global pet business,&#8221; Mr. Lumley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a strong European pet franchise with outstanding product brand 
      equity and room for growth and margin enhancement,&#8221; said David Maura, 
      Chairman of Spectrum Brands. &#8220;As we continue to expand our Pet division 
      organically and by targeted acquisitions, this business will provide 
      more global balance to our Pet footprint by further building out our 
      continental European and U.K. market presence. We look forward to the 
      contributions it will make to growing our adjusted EBITDA and free cash 
      flow.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The acquisition, which has been approved by Spectrum Brands&#8217; Board of 
      Directors, is expected to close in 2015 and is subject to customary 
      closing conditions.

      Research and Markets: United States B2C e-Commerce Market Report 
      2014-2018: Isis Mobile Wallet, MasterCard, PayPal  Visa Dominate the 
      Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/qxr67h/b2c_ecommerce) 
      has announced the addition of the "B2C 
      e-Commerce Market in the US 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The B2C e-Commerce market in the US to grow at a CAGR of 11.40 percent 
      over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      B2C e-commerce is an online transaction between a business and a 
      consumer. It includes online shops, online banking, travel services, and 
      online auctions and has many benefits such as self-service shopping, 
      which can be done 24 hours, accurate orders, and prompt payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One major trend emerging in this market is the increased adoption of 
      multichannel retailing. Vendors have started selling their products on 
      their websites and through online stores, which reduces their cost of 
      operations and saves the maintenance cost of physical stores.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers in this market is 
      increased internet penetration. North America accounts for the highest 
      internet penetration rate. There has been significant growth in internet 
      technologies in the US. Consumers in the US widely use the internet for 
      their transactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is logistics-related issues. Vendors charge customers shipping 
      costs by adding them to the product cost. The supply system in remote 
      areas also needs to be strengthened.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			To calculate market size, the report considers the revenues 
      generated from the sales of the following product segments in the market:

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has set Sept. 29 as the new launch date for its Xbox One game console in China, the U.S. software giant said on Tuesday, in the first launch since a 14-year ban on sales of foreign games consoles was lifted this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest software company gave no reason for the delay in the launch which was originally scheduled for Sept. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delay is the latest in a series of setbacks for Microsoft in China, where it is under investigation for suspected anti-trust violations related to the Windows operating system and Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We take great care to ensure that we meet or exceed regulatory standards," said Microsoft in an e-mail to Reuters in response to the delayed console launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox One console will cost 3,699 yuan ($602.76) without the Kinect motion detection system and 4,299 yuan ($700.53) with Kinect, Microsoft said.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is the world's third-biggest gaming market where revenues grew by more than a third from 2012 to nearly $14 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Console games must also get approval from Shanghai's local culture department, which will ensure they do not harm China's national unity, territorial integrity or reputation - or promote racial hatred, obscenity, gambling, violence or drugs. This could stop some of video games' biggest franchises, such as Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty, from being published in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After receiving government approval for the first wave of games, we've decided to launch with digital copies of the first 10 games now and will continue our work to bring more blockbuster games and a broad offering of entertainment and app experiences to the platform in the months to come," Enwei Xie, Microsoft's general manager for Xbox China, said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, Sony Corp) said it would set up a joint venture with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group to bring the PlayStation games console to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft makes the Xbox One console with Chinese internet TV set-top box maker BesTV New Media Co Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 US dollar = 6.1368 Chinese yuan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Jeremy Laurence)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Russia, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Russia's
Rosneft and U.S. ExxonMobil are continuing to
drill in the Kara Sea and plan to stop work by Oct. 10, Russian
Deputy Energy Minister Kirill Molodtsov said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They are drilling and will be drilling until Oct. 10. They
did have to stop on Sept. 26 but they extended," he told
reporters on the Pacific island of Sakhalin where he was
attending an energy conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said on Friday that the U.S. Treasury Department had
given it a short extension to wind down a rig at the well,
beyond the 14 days outlined in the sanctions targeting Western
cooperation in Russia's oil sector over Moscow's role in the
Ukraine crisis.

			The Global Non-small Cell Lung Cancer market to grow at a CAGR of 
      3.62% over the period 2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the key trends emerging in this market is the use of personalized 
      medicine, which is based on the genetic structure of the patients, and 
      it has fewer adverse side effects than chemotherapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the major driving factor in the market is the 
      high unmet need for appropriate drugs in the market. The drugs that can 
      cause disease remission in patients are expected to drive the growth of 
      the market significantly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the high cost of the therapy is a major 
      factor that restricts the growth of the market. Thus, the drugs get a 
      low response from patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

console to launch since a 14-year-old ban on sales of foreign
games consoles was lifted this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, Microsoft struck a deal with Chinese internet TV
set-top box maker BesTV New Media Co Ltd to form a
joint venture to make the consoles in Shanghai's Free Trade

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/b9xlc3/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Pneumococcal Vaccines Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Pneumococcal Vaccines market to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% 
      over the period 2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumonia), a pathogenic bacterium, is the 
      leading cause of serious illness across the globe. It is the main cause 
      of pneumonia, sinusitis, blood infections, meningitis, and middle ear 
      infections (otitis media). Pneumococcal disease affects children and the 
      elderly, and it is one of the leading infectious diseases worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It kills almost 1.6 million people (including more than 800,000 children 
      under the age five years) every year. Pneumococcal disease can be 
      prevented by vaccination. Vaccination involves the introduction of dead 
      or weakened antigen into the human body, which in turn produces 
      lymphocytes to counter the infection and any future invasions by that 
      antigen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the emerging trends in this market is strategic alliances of 
      vendors in the market, resulting in consolidation. Such alliances are 
      intended to increase the market penetration of the acquirer or to 
      enhance the product portfolio of the parent company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the major driving force in the market is the 
      inclusion of the pneumococcal vaccination in the national immunization 
      schedule of many countries, which helps to increase the consumption of 
      vaccines in the market, thereby boosting growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the inadequate vaccine coverage in the 
      world is a major challenge to the market growth, resulting in low reach 
      of the vaccines in the market, which restrains growth.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/st9r9c/global_taas) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      TaaS Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global TaaS market to grow at a CAGR of 32.17% over the period 
      2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A TaaS is a cloud-based platform where organizations can transfer their 
      testing facilities to third-party service providers. This platform is 
      suitable for iterative tasks as it can be measured and quantified. TaaS 
      activities are mostly done by those organizations that do not require 
      much knowledge regarding the design or the product system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Outsourcing testing services to low-cost destinations is one of the 
      major trends emerging in the market. Companies have started investing in 
      developing countries such as India and China, where there are many IT 
      professionals and the growth of the Testing Services market has a huge 
      scope.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the need to reduce operational time and cost is 
      one of the main growth drivers in this market. The Global TaaS market is 
      witnessing increasing demand for software testing from companies because 
      the quality of applications is highly dependent on testing. Companies 
      rely more on testing services and are increasing the adoption of 
      outsourced testing services to avoid poor execution, slow test 
      turnaround, or excessive software life cycle costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major growth inhibitors of 
      this market is lack of skilled resources in the Global TaaS market. The 
      market is highly dependent on the availability of the necessary testing 
      professionals with appropriate skills. With increased demand for testing 
      services, the retaining and hiring of desired testing professionals is 
      becoming a challenge for enterprises.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The following are the key objectives for using TaaS:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Reduced operational costs
      
			
        Improved product quality
      
			
        Predictable output
      
			
        On-demand pricing model for testing

      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global CMC market to grow at a CAGR of 9.89% over the period 
      2013-2018
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are manufactured by strengthening a 
      ceramic matrix with a refractory fiber. The ceramic matrix can be of 
      various types including silicon carbide and alumina matrices, among 
      others. The reinforcements can also be made in different forms, 
      including continuous or short fibers and particles. Because of their 
      superior material properties such as heat and wear resistance and high 
      strength, CMCs serves several industries, including Mechanical and 
      Chemical, Aerospace and Defense, and Energy and Environmental. They are 
      being extensively researched for their applications in hot-zone 
      structures, as a replacement for metal alloys.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Leap program initiated by GE Aviation, a subsidiary of GE, is the 
      major trend being witnessed by the Global CMC market. GE's program is 
      aimed at manufacturing and supplying CMC turbine-based Leap engines to 
      major players in the Aviation industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, increased demand from the aviation industry is 
      one of the major drivers in the Global CMC market. CMCs are increasingly 
      being used in the manufacturing of jet engines because of their high 
      wear resistance and ability to work in high temperatures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the dearth of global demand is hindering 
      market growth. As most of the demand is being generated from developed 
      nations, especially the US, manufacturers are finding it difficult to 
      expand geographically.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will reintroduce a controversial temporary visa system to deal with a huge backlog of asylum seekers, its immigration minister said on Thursday, despite criticism the stopgap process leaves refugees in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott won an election last September after campaigning on tough immigration policies, which have been criticized internationally but which polls show remain popular with voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia uses offshore detention centers in Papua New Guinea and the tiny South Pacific island nation of Nauru to process would-be refugees who arrive on boats, but some 30,000 who arrived before the policy was set are awaiting processing in Australian detention centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said that the Temporary Protection Visas (TPV), which were introduced under former Prime Minister John Howard and abolished in 2008, would address those people without providing inducements to people smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TPVs will provide refugees with stability and a chance to get on with their lives, while at the same time guaranteeing that people smugglers do not have a 'permanent protection visa product' to sell to those who are thinking of traveling illegally to Australia," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opposition Labor Party said it opposed temporary protection visas as leaving asylum seekers in limbo without a pathway to citizenship, but would study the proposed legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morrison said a deal had been reached with mining magnate Clive Palmer, whose Palmer United Party virtually controls the balance of power in the Senate, which nearly ensures its passage through Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 16,000 asylum seekers came to Australia on 220 boats in the first seven months of 2013, but the government says there has been just one "illegal" boat arrival since December. Hundreds of asylum seekers have drowned when rickety boats, mostly from Indonesia, have sunk en route in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the legislation, Palmer said that refugees would be allowed into Australia for an initial period of five years, during which time they would be allowed to work, provided they go to a remote area in need of laborers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are many areas and many communities in our country that can't get labor," Palmer told reporters in Brisbane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Jeremy Laurence)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			ExxonMobil 
      Chemical is increasing production of its high performance hydrocarbon 
      fluids by about 10 percent through expansion projects at its 
      Singapore and Antwerp facilities. The additional capacity, designed to 
      meet rapidly expanding global demand for hydrocarbon fluids and extend 
      the company&#8217;s worldwide supply capability, will begin producing by 
      mid-2015 and be complete in 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The investments in new capacity at our Singapore and Antwerp facilities 
      demonstrate ExxonMobil&#8217;s commitment to meet evolving customer needs,&#8221; 
      said Elissa Sterry, vice president of intermediates products, ExxonMobil 
      Chemical Company. &#8220;Our fluids are tailored to meet specific end-use 
      requirements, providing customers with a competitive advantage. As a 
      fully integrated company, access to our own feedstocks reinforces supply 
      security for our customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil Chemical is the leading producer of hydrocarbon fluids 
      specifically formulated for resource extraction, industrial processing 
      and a wide range of consumer applications. The company&#8217;s portfolio of 
      fluids includes ultra-low aromatic grades that deliver the highest 
      performance standards while complying with stringent environmental and 
      regulatory requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;ExxonMobil&#8217;s specialty products, such as our Escaid&#8482;
			fluids, improve performance and safety in extended-reach drilling 
      and solvent extraction processes for mining applications,&#8221; said Declan 
      Dixon, ExxonMobil fluids marketing manager. &#8220;Our Exxsol&#8482;
			fluids, with extremely-low aromatic content and low odor, are 
      effectively and efficiently replacing traditional industrial and 
      consumer solvents.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expansion projects, which upgrade refining streams into specialty 
      chemical products, are in progress and build on other recently announced 
      large investment projects in the company&#8217;s Singapore 
      and Antwerp 
      facilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Singapore is ExxonMobil&#8217;s largest integrated refining and chemical 
      manufacturing site. The company has expanded production in Singapore to 
      meet expected demand across the Asia Pacific region.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil&#8217;s capacity expansion in Antwerp is among other investments 
      totaling more than $2 billion over the last decade at the facility. The 
      expanded hydrocarbon fluids unit will further strengthen ExxonMobil&#8217;s 
      integrated downstream and chemical portfolio in northwest Europe to 
      better compete in the global industry environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hydrocarbon fluids, including specialty brands and unique products 
      tailored for specific applications, are available in a variety of 
      distillation ranges and evaporation rates. They are well suited as 
      solvents, dispersants and carriers for many applications. The ExxonMobil 
      Chemical portfolio of high-value hydrocarbon fluids include the Exxsol&#8482;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Swiss commodity trader Mercuria, known best for its energy  prowess, is mounting an audacious challenge to metal trading titans like Glencore Plc and Trafigura AG [TRAFGF.UL], but not in the way that industry sources had expected.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying on its pending $3.5 billion purchase of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's physical commodity business to build out its China-focused metals business into a global powerhouse, the upstart trader has hired a new global metals trading head and is quietly preparing a move into new markets, according to four sources familiar with its strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Trafigura's former global refined metals chief Tristan Busch joined Mercuria as global head of metals, spearheading a foray into North and South America and Europe, the sources said. It is the firm's first major expansion since starting trading copper, aluminum and other base metals just over two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Mercuria will not retain JPMorgan's top metal traders, Sam Hainsworth and Ivan Petev, when the acquisition is completed in the next few weeks, the four sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the size of the bank's trading book has shrunk in the past year, as long-term contracts have expired during the year-long sales process, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria spokesman Matthew Lauer played down the scale of the company's ambitions, which do not include the kind of vast mining projects that Glencore secured with last year's takeover of Xstrata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is absurd to reason that Mercuria is working to rival other businesses with billions of dollars in resources and more than 20 years of experience in the metals trading space," he said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Mercuria, founded a decade ago by two former Goldman Sachs oil traders, will undertake a significant strategic shift to broaden its business beyond the high-volume Chinese copper financing deals that helped make it the world's third-largest base metals trader, handling over one million tonnes per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With China embroiled in a scandal over missing warehouse stockpiles, Mercuria is focusing on the fiercely competitive business of securing offtake agreements and building relationships with producers and end users, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the same strategy as its rivals, some traders have tagged Mercuria a "Trafigura Mark Two" in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is also a similar model to the one carved out in energy trading by Mercuria founders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, who have transformed a small trading house into a global competitor. Turnover topped $100 billion last year for the first time, with profit at $273 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA FOCUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria's metals business mainly deals in base metals from its Chinese headquarters in Shanghai helmed by another Trafigura alumnus and copper trader, James Wu. It has about 50 personnel in China, including about 10 traders, two sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Busch, who led Trafigura's charge into aluminum almost a decade ago before being promoted to global head of refined metal in 2011, will oversee Wu and veteran trader Jose Leon who started Mercuria's concentrates trading operations late last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Leon and Busch are based in Geneva and the firm has several staff in the Lulumbashi, the Democratic Republic of Congo's copper belt, Mercuria's global presence is limited, sources say. Mercuria's Lauer denied the company has staff in the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In at least one way that will change substantially when Mercuria closes its purchase of the JPMorgan business, including the centuries-old Henry Bath &amp; Sons Ltd metals warehousing unit, a prize asset with sheds stretching from Singapore to Rotterdam and about 25 staff. That will help Mercuria push into consumer business as well as juggle inventory around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal for Henry Bath is to operate it as an independent warehouse facility. It will be separate from our trading operation," Lauer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's operations also have a long and distinguished pedigree as one of the world's largest and most successful metals businesses, with roots in legendary German trading house Metallgesellschaft and, more recently, Sempra Commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its history, however, the portion of the business being sold is "symbolic" compared with its vast energy operations, according to a source close to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how many traders the firm will hire as part of the push. JPMorgan metals staff will only account for a small share of the less than 200 people it will retain out of the 400-strong business, sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-time aluminum trader Hainsworth, who joined the desk 14 years ago from Barclays, may leave the bank after the deal is signed, the four sources who know the traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing is unknown because it has not been officially announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Petev, who deals in copper from Singapore, will not join Mercuria, it is not clear if he will stay at JPMorgan after the signing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were formerly traders at Sempra Commodities, where Dunand and Jaeggi also worked in the early 2000. They moved from RBS Sempra to the Wall Street bank with the acquisition in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEYOND REPOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria has been one of the most successful new entrants on the metals market in recent years, even as competition from other energy trading house Gunvor [GGL.UL] and Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual [BTG.UL] has intensified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mainstay of its meteoric growth has been through so-called repo deals in China, which give companies access to short-term credit in exchange for goods, three sources familiar with the company have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's huge, it's China centric and all they do is trade repos. It's going in the right direction, but it needs more focus on stuff beyond repo," said one of the four sources familiar with the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspected fraud at China's Qingdao port has left banks and trading firms exposed to billions of dollars of losses and curbed the market's appetite for repo deals though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria had alumina worth about $44 million stuck at the port, one of China's largest, and the company is facing legal action from Trafigura's warehouse business Impala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Jonathan Leff, Marguerita Choy and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			ExxonMobil Indonesian Villagers Human Rights Abuse Cases to Proceed 
      in Federal Court
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a significant victory for families of Indonesian citizens who were 
      killed or abused by security personnel hired by ExxonMobil Corporation, 
      a federal court has ruled that two closely related lawsuits against 
      ExxonMobil for human rights violations can proceed, Agnieszka Fryszman 
      of Cohen Milstein Sellers  Toll PLLC and other attorneys for the 
      plaintiffs announced today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Plaintiffs in the cases, which were filed in the U.S. District Court 
      District of Columbia, allege that Indonesian soldiers hired by 
      ExxonMobil to provide security at the corporation&#8217;s natural gas facility 
      physically abused and killed family members who lived or worked in 
      villages within the sprawling operations in rural Aceh, Indonesia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a huge victory for the plaintiffs,&#8221; said Plaintiffs&#8217; co-lead 
      counsel Agnieszka Fryszman, a partner at Cohen Milstein Sellers  Toll. 
      &#8220;We are especially pleased that the Court agreed with us that the 
      Plaintiffs had sufficiently tied Exxon&#8217;s conduct to the injuries and 
      abuses that were inflicted on these villagers. We look forward to seeing 
      justice done and to putting our case before a jury.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2008, another judge on the District Court had denied ExxonMobil's 
      attempt to avoid trial by rejecting the company&#8217;s motion for summary 
      judgment, citing &#8220;evidence that these security forces committed the 
      alleged atrocities.&#8221; The Court of Appeals then held that the claims must 
      be considered under Indonesian law, not the law of the District of 
      Columbia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among highlights of today&#8217;s decision, the District Court in a meticulous 
      43 page opinion:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Held that Plaintiffs&#8217; claims can go forward under Indonesian law, 
        finding that &#8220;expert testimony indicates to the Court that Indonesian 
        tort law, while using different terminology from American law, 
        compensates tort victims in similar fashion to the common law.&#8221;
      
			
        Permits Plaintiffs to add information regarding Exxon&#8217;s conduct in the 
        United States in order to meet the standard set out by a recent 
        Supreme Court decision, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Shell.
      
			
        Rejected Exxon&#8217;s arguments regarding the application of a variety of 
        international law doctrines.
      
			
        Permits Plaintiffs to gather additional evidence in support of their 
        claims.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Co-counsel Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun DeSimone Seplow Harris  Hoffman 
      LLP, said, &#8220;The well-reasoned and thoughtful opinion is an important one 
      for the enforcement of human rights law.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Co-counsel Terry Collingsworth of Conrad  Scherer added, &#8220;Since I first 
      met our clients in 2001, they have endured not only the agony of human 
      rights crimes, but over thirteen years of justice delayed. We are 
      looking forward to getting this case to trial so that our long-suffering 
      clients can obtain justice.&#8221;

      under the Company&#8217;s retrospective responsibility plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;). 
      Under the terms of the Plan, this resulted in the decrease in the 
      conversion rate applicable to the Company&#8217;s class B common stock from 
      0.4206 to 0.4121, effective immediately. Therefore, the number of 
      as-converted class B common shares was reduced by 2,089,780 from 
      103,257,583 to 101,167,803. The deposit and price-per-share calculations 
      were conducted in accordance with the Company&#8217;s certificate of 
      incorporation using the volume-weighted average price over the 9-day 
      pricing period from September 11, 2014 through September 23, 2014.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Swiss commodity trader Mercuria, known best for its energy  prowess, is now mounting an audacious challenge to metal titans like Glencore Plc and Trafigura AG [TRAFGF.UL], but not in the way that industry sources had expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying on its pending $3.5 billion purchase of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's physical commodity business to build out its China-focused metals business into a global powerhouse, the upstart trader has hired a new global metals trading head and is now quietly preparing a move into new markets, according to four sources familiar with its strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Trafigura's former global refined metals chief Tristan Busch joined Mercuria as global head of metals, spearheading a foray into North and South America and Europe, the sources said. It is the firm's first major expansion since starting trading copper, aluminum and other base metals just over two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Mercuria will not retain JPMorgan's top metal traders, Sam Hainsworth and Ivan Petev, when the acquisition is completed in the next few weeks, the four sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the size of the bank's trading book has shrunk in the past year, as long-term contracts have expired during the year-long sales process, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria and JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded a decade ago by two former Goldman Sachs oil traders, Mercuria will undertake a significant strategic shift to broaden its business beyond the high-volume Chinese copper financing deals that helped make it the world's third-largest base metals trader, handling over one million tonnes per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With China now embroiled in a scandal over missing warehouse stockpiles, Mercuria is focusing on the fiercely competitive business of securing offtake agreements and building relationships with producers and end users, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the same strategy as its rivals, some traders have tagged Mercuria a "Trafigura Mark Two" in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is also a similar model to the one carved out in energy trading by Mercuria founders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, who have transformed a small trading house into a global competitor. Turnover topped $100 billion last year for the first time, with profit estimated at over $400 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA FOCUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria's current metals business now mainly deals in base metals from its Chinese headquarters in Shanghai under the helm of another Trafigura alumni and copper trader James Wu. It has about 50 personnel in China, including about 10 traders, according to two sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Busch, who led Trafigura's charge into aluminum almost a decade ago before being promoted to global head of refined metal in 2011, will oversee Wu and veteran trader Jose Leon who started Mercuria's concentrates trading operations late last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Leon and Busch are based in Geneva and the firm has several staff in the Lulumbashi, the Democratic Republic of Congo's copper belt, Mercuria's global presence is limited, sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In at least one way that will change substantially when Mercuria closes its deal to buy the JPMorgan business, including the centuries-old Henry Bath &amp; Sons Ltd metals warehousing unit, a prize asset with sheds stretching from Singapore to Rotterdam and about 25 staff. That will help Mercuria push into consumer business as well as juggle inventory around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's operations also have a long and distinguished pedigree as one of the largest and most successful metals businesses in the world, with roots back to legendary German trading house Metallgesellschaft and, more recently, Sempra Commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its history, however, the portion of the business being sold is "symbolic" compared with its vast energy operations, according to a source close to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear how many traders the firm will hire as part of the push. JPMorgan metals staff will only account for a small share of the less than 200 people it will retain out of the 400-strong business, sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-time aluminum trader Hainsworth, who joined the desk 14 years ago from Barclays, may leave the bank after the deal is signed, the four sources who know the traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing is not known because it has not been officially announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Petev, who deals in copper from Singapore, will not join Mercuria, it is not clear if he will stay at JPMorgan after the signing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were formerly traders at Sempra Commodities, where Dunand and Jaeggi also worked in the early 2000. They moved from RBS Sempra to the Wall Street bank with the acquisition in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEYOND REPOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria has been one of the most successful new entrants on the metals market in recent years, even as competition from other energy trading house Gunvor [GGL.UL] and Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual [BTG.UL] has intensified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mainstay of its meteoric growth has been through so-called repo deals in China, which give companies access to short-term credit in exchange for goods, three sources familiar with the company have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's huge, it's China centric and all they do is trade repos. It's going in the right direction, but it needs more focus on stuff beyond repo," said one of the four sources familiar with the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspected fraud at China's Qingdao port has left banks and trading firms exposed to billions of dollars of losses and curbed the market's appetite for repo deals though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria had alumina worth about $44 million stuck at the port, one of China's largest, and the company is facing legal action from Trafigura's warehouse business Impala. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Jonathan Leff and Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Indexes up: Dow, S 500 0.5 pct, Nasdaq up 0.7 pct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ryan Vlastelica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Derivative strategists at
Goldman Sachs on Wednesday advised clients to buy a near-term
straddle on IBM, saying the options market was
underestimating the stock's typical post-earnings volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman suggested buying October $192.50 straddles. Over the
past eight quarters, IBM moved an average of 4.6 percent in the
week following its report, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, Goldman wrote, the options market is pricing in
a move of 2.2 percent, "the lowest level since 2006." The broker
added that sentiment on the chipmaker was bearish, which "could
indicate investors are more negatively biased ahead of
earnings." The Dow component reports results on Oct. 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a straddle strategy, an investor will buy both a bullish
call option and a bearish put option at the same strike price,
betting that a stock will move by a certain amount, rather than
in a specific direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares are up about 2 percent in 2014, underperforming
the S 500's 7.8 percent advance. The stock dipped 0.2 percent
to $191.31 on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Index snapshot at 11:34 EDT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S 500 was rising 9.7 points, or 0.49 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Nasdaq Comp was gaining 30.66 points, or 0.68
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow industrials was adding 88.09 points, or 0.52
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Russell 2000 was adding 7.18 points, or 0.64
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S MidCap was adding 4.5 points, or 0.32 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S SmallCap was gaining 3.83 points, or 0.6
percent.&lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;Visa&#8217;s size and scale allows technologists to work on meaningful

      In April 2013, The Coca-Cola Company announced that it had signed 
      Letters of Intent with five U.S. bottlers which committed to creating a 
      stronger U.S. business model through the granting of new, expanded 
      territories. The five bottlers are Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, 
      Coca-Cola Bottling Company United Inc., Swire Coca-Cola USA, Coca-Cola 
      Bottling Company High Country and Corinth Coca-Cola Bottling Works, Inc. 
      The Company is very encouraged by the transitions that have taken place 
      with each of these bottlers in 2014. Looking ahead, the Company is 
      positioned to complete the initial transitions in 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally the Company announced on February 21, 2014 that it had 
      signed a Letter of Intent for the granting of territories in the greater 
      Chicago area to J. Christopher and M. Jude Reyes of Reyes Holdings, 
      L.L.C. and expects to reach Definitive Agreement later this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      In all of the newly granted territories, the Bottlers and The Coca-Cola 
      Company will work collaboratively to implement key elements of the 
      evolving U.S. operating model, including:

        A grant of exclusive territory rights and the sale by Coca-Cola 
        Refreshments (CCR) of distribution assets and cold drink equipment

      Research and Markets: Global Flue Gas Desulfurizer (Greenfield and 
      Retrofit) Market 2014-2018 - Leading Vendors are Alstom, General 
      Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Siemens  The Babcock  Wilcox 
      Company
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4fvdxk/global_flue_gas) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Flue Gas Desulfurizer (FGD) Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Flue Gas Desulfurizer market to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% 
      over the period 2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Flue Gas Desulfurizer (FGD) is a system for removing sulfur dioxide from 
      flue gas, which is produced as an exhaust from waste incineration 
      plants, power plants fueled by fossil fuels such as coal, or oil and 
      chemical plants. Various methods are used for achieving this process. 
      This report involves FGD using dry lime, wet calcium, and other methods 
      such as ammonia scrubbing and seawater washing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The emergence of new technologies is a major trend in the Global FGD 
      market. The need for improved efficiency, enhanced reliability, and 
      reduced power consumption has triggered the need for new types of 
      desulfurizer equipment as well as systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in the market is an 
      increased demand for electricity. The combustion of fossil fuels in 
      thermal power plants produces exhaust gases that contain considerable 
      amounts of SO2, which is removed using FGD systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the high cost of installation is one of 
      the major challenges faced by the Global Flue Desulfurizer market. The 
      price of commodities required for manufacturing FGD systems has risen 
      over the past few years which has led to many small companies abstained 
      from installing FGD systems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO, Sept. 25, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- REVA Medical, Inc. (ASX:RVA) ("REVA" or the "Company") announced today that it has entered into a convertible note deed with Goldman Sachs International ("Goldman Sachs"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and Senrigan Master Fund ("Senrigan"), an investment vehicle managed by Senrigan Capital, which, if approved by stockholders, will provide funding for the Company's ongoing operating, clinical, and capital needs including, specifically, the clinical testing and planned CE Mark application of its Fantom bioresorbable scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Under the convertible note deed, REVA will issue an aggregate principal amount of US$25 million in senior unsecured convertible notes and 8,750,000 options; each option allows the purchase of one share of REVA's common stock. If the options are exercised in full at their maximum exercise price of A$3.00 per share, they would generate approximately US$23.2 million of additional capital, based on current exchange rates. The convertible notes and options will be offered to Goldman Sachs and Senrigan under a prospectus to be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 6D of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We are extremely pleased to have the support of global institutional investors Goldman Sachs and Senrigan," commented REVA's Chief Executive Officer, Bob Stockman. "Securing this commitment, together with our polymer and clinical trial expertise, allows REVA to move Fantom forward quickly into our clinical trial and ultimately to market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Fantom is a single-piece coronary stent made from REVA's proprietary polymer, which allows for complete visibility of the stent when placed in the artery, an attribute unique to REVA. Additionally, Fantom's polymer properties allow it to dissolve over time, leaving the artery free of a permanent implant and thereby allowing the artery to return to its natural movement, or "vasomotion." Resorbable stents are commonly referred to as "scaffolds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Fantom scaffold is currently in the latter stages of development and preclinical testing. The Company anticipates initiating a human clinical trial of Fantom before year-end. The clinical trial is designed to enroll up to 125 patients and provide the data needed to apply for CE Marking, the regulatory approval needed prior to commercially selling the device in Europe and other international markets under the CE Mark. REVA expects to apply for CE Mark by mid-2016 and anticipates that this financing will provide the capital needed to reach commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The convertible notes will have a five-year term, bear interest at 7.54% annually, and allow for cash redemption options by the holder at 26 months, at maturity, and upon a change of control or following an event of default under the convertible note deed. While interest compounds annually, it is payable only upon redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The noteholders are allowed to convert some or all of the convertible notes into the trading securities of the Company at any time at an initial conversion price of A$0.25 per CHESS Depositary Interest (or "CDI"). The conversion price is subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the convertible note deed. Currently, REVA's securities are traded in the form of CDIs on the Australian Securities Exchange ("ASX"); 10 CDIs equal one share of the Company's common stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The notes will automatically convert to CDIs in the event the Company has received CE Mark approval for Fantom and the market price of the Company's CDIs exceeds A$0.60 for 20 consecutive trading days. Based on current exchange rates and the initial conversion price, the maximum number of CDIs that may be issued on conversion of all the convertible notes is approximately 113.4 million (or 11.3 million shares of common stock).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The exercise price of each option is set at A$2.50 (or the equivalent of A$0.25 per CDI) until such time as REVA has completed full patient enrollment in its CE Mark clinical trial of Fantom, at which time the exercise price will increase to A$3.00 (or A$0.30 per CDI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Closing of the transaction is subject to, among other things, approval by REVA's stockholders. Accordingly, a special meeting of stockholders will be held. The Proxy Statement for the special meeting will include additional details regarding the terms of the convertible notes and options and will be mailed to all stockholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A summary of the principal terms of the convertible notes and the options is attached to this announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About REVA Medical, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	REVA is a development stage medical device company located in San Diego, California, USA, that is focused on the development, testing, and eventual commercialization of its proprietary bioresorbable stents, which are called "scaffolds" because of their temporary nature. The Company's scaffolds are being developed as an alternative to metal stents, which are small tube-like devices permanently implanted into an artery to treat coronary artery disease. Scaffolds provide restoration of blood flow, support the artery through the healing process, then disappear (or "resorb") from the body over a period of time. This resorption allows the return of natural movement and function of the artery, a result not attainable with permanent metal stents. The Company has conducted clinical studies of its scaffold technologies; a total of 112 patients were enrolled in its most recent clinical trial in Australia, Brazil, Europe, and New Zealand, with enrollment completed during January 2014. The patients in this trial will be followed for a total of five years, with primary data to be obtained at nine and 12 months. The Company is now developing and testing its FantomTM scaffold, with initial human implants planned for late 2014 at multiple centers in Brazil and Europe. The Fantom scaffold has been designed to offer distinct ease-of-use features including complete scaffold visibility under x-ray, expansion with one continuous inflation, no procedural time limitations, and standard storage and handling. REVA will require successful clinical results and regulatory approval before it can commercialize Fantom or any of its other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			ATTACHMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Summary of Certain Key Terms of the Notes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Face Value: the Notes each have a face value of US$100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Form and Status: the Notes are direct, unsubordinated, unconditional and unsecured obligations of the Company in certificated form, and will at all times rank pari passu in right of payment with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated senior obligations of the Company (other than unsecured obligations preferred by mandatory provisions of law) and senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated obligations of the Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Maturity: the Notes mature and shall be repaid in an amount equal to Face Value plus accrued Interest on the earlier to occur of an event of default (as defined in the Deed) or the date 60 months from the date of issue of the Notes unless a Note has been previously converted, redeemed or cancelled.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Optional Redemption: a Noteholder may elect to cause the Company to redeem all or some of its Notes which have not otherwise been converted, redeemed or cancelled on the date which is 26 months after the date of issue of the Notes, at an amount equal to Face Value plus accrued Interest, upon providing the Company with at least 30 calendar days prior written notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Redemption Following a Change of Control Event: following the occurrence of certain change of control events, as further described in the Deed, each Noteholder may give the Company an irrevocable notice requiring the Company to redeem all or any part of their Notes for the greater of (a) the Face Value of the Notes plus accrued Interest and (b) the Cash Settlement Amount (as defined under "Option Conversion" below), provided such Noteholder gives written notice of its decision to redeem within five business days of the change of control event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Stockholder Rights: the Notes do not provide the holder voting rights or other rights as a stockholder of the Company unless and until converted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Interest: interest will accrue in respect of the Notes at the rate of 7.54% per annum (increased to 9.54% per annum if any payments are past due); provided that interest is payable only upon redemption of the Notes for cash. No interest is payable on any Note that is converted into shares of common stock (represented by CDIs) in accordance with the terms of the Deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Optional Conversion: at any time following the date of issue of the Notes but prior to the maturity date, a Noteholder may give the Company an irrevocable notice electing to convert (the "Conversion Notice") all or some of the Notes held by the Noteholder and specifying the number of Notes the Noteholder is electing to convert into shares of the Company's common stock (represented by CDIs).&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The terms of the Notes contain provisions for the adjustment of the conversion price, which will initially be A$2.50 per share of our common stock (or A$0.25 per CDI), subject to adjustment as described under "Adjustment of Conversion Price" below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The number of shares of the Company's common stock (equivalent to 10 CDIs) to be issued upon conversion of the Notes is determined by dividing the face value of the Note converted (translated from U.S. dollars into Australian dollars at the exchange rate fixed on the subscription date for the Note) by the conversion price in effect on the conversion date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Upon receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company may, in lieu of issuing shares of common stock (represented by CDIs) to the Noteholder, give the Noteholder notice that the Company is electing to redeem the Notes subject to the Conversion Notice for an amount equal to the number of CDIs which would have been issued on conversion multiplied by the average daily volume-weighted average price on the ASX of the CDIs during the 20 trading days after receipt of the Conversion Notice (the "Cash Settlement Amount").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Adjustment of Conversion Price: the terms of the Notes contain provisions for the adjustment of the conversion price upon the occurrence of certain events, including reorganisation of issued capital, certain dividends, distributions and issuance by the Company of equity securities at a price below current market value. If such events occur, the conversion price will be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Deed to ensure the economic value of the Notes is not adversely affected by the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Automatic Conversion: Noteholders shall automatically be deemed to have given the Company an irrevocable Conversion Notice in respect of all of the Notes then held by the Noteholder in the event that both (a) the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Company's CDIs as traded on the ASX equals or exceeds A$0.60 for a period of 20 consecutive trading days and (b) the Company has received CE Mark approval for its Fantom product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Restrictions on Transfer: subject to certain conditions, a Note or Option may be assigned or transferred to affiliates of the Noteholder, other Noteholders and to any party that is not a competitor (as defined in the Deed) of the Company, provided that the Notes may be transferred to any person, including a competitor of the Company, either upon the occurrence of a change of control event or while an event of default subsists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Restrictions on Issuance of Equity Securities:&#160;for so long as any Notes remain outstanding or Options remain unexercised, the Company may not raise additional capital through the sale or issuance of its equity securities (or securities convertible or exercisable for such securities) except (i) upon the exercise or conversion of securities currently outstanding, (ii) up to an aggregate of 8,700,000 shares of common stock upon equity issuances completed within 6 months of the issuance of the Note or upon the issuance of securities pursuant to the Company's incentive equity plans, (iii) upon a stock split or stock dividend to all holders of the Company's common stock, (iv) to the extent, acting in good faith and in accordance with their fiduciary duties to the Company under applicable law, the directors of the Company form the view that the failure to make such an offering would be a breach of their fiduciary duties, or (v) in certain other limited circumstances set forth in the Deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Right of First Refusal:&#160;the Noteholders shall have a right of first offer and right of first refusal to acquire all or any portion of any finance debt (as defined in the Deed) that the Company determines to raise while the Notes remain outstanding, subject to certain limited exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Covenants:&#160;for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, the Company shall not take certain actions, including, among other things, (i) declaring or paying any dividend, (ii) issuing any finance debt (as defined in the Deed) in excess of $10,000,000, (iii) granting any security interest in respect of or dispose of the Company's intellectual property, or (iv) substantially changing the general nature or scope of its business, subject to such exceptions as specified in the Deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			NASDAQ Listing and Registration Rights:&#160;provisions of the Deed require the Company to use reasonable efforts to seek to list its common stock on NASDAQ as soon as practicable after September 2015. Additionally, as a condition precedent to issue of the Notes and Options, the Company must enter into an Amended and Restated Investors' Rights Agreement with each Noteholder and each investor that is a party to the existing Amended and Restated Investors' Rights Agreement with the Company dated December 16, 2010.&#160;The Amended and Restated Investors' Rights Agreement will be substantially in the form set forth in Schedule 8 to the Deed and will provide each Noteholder, subject to the terms and conditions therein, with the right to require the Company to file a registration statement with the SEC in respect of any securities in the Company held by each such Noteholder to facilitate the sale of such securities on the same basis, and in the same circumstances, as each of the investors that are a party to the existing Amended and Restated Investors' Rights Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Lock-Up Agreements: each of Robert B. Stockman (REVA's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) and Robert K. Schulz (REVA's President and Chief Operating Officer) have agreed to enter into Lock-Up Agreements with the Noteholders whereby each will agree not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale, file a registration statement with respect to, or otherwise dispose of (including entering into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequence of ownership interests) any shares or CDIs of the Company or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right receive any shares or CDIs of the Company, subject to certain exceptions as further described in the form of Lock-Up Agreement in Schedule 7 of the Deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Modifications to Notes:&#160;provisions of the Notes may generally be modified, amended or waived by Noteholders that represent at least two-thirds of the outstanding principal face value amount of all outstanding Notes acting at a meeting or by written consent; provided, however, that unanimous consent of the Noteholders holding all of the outstanding notes is required to, amongst other items, (i) extend the term of the notes or their maturity date, (ii) reduce the amount of any payment of principal, interest, fees or any other payment obligation of the Company or (iii) change when and on what terms the Notes will convert or be redeemed, cancelled or otherwise repaid or prepaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	An "Event of Default" includes, in summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			(a)&#160; Failure to pay: &#160;a failure by the Company to pay an amount due under and in the manner required by the Deed;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			(b)&#160; Cross default: &#160;finance debt of the Group that, in aggregate, exceeds US$1,000,000, is not paid when due or becomes due and payable prior to its maturity date;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			(c)&#160; Revocation: &#160;an authorisation, approval or consent material to the Company or its business is cancelled, repealed, revoked or terminated or has expired, amended or modified in a manner which is likely to have a material adverse effect (as defined in the Deed);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			(d)&#160; Failure to perform: &#160;the Company or key management fails to perform any material obligation under the Deed, the Amended and Restated Investors' Rights Agreement or the Lock-up Agreement;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			(e)&#160; Misrepresentation: &#160;any warranty or representation made by the Company under the Deed becomes false or misleading or incorrect in any material respect when made;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			(f)&#160; Insolvency event: an insolvency event (as defined in the Deed) occurs in relation the Company;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			(g)&#160; Breach of law: &#160;the Company or any of its subsidiaries is in material breach of an applicable law, regulation, authorisation, listing rule, or court order, official directive or ruling of any Government Agency binding on it which is likely to have a material adverse effect (as defined in the Deed);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			(h)&#160; Termination: &#160;any person becomes entitled to repudiate, terminate, rescind or avoid any material provision of the Deed, the Amended and Restated Investors' Rights Agreement or the Lock-up Agreement; or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			(i)&#160; Listing: &#160;CDIs cease to trade on ASX or are suspended from trading for more than 5 consecutive trading days or, where the Company's common stock is quoted on an alternative exchange, the shares of the Company's common stock cease to trade or are suspended from trading on such exchange for more than 5 consecutive trading days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			The foregoing description is a summary of certain of the material provisions of the Notes and the Deed and does not purport to be complete.&#160;This summary is subject to and is qualified by reference to all the provisions of the Notes and the Deed, including the definitions of certain terms used in the Deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Summary of Certain Key Terms of the Options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(a)&#160; The Options may be exercised at any time after issuance until they expire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(b)&#160; The Options will automatically expire at 5.00pm Delaware, United States of America time on the date 60 months following the date of issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(c)&#160; The Options confer the right to subscribe for one share of the Company's common stock (equivalent to 10 CDIs) per Option upon the payment of the exercise price of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(i)&#160; A$2.50 (translated into US dollars at the prevailing rate on the date of issue of the Options) where the Option is exercised before a defined Company milestone of full patient enrollment in the Company's CE Mark clinical trial of the Fantom product has occurred, or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(ii)&#160; A$3.00 (translated into US dollars at the prevailing rate on the date of issue of the Options) where the Option is exercised after full CE Mark clinical trial enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(d)&#160; There are no participating rights or entitlements inherent in the Options and holders of the Options will not be entitled to participate in new issues of capital that may be offered to securityholders (except where the holder has first exercised any of their Options before the record date to participate in the new issue).&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(e)&#160; In the event of any re-organisation (including reconstruction, consolidation, subdivision, reduction or return of capital) of the issued capital of the Company, the Options will be re-organised as required by the ASX Listing Rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(f)&#160; If there is a bonus issue to the holders of CDIs, the number of CDIs over which an Option is exercisable will be increased by the number of CDIs which the Optionholder would have received if they had exercised their Options before the record date for the bonus issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(g)&#160; In the event the Company proceeds with a pro rata issue (except a bonus issue) of securities to any holder of shares or CDIs of the Company after the date of issue of the Options, the exercise price for the Option will be reduced in accordance with the formula set out in ASX Listing Rule 6.22.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(h)&#160; The Options will not be quoted on ASX or any other securities exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(i)&#160; CDIs allotted pursuant to an exercise of the Options will rank, from the date of allotment, equally with the existing CDIs of the Company in all respects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(j)&#160; The Company will make an application to have those CDIs allotted pursuant to an exercise of the Options listed for official quotation by ASX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(k)&#160; The Options will be exercisable by the delivery to the registered office of the Company of a notice in writing stating the intention of the Optionholder to exercise all or a specified number of the Options held by them (an "Exercise Notice") accompanied by the relevant option certificate and payment to the Company of the relevant exercise price. An exercise of only some of the Options will not affect the rights of the Optionholder to the balance of the Options held by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(l)&#160; Immediately after receipt by the Company of a valid Exercise Notice and payment of the exercise price by the Optionholder in immediately available funds (and in any event no later than two Business Days thereafter), the Company must:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(i)&#160; allot and issue to the Optionholder the number of fully paid CDIs equal to the number of the Options which have been exercised;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(ii)&#160; enter the Optionholder into the Company's register of members as the holder of the relevant number of CDIs;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(iii)&#160; deliver to the Optionholder a holding statement showing the Optionholder as the holder of the relevant number of CDIs; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(iv)&#160; apply for and use its reasonable efforts to obtain Official Quotation of the relevant number of CDIs by ASX as soon as practicable on such terms and conditions as are usual for quotation of securities on ASX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(m)&#160; The rights of the Optionholders and the obligations of the Company in relation to the Options are separate and independent of the Deed and the Notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			The foregoing description is a summary of certain of the material provisions of the Options and the Deed and does not purport to be complete.&#160;This summary is subject to and is qualified by reference to all the provisions of the Options and the Deed, including the definitions of certain terms used in the Deed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds background on possible ICSID ruling)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - A World Bank arbitration
tribunal could rule in days that Venezuela must pay between $700
million and $1.2 billion to Exxon Mobil Corp to
compensate for a 2007 nationalization, a newspaper said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID), which is deciding the case, must issue a final
ruling by the end of October to meet a 90-day deadline following
the close of proceedings on July 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court can also request an extension of 90 days, which
would leave the final decision for the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But pro-opposition Venezuelan daily El Nacional cited a
source at state oil company PDVSA saying the ICSID would give a
judgment by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Preliminary calculations indicate that the total would be
between $700 million and $1.2 billion" for the takeover,
including Exxon Mobil's Cerro Negro heavy oil project and the
smaller La Ceiba project, expropriated by then-President Hugo
Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company received $908 million from PDVSA in 2012 after a
separate decision by the International Chamber of Commerce over
a contract dispute linked to the same projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear if a potential ICSID ruling would deduct that
amount already paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they do not deduct payments already made, the country's
finances will be seriously affected," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela is facing around 20 cases at the World Bank
tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been no official word on the case from either
PDVSA or Exxon Mobil, nor was there any new information on the
ICSID website where judgments are posted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should the El Nacional report prove correct, analysts said
that would represent a "victory" for Venezuela given that Exxon
Mobil is seeking a much larger amount. Two oil analysts who
follow the case closely, however, said they had no information
that a ruling was as imminent as reported by the newspaper.

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA+'; Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4477 
      PUTTERs and series 4477 DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch has 
      assigned to The Regents of the University of Colorado Tax-Exempt 
      University Enterprise Revenue Bonds, Series 2014A (rated 'AA+'; Stable 
      Outlook) that have been deposited in the series 4477 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4477 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (rated 
      'A+/F1'; Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on June 1, 2015, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, 
      unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's
 private equity arm and buyout firm Rhone Capital LLC are
nearing a deal to acquire logistics services provider Neovia
Logistics LLC for more than $1 billion, including debt,
according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' and Rhone Capital's consortium has prevailed
over a rival bid from private equity firm Blackstone Group LP
, the people said on Wednesday. The deal is expected to be
finalized later this month, the people added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of Neovia comes just two years after private equity
firm Platinum Equity LLC acquired a 65 percent stake in the
company from Caterpillar Inc, leaving the industrial
conglomerate with a 35 percent interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources asked not to be identified because the deal
talks are confidential. Representatives for Neovia, Platinum
Equity, Caterpillar, Goldman Sachs and Rhone Capital did not
immediately respond to requests for comment, while Blackstone
declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neovia runs a third-party logistics business that helps
companies cut distribution costs in sectors ranging from
automotive and mining to electronics and healthcare. The Downers
Grove, Illinois-based company has more than 96 facilities in 25
countries, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters first reported in April that Neovia was up for sale.
Investment banks UBS AG and Macquarie Group Ltd
 have been advising Neovia on the sale process,
according to the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platinum said in 2012 when it took over Neovia that the
overall transaction was worth about $750 million. At the time,
Macquarie, which financed the deal, said it was the largest
logistics deal since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction for Neovia also attracted peer XPO Logistics Inc
, which exited the process in recent weeks, according to
the sources. Greenwich, Connecticut-based XPO went on to acquire
another company, New Breed Logistics, in a $615 million deal
from private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An XPO spokesman declined to comment on the company's
interest in Neovia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wave of deals in the industrial logistics sector have
taken place this year. French logistics company Groupe Norbert
Dentressangle SA, for example, completed its $750
million purchase of Jacobson Companies from private equity firm
Oak Hill Capital Partners on Sept. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other companies are coming to the market. Singapore's
Neptune Orient Lines Ltd is looking to sell its APL
Logistics division with the hopes of fetching more than $750
million, Reuters reported last month.

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Clean Task Sequences, Healthy SCCM Clients and Hardlinking Can Reduce Migration Time and Cost&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;BELLEVUE, WA--(Marketwired - Sep 25, 2014) -  Adaptiva, a leading global provider of add-ons for Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), today announced its "5 Tips for XP Migration" to help IT departments migrate from Microsoft Windows XP to Windows 7 or 8 using SCCM. According to a recent user survey Adaptiva conducted with more than 100 TechEd North America 2014 attendees, more than half (53%) are still running XP in their organization. Adaptiva's 5 Tips encapsulate best practices from some of the world's largest enterprises that have successfully migrated from Windows XP using SCCM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very difficult for a large organization to move off of Windows XP completely, especially one with many operating locations around the globe," said Deepak Kumar, Founder and CTO, Adaptiva. "IT departments can begin taking steps now to ensure a smoother migration, whether moving from Windows XP or from Windows 7 to 8. Our 5 Tips come from successful enterprise migrations where they have reduced costs, slashed migration times, and improved success rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading analyst firm Ovum estimates that it could take a company as long as six months to upgrade 1,000 machines using traditional, manual approaches to an OS upgrade -- with some mid-size organizations taking up to two years to complete. Even with SCCM, the market-leading operating system deployment (OSD) automation solution, companies may still be held back by time and cost constraints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptiva's 5 Tips for ensuring a smooth Windows XP migration with SCCM include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Optimize Your Task Sequences: Plan for debugging and troubleshooting when creating task sequences.&#160;Make use of logical phases -- called groups in task sequences -- so others can more easily monitor for success/failure, perform troubleshooting, and remediate. Plan ahead for debugging by saving log files to a network share, otherwise there will be no way to perform root cause analysis in the event of failure during the pre-OS phase. 
        2. Ensure the Health of SCCM Clients: The success of each migration depends on a healthy Windows system with a properly functioning SCCM client. Administrators need to be sure all the clients are problem-free well in advance of migration. If problems are detected and corrected at the start of migration, large delays may occur, such as processing of backlogged system updates. 
        3. Make Friends with the Network Team: Make the networking team part of the planning process. A good working relationship with the networking team will reduce political obstacles and accelerate troubleshooting. 
        4. Use Hardlinking When Possible: In situations where it fits, hardlinking can reduce reliance on network transfers during migration by backing up a system's user settings and data (state) on the system being migrated. Minimizing network transfers reduces the chance of the network becoming a bottleneck. This is much simpler with unencrypted hard drives, but can work on encrypted drives in some situations. 
        5. Set User Expectations Accurately: Leverage SCCM asset intelligence to ensure that users do not lose capabilities. If the migration would cause a user to lose a personal or otherwise non-business-critical application, then it is important to communicate that even though the change has no impact to the business. It is common to leave off some state data, such as a user's "My Pictures" directory. In these cases, it is critical to let the user know user as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some SCCM add-ons, such as Adaptiva OneSite, can further cut project timelines and expenses by eliminating the need for infrastructure and providing a host of OSD-automation features.

			Sonian Unveils New Cloud-Based Archiving Solution for Microsoft Lync&#174; 
      Instant Messages
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Lync&#174; Archiving enables organizations to secure and search IM 
      conversations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sonian, 
      an early innovator in cloud-based data archiving, today announced a new 
      solution to allow organizations to archive their Microsoft Lync&#174; instant 
      messages (IM). Currently available, Lync 
      Archiving captures, indexes and secures an organization&#8217;s Lync 
      instant messaging data within the cloud alongside email if desired, 
      allowing for unified search, compliance adherence and faster discovery 
      response.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The ubiquity of instant messaging has made it a de facto form of 
      business communication. Companies that correctly recognize these 
      communications as intellectual property want to be able to secure and 
      search them,&#8221; said Greg Arnette, founder and CTO of Sonian. &#8220;Lync 
      Archiving enables SMBs to preserve, index, search and retrieve IMs in a 
      cost-effective and easy-to-use cloud archive. This helps companies to 
      speed audit response, power internal investigations or answer any legal 
      or compliance inquiry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This new solution enables IT administrators to secure all Lync IM 
      conversations within a cloud archive and then create flexible searches 
      for specific keywords, users, dates or search the entire corpus to 
      quickly gather complete and reliable results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key features of Sonian&#8217;s Lync Archiving include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        All Microsoft Lync IM conversations secured in a unified cloud archive
      
			
        Organizations can now effectively meet IM retention mandates and 
        respond to discovery requests without increasing complexity
      
			
        Unlimited cloud storage and unlimited retention at a fixed and 
        predictable cost
      
			
        A single search interface allows administrators to quickly access IM 
        conversations and emails
      
			
        Fully supports peer-to-peer and multi-party instant messaging of 
        Microsoft Lync 2010 and 2013 servers

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - A World Bank arbitration
tribunal will rule in days that Venezuela must pay between $700
million and $1.2 billion to Exxon Mobil Corp to
compensate for a 2007 nationalization, a newspaper said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro-opposition Caracas daily El Nacional cited a source at
Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA saying the International
Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) would give
a judgment by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Preliminary calculations indicate that the total would be
between $700 million and $1.2 billion," for the takeover of
Exxon Mobil's Cerro Negro heavy oil project in the Orinoco
region by then President Hugo Chavez's government, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company received $908 million from PDVSA in 2012 after a
separate decision by the International Chamber of Commerce over
the same claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Nacional said it was unclear if a potential ICSID ruling
would deduct that amount already paid. "If they do not deduct
payments already made, the country's finances will be seriously
affected," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela is facing around 20 cases at the World Bank
tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been no official word on the case from either
PDVSA or Exxon Mobil, nor was there any new information on the
ICSID web site where judgments are posted.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) was the top performing investment bank in the first half of the year, making $11.5 billion in revenue and ranking first for both its fixed income and deals advisory businesses, data showed on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank ranked ahead of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), who shared second place, according to industry analytics firm Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were followed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and Citi (C.N), then Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in sixth, Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) seventh, Barclays (BARC.L) eighth, UBS (UBSN.VX) ninth and then BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result, which is closely watched by the industry, puts JPMorgan on track to keep its top slot in the full-year league tables. It has ranked first since Coalition began publishing its rankings in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was joined by Deutsche Bank and Citi in first place in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC). The three banks each brought in around $5.9 billion in revenue from that business in the six months to end-June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compares with $7.6 billion made by JPMorgan last year, when it was also the top bank in FICC, and reflects the structural and cyclical pressures that have dogged FICC divisions in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FICC trading has been steadily falling since the 2008 crisis, partly due to a collapse in interest rates across the developed world that has crushed volatility. New rules forcing banks to hold more capital against the business have also driven down returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coalition expects that full year FICC revenue at the top 10 investment banks globally will fall 9 percent this year to $67.4 billion. But the outlook could improve as the prospect of interest rate increases in the United States and political tensions have caused volatility levels to edge higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an earlier report, Coalition said it expected full-year revenues at the world's top 10 investment banks to fall 2 percent year-on-year to $150.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In equities, Morgan Stanley came first for a second year running, having earned $2.8 billion in revenue in the first half. JPMorgan and Goldman, who had held the top spot with Morgan Stanley last year, were joint second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman moved up one place to lead the rankings of banks' investment banking divisions, whose staff advise on deals, alongside JPMorgan and Bank of America. The three each made revenue of around $3 billion in the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Clare Hutchison. Editing by Jane Merriman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An influential U.S. senator wants to hold hearings into "disturbing" issues raised by secretly taped conversations between Federal Reserve supervisors and officials at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), a bank the Fed was tasked with policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, on Friday called for hearings after portions of the recordings from 2011 and 2012 were made public.

"This American Life" to illustrate what she saw as an
inappropriately close relationship between regulator and bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tapes appear to show an unwillingness among some Fed
supervisors to both demand specific information from Goldman
about a transaction with Banco Santander and to strongly
criticize what Segarra concluded was the lack of an appropriate
conflict-of-interest policy at Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political interest in the recordings could feed suspicion
among Americans that little has changed on Wall Street since
bank regulators failed to identify and stop the risk-taking that
led to the 2007-2009 financial crisis and deep U.S. recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When regulators care more about protecting big banks from
accountability than they do about protecting the American people
from risky and illegal behavior on Wall Street, it threatens our
whole economy," Warren said in an emailed statement. "Congress
must hold oversight hearings on the disturbing issues raised by
today's whistleblower report when it returns in November."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown, in an email, said: "For too long, too many financial
regulators have been too cozy towards the very industry that
they are meant to police."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segarra was fired after nearly seven months at the New York
Fed as a so-called embedded supervisor at Goldman. She later
sued the branch of the U.S. central bank for $7 million but the
suit was dismissed in April for failing to state a claim that
merited whistleblower protection, a decision she is appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The New York Fed categorically rejects the allegations
being made about the integrity of its supervision of financial
institutions," it said in a statement on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the possibility of hearings, both the New York
Fed and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segarra stands by her allegations against the Fed, said
Linda Stengle, her lawyer. "The audio on the tapes speaks for
itself. Regardless of whether our case proceeds on appeal, we
are gratified that Carmen is vindicated by the recorded words of
employees of Goldman Sachs and the New York Fed," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segarra filed the wrongful termination suit in October,
claiming she was fired after refusing to alter a critical
examination of Goldman's legal and compliance units. In claims
she repeated in Friday's media reports, she said superiors were
too deferential to the bank and they pressured her to back down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 46 hours of meetings and conversations were recorded,
according to ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one conversation said to be among Fed examiners following
a meeting with Goldman officials, one participant appeared
concerned about pushing the bank too hard for details on the
Santander deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we don't want to discourage Goldman from disclosing
these types of things in the future, and therefore maybe you
know some comment that says don't mistake our inquisitiveness,
and our desire to understand more about the marketplace in
general, as a criticism of you as a firm necessarily," the
unidentified examiner told his colleagues, according to a
transcript provided by This American Life.

&lt;p&gt;* Former New York Fed bank examiner recorded conversations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Warren calls for hearings on coziness of relationship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Spicer and Emily Stephenson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - An influential U.S.
senator wants to hold hearings into "disturbing" issues raised
by secretly taped conversations between Federal Reserve
supervisors and officials at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, a
bank the Fed was tasked with policing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat on the Senate Banking
Committee, on Friday called for hearings after portions of the
recordings from 2011 and 2012 were made public. Fellow Democrat
Sherrod Brown, also a committee member, called for a "full and
thorough investigation" into the allegations they raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carmen Segarra, a former New York Fed bank examiner who
brought a wrongful termination lawsuit against her former
employer, recorded the conversations and provided them to the
investigative news outlet ProPublica and the public radio show
"This American Life" to illustrate what she saw as an
inappropriately close relationship between regulator and bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tapes appear to show an unwillingness among some Fed

comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segarra filed the wrongful termination suit in October,

        </body></entry><entry author="None" date="2014-09-26T19:30:00+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/26/ny-fitch-ratings-health-idUSnBw265472a+100+BSW20140926"><headline>Fitch Affirms Pfizer's IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Pfizer's IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed Pfizer Inc.'s (Pfizer's) ratings, including 
      the 'A+' Issuer Default Rating (IDR). The rating actions apply to 
      approximately $37.8 billion of consolidated debt outstanding as of June 
      29, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch forecasts that Pfizer will operate with total debt leverage 
      ranging between 1.5x and 1.7x, driven by relatively flat profitability 
      and debt levels, leaving the company little flexibility at its current 
      'A+' rating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch believes Pfizer will continue to aggressively deploy cash 
      towards acquisitions, share repurchases and an increasing dividend.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The company's patent cliff is generally manageable with roughly 16% of 
      branded revenues exposed to patent expiration in the next three years. 
      One of its at-risk products, Enbrel, is a biologic that Fitch expects 
      will lose far less market share to generic competition than what 
      typically occurs with small molecules.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Pfizer is making headway in shepherding a number of projects through 
      its pipeline. Notable progress has been made in advancing treatments for 
      symptoms of menopause and cancer and also for vaccines to prevent of 
      neisseria meningitidis and clostridium difficile infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch expects Pfizer will face incrementally declining organic 
      revenues through 2016. Fitch's expectation incorporates the anticipated 
      performance of Pfizer's mature, new and pipeline products, while 
      factoring in patent expiries, moderate macroeconomic headwinds and the 
      beneficial effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Pfizer will likely continue with narrowing its strategic focus on 
      human branded pharmaceuticals. Its efforts should improve long-term 
      profitability and growth, mitigating the negative effect of a 
      less-diversified business model.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch anticipates Pfizer will generate strong free cash flow (FCF) and 
      maintain solid liquidity during the intermediate term, with significant 
      cash balances and adequate access to the credit markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LEVERAGE LEAVES LITTLE FLEXIBILITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer's current leverage (total debt/EBITDA) at June 29, 2014 of 1.72x, 
      leaves the company little flexibility at its current 'A+' rating. Fitch 
      anticipates that Pfizer will operate with total debt leverage ranging 
      between 1.5x and 1.7x, driven by relatively flat profitability and debt 
      levels. FCF and cash on hand should be sufficient to fund targeted 
      acquisitions and share repurchases without requiring additional debt. 
      Fitch's rating for Pfizer does not incorporate any large transformative 
      acquisitions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AGGRESSIVE CASH DEPLOYMENT TO PERSIST
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes Pfizer will continue to aggressively deploy cash towards 
      acquisitions and (to a lesser degree) share repurchases. The relative 
      intensity between the two options will likely be driven by available 
      targets and the relative returns to shareholders. In addition, Fitch 
      expects that Pfizer will remain committed to an increasing dividend over 
      time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In May 2014, Pfizer decided to abandon its attempt to acquire 
      AstraZeneca (AZN) for roughly $119 billion. Pfizer's proposed 
      acquisition was based on strategic portfolio opportunities and a more 
      favorable tax status, particularly regarding the repatriation of future 
      foreign earnings to the U.S. The company continues to demonstrate its 
      willingness to pursue large strategic transactions, demonstrated by its 
      recent pursuit of AZN and completed acquisitions of Warner-Lambert, 
      Pharmacia and Wyeth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MANAGABLE PATENT EXPIRIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company's intermediate-term patent cliff is manageable. Over the 
      next three years, roughly 16% of the company's drug portfolio is at-risk 
      of losing market exclusivity, including two of its five best-selling 
      medicines - Celebrex (approximately 6% of total firm sales) and Enbrel 
      (approximately 8% of total firm sales). Generic competition in the U.S. 
      for Celebrex is expected as early as December 2014, and the base patent 
      for Enbrel expires internationally beginning in 2014. Pfizer does not 
      have rights to Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, but does receive modest 
      royalty income from Amgen for sales in those regions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not expect that Enbrel will face as serious a competitive 
      threat from generic alternatives as will Celebrex. Enbrel is a biologic, 
      and a generic biologic that is automatically interchangeable with Enbrel 
      will not likely emerge. Therefore, Fitch expects competitive challengers 
      will require significant research and marketing investments, making 
      steep price discounts and drastic market share gains by competitors less 
      likely.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PIPELINE SUCCESSES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Helping to mitigate the anticipated revenue challenges from patent 
      expiries, Pfizer has added new revenue sources over the past two years, 
      including Duavee (vasomotor symptoms of menopause), Prevnar 13 
      (pneumococcal vaccine expanded use), Xeljanz (arthritis) and Bosulif 
      (cancer).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company is making progress with late-stage pipeline candidates, such 
      as tafamidis (polyneuropathy), bivalent rLP2086 (Neisseria meningitidis 
      vaccine), PF-06425090 (Clostridium difficile vaccine) and palbociclib 
      (breast cancer). In addition, Pfizer is conducting clinical trials that 
      could expand the market of currently marketed products by garnering 
      regulatory approvals for their broader clinical use.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NARROWING STRATEGIC FOCUS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch anticipates that Pfizer will continue to sharpen its strategic 
      focus on human branded pharmaceuticals. While decreasing the diversity 
      of its product portfolio, an increased focus will enable the company to 
      improve the productivity of its core operations, including research  
      development, marketing and manufacturing. Fitch believes the company's 
      Global Established Pharmaceuticals business and its Consumer Health 
      business are possible divestment candidates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EXPECTED SOFT ORGANIC REVENUES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects the net effect of patent-protected product sales, lost 
      share due to products with near-term patent expirations and the ramp up 
      of recently introduced products will result in slightly declining 
      organic revenues through 2016. Fitch's revenue forecast assumes moderate 
      uptake of recently launched products, Celebrex's loss of market 
      exclusivity in December 2014, Enbrel's loss of European market 
      exclusivity in 2014, and Lyrica's loss of market exclusivity in Europe 
      in 2013. In addition, the persistence of weak macroeconomic trends 
      presents a headwind, while somewhat offset by a modest tailwind from the 
      expected increase in the rolls of the insured in 2014-2016 from the 
      Affordable Care Act.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      STRONG CASH FLOW EXPECTED
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch forecasts $6 billion to $7 billion of free cash flow (cash flow 
      from operations minus capital expenditures and dividends) for Pfizer in 
      2014. The forecast incorporates relatively durable margins supported by 
      a stable sales mix and a strong focus on cost control. In addition, 
      aggregate pricing across the company's product portfolio is expected to 
      be supportive for margins in the near term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SOLID LIQUIDITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch looks for Pfizer to maintain solid liquidity through strong FCF 
      generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM 
      ending June 29, 2014 was $11 billion. At the end of the period, Pfizer 
      had approximately $34.1 billion in cash/short-term investments and full 
      availability on its $7 billion revolver, maturing in October 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch views Pfizer's debt maturity schedule as manageable and expects 
      the company to refinance the vast majority of its upcoming maturities 
      with additional borrowings. Pfizer has approximately $3 billion of 
      long-term debt maturing in 2015, $4.3 billion in 2016 and $4 billion in 
      2017.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in 
      the near term, future developments that may individually or 
      collectively, lead to such an action include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --If Pfizer maintains gross debt leverage in the range of 1.0x to 1.3x;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --If the company sustains strong operational performance through the 
      current patent cliff period, including relatively stable to positive 
      trends in revenues, margins and FCF
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, 
      lead to a negative rating action include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --If pressure on operations is significant enough to result in sustained 
      gross debt leverage greater than 1.7x as a possible result of 
      marketplace pressures, adverse actions from regulatory bodies or 
      unfavorable clinical developments;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --If Pfizer pursues a transaction (acquisitions/share repurchases) that 
      places pressure on gross leverage without the expectation of delveraging 
      in a timely manner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DEBT ISSUE RATINGS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed Pfizer Inc.'s ratings as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IDR at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR at 'F1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper program at 'F1';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Credit facility at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings apply to roughly $30.9 billion of debt (excluding subsidiary 
      debt) outstanding at June 29, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has also affirmed the ratings of Pfizer's consolidated 
      subsidiaries as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wyeth LLC
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IDR at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings apply to roughly $5.5 billion of subsidiary debt outstanding 
      at June 29, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pharmacia Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IDR at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings apply to roughly $1.4 billion of subsidiary debt outstanding 
      at June 29, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
CHICAGO, September 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Pfizer
Inc.'s 
(Pfizer's) ratings, including the 'A+' Issuer Default Rating
(IDR). The rating 
actions apply to approximately $37.8 billion of consolidated
debt outstanding as 
of June 29, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of
ratings follows 
at the end of this press release.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
--Fitch forecasts that Pfizer will operate with total debt
leverage ranging 
between 1.5x and 1.7x, driven by relatively flat profitability
and debt levels, 
leaving the company little flexibility at its current 'A+'
rating. 
--Fitch believes Pfizer will continue to aggressively deploy
cash towards 
acquisitions, share repurchases and an increasing dividend. 
--The company's patent cliff is generally manageable with
roughly 16% of branded 
revenues exposed to patent expiration in the next three years.
One of its 
at-risk products, Enbrel, is a biologic that Fitch expects will
lose far less 
market share to generic competition than what typically occurs
with small 
molecules. 
--Pfizer is making headway in shepherding a number of projects
through its 
pipeline. Notable progress has been made in advancing treatments
for symptoms of 
menopause and cancer and also for vaccines to prevent of
neisseria meningitidis 
and clostridium difficile infections. 
--Fitch expects Pfizer will face incrementally declining organic
revenues 
through 2016. Fitch's expectation incorporates the anticipated
performance of 
Pfizer's mature, new and pipeline products, while factoring in
patent expiries, 
moderate macroeconomic headwinds and the beneficial effect of
the Affordable 
Care Act (ACA).
--Pfizer will likely continue with narrowing its strategic focus
on human 
branded pharmaceuticals. Its efforts should improve long-term
profitability and 
growth, mitigating the negative effect of a less-diversified
business model. 
--Fitch anticipates Pfizer will generate strong free cash flow
(FCF) and 
maintain solid liquidity during the intermediate term, with
significant cash 
balances and adequate access to the credit markets. 
LEVERAGE LEAVES LITTLE FLEXIBILITY
Pfizer's current leverage (total debt/EBITDA) at June 29, 2014
of 1.72x, leaves 
the company little flexibility at its current 'A+' rating. Fitch
anticipates 
that Pfizer will operate with total debt leverage ranging
between 1.5x and 1.7x, 
driven by relatively flat profitability and debt levels. FCF and
cash on hand 
should be sufficient to fund targeted acquisitions and share
repurchases without 
requiring additional debt. Fitch's rating for Pfizer does not
incorporate any 
large transformative acquisitions. 
AGGRESSIVE CASH DEPLOYMENT TO PERSIST
Fitch believes Pfizer will continue to aggressively deploy cash
towards 
acquisitions and (to a lesser degree) share repurchases. The
relative intensity 
between the two options will likely be driven by available
targets and the 
relative returns to shareholders. In addition, Fitch expects
that Pfizer will 
remain committed to an increasing dividend over time.
In May 2014, Pfizer decided to abandon its attempt to acquire
AstraZeneca (AZN) 
for roughly $119 billion. Pfizer's proposed acquisition was
based on strategic 
portfolio opportunities and a more favorable tax status,
particularly regarding 
the repatriation of future foreign earnings to the U.S. The
company continues to 
demonstrate its willingness to pursue large strategic
transactions, demonstrated 
by its recent pursuit of AZN and completed acquisitions of
Warner-Lambert, 
Pharmacia and Wyeth.
MANAGABLE PATENT EXPIRIES
The company's intermediate-term patent cliff is manageable. Over
the next three 
years, roughly 16% of the company's drug portfolio is at-risk of
losing market 
exclusivity, including two of its five best-selling medicines -
Celebrex 
(approximately 6% of total firm sales) and Enbrel (approximately
8% of total 
firm sales). Generic competition in the U.S. for Celebrex is
expected as early 
as December 2014, and the base patent for Enbrel expires
internationally 
beginning in 2014. Pfizer does not have rights to Enbrel in the
U.S. and Canada, 
but does receive modest royalty income from Amgen for sales in
those regions. 
Fitch does not expect that Enbrel will face as serious a
competitive threat from 
generic alternatives as will Celebrex. Enbrel is a biologic, and
a generic 
biologic that is automatically interchangeable with Enbrel will
not likely 
emerge. Therefore, Fitch expects competitive challengers will
require 
significant research and marketing investments, making steep
price discounts and 
drastic market share gains by competitors less likely. 
PIPELINE SUCCESSES
Helping to mitigate the anticipated revenue challenges from
patent expiries, 
Pfizer has added new revenue sources over the past two years,
including Duavee 
(vasomotor symptoms of menopause), Prevnar 13 (pneumococcal
vaccine expanded 
use), Xeljanz (arthritis) and Bosulif (cancer). 
The company is making progress with late-stage pipeline
candidates, such as 
tafamidis (polyneuropathy), bivalent rLP2086 (Neisseria
meningitidis vaccine), 
PF-06425090 (Clostridium difficile vaccine) and palbociclib
(breast cancer). In 
addition, Pfizer is conducting clinical trials that could expand
the market of 
currently marketed products by garnering regulatory approvals
for their broader 
clinical use.
NARROWING STRATEGIC FOCUS
Fitch anticipates that Pfizer will continue to sharpen its
strategic focus on 
human branded pharmaceuticals. While decreasing the diversity of
its product 
portfolio, an increased focus will enable the company to improve
the 
productivity of its core operations, including research &amp;
development, marketing 
and manufacturing. Fitch believes the company's Global
Established 
Pharmaceuticals business and its Consumer Health business are
possible 
divestment candidates.
EXPECTED SOFT ORGANIC REVENUES
Fitch expects the net effect of patent-protected product sales,
lost share due 
to products with near-term patent expirations and the ramp up of
recently 
introduced products will result in slightly declining organic
revenues through 
2016. Fitch's revenue forecast assumes moderate uptake of
recently launched 
products, Celebrex's loss of market exclusivity in December
2014, Enbrel's loss 
of European market exclusivity in 2014, and Lyrica's loss of
market exclusivity 
in Europe in 2013. In addition, the persistence of weak
macroeconomic trends 
presents a headwind, while somewhat offset by a modest tailwind
from the 
expected increase in the rolls of the insured in 2014-2016 from
the Affordable 
Care Act.
STRONG CASH FLOW EXPECTED
Fitch forecasts $6 billion to $7 billion of free cash flow (cash
flow from 
operations minus capital expenditures and dividends) for Pfizer
in 2014. The 
forecast incorporates relatively durable margins supported by a
stable sales mix 
and a strong focus on cost control. In addition, aggregate
pricing across the 
company's product portfolio is expected to be supportive for
margins in the near 
term.
SOLID LIQUIDITY
Fitch looks for Pfizer to maintain solid liquidity through
strong FCF generation 
and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM ending
June 29, 2014 was 
$11 billion. At the end of the period, Pfizer had approximately
$34.1 billion in 
cash/short-term investments and full availability on its $7
billion revolver, 
maturing in October 2018.
Fitch views Pfizer's debt maturity schedule as manageable and
expects the 
company to refinance the vast majority of its upcoming
maturities with 
additional borrowings. Pfizer has approximately $3 billion of
long-term debt 
maturing in 2015, $4.3 billion in 2016 and $4 billion in 2017.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating
action in the near 
term, future developments that may individually or collectively,
lead to such an 
action include:
--If Pfizer maintains gross debt leverage in the range of 1.0x
to 1.3x;
--If the company sustains strong operational performance through
the current 
patent cliff period, including relatively stable to positive
trends in revenues, 
margins and FCF
Negative: Future developments that may, individually or
collectively, lead to a 
negative rating action include:
--If pressure on operations is significant enough to result in
sustained gross 
debt leverage greater than 1.7x as a possible result of
marketplace pressures, 
adverse actions from regulatory bodies or unfavorable clinical
developments;
--If Pfizer pursues a transaction (acquisitions/share
repurchases) that places 
pressure on gross leverage without the expectation of
delveraging in a timely 
manner.
DEBT ISSUE RATINGS
Fitch has affirmed Pfizer Inc.'s ratings as follows:
--IDR at 'A+';
--Short-term IDR at 'F1'. 
--Commercial paper program at 'F1';
--Credit facility at 'A+';

--Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'.
The ratings apply to roughly $1.4 billion of subsidiary debt
outstanding at June 
29, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Games market to grow at a CAGR of 9.19% over the period 
      2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the beginning, games were restricted to board games and associated 
      video games. The introduction and popularity of PCs and electronic 
      devices and the rise of the internet has led to the development and 
      commercialization of gaming. Consumers are now yearning for interactive 
      entertainment in the form of games. Games now have different genres and 
      offer different user experiences across a wide variety of platforms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major trends in this market is the increased number of 
      platforms such as mobile platforms, social network gaming, handheld 
      games, and online games on the PC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers of market growth is 
      the emergence of mobile games because of the rapid adoption of 
      smartphones and tablets with internet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one key inhibitor of market growth is 
      the piracy of games because pirate servers are offering licensed, 
      fee-based games for free.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      For investors seeking to participate in the US Energy Renaissance, 
      Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (&#8220;GSAM&#8221;) is pleased to announce the 
      public listing of the Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund (the 
      &#8220;Fund&#8221;), now trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker 
      symbol &#8220;GER.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Further expanding our energy-focused product line continues to be an 
      important strategic initiative for GSAM, and we are pleased to have 
      completed our second successful MLP closed-end fund launch within the 
      last 12 months,&#8221; said James McNamara, President of the Goldman Sachs 
      Funds advised by GSAM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fund will invest primarily in Master Limited Partnerships (&#8220;MLPs&#8221;) 
      and other energy investments. The Fund currently expects to concentrate 
      its investments in the energy sector, with an emphasis on midstream MLP 
      investments. The Fund will invest in investments across the energy value 
      chain, including upstream, midstream and downstream investments. The 
      Fund seeks a high level of total return with an emphasis on current 
      distributions to shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Fund 
      will achieve its investment objective or that the Fund's investment 
      program will be successful.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe the US energy renaissance story is only in its early stages 
      and we see multiple years of growth ahead,&#8221; said Kyri Loupis, Managing 
      Director of GSAM and lead portfolio manager for the Fund. &#8220;Our midstream 
      MLP focus, combined with an opportunistic approach for selecting energy 
      users and producers, can help make this fund more of a complete product 
      for today&#8217;s environment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fund is managed by GSAM&#8217;s Energy  Infrastructure Team, which is 
      among the industry&#8217;s largest MLP investment groups. As of August 31, 
      2014 the team managed approximately $14.1 billion in MLPs and other 
      energy investments.2

      Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount 
      from their net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;), which may increase investors&#8217; risk 
      of loss. At the time of sale, an investor&#8217;s shares may have a market 
      price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than the 
      original investment. There is no assurance that the Fund will meet its 
      investment objective. Past performance does not guarantee future 
      results. Investments in securities of MLPs involve risks that differ 
      from investments in common stock, including among others risks related 
      to limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting MLPs, 
      potential conflicts of interest risk, cash flow risks, dilution risks 
      and trading risks.

			Fund Risk Considerations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund invests 
      primarily in master limited partnership (&#8220;MLP&#8221;) and other energy 
      investments. The Fund&#8217;s equity investments are subject to market risk, 
      which means that the value of the securities in which it invests may go 
      up or down in response to numerous factors, including the prospects of 
      individual companies, particular sectors and/or general economic 
      conditions. Investments in MLPs are subject to certain additional 
      risks, including risks related to limited control and limited rights to 
      vote, potential conflicts of interest, cash flow risks, dilution risks, limited 
      liquidity, risks related to the general partner&#8217;s right to force 
      sales at undesirable times or prices, interest rate sensitivity and for 
      MLPs with smaller capitalizations, lower trading volume and abrupt or 
      erratic price movements. MLPs are also subject to risks relating to 
      their complex tax structure, including the risk that an MLP could 
      lose its tax status as a partnership, resulting in a reduction in the 
      value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in the MLP and lower income to the Fund. 
      MLPs are also subject to the risk that to the extent that a distribution 
      received from an MLP is treated as a return of capital, the Fund&#8217;s 
      adjusted tax basis in the MLP interests may be reduced, which may 
      increase the Fund&#8217;s tax liability upon the sale of the MLP interests or 
      upon subsequent distributions in respect of such interests. The Fund&#8217;s 
      strategy results in its being taxed as a regular corporation, or &#8220;C&#8221; 
      corporation, which involves complicated accounting, tax and 
      valuation issues. Many MLPs in which the Fund invests operate facilities 
      within the energy sector and are also subject to risks affecting that 
      sector. Because the Fund concentrates its investments in the energy 
      sector, the Fund is subject to greater risk of loss as a result of 
      adverse economic, business or other developments affecting industries 
      within that sector than if its investments were more diversified across 
      different industries. The Fund may invest in private investment in 
      public equities (&#8220;PIPEs&#8221;) which may be deemed illiquid. The 
      securities of mid- and small-capitalization companies involve 
      greater risks than those associated with larger, more established 
      companies and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements. 
      The Fund may invest in MLPs with smaller capitalizations which 
      may have limited financial resources and less liquidity. The Fund may invest 
      in private companies, or companies prior to their initial public 
      offering,
			which are not subject to Securities and Exchange 
      Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) reporting and are more vulnerable to market 
      conditions. The Fund is non-diversified and may invest a larger 
      percentage of its assets in fewer issuers than diversified funds. 
      Accordingly, the Fund may be more susceptible to adverse developments 
      affecting any single issuer held in its portfolio and to greater losses 
      resulting from these developments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fund is newly organized and has no operating history. Shares 
      of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount 
      from their net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;) and the Fund cannot predict 
      whether its shares will trade at, below or above NAV or the initial 
      public offering price. The Fund is subject to leverage risk, 
      which involves risks and special considerations including the likelihood 
      of greater volatility of NAV, market price and dividend rate of the 
      shares than a comparable portfolio without leverage; the risk that 
      fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings and short-term debt or in 
      the interest or dividend rates on any leverage that the Fund must pay 
      will reduce returns; the effect of leverage in a declining market, which 
      is likely to cause a greater decline in the NAV of the shares than if 
      the Fund were not leveraged, which may result in a greater decline in 
      the market price of the shares. The Fund&#8217;s investments in derivative 
      instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, 
      and may have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Investments 
      in derivative instruments may be harder to value, subject to greater 
      volatility and more likely subject to changes in tax treatment than 
      other investments. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all 
      investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The 
      Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, Sept. 26, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq:MSFT) ("Microsoft") and 21Vianet Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:VNET) ("21Vianet" or the "Company"), announced that&#160;Windows Azure services' WebDirect payment services are now available to all customers in&#160;China.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Customers can purchase public cloud services at international standards directly from the 21Vianet official website.&#160;In contrast to traditional offline purchase models, the self-serviced WebDirect model will greatly simplify the contract signing, purchasing, and payment processes. Customers can start using the cloud services as soon as payments are accepted.&#160;It will be easier and less costly for small  medium enterprises (SMEs), startups, and developers to adopt public cloud services.&#160;The "One RMB Trial" promotion (terms and conditions apply) allows new customers to enjoy a comprehensive public cloud Windows Azure services package for one month, typically valued at RMB2,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mr. George Zhiqing Yan, General Manager of Marketing and Operations for Microsoft Greater China, said, "Since Windows Azure's official launch on March 26, 2014, we have made great progress, exceeding our expectations with the speed and magnitude in which our users have grown. We have always been committed to introducing the world's leading technology and services, and now users in China can also experience public cloud services at international standards. Over the past few months, working with 21Vianet, we have been strengthening the speed and frequency of updates for our public cloud functions and services, further improving our users' experience.&#160;WebDirect's rollout will substantially simplify the process of implementing public cloud services, allowing SMEs, startups and developers to experience the online payment, instant deployment, pay-as-you-go way of purchase of Windows Azure and helping them face the IT challenges in this age of cloud computing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mr. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, Mr. Ralph Haupter, Corporate Vice President and CEO of Microsoft Greater China, and Mr.&#160;Josh Chen, Chairman and CEO of 21Vianet all attended the launch event together. Mr. Josh Chen, Chairman and CEO of 21Vianet, stated, "We are extremely excited to achieve another great milestone in the collaboration between 21Vianet and Microsoft. The WebDirect online payment portal will significantly reduce customers' IT costs and enable them to more easily and efficiently deal with any difficult challenges in the cloud era."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	WebDirect is a pre-paid model &#8211; it enables customers to order Windows Azure products and services and sign contracts online and prepay for these services by using Alipay and UnionPay payment systems. Currently, the typical online contract will be valid for one year and the lowest package available to customers will cost RMB 700.&#160;Windows Azure offers standard service level agreements (SLAs) and users can customize their service packages depending on their specific needs.&#160;Once customers begin using the services, the WebDirect system will automatically deduct amounts from the account balance based on actual usage.&#160;Prepaid accounts do not support any usage exceeding the paid amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Globally, Windows Azure has become&#160;Microsoft's&#160;fastest growing business segment, servicing over 57% of Fortune 500 companies&#160;in more than 100 countries.&#160;In China, Windows Azure operated by 21Vianet is the first commercially offered public cloud service at international standards.&#160;By combining Microsoft's leading global cloud technologies and 21Vianet's reliable local operation, Windows Azure has been able to attract many new customers, many of which are market leaders in their respective fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Starting today, 21Vianet offers the "One RMB Trial" promotion (term and conditions apply) for new customers.&#160;Paying one RMB via online registration, customers will be able to enjoy a public cloud Windows Azure services package for one month, typically valued at RMB2,000.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will unveil a new name for its best-known product on Tuesday when it offers the first official glimpse of its latest Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, known for the past few years as "Threshold" inside the software company and "Windows 9" outside it, will likely get an entirely new brand, or just be called Windows,  analysts said, ahead of its full release early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name change is symbolic of a new direction and style for Microsoft, which is veering away from an aggressive focus on Windows and PCs, the hallmark of previous Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. The new, quieter emphasis is on selling services across all devices and is championed by new boss Satya Nadella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The switch also represents a desire to erase the ill will generated by Windows 8, an ambitious attempt to redesign Windows with tablet users in mind, which ended up annoying and confusing the core market of customers who use mice and keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 8 was not a shining moment for Microsoft," said Michael Silver, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner. "Probably the biggest issue that lingers is the negative brand equity in the name."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many users howled in protest over the death of the start-button menu and the introduction of a colorful grid of squares or tiles representing apps in what became known as the modern user interface, even though they could easily switch to a traditional desktop mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judging by recent leaks online, which Microsoft has not tried to discredit, the start-button menu will come back in the next Windows, with an option of tacking on tiles if preferred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the problem of users having to toggle between the modern interface and the old-style desktop - for instance to use the full version of Excel spreadsheet software - has yet to be solved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The schizophrenic behavior between the modern user interface and the Windows desktop has got to go away," said  David Johnson, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. "They have to smooth that out." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment on the new name, or what it plans to unveil on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company has said only that it will have a "discussion" about where Windows is headed at a stylish event space in San Francisco on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice of wording and venue are key to a humbler, lower-profile Microsoft under Nadella, who is keen to rebuild respect in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley as it moves away from the PC and to play a bigger part in the mobile computing world fashioned by Apple Inc and Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella's slogan is "mobile first, cloud first," and although he will not be at the San Francisco event - he is traveling in Asia - that theme will be at the fore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a launching pad and catalyst for Nadella's holistic cloud vision over the coming years," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at investment bank FBR Capital Markets. "Windows 9 is a potentially game-changing product release for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella is resigned to the fact that sales of PCs have leveled off, and with it sales of Windows. With the explosion of smartphones and tablets, Windows now powers only 14 percent of computing devices sold last year, according to Gartner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His response is to focus on selling high-quality services - such as the Office suite of applications or storing documents in the cloud - to people on whatever device or system they are using. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is changing from a company that was Windows-centric to one that is services-centric," said Silver at Gartner. "It has to be that way. Windows revenue is likely going to decline, and Microsoft's task is to replace that Windows revenue with revenue from services on all sorts of platforms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to come up with killer apps and services users can't live without. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft built their business on being very good at delivering what people needed in the moment, for example Excel in the 1990s," said Johnson at Forrester. "That's what Microsoft has to get back to, innovating and creating things that people find indispensable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's Xalkori, which treats lung cancer patients with a specific gene mutation, proved effective in shrinking tumors in those with an even rarer form of the disease, according to data presented at a medical meeting on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study of 50 non-small cell lung cancer patients with a rearrangement of the ROS1 gene, Xalkori treatment led to significant tumor shrinkage in 36 of them, or 72 percent, and halted tumor growth in an additional 9 patients, researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xalkori, known chemically as crizotinib, was approved to treat patients with a mutation of the ALK gene, along with a companion diagnostic test to identify those with the mutation, which accounts for about 4 percent of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). About 1 to 2 percent of NSCLC patients are believed to be ROS1 positive - the result of a fusion of two genes that are usually separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first definitive study to establish crizotinib's activity in a large group of patients with ROS1-positive lung cancer and confirms that ROS1 is a bona fide therapeutic target in those patients," Dr. Alice Shaw, the study's lead investigator from the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average duration of response to the oral drug taken twice daily was 17 months, and half of the patients were still receiving treatment with no evidence of tumor progression, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The remissions induced by crizotinib in ROS1-positive patients are quite prolonged, and (treatment) resistance appears to emerge much later, on average, than what we have seen with other targeted therapies for lung cancer and melanoma," Shaw said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) meeting in Madrid and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in diagnostic tools and the understanding of human genetics have enabled doctors to identify patients with the ROS1 mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a great example of success in personalized medicine," said Dr. John Iafrate, medical director of  Massachusetts General's Center for Integrated Diagnostics and one of the study's leaders. He called the results "incredibly important for ROS patients." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ROS1-positive NSCLC patients are rare, Iafrate said, "if you devote the diagnostic laboratory resources to find that 1 to 2 percent of patients, you will make a real difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xalkori is not yet approved to treat ROS1-positive patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer continues to support clinical research of Xalkori in patients with ROS1 rearrangements to better understand the compound's activity in this population," the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are an estimated 1.5 million new cases of NSCLC worldwide each year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xalkori, known chemically as crizotinib, was approved to
treat patients with a mutation of the ALK gene, along with a
companion diagnostic test to identify those with the mutation,
which accounts for about 4 percent of non-small cell lung
cancers (NSCLC). About 1 to 2 percent of NSCLC patients are
believed to be ROS1 positive - the result of a fusion of two
genes that are usually separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first definitive study to establish
crizotinib's activity in a large group of patients with
ROS1-positive lung cancer and confirms that ROS1 is a bona fide
therapeutic target in those patients," Dr. Alice Shaw, the
study's lead investigator from the Massachusetts General
Hospital Cancer Center in Boston, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average duration of response to the oral drug taken
twice daily was 17 months, and half of the patients were still
receiving treatment with no evidence of tumor progression,
researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The remissions induced by crizotinib in ROS1-positive
patients are quite prolonged, and (treatment) resistance appears
to emerge much later, on average, than what we have seen with
other targeted therapies for lung cancer and melanoma," Shaw
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was presented at the European Society for Medical
Oncology (ESMO) meeting in Madrid and published in the New
England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in diagnostic tools and the understanding of human
genetics have enabled doctors to identify patients with the ROS1
mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a great example of success in personalized
medicine," said Dr. John Iafrate, medical director of 
Massachusetts General's Center for Integrated Diagnostics and
one of the study's leaders. He called the results "incredibly
important for ROS patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ROS1-positive NSCLC patients are rare, Iafrate said,
"if you devote the diagnostic laboratory resources to find that
1 to 2 percent of patients, you will make a real difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xalkori is not yet approved to treat ROS1-positive patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer continues to support clinical research of Xalkori in
patients with ROS1 rearrangements to better understand the
compound's activity in this population," the company said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are an estimated 1.5 million new cases of NSCLC
worldwide each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Rosneft, Exxon complete drilling of Universitetskaya-1
well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Rosneft says discovered oil is comparable to Siberian
Light oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Exxon's work in Russia in doubt due to sanctions over
Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Vladimir Soldatkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Russia's top crude oil producer
Rosneft said on Saturday it had made an oil discovery
jointly with ExxonMobil at an offshore Arctic field,
which has been at the centre of controversy due to Western
sanction against Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, further progress at the site is likely to be
problematic as international oil majors have to wind down work
in Russia due to Western sanctions following the Ukraine crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft and its head Igor Sechin were among the targets of
the sanctions, imposed over Moscow's role in the Ukrainian
conflict, which has claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sanctions, introduced by the United States and European
Union, effectively freeze access by Russian companies to foreign
technology and ban Western companies from cooperating in the
Arctic, as well as in shale exploration and deep-water drilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft said on Saturday it and ExxonMobil had successfully
completed drilling of the Universitetskaya-1 well, the most
northerly well in the world, located in the
East-Prinovozemelskiy-1 license area in the Kara Sea oil
province, where oil reserves are estimated to be comparable to
those of Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first oil was extracted. It is an astonishing sample of
light oil, which based on the results of the analysis performed,
is comparable to Siberian Light oil," Sechin said in a statement
on Rosneft's web site. He said Rosneft would like to call the
discovered field "Pobeda", Russian for victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However it was not yet clear if commercially viable
quantities of oil could be recovered from the well. Rosneft said
data from the well will be analysed and only then could a
conclusion be reached on the reserves there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHORT EXTENSION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft signed a $3.2 billion agreement in 2011 to
develop the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said last week the U.S. Treasury Department had given
it a short extension to wind down a rig at the well, beyond the
14 days outlined in the sanctions targeting Western cooperation
in Russia's oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia is one of the world's top crude producers and the
biggest supplier to Europe, but its reservoirs are in decline
and it must look to new sources to retain its positions.
Large-scale offshore oil production in Arctic is not expected
before the middle of the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before sanctions, Rosneft had planned to tap other parts of
the offshore Arctic, key for the future oil production in
Russia, jointly with Exxon. A Rosneft spokesman declined to
comment on whether those projects will go ahead in the light of
sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prospect of sanctions on Russia has been a big issue for
Exxon this year. It spent $6 million on lobbying the U.S.
government in the first half of 2014 and listed Russian
sanctions as one of its lobbying issues, according to
disclosures filed to the U.S. Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon also paid about another $170,000 to four outside firms
for lobbying in the second quarter, largely tied to Russian
sanctions, the disclosures show.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIAMI, Fla., Sept. 27, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - Millions of families choose to visit Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, every year for their annual family vacation. Eccentry Holidays Sunny Isles knows that the parks can become pretty crowded during the peak travel seasons and around major holidays. So to alleviate some of the inevitable line waiting, Eccentry Holidays Sunny Isles has compiled a handful of helpful tips designed to get families the most out of their time spent at Disney World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	1. Get there early. 
	Arriving at the parks early is easily the best idea that families can have when they choose to vacation at Disney World. Travelers should tough through their early-morning drowsiness and get to the parks just as they open, and then immediately head for the most popular attractions. As one of the first people in the park, travelers will quickly realize that this means there will be hardly any wait for attractions that will later have over 60-minute waits later on in the day. Rides like Rockin' Rollercoaster, Soarin', Expedition Everest, and Splash Mountain are a few of the major attractions that this tactic works great with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	2. Save shopping for last. 
			Eccentry Holidays Sunny Isles also recommends that families refrain from spending too much time shopping throughout the day. Nearly every ride and attraction has a gift shop that guests exit through after the attraction ends. Lots of time can be wasted browsing through these shops, time that could be better-spent heading onto the next attraction. The stores usually stay open later than anything else in the parks, so at the end of the day, parents can let their kids pick out a souvenir that they spotted earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	3. Use the Fast-Pass 
	Another great time saving tip involves utilizing the Fast-Pass system. Eccentry Holidays Sunny Isles points out that the parks now utilize a system where the ticket issued can act as a fast-pass, allowing guests to enter into expedited lines. Utilize the system for attractions that usually have over an hour wait, and it will greatly save guest's time. The fast-pass will present a designated time to return to the attraction at, so guests are free to do as they will until the return window rolls around. Consider using fast-passes for attractions like Toy Story Mania, Soarin', Splash Mountain, and Rockin' Rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs led
underwriting rankings in Asia Pacific ex-Japan equity capital

      therapeutic potential of the combination of Pfizer&#8217;s PF-05082566, an 
      investigational, fully humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that 
      stimulates signaling through 4-1BB (CD-137), a protein involved in 
      regulation of immune cell activation, proliferation and survival, with 
      Kyowa Hakko Kirin&#8217;s anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab, which suppresses 
      some of the immune cells that shield the tumor from the immune system, 
      in a Phase Ib clinical study evaluating the safety and tolerability of 
      the combination in patients with solid tumors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer and Kyowa Hakko Kirin will 
      co-fund the clinical study, which will be conducted by Pfizer. This 
      study is expected to establish a recommended dose regimen and assess the 
      safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination. This study is 
      expected to begin in 2015 and the results will determine the future 
      clinical development of the combination.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe that combination therapy in immuno-oncology holds great 
      promise to improve outcomes for patients with cancer and provides an 
      exciting opportunity for Pfizer to maximize the potential of our 
      emerging immuno-oncology portfolio,&#8221; said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior 
      vice president of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs and chief 
      medical officer for Pfizer Oncology. &#8220;Our collaboration with Kyowa Hakko 
      Kirin provides an additional important partnership opportunity to 
      explore the potential of 4-1BB as part of a novel immunotherapy 
      combination regimen.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With recent progress in the field of cancer immunotherapy, the 
      combination therapy of mogamulizumab and Pfizer&#8217;s 4-1BB agonist has the 
      potential to bring significant benefits to patients,&#8221; said Yoichi Sato, 
      managing executive officer, vice president, Head of Research and 
      Development Division of Kyowa Hakko Kirin. &#8220;Collaborating with Pfizer, a 
      world&#8217;s leading pharmaceutical company, on a clinical study in emerging 
      immuno-oncology field is an important component of Kyowa Hakko Kirin&#8217;s 
      ongoing transformation into a global specialty pharmaceutical company. 
      We are excited about this opportunity.&#8221;

			About PF-05082566
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PF-05082566 is an investigational, fully humanized mAb that targets 
      4-1BB (CD-137), a protein expressed in many immune cells. In 
      pre-clinical models, it has shown anti-tumor activity by enhancing 
      T-cell mediated immune responses. Pfizer is currently evaluating 
      PF-05082566 in a Phase I study as a single agent in multiple tumor 
      types, as well as in several combination studies, including a clinical 
      study of PF-05082566 in combination with rituximab in non-Hodgkin 
      lymphoma patients. PF-05082566 is not approved for any indications in 
      any markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About Mogamulizumab
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mogamulizumab is a novel, humanized mAb directed against CC chemokine 
      receptor 4 (CCR4). Engineered by Kyowa Hakko Kirin's unique POTELLIGENT&#174; 
      Technology, the antibody is designed to kill its target cells through 
      potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Mogamulizumab was 
      launched in Japan in May 2012 for the treatment of patients with 
      relapsed or refractory CCR4-positive adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma 
      (ATL). The drug was approved for indication expansion and was granted 
      marketing authorization in Japan for the treatment of patients with 
      relapsed or refractory CCR4-positive, peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) 
      and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in March 2014. Clinical trials with 
      mogamulizumab in ATL, PTCL, and CTCL are ongoing in the US, EU and other 
      countries.

      Research and Markets: Global Threat Intelligence Security Market 
      2014-2018 - Market Leaders are IBM, McAfee, Symantec  Trend Micro
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4k8mgs/global_threat) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Threat Intelligence Security Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Threat Intelligence Security Market to grow at a CAGR of 
      14.2% over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Threat intelligence is a security service given by security vendors to 
      thwart advanced attacks such as APT, advanced malware, and other new 
      breeds of sophisticated threats that have unknown signatures and are 
      slow and adaptive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These new breeds of cyber-attacks are immune to traditional security 
      solutions and hence the need for a proactive, intelligent system to 
      prevent attacks. Threat intelligence service is largely given as a 
      service through cloud by vendors that range from ICT vendors, security 
      vendors, and MSSP providers. The service offerings typically are of 
      three types: TIS Managed Security Services, TIS Information Feeds and 
      Publications, and TIS Consultative Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As the number of cyber-attacks continue to increase, the level of 
      awareness in organizations across geographies also rises. As 
      organizations realize that in-house security teams are not competent 
      enough, considering the level of sophistication in attacks by hackers, 
      this leads to increased look-up to vendors that give solutions not only 
      just to detect but also prevent any possible attack.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An enhancement in threat intelligence is one of the positive trends 
      acting on the market. Continuous enhancements and new mechanisms that 
      look to study the nature of past attacks will greatly benefit end-users 
      as it can significantly reduce the number of false negatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, growing sophisticated threats are one the most 
      prominent drivers acting on the market. As hacking tools are freely 
      available on the internet and knowledge of hacking is shared and 
      transferred, the attacks become increasingly advanced and more immune to 
      the available network security solutions, which has led customer 
      organizations to look for solutions such as threat intelligence that 
      have the capability to prevent such advanced attacks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that shortage of security talent is one major 
      challenge that the market is facing. The competition is intense among 
      organizations looking to hire talent so as to continuously innovate the 
      product offerings. An immense shortage of talent will therefore have a 
      negative bearing on the market, especially with attacks becoming 
      increasingly advanced.

      Research and Markets: Global Therapeutic Vaccines Market Outlook 2019 
      Featuring GSK, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi Avnetis  Serum Institute
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/9vl7kz/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Therapeutic Vaccines Market- Trends And Forecasts (2014-2019)" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The vaccine market accounts for a relatively small share (2-3%) of the 
      global pharmaceutical market sales. However, there has been rapid growth 
      over recent years, with the vaccine market quadrupling in value from USD 
      5 billion in 2000 to almost USD 24 billion in 2013. Once a commodity 
      market with low margins, the vaccines on the market now include 
      blockbusters and mega blockbusters. New candidates for vaccinating 
      against cancers and HIV are also projected to hit the magic milestone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multinational vaccine companies historically have conducted much of the 
      innovation, research, and development in the field of vaccine 
      production. They have used significant revenues, global size, and deeper 
      expertise to fund. The development of new technologies for vaccine 
      development - an expensive and relatively time consuming process. But 
      Despite the success of vaccines, infectious diseases are still a major 
      cause of illnesses worldwide and at least 40 major infectious diseases 
      are still uncontrolled by vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are currently close 120 new vaccines in the pipeline of various 
      companies across the globe set to hit the market in the next 5 years to 
      come. In anticipation of this and with the emergence of new target 
      market and smaller player into the market, the Global vaccine market is 
      set to grow by a CAGR of close to 12.4 % till the year 2020.

      Research and Markets: Taiwan Structured Data Management Software Market 
      2014-2018 with IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP  Sybase Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/mr8tk4/structured_data) 
      has announced the addition of the "Structured 
      Data Management Software Market in Taiwan 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Structured Data Management Software market in Taiwan to grow at 
      a CAGR of 3.38% over the period 2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Data that stored in a fixed place such as in a file or record are known 
      as structured data. Structured data have the advantage of being easily 
      entered, stored, and analyzed. Structured data management software can 
      be used to define where the data will be stored and how these data will 
      be stored. Initially, because of the high cost and performance 
      limitations of storage, memory, and processing, relational databases and 
      spreadsheets using structured data were the only way to effectively 
      manage the data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One major trend in the market is the emergence of Hadoop technology. 
      This technology helps businesses easily change the economics of their 
      data, which was previously very expensive to store and maintain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major growth drivers in the market 
      is the need to increase database storage capacity. Data in any 
      enterprise grows at a huge rate with time, and they require a high 
      storage capacity and efficient management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the increased adoption of Big Data is 
      one of the major challenges confronting the market. Enterprises are 
      always looking forward for new technologies and new business 
      opportunities, which can be realized by Big Data.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 29 (IFR) - Jason Mann, a financial institutions
group (FIG) syndicate official at JP Morgan in London, could be
set to leave the US bank after being put at risk, according to a
source close to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mann's potential departure, after more than three years of
service, will deepen the void in the bank's financials team that
has already lost three long-standing dept capital markets FIG
bankers in the past few months, according to sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, JP Morgan put at risk Veenay Chheda, an executive
director in the hybrid structuring team, Ian Haywood, a UK and
Ireland FIG DCM coverage banker, and Lily Brown, a French FIG
DCM banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You just have to look at the deals JP Morgan has missed
these days to see that clients are not particularly happy with
the way they are running the business," said a syndicate banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this year, JP Morgan has dropped out of
the top 10 financial bond houses for euro deals, having been at 
number nine in January of this year.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Aerocrine AB and Microsoft collaborate to test secure, cloud-based 
      remote medical device monitoring.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Regulatory News:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aerocrine AB (STO:AERO-B), the innovator of NIOX&#174; brand medical devices 
      announces today a collaboration with Microsoft. Aerocrine&#8217;s devices are 
      used by physicians to measure Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO), a 
      biomarker for allergic, airway inflammation which is linked with Asthma. 
      The collaboration will utilize Microsoft&#8217;s secure cloud services to 
      transmit device telemetry data from physician and company sites in 
      Sweden, UK and US back to Aerocrine for analyses. Aerocrine&#8217;s goal is to 
      use this information to deploy its field resources for customer service 
      and sales support in the future.&#160;Microsoft chose Aerocrine due to its 
      device technology, global reach and commitment to progressing human 
      health management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aerocrine is committed to improving the management of inflammatory 
      airway disease and the quality of patients&#8217; lives. One of the world&#8217;s 
      most common diseases, asthma affects 8 to 10 percent of the global 
      population. Since the disease has no cure, proper diagnosis and 
      management are important to optimize the treatment of a patient&#8217;s 
      asthma. Using an Aerocrine FeNO-testing device offers several advantages 
      for patient care. The physician can accurately identify the patients, 
      the type of medication they should receive and use the device to monitor 
      the patients&#8217; progress helping them to maintain adequate control and 
      minimize exacerbations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The ability to collect vital telemetry data from deployed devices has 
      been a key objective of ours. A cloud-based solution allowing us to 
      collect data on device performance in real-time helps us to be more 
      proactive in our customer support and ensure that our NIOX devices help 
      the physicians deliver the best possible outcome for the patient,&#8221; says 
      Scott Myers, CEO of Aerocrine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft and Aerocrine are working together on this pilot project 
      because of the unique ability of Aerocrine&#8217;s devices to generate data at 
      the point of care. This proof of concept will be conducted this fall and 
      will collect data from Aerocrine devices deployed in Sweden, the UK and 
      the United States. Microsoft will connect the Aerocrine devices to its 
      secure cloud analytics platform, Microsoft Azure in the first phase to 
      demonstrate the secure and accurate transmission of telemetry data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to work with Aerocrine on this project as part of the 
      CityNext, Healthier Cities initiative to show the potential of new 
      technology to drive productivity and patient safety as we move towards a 
      mobile-first and cloud-first world,&#8221; says Mathias Ekman, Industry 
      Marketing Development Manager at Microsoft Sweden.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - EnLink Midstream (ENLK.N) (ENLC.N) said on Monday it had signed a $235 million deal with Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to buy natural gas pipelines in Southern Louisiana, including those linked to the Henry Hub supply point that sets U.S. futures prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EnLink plans to acquire about 1,400 miles of pipelines from Beaumont, Texas, to the Mississippi River corridor that carry about 11 billion cubic feet of working natural gas storage capacity in Southern Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These assets, combined with EnLink's existing Louisiana operations, will allow the company to provide services to Southern Louisiana's growing industrial, refining and petrochemical marketplace, it said in a statement.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the deal gives EnLink ownership and management of the Henry Hub, the benchmark for natural gas futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Henry Hub is connected to 13 major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Henry Hub, though still important for U.S. gas pricing, has been surpassed as the most active place for trading the physical form of the fuel by hubs in shale-rich Pennsylvania and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, the federal Gulf of Mexico pumped about 20 percent of all U.S. natural gas, much of which flowed through the Henry Hub. Now it produces just 4 percent of the nation's total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Barani Krishnan and Scott DiSavino; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      In an effort to boost local recycling rates, Charleston County, in 
      partnership with Coca-Cola and Harris Teeter, is introducing the 
      Coca-Cola Recycle  Win program &#8211; a nationally recognized sustainability 
      initiative which offers tips on recycling and rewards selected residents 
      for proper recycling with a $50 Harris Teeter gift card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Recycling not only helps the environment, but it is good for our 
      communities&#8217; bottom line,&#8221; said Chairman of Charleston County Council 
      Teddie Pryor. &#8220;Our research shows that the Coca-Cola Recycle  Win 
      program can help take our recycling efforts to the next level.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Coca-Cola Recycle  Win program has helped other communities 
      increase recycling rates by as much as 15 percent,&#8221; said Charleston 
      County Councilmember Anna Johnson, who chairs Council&#8217;s Recycling/Solid 
      Waste Committee. &#8220;And we know that any increase in recycling rates saves 
      tax dollars in the long run by extending the life of landfills.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To promote recycling in Charleston County, The Coca-Cola Company and 
      Coca-Cola Bottling Company Consolidated have invested over $150,000 in 
      the Coca-Cola Recycle  Win program, which includes information that 
      will be mailed during the week of September 28 to all single family 
      households along existing curbside collection routes. .
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This mailer will contain an official &#8220;Give It Back&#8221; sticker which 
      residents must place on their recycling cart to be eligible for a chance 
      to win a $50 Harris Teeter gift card. The mailer will also contain a 
      list of accepted items for recycling. Additional mailers and stickers 
      will be available for pick up at Harris Teeter stores throughout 
      Charleston County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Plandai Biotechnology Expects Pfizer Viagra Patent Ruling Will Aid in Developing All-Natural Substitute to Treat Erectile Dysfunction&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Sep 29, 2014) - Planda&#237; Biotechnology (OTCQB: PLPL) has already begun cultivating and cloning the epimedium plants it recently acquired as part of its preliminary plans to develop and test what it anticipates will be an all-natural substitute for the widely popular erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs Viagra&#174;, Cialis&#174; and Levitra&#174;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why epimedium? Well, the company is working with a strain of the plant that has high levels of icariin, epimedium's primary active constituent which studies have shown may treat ED. Now, figure in the company's unique and proprietary extraction process, and Planda&#237; is confident it can develop a genetically pure, high icariin content Phytofare&#8482; extract for ED. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epimedium, also known as horny goat weed among other names, gained notoriety as an option for ED, which affects many millions of men worldwide, after it was used in a patent infringement case to rescind parts of the US Viagra patent (Patent 6,469,012) based on historic use in Chinese medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Viagra, claims that its drug was the first medical example of a PDE5 inhibitor which treated ED, and therefore claimed patent protection from all similar PDE5 inhibitors. Sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, is the PDE5 inhibitor Pfizer claimed was the first example of the inhibitor to treat ED, but Patent examiners used epimedium and its PDE5 inhibitor, icariin, as an example of prior use and rescinded those portions of the patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested in the science, PDE5 inhibitors block an enzyme that affects the smooth muscles in certain tissues, such as those responsible for causing erections. Blocking the enzyme increases the blood flow to those tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like its Phytofare&#8482; Catechin Complex, a green tea extract, Planda&#237; expects that its process will enhance epimedium's absorption and retention in the bloodstream offering those suffering from ED with an all-natural, and potentially safer substitute for the drugs sold by big pharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's expectation, assuming the ED product would be effective and safe after conducting research, development and testing, would be to market and sell the extract as an active ingredient to pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturers. Planda&#237; announced that it expects to commence testing on the possible ED product by mid-2015 after enough genetically pure mature plants for testing are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Stock Market Media Group

		&lt;h1&gt;Goldman Sachs Names Jyoti Bansal, Founder  CEO of AppDynamics, as "One of the 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs" at Third Annual Builders + Innovators Summit&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - Sep 29, 2014) - 
				Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) is recognizing Jyoti Bansal, founder and CEO of AppDynamics, as one of the 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs at its third annual Builders + Innovators Summit being held October 15th - 17th in Santa Barbara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bansal, a Silicon Valley product visionary and innovator, founded AppDynamics in 2008 to serve the burgeoning number of "software-defined businesses" that depend on complex applications and infrastructure to serve their customers and bring in revenue. Bansal recognized that visibility into every line of that software is critical to ensuring the performance not just of the applications, but of the business itself. And so he created the AppDynamics Application Intelligence Platform, which can, with extreme speed and minimal overhead, offer complete visibility into an enterprise's entire application infrastructure, and harvest critical business data from it. The platform is currently disrupting the multi-billion dollar application performance management (APM) market and fueling stratospheric growth for AppDynamics, which in six short years has grown to nearly 500 employees serving more than 1,400 enterprises worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bansal was selected by Forbes in 2013 as a "Best Cloud Computing CEO to Work For." In 2014, he was named "Best CEO" by the San Francisco Business Times at the Annual Tech  Innovation Awards, and was an EY Entrepreneur Of The Year&#8482; 2014 Award Finalist in Northern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is humbling to be included in this prestigious cohort of entrepreneurs," Bansal said, "Truly, I am here thanks to the drive, dedication, and brainpower of my incredibly talented colleagues at AppDynamics. I am fortunate to be standing at the helm of an amazing organization where everyone is committed to disruptive growth, pushing the boundaries of what is possible for this industry. We've already done so much but really, we're just getting started."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are honored to recognize Jyoti Bansal of AppDynamics as one of the most intriguing entrepreneurs of 2014," said David Solomon, co-head of investment banking at Goldman Sachs. "This is the third year for the summit, and we continue to be amazed by what happens when a diverse group of seasoned and emerging entrepreneurs -- the builders and innovators -- come together to discuss how to drive innovation, create jobs, and build enduring organizations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 140 years, Goldman Sachs has been advising and financing entrepreneurs as they launch and grow their businesses. In addition to honoring 100 entrepreneurs, the summit consists of general sessions and clinics led by Goldman Sachs experts, seasoned entrepreneurs, academics and business leaders, as well as resident scholars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For regular news and information about AppDynamics and the APM market, like and follow the company on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter: @AppDynamics

      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Retail Banking IT Spending Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.

		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Retail Banking IT market to grow at a CAGR of 4.09% over 
      the period 2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Retail banking IT spending occupies a major share in the total IT 
      spending by banks worldwide. Innovation in banking technologies has 
      transformed how a customer deals with a bank today. The evolution of 
      technologies has not only enhanced the customer experience and 
      satisfaction level, but has also made banks omnipresent virtually, such 
      as through a cellphone, a customer can complete a banking transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One key trend in this market is the need to integrate multiple channels. 
      Retail banks should integrate their solutions to serve multiple channels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main growth drivers of the Global 
      Retail Banking IT spending market is increased expenditure on BI 
      technologies. Newly developed channels such as mobile and internet give 
      an enormous amount of data about customers with which banks can easily 
      use to connect with their customers and provide solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in the 
      market is the ability to adopt new technologies more rapidly. 
      Advancements in technology and the adoption of these updated 
      technologies by customers are forcing banks to quickly adopt best-fit 
      technology to remain in the competition.

      Leading Vendors Dominating are Capgemini, CSC, HP IBM
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/brgv83/public_sector) 
      has announced the addition of the "Public 
      Sector Outsourcing Market in the UK 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Public Sector Outsourcing market in the UK to grow at a CAGR of 
      7.91% over the period 2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Public sector industries in the UK has witnessed a rise in 
      mid-market contracts, mainly as a result of the degree of the complexity 
      of the services required and the lack of appetite to utilize low-cost, 
      offshore resources. It is expected to witness small and middle-sized 
      enterprises to drive to procure services through the G-cloud and various 
      major contracts are expected to break down and shift to smaller 
      contracts over the next two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the emerging trends in this market is the adoption of Big Data 
      Analytics Outsourcing. With the adoption of technology and data centers, 
      the UK Public sector is increasingly focused to analyze and use this 
      data in a timely fashion to get a competitive advantage in terms of cost 
      and time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, increased adoption of cloud-based services and 
      technologies is one of the major drivers in the market. Cloud technology 
      is revolutionizing the mode of outsourcing business processes. With its 
      usage, the UK Public sector has been able to gain instant access to 
      on-demand applications and eliminate the need to invest in additional IT 
      infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that outsourcing of specific operational 
      processes requires BPOs to have a significant level of knowledge on the 
      government's business environment. Presently, various BPOs lack the 
      required process expertise and this could hamper the effective delivery 
      of solutions in Public sector outsourcing in the UK.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Public Sector Outsourcing market in the UK can be segmented 
      into two:

&lt;p&gt;OSLO (Reuters) - Kuddle, a Norwegian picture sharing app designed for children, plans to launch a child safe tablet with Microsoft on Dec 1, and expects to sign funding deals with several venture capital firms within weeks, its chief executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oslo-based company said it was on track to reach its goal of one million users by year-end and plans to soon raise another $5 million of fresh funds on top of the nearly $6 million it has already raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are working with Microsoft on several child safe devices which will be sold on our online store," Chief Executive Ole Vidar Hestaas said. "The first device will be an Ipad Mini sized tablet prized under $100 that will be ready ahead of the Kuddle Store launch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a child friendly device and it is not possible to download games like GTA (Grand Theft Auto) or apps like Snapchat," Hestaas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuddle, which bills itself as a rival to Instagram, lets parents monitor what their children publish and keeps access to content restricted, preventing strangers from seeing and sharing pictures. There are no hashtags or comments to prevent online bullying and "likes" are anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hestaas said the company also is in talks with Samsung and Microsoft's Nokia phones unit on similar cooperation, and that it was also working on deals with European telecoms operators Telenor and Vodafone for child safe Kuddle SIM cards to be sold separately or linked up to one of its devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app, which has a target of 1 million users by the end of 2014, is now available in 7 languages. The most significant growth has recently come from Brazil and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hestaas said he expects to conclude funding deals with several major international venture capital funds within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm's present investors include Norwegian golf ace Suzann Pettersen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joachim Dagenborg)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Antibiotics Market 2014-2018: AstraZeneca, 
      Eli Lilly, GSK, Johnson  Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer  Sanofi Lead the 
      Market
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/fqrtz8/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Antibiotics Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Antibiotics market to grow at a CAGR of 
      1.41% over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One key trend emerging in this market is the increase in demand for 
      antibiotics, which is attracting various companies to the pharmaceutical 
      space. The increase in demand for antibiotics to counter growing cases 
      of drug-resistant infections offers ideal opportunities for 
      pharmaceutical companies to introduce new products into the marketplace.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers in this market is the 
      increasing global aging population. The elderly are more likely to 
      acquire infections and require hospitalization. The elderly are more 
      prone to hospital-acquired infections. Therefore, more treatment 
      options, including antibiotics, are needed to meet the treatment 
      requirements of the growing elderly population.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges that this 
      market confronts is the emergence of drug-resistant strains. These 
      drug-resistant infectious agents can easily spread to other regions as 
      they are able to persist inside the human body despite treatment with 
      standard therapies.

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/zzlllh/global_internet) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Internet Advertising Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The analysts forecast Global Internet Advertising market to grow at 
      a CAGR of 11.75% over the period 2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Online advertising is a medium which uses internet for advertising a 
      product or services. It is one of the most popular media of advertising 
      because of its wide reach, flexibility, and accessibility. One of the 
      benefits of internet advertising is that it can be customized, making 
      consumer targeting more efficient and precise. For instance, Yahoo 
      search, AdWords, and Google AdSense are shown only on relevant web pages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One major trend in this market is localization and geo-targeting. 
      Through an IP address and GPS, advertisers can find out the geographic 
      information of the user and target him/her accordingly. Cookies also 
      help in narrowing the user's location.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers in this market is the 
      increase in mobile advertising with the increase in the number of 
      smartphones. Advertisers are increasingly using mobile advertising to 
      market their products because every second person in the world owns a 
      smartphone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the ethical issues relating to unwanted advertorials, 
      contextual links, pop-ups, and pop-unders. The users are concerned about 
      the privacy of their information on the internet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			To calculate market size, the report considers the revenue of 
      the following types of advertisement in the market:
		&lt;/p&gt;

      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      IT Services Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The Global IT Services market 2014-2018 to grow at a CAGR of 5.4% over

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is a wide range of IT services available, and organizations need 
      them to streamline their processes and integrate their systems. These 
      services help organizations reinvent themselves, develop a more 
      economical cost structure, and centralize their processes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud-based services are expected to play an increased role, led by 
      increasing awareness among customers about the advantages of these 
      services. The rapid development of cloud computing services has enabled 
      organizations to achieve better operational efficiency and productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers steering the growth of 
      the market is the emergence of outsourcing destinations. The APAC region 
      is considered an outsourcing hub, with the presence of many important 
      and sought-after outsourcing countries such as India, China, Australia, 
      Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the high cost of implementation of IT 
      services, such as licensing, installation, system design and 
      customization, testing, training, maintenance, and upgrades, poses a 
      major challenge to

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) will close its acquisition of International Business Machines Corp's (IBM) (IBM.N) x86 server division on Oct 1 for $2.1 billion, giving the Chinese tech firm the firepower to win business clients from U.S. rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closing purchase price is lower than the $2.3 billion announced in January because of a change in the valuation of inventory and deferred revenue liability, Lenovo said. Roughly $1.8 billion will be paid in cash and the remainder in stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchase is Lenovo's latest since overtaking Hewlett-Packard Co (HP) (HPQ.N) as the world's top personal computer (PC) maker last year, in its quest to diversify away from a steadily shrinking PC market. Earlier this year, Lenovo also said it would pay $2.9 billion for Google Inc's (GOOG.O) Motorola smartphone unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said the IBM deal opened a new "growth engine" for his company. He said he expected the x86 unit to bring in $5 billion in its first year and deliver margins higher than the 4 percent of Lenovo's PC business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the large and medium enterprise space we can now fully leverage IBM technology to compete with brands like HP and Dell," Yang said by telephone. "We can combine this good technology with Lenovo's efficient operations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's x86 server business has trailed those of HP and Dell Inc [DI.UL] in market share. But Yang said Lenovo has expertise competing in markets with razor-thin margins, gained during its journey to becoming the world's largest PC maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo currently sells a line of low-end servers under the ThinkServer brand, but the company pursued IBM's x86 portfolio because its higher-end machines can perform more complex analytics and database-related functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The x86 server team will continue to be led by former IBM executive Adalio Sanchez, who will report to Gerry Smith, president of Lenovo's enterprise business group, Lenovo said in a statement announcing the deal's impending closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some observers expected the deal would take longer to close because of uncertainty about how U.S. regulators might respond to a Chinese company buying a server business during a time of cyber-security tensions between the United States and China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo previously bought its consumer PC laptop business from IBM in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, IBM has been undergoing a strategic shift away from hardware, focusing instead on higher-margin cloud and big data products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Christopher Cushing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil
 is suspending cooperation with Russia's state-owned
company Rosneft on offshore drilling in the Arctic due
to sanctions, the daily Kommersant reported on Monday, citing
unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft and its head Igor Sechin were among the targets of
the sanctions, imposed over Moscow's role in the Ukrainian
conflict, which has claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Rosneft said it had made an oil discovery
jointly with ExxonMobil and that the two had successfully
completed drilling of a well in the Kara Sea oil province, where
oil reserves are estimated to be comparable to those of Saudi
Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said earlier this month that the U.S. Treasury
Department had given it a short extension to wind down a rig in
the Kara Sea beyond the 14 days outlined in the sanctions
targeting Western cooperation in Russia's oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Theoretically, there was a possibility to continue the
work, but it was necessary to obtain a new permit," Kommersant
reported, citing one of the unnamed sources. "But (ExxonMobil)
failed to get it. ExxonMobil should stop work and evacuate its
personnel by mid-October."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft declined to comment on the report. ExxonMobil was
not immediately available for comment.

			Lenovo Set to Close Acquisition of IBM&#8217;s x86 Server Business
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Acquisition to strengthen Lenovo&#8217;s position as global, diversified 
      tech leader, accelerates growth of enterprise and cloud strategies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lenovo
			(SEHK:992) (Pink Sheets:LNVGY) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) 
      announced today that conditions for Lenovo&#8217;s acquisition of IBM&#8217;s x86 
      server business have been satisfied and the parties anticipate they will 
      begin closing the transaction effective on October 1, 2014. The 
      acquisition will make Lenovo the third-largest player in the $42.1 
      billion global x86 server market.i
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lenovo is acquiring System x, BladeCenter and Flex System blade servers 
      and switches, x86-based Flex integrated systems, NeXtScale and iDataPlex 
      servers and associated software, blade networking and maintenance 
      operations. IBM will retain its System z mainframes, Power Systems, 
      Storage Systems, Power-based Flex servers, PureApplication and PureData 
      appliances.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the close of the x86 acquisition, Lenovo will add a world-class 
      business that extends our capabilities in enterprise hardware and 
      services, immediately making us a strong number three in the global 
      server market,&#8221; said Yang Yuanqing, chairman and CEO of Lenovo. &#8220;Now, 
      our priorities are to ensure a smooth integration and deliver a seamless 
      transition for customers. By combining Lenovo&#8217;s global reach, efficiency 
      and operational excellence with IBM&#8217;s legendary quality, innovation and 
      service, I am confident that we will have competitive advantages to help 
      us drive profitable growth and build Lenovo into a global enterprise 
      leader.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The agreement builds upon a strong history of collaboration that began 
      in 2005 when Lenovo acquired IBM&#8217;s PC business, including the ThinkPad 
      line of PCs. Lenovo&#8217;s pending acquisition of Motorola Mobility from 
      Google will make it the world&#8217;s third-largest smartphone maker, while 
      further strengthening its position as a top-three maker of smart 
      connected devices &#8211; PCs, tablets and smartphones.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The acquisition is a clear demonstration of the confidence we have 
      earned based on our consistent track record as a responsible global 
      investor and as a secure and reliable technology provider,&#8221; said Gerry 
      Smith, executive vice president of Lenovo Group and president of 
      Enterprise Business Group and Americas Group. &#8220;Lenovo has big plans for 
      the enterprise market. Over time, we will compete vigorously across 
      every sector, using our manufacturing scale and operational excellence 
      to repeat the success we have had with PCs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As described in the January announcement of Lenovo&#8217;s acquisition of 
      IBM&#8217;s x86 server business, Lenovo and IBM have also established a 
      strategic alliance where Lenovo will serve as an Original Equipment 
      Manufacturer (OEM) to IBM and resell selected products from IBM&#8217;s 
      industry-leading storage and software portfolio, including IBM&#8217;s entry 
      and midrange Storwize storage product family, Linear Tape Open (LTO) 
      products, IBM Flash storage arrays and elements of IBM&#8217;s system software 
      portfolio, including Smart Cloud, General Parallel File System and 
      Platform Computing solutions. This strategic alliance means Lenovo can 
      now offer these products as part of a more comprehensive enterprise IT 
      solution, allowing it to support a greater range of customer needs in 
      data centers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lenovo is buying IBM's x86 server business intact and is committed to 
      following the IBM x86 product roadmap, including Flex and x86-based 
      PureFlex integrated systems. Lenovo will continue to drive innovation in 
      these products. As previously disclosed, upon close, IBM will continue 
      to provide maintenance delivery on Lenovo&#8217;s behalf for an extended 
      period of time, so customers will experience a seamless transition with 
      no change in their maintenance support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The global team of the IBM x86 server business will be organized under 
      Lenovo&#8217;s Enterprise Business Group. Adalio Sanchez led the x86 server 
      business at IBM and will continue in this capacity at Lenovo, as senior 
      vice president of Enterprise Systems, reporting to Gerry Smith.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The purchase price is approximately US$ 2.1 billion. Approximately US$ 
      1.8 billion will be paid in cash at closing after estimated adjustments 
      and approximately US$ 280 million will be paid in Lenovo stock, based on 
      the closing price of Lenovo&#8217;s stock on September 26, 2014. The 
      transaction satisfied&#160;regulatory requirements and conditions, including 
      clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States 
      (CFIUS), the European Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transition will begin Wednesday in countries that are part of the 
      initial closing, which includes most major markets. The transaction is 
      expected to close in most other countries later this year, with the few 
      remaining countries following in early 2015.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd will

China's biggest personal computer maker a major asset as it
expands its offerings for business clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closing purchase price is lower than the $2.3 billion
valuation announced in January because of a change in the
valuation of inventory and deferred revenue liability, Lenovo
said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday said JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co must face a class action lawsuit by investors who claimed the largest U.S. bank misled them about the safety of $10 billion of mortgage-backed securities it sold before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan certified a class action as to JPMorgan's liability but not as to damages, saying it was unclear how investors could value the certificates they bought, given how the market was "not particularly liquid." He said the plaintiffs could try again to certify a class on damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oetken ruled 10 months after JPMorgan reached a $13 billion settlement to resolve U.S. and state probes into the New York-based bank's sale of mortgage securities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The class consists of investors before March 23, 2009 in certificates issued from nine of 11 trusts created by JPMorgan for the April 2007 offering. The other two trusts attracted only a handful of investors, and are the subject of other lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oetken named the Laborers Pension Trust Fund for Northern California and Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as lead plaintiffs, and their law firm Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd as lead counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The plaintiffs' lawyer did not immediately respond to a similar request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit said that JPMorgan misled prospective investors about the underwriting, appraisals and credit quality of the home loans underlying the certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said that by the time the litigation began in March 2009, six months after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc failed, the certificates were worth at most 62 cents on the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oetken rejected JPMorgan's arguments that the case could not be a class action because it was based on the practices of many originators and more than 8,000 underwriting guidelines, some investors were more sophisticated than others, and the MBS had evolved too rapidly during the two-year class period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said he had no basis to accept JPMorgan's request that he disqualify Robbins Geller because one of what the judge called the firm's "confidential sources" for the lawsuit, a former employee at a loan originator, later withdrew his testimony - something the bank said had occurred in other cases handled by the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, whose caption names a different plaintiff, is Fort Worth Employees' Retirement Fund v.

certificates were worth at most 62 cents on the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oetken rejected JPMorgan's arguments that the case could not
be a class action because it was based on the practices of many
originators and more than 8,000 underwriting guidelines, some
investors were more sophisticated than others, and the MBS had
evolved too rapidly during the two-year class period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said he had no basis to accept JPMorgan's request
that he disqualify Robbins Geller because one of what the judge
called the firm's "confidential sources" for the lawsuit, a
former employee at a loan originator, later withdrew his
testimony - something the bank said had occurred in other cases
handled by the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, whose caption names a different plaintiff, is Fort
Worth Employees' Retirement Fund v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-03701.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp announced its 'Windows 10' operating system on Tuesday to replace the largely unpopular Windows 8, skipping a number to mark a leap toward unifying the way people work on tablets, phones and traditional computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next version of Microsoft's flagship product, which still runs the vast majority of personal computers and is used by 1.5 billion customers worldwide, is aimed at recapturing the lucrative business market, which generally ignored the new-look Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 will be "our greatest enterprise platform ever," said Terry Myerson, Microsoft's head of operating systems, at an event in San Francisco. Only 20 percent of organizations migrated to Windows 8, which was released two years ago, according to tech research firm Forrester. Many PC users disliked the touch-optimized interface and bemoaned the loss of the traditional start-button pop-up menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Windows 10, long known by the project name 'Threshold' internally, represented a new type of system for the company, as it seeks to unify computing as mobile devices proliferate. The name represented that leap, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 10 adapts to the devices customers are using, from Xbox to PCs and phones to tablets and tiny gadgets," said Myerson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft faces an uphill struggle in reigniting excitement about Windows. With the rise of Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad, and Google Inc's Android devices, Windows no longer plays a central role in many people's on-screen lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a virtual monopoly on personal computing 10 years ago, Windows now runs only about 14 percent of devices, according to research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaction to the news was cautious.

&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp

			ExxonMobil Details Risk Management Practices for Unconventional 
      Resources Development
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ExxonMobil 
      today released a report that outlines for shareholders how the company 
      assesses and manages risks associated with developing unconventional 
      resources, including through hydraulic fracturing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Hydraulic fracturing has been responsibly and safely used by the oil 
      and gas industry for more than 60 years,&#160;but&#160;the process isn&#8217;t&#160;without 
      risks,&#8221;&#160;said Jeffrey Woodbury, vice president of Investor 
      Relations.&#160;&#8220;This report to shareholders&#160;details how ExxonMobil uses 
      sound risk management processes and engages with stakeholders to ensure 
      safe and environmentally responsible operations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Unconventional natural gas and oil development in the United States has 
      resulted in widespread benefits, including significant job creation, 
      reduced carbon dioxide emissions, lower energy costs, new sources of 
      government revenue and improved energy security. The report highlights 
      numerous studies that support these trends.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report presents information on how the application of sound risk 
      management practices that protect human health and the environment can 
      be deployed to continue supporting the significant benefits of resource 
      development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Release of the report is part of an ongoing dialogue between ExxonMobil 
      and its shareholders about important matters. The report to shareholders 
      is available at www.exxonmobil.com/hfreport. 
      Additional information about unconventional 
      resources development and hydraulic 
      fracturing can be found in ExxonMobil&#8217;s Outlook

      Actual future conditions (including economic conditions, energy demand,

		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chesapeake Lodging Trust (NYSE:CHSP) (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;) announced today that 
      it has closed on the previously announced sale of the Courtyard Anaheim 
      at Disneyland Resort for a sale price of $32.5 million, or $212,000 per 
      key.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are thrilled to have closed on the sale of this non-strategic 
      asset,&#8221; commented James L. Francis, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of the Trust. &#8220;We purchased the Courtyard Anaheim in 2010 as a 
      part of our acquisition of the Hilton Checkers in downtown Los Angeles. 
      While the Courtyard Anaheim has been a very solid performer for the 
      Trust, its non-core CBD location was not consistent with the 
      high-quality portfolio that we have built over the past four years.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Courtyard Anaheim at Disneyland Resort was one of the Trust&#8217;s 
      earliest investments, purchased in July 2010 for $25.0 million, or 
      $163,000 per key. The $32.5 million sale price represents a 7.1% 
      trailing twelve month NOI cap rate and produces a 13.3% unleveraged 
      internal rate of return for the Trust over its ownership period.

      Fitch does not rate the $62,697,834 class NR, or the $62,697,834 
      interest only class X-E. Fitch does not rate the $12,257,000 class UH5, 
      which will only receive distributions from, and will only incur losses 
      with respect to, the non-pooled component of the U-Haul Self-Storage 
      Portfolio mortgage loan. Fitch does not rate the $10,500,000 class WYA, 
      which will only receive distributions from, and will only incur losses 
      with respect to, the non-pooled component of the Wyvernwood Apartments 
      mortgage loan. Fitch does not rate the $15,000,000 class RIM, which will 
      only receive distributions from, and will only incur losses with respect 
      to, the non-pooled component of the Residence Inn Midtown East mortgage 
      loan. Such class will share in losses and shortfalls on the related 
      componentized mortgage loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The interest-only class X-B balance decreased to $96,588,000 from 
      $201,651,000 since Fitch published its presale report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 65 loans secured by 101 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.36 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association; Barclays Bank PLC; Redwood 
      Commercial Mortgage Corporation; MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage 
      Finance, LLC; General Electric Capital Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 68.4% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis on 82%, and asset summary reviews on 82% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.11x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 110.8%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 8.6%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 9% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher Leverage than Recent Transactions: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV 
      are 1.11x and 110%, respectively, which is worse than the first-half 
      2014 and 2013 averages of 1.19x and 105.6% and 1.29x and 101.6%, 
      respectively. However, two top 10 loans with above-average LTVs are 
      secured by high-quality, strong performing retail properties located in 
      New York City and Los Angeles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Limited Amortization: 20.9% of the pool is full-term interest-only, 
      53.3% of the pool is partial term interest-only, and 1.64% of the pool 
      is fully amortizing. The remainder of the pool (28 loans, 24.1%) 
      consists of amortizing balloon loans with loan terms of five to 10 
      years. Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, the pool will have 
      paid down 10.4%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit Opinion Loan: The fourth largest loan in the pool, Grapevine 
      Mills (5.9%), has a Fitch credit opinion of 'BBB-sf' on a stand-alone 
      basis. The loan is collateralized by a 1.6 million-sf regional shopping 
      center located in Grapevine, TX
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.45% below the 
      most recent NOI (for properties that a recent NOI was provided, 
      excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). 
      Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and could result 
      in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the 
      sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMBB 2014-C23 certificates and 
      found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further 
      declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' 
      could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 
      30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 
      'BBB-sf' could result.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      rated 'CMS1-' by Fitch. The special servicer will be CWCapital Asset 
      Management, LLC, rated 'CSS1-' by Fitch.

			Goldman Sachs Asset Management Launches GS Long Short Fund
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Expands GSAM&#8217;s Liquid Alternatives Platform to Seven Fund Offerings
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Sachs Asset Management (&#8220;GSAM&#8221;) today announced the launch of 
      the Goldman Sachs Long Short Fund (&#8220;the Fund&#8221;; Class A shares: GSEAX; 
      Class I: GSLSX), which pursues high conviction investment ideas in 
      global equity markets through a fundamental, bottom-up approach to 
      investing while seeking to hedge market risk and limit volatility. As a 
      leading manager of alternative investments, GSAM continues to grow its 
      Liquid Alternatives business and this new Fund expands that platform to 
      include seven funds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We seek to identify secular changes in industries, markets and consumer 
      behavior that will positively or negatively impact companies. We are 
      typically looking for investment opportunities with asymmetric 
      risk/return profiles and identifiable catalysts,&#8221; said Raanan Agus and 
      Kenneth Eberts, co-heads of the Goldman Sachs Investment Strategies 
      (GSIS) portfolio management team. &#8220;We strive to build a hedged portfolio 
      with the flexibility and nimbleness to generate attractive performance 
      in any market environment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The GSIS team is comprised of 55 investment professionals across four 
      regions globally and led by Messrs. Agus and Eberts, who each have more 
      than 20 years of investing experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For the first time, we are bringing the expertise that Raanan, Ken and 
      their entire team have delivered to institutional and qualified high net 
      worth investors to a retail investing client base,&#8221; said James McNamara, 
      President of GSAM&#8217;s mutual funds business. &#8220;We are excited to further 
      meet the growing demand for differentiating liquid alternative 
      investment solutions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fund is offered in Class A and C shares with $1,000 minimum initial 
      investments. The Fund also offers Institutional, Class R and Class IR 
      Shares. GSAM also recently launched its Liquid Alternatives Center (www.gsamfunds.com/lac) 
      to provide advisors and investors with educational materials and tools 
      that were specifically designed to help them effectively manage 
      portfolios with allocations to liquid alternatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSAM is the asset management arm of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 
      (NYSE:GS), which oversees $1.14 trillion as of June 30, 2014. Goldman 
      Sachs Asset Management has been providing discretionary investment 
      advisory services since 1988 and has investment professionals in all 
      major financial centers around the world. The company offers investment 
      strategies across a broad range of asset classes to institutional and 
      individual clients globally. Founded in 1869, Goldman Sachs is a leading 
      global investment banking, securities and investment management firm 
      that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and 
      diversified client base that includes corporations, financial 
      institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Goldman Sachs Long Short Fund invests primarily in the global 
      equity markets, with a focus on securities listed on North American and 
      European exchanges, through the use of long and/or short positions. The 
      Fund may also invest in global fixed income, commodity and currency 
      instruments. The Fund&#8217;s equity investments are subject to market risk, 
      which means that the value of the securities in which it invests may go 
      up or down in response to the prospects of individual companies, 
      particular sectors or governments and/or general economic conditions. 
      The securities of mid- and small-capitalization companies involve 
      greater risks than those associated with larger, more established 
      companies and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements. 
      The Fund is subject to the risks associated with short selling of 
      securities, which involves leverage of the Fund&#8217;s assets and 
      presents various other risks. The Fund may be obligated to cover its 
      short position at a higher price than the short price, resulting in a 
      loss. Losses on short sales are potentially unlimited as a loss occurs 
      when the value of a security sold short increases. The Fund&#8217;s borrowing 
      and use of derivatives result in leverage, which can make the 
      Fund more volatile. The Fund&#8217;s fixed income investments are subject to 
      the risks associated with debt securities generally, including credit, 
      liquidity and interest rate risk. High yield, lower rated 
      investments involve greater price volatility and present greater 
      risks than higher rated fixed income securities. Foreign and emerging 
      markets investments may be more volatile and less liquid than 
      investments in U.S. securities and are subject to the risks of currency 
      fluctuations and adverse economic or political developments. Derivative 
      instruments (including swaps and forward foreign currency 
      transactions) may involve a high degree of financial risk. These risks 
      include the risk that small movements in the price of the underlying 
      security or benchmark may result in a disproportionately large movement, 
      unfavorable or favorable, in the price of the derivative instrument; 
      risk of default by a counterparty; and liquidity risk (i.e., the risk 
      that an investment may not be able to be sold without a substantial drop 
      in price, if at all). The Fund&#8217;s investments in other investment 
      companies (including exchange-traded funds) subject it to additional 
      expenses. At times, the Fund may be unable to sell certain of its illiquid 
      investments without a substantial drop in price, if at all. Different 
      investment styles tend to shift in and out of favor, and at times 
      the Fund may underperform other funds that invest in similar asset 
      classes. Certain shareholders, including clients or affiliates of the 
      investment adviser, may from time to time own or control a significant 
      percentage of the Fund&#8217;s shares. Redemptions by these shareholders of 
      their shares of the Fund may impact the Fund&#8217;s liquidity and NAV. The 
      Fund is &#8220;non-diversified&#8221; and may invest more of its assets in 
      fewer issuers than &#8220;diversified&#8221; funds. Accordingly, the Fund may be 
      more susceptible to adverse developments affecting any single issuer 
      held in its portfolio and to greater losses resulting from these 
      developments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The investment program of the Fund is speculative, entails 
      substantial risks and includes alternative investment techniques not 
      employed by traditional mutual funds. The Fund should not be relied upon 
      as a complete investment program. The Fund&#8217;s investment techniques (if 
      they do not perform as designed) may increase the volatility of 
      performance and the risk of investment loss, including the loss of the 
      entire amount that is invested, and there can be no assurance that the 
      investment objective of the Fund will be achieved.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - The World Bank arbitration tribunal will give its final award ruling this week on a multibillion- dollar claim by Exxon Mobil Corp against Venezuela over the 2007 nationalization of two oil projects, legal sources said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The final ruling will be delivered to the parties on Thursday, Oct. 2, according to a notification they received last week," one of the sources told Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source said lawyers for state oil company PDVSA had left the country to await the ruling, although it was not immediately clear where they will receive the document. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), which is deciding the case, formally has until the end of October to meet a 90-day deadline for a ruling following the close of proceedings on July 28.      Pro-opposition Venezuelan daily El Nacional cited a PDVSA source this week as saying Exxon would be awarded between $700 million and $1.2 billion for the takeover of its Cerro Negro heavy oil project and its smaller La Ceiba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are different views and expectations about the valuation amount,&#8221; one of the legal sources said. "A figure below $1 billion will be highly favorable to Venezuela, but there are no guarantees of that, and the lawyers of both parties are just hoping for the best."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company received $908 million from PDVSA in 2012 after a separate decision by the International Chamber of Commerce over a contract dispute linked to the same projects. It was unclear if the ICSID would deduct that sum in its ruling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela is facing about 20 cases at the World Bank tribunal after a wave of nationalizations under the late President Hugo Chavez's socialist government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been no official word on the case from either PDVSA or Exxon Mobil. Nor was there any new information on the ICSID website where judgments are posted.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds background, details)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Marianna Parraga&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The World Bank arbitration
tribunal will give its final award ruling this week on a
multibillion- dollar claim by Exxon Mobil Corp against
Venezuela over the 2007 nationalization of two oil projects,
legal sources said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The final ruling will be delivered to the parties on
Thursday, Oct. 2, according to a notification they received last
week," one of the sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source said lawyers for state oil company PDVSA
 had left the country to await the ruling, although it
was not immediately clear where they will receive the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID), which is deciding the case, formally has until
the end of October to meet a 90-day deadline for a ruling
following the close of proceedings on July 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pro-opposition Venezuelan daily El Nacional cited a PDVSA
source this week as saying Exxon would be awarded between $700
million and $1.2 billion for the takeover of its Cerro Negro
heavy oil project and its smaller La Ceiba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are different views and expectations about the
valuation amount," one of the legal sources said. "A figure
below $1 billion will be highly favorable to Venezuela, but
there are no guarantees of that, and the lawyers of both parties
are just hoping for the best."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company received $908 million from PDVSA in 2012 after a
separate decision by the International Chamber of Commerce over
a contract dispute linked to the same projects. It was unclear
if the ICSID would deduct that sum in its ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela is facing about 20 cases at the World Bank
tribunal after a wave of nationalizations under the late
President Hugo Chavez's socialist government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been no official word on the case from either
PDVSA or Exxon Mobil. Nor was there any new information on the
ICSID website where judgments are posted.

		&lt;p&gt;SCOTTSDALE, AZ--(Marketwired - Sep 30, 2014) -  Informative Graphics Corporation (IGC&#174;), a leader in viewing, collaboration and redaction technology, has announced the release of Brava!&#174; Enterprise 7.2 for IBM Content Navigator. Brava integrates seamlessly into IBM Content Navigator, which provides access to IBM's enterprise content management systems such as IBM FileNet P8, Content Manager 8, Case Manager, Maximo and TRIRIGA.&lt;/p&gt;

They can also create custom dialogs to suit specific business needs and custom plug-ins for a quicker Brava integration within the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

				Enables a faster, easier Brava plug-in configuration for IBM Content Navigator.
            
				Supports IBM Case Manager to allow users to view and compare files without leaving the Case Manager interface.
            
				Enhances Film Strip view by giving users the option of either the HTML or ActiveX viewers, allowing users to more quickly and easily navigate through documents.
			&lt;p&gt;"These new capabilities demonstrate IGC's alignment with the evolution of IBM Content Navigator," said IGC CEO Gary Heath. "Brava provides IBM Content Navigator users&#160;a way to view, annotate, redact and publish in one easy interface -- regardless of the content management system they are using."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about Brava for IBM Content Manager, please visit http://www.infograph.com/ibm/brava.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About IGC &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1990, IGC has been a leading developer of commercial software products for viewing, collaboration and redaction.

			Coca-Cola Releases 2013/2014 Global 
      Sustainability Report
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Report Highlights Progress on Comprehensive 2020 Sustainability 
      Goals with a Focus on Women, Water and Well-being
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company today released its 11th annual 
      Sustainability Report highlighting the progress the Coca-Cola system 
      made in 2013 against the 2020 
      sustainability goals announced last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola can only be as healthy, vibrant and resilient as the 
      communities we proudly serve around the globe. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re working 
      together with our bottling partners across our system to build stronger, 
      more active communities and advance environmental conservation,&#8221; said 
      Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;Unlocking the 
      collaborative power of the Golden 
      Triangle of business, government and civil society organizations 
      allows for a much greater collective impact than any one organization or 
      even sector could hope to achieve alone.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the first report to include both an update on existing 
      sustainability goals and the Company&#8217;s new global 2020 goals. The report 
      follows the Company&#8217;s sustainability framework &#8212; &#8220;Me, We, World&#8221; &#8212; and 
      is rooted in three leadership priorities:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Women: In our fourth year, we 
        continue our journey to economically empower 5 million women 
        entrepreneurs across our value chain by 2020 through our 5by20&#8482; 
        program. This initiative aims to help women entrepreneurs, from fruit 
        farmers to artisans, overcome the barriers they face to succeed in 
        business. As of December 31, 2013, our 5by20 programs had enabled more 
        than 550,000 women in 44 countries since 2010. More than 255,000 women 
        were impacted in 2013, an increase of more than 50% over the previous 
        year.
      
			
				Water: We are working to balance 
        the water we use by 2020, returning to our communities and nature an 
        amount of water equivalent to that used in our beverages and their 
        production. We are currently on track to achieve this water goal. In 
        2013, we replenished an estimated 68% (a calculated estimate of 108.5 
        billion liters) of the water used in our finished beverages through 
        509 community water partnership projects in more than 100 countries, 
        and we improved our water use efficiency for the 11th 
        consecutive year with an 8% improvement over 2010.
      
			
				Well-being: We continue our work 
        to meet our 2013 global business commitments to promote well-being and 
        to help address the public health challenge of obesity. In 2013, we 
        offered more than 800 reduced-, low- and no-calorie products worldwide 
        &#8212; nearly 25% of our global portfolio. We also supported more than 290 
        physical activity programs in nearly 125 countries.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report also updates other areas of progress. Through The Coca-Cola 
      Foundation, the Company&#8217;s global philanthropic arm, we invested $143 
      million (1% of our operating income) to support sustainable community 
      initiatives in 2013. We also continue applying our supply chain and 
      logistics expertise to help deliver essential medicines to communities 
      that need them through Project 
      Last Mile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We continue to work against ambitious new goals to reduce the carbon 
      footprint of &#8220;the drink in your hand&#8221; by 25% and to sustainably source 
      key agricultural ingredients by 2020. In addition, through June 2014, we 
      had then distributed more than 25 billion fully recyclable PlantBottle&#8482; 
      packages across nearly 40 countries since the program launched in 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re investing in sustainability because it helps us grow our 
      business, make a positive difference for the people and communities we 
      serve, and protect the environment we all share,&#8221; said Bea Perez, Chief 
      Sustainability Officer at The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;The results in our 
      report reflect Coca-Cola&#8217;s commitment, our employees&#8217; passion, and the 
      power of our many partnerships.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2013/2014 
      Sustainability Report
			demonstrates The Coca-Cola 
      Company&#8217;s commitment to continuous improvement, increased disclosure, 
      risk assessment and expanded stakeholder engagement. The report is 
      available on the Company&#8217;s website, Coca-Cola Journey, and features 
      social and multimedia capabilities. This year, the Company developed the 
      report at the Core In Accordance level of the GRI G4 guidelines. Ernst  
      Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, provided external 
      assurance on sustainability indicators related to water use ratio, 
      PlantBottle&#8482; packaging, lost-time incident rate, front-of-pack labeling 
      and manufacturing greenhouse gas emissions.

		&lt;h1&gt;New U.S. Consumer Survey by CorvisaCloud Identifies Ongoing Issues and Industries With Poor Service Records&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Findings Show Hospitality Industry and Small Businesses Outshine Cable Companies and Large Businesses for Customer Service Honors&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;MILWAUKEE, WI--(Marketwired - Sep 30, 2014) -  Cloud contact center provider, CorvisaCloud, today shared results of its second annual Customer Service Report, a survey of more than 1,200 U.S. consumers that analyzed trends such as key service issues, industries with excellent and poor customer service, and top approaches for keeping customers happy. Key findings reveal that 60 percent of respondents reported an improvement in customer service since 2013, yet identified critical areas of concern and frustration such as unknowledgeable and inarticulate agents. Compared to the 2013 report, consumers reported a 10 percent increase in the frequency they are contacting customer service on a monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This year's survey proves that companies are recognizing the importance of listening to customers and implementing strategies that address customer needs, but it also uncovered that 'good enough' still isn't cutting it," said Matt Lautz, president and CIO, CorvisaCloud. "In order to effectively compete, businesses of all sizes need to invest in the right people and technology to make sure they're wow-ing customers instead of just covering the basics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Room for Improvement
				The good news is that the quality of customer service is progressing, but there are ongoing issues and industries that still need improvement. Nearly half of respondents (49 percent) claim that call center agents are uninformed and difficult to understand. And when agents can be understood, survey participants report they sound robotic, as if reading from a script (80 percent) and not really listening. In addition, hold times continue to vex customers, as 32 percent of customers will hang up after waiting five minutes. Lastly, 18 percent report one of the biggest areas where businesses customer service could improve is in making sure information the customer has already shared is passed along when the call is transferred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Best  Worst Industries
				All industries are not created equal when it comes to customer service. Cable companies are still the worst customer service offenders, according to 47 percent of consumers surveyed, up 16 percent from last year. Conversely, almost one-third (30 percent) identified the hospitality industry as the best provider of customer service. Also of note, small businesses seem to have an edge with 49 percent of respondents ranking them as providing the best at customer service, with only 11 percent believing large companies do it best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Call Centers Can Up the Ante
				While today's customers can connect with companies in a variety of ways, phone calls still reign supreme. Survey respondents indicated that they still prefer to pick up the trusty phone (55 percent) rather than use other mediums such as email/web forms (22 percent) and chat (12 percent). And when it comes to time of day, those surveyed overwhelmingly indicated they pick up the phone to call customer service in the afternoon (43 percent) or morning (40 percent). The takeaways for contact center managers? While it's important to manage all your channels, the phone isn't going away any time soon so making sure phone lines are adequately staffed during peak hours will be key to lowering hold times and preventing customer frustration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond how and when consumers prefer to contact customer service, survey results showed that service quality is critical as well. Almost 50 percent of consumers said they have experienced challenges trying to get an issue with a service or product resolved, underscoring the need for more informed and helpful agents. Speaking of staff, the survey identified Anderson Cooper as the celebrity persona best suited for customer service -- 30 percent agreed that Cooper's straightforward and smart communication style is ideal for a call center agent -- traits to keep in mind when hiring and training agents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while customers feel progress is being made, businesses and contact centers alike still have ample opportunity to turn service into a competitive advantage. Based on survey insights, CorvisaCloud has developed a list of tips to help companies get a jumpstart toward improving the customer service experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About CorvisaCloud
				CorvisaCloud brings customer success to the heart of every business interaction through our cloud-based communications platform, contact center technologies and consulting services.

		&lt;h1&gt;Baltimore Orthodontists Share Advantages of Using iTero Scanners for Their Invisalign Patients&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wayne Hickory and Dr. Sandra Selnick Highlight the Benefits of Using the iTero(TM) Scanner for Patients Considering Invisalign(R) Treatment&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;BALTIMORE, MD--(Marketwired - Sep 30, 2014) -  Super Elite Invisalign&#174; Providers Wayne Hickory, DMD, and Sandra Selnick, DDS, have decades of experience helping patients successfully straighten their teeth with Invisalign&#174;. As a result, they continuously seek opportunities to provide state-of-the-art dental technology for their patients. They say their recent investment in the iTero&#8482; scanner makes their practices one of the exclusive few to have this technology. The device creates 3D digital teeth impressions, can enhance the treatment experience for patients thinking about straightening their teeth with Invisalign&#174;'s clear, removable teeth aligners. The doctors note that this technology can even give patients a look at the potential results of Invisalign&#174; before they undergo treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baltimore orthodontists, who operate a number of practices in the Maryland and Washington, DC area, recently published a blog post about the high-tech scanner on their website titled: "Introducing Our New iTero&#8482; Scanner!" In the blog, Drs. Hickory and Selnick discuss how the technology's light-emitting hand-held wand can capture accurate impressions of their patient's teeth without the need for messy putties and molds. With these digital impressions, the Invisalign&#174; aligners will be custom-designed for the patient. The orthodontists say the iTero&#8482; technology's powerful integration with Invisalign&#174; also makes the entire process more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog goes on to point out other advantages of the iTero&#8482; scanner for Invisalign&#174; patients, including:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Less risk of needing a "redo" impression, necessitating a return visit to the office
            
				More environmentally friendly impression materials
            
				It can scan your mouth in under 10 minutes
            
				Seamless communication with Invisalign&#174; means patients can receive their customized aligners faster
            
				Patients can receive even better fitting aligners due to the digital scanner's precision
            
				More comfortable and convenient than old-fashioned impression methods
            
				With the iTero Invisalign&#174; Outcome Simulator, patients can get a preview of their potential new smile before starting Invisalign&#174; treatment 
			&lt;p&gt;Both Dr. Wayne Hickory and Dr. Sandra Selnick say Invisalign&#174; can be a very effective technique to help patients achieve straighter teeth in a more discreet, comfortable way. They believe the accuracy, precision, and efficiency of the iTero&#8482; scanner is a way to further enhance the patient's overall Invisalign&#174; experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Wayne Hickory, DMD, MDS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hickory is one of the largest providers of Invisalign&#174; treatment in the United States and has over 20 years of orthodontic experience. He earned his Masters of Dental Science and Doctorate of Dental Medicine at the University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine, where he completed a three-year postdoctoral orthodontics program. Dr. Hickory is available for interview upon request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Sandra Selnick, DDS, MS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Selnick received her dental degree from the University of Maryland and completed her general practice residency at the Veterans Medical Center in Baltimore. She also earned a postdoctoral certification in orthodontics and a master's degree in oral biology. She has twice been named Best Orthodontist in Baltimore Magazine.

      IFS Launches Global Cloud Solution on Microsoft Azure
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IFS&#160;(STO:IFSA) (STO:IFSB)(http://www.ifsworld.com/), 
      the global enterprise applications company is today announcing the 
      availability of IFS Applications on Microsoft Azure. The new offering 
      reduces the need for hardware infrastructure to provide customers with a 
      highly cost effective, rapid and secure way to benefit from IFS 
      Applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to avoiding many of the high upfront costs normally 
      associated with on-premise solutions, the cloud-based offer from IFS and 
      Microsoft enables customers to easily increase the breadth of their 
      deployment as well as scale the number of user-seats in line with 
      business growth. Azure is a proven cloud environment that delivers 
      advance data protection as well as business continuity features that a 
      typical on-premise installation would not include.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The full suite of IFS Applications, including all enterprise resource 
      planning (ERP), enterprise asset management (EAM) and enterprise service 
      management (ESM) modules, can run on Azure. Customers wanting to use IFS 
      Applications in the cloud can leverage Azure either as an Infrastructure 
      as a Service (IaaS) and self-manage their IFS Applications, or to have 
      their IFS Applications hosted and managed as a service (SaaS). The IaaS 
      offering is available now and the SaaS offering, including both 
      technical and application managed services, will be rolled out over the 
      next six months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mark Boulton, Chief Marketing Officer at IFS, said, &#8220;Collaborating with 
      Microsoft to offer IFS on Azure was a natural fit because Azure is so 
      well aligned to our customers&#8217; needs.&#8221; Boulton continued, &#8220;Our customers 
      want a trusted cloud platform that enables them to quickly set-up and 
      benefit from IFS Applications in line with their business needs. IFS is 
      synonymous with agility, so empowering customers with the power to 
      quickly deploy new capabilities, or extend the usage of IFS Applications 
      into new markets with ease, is very attractive.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mike Schutz, GM of Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure said, &#8220;Cloud 
      computing is becoming more popular with companies who want to save money 
      and increase speed and efficiencies but they need a solution that is 
      enterprise grade and available at global scale. The work IFS is doing 
      with Azure allows organizations to leverage the power of the cloud and 
      utilize IFS Applications on a highly scalable platform.&#8221;&#160;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To validate the real-world application of the offering, IFS has been 
      working with beta customer Ebara, a precision instruments manufacturing 
      company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on Ebara&#8217;s deployment of IFS Applications on Microsoft Azure, 
      Frank Lowery, Director of IS, said, &#8220;Ebara has made a company-wide 
      decision to put key IT systems into the cloud, so as a long-standing 
      customer of IFS it was music to our ears to hear of this new initiative 
      on Microsoft Azure. We were more than impressed with the ease and speed 
      of creating our first IFS working environment on Azure, which is a cloud 
      environment the company is comfortable with having recently moved to 
      Office 365&#8221;. In light of this, Dan Matthews, Chief Technology Officer at 
      IFS added, &#8220;There is very little work involved in running IFS 
      Applications in Microsoft Azure as the performance has proven to be 
      equal to deploying our software on-premise.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IFS Applications is now available in Microsoft Azure for customers to 
      leverage. For more information go to: www.ifsworld.com/IFS-on-Azure&#160;(http://www.ifsworld.com/IFS-on-Azure)

      October 2nd 2014 in San Francisco can visit the IFS stand, #515 in the 
      South Hall of the Moscone Center, to learn more.

		&lt;h1&gt;Carbon Sciences Sees Market Opportunity as IBM Considers Replacing Silicon With Graphene&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;IBM Will Invest $3 Billion Over the Next Five Years on an Ambitious Project to Find the Next-Generation Chip Technology to Replace Silicon&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SANTA BARBARA, CA--(Marketwired - Sep 30, 2014) -  Carbon Sciences Inc. (OTCBB: CABN), the developer of a breakthrough technology to mass-produce graphene, the new miracle material, commented today on IBM's recent announcement that it is considering replacing silicon with graphene.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;IBM has developed a new method to use graphene as a substrate for single-crystalline semiconductor film growth. Graphene will be less expensive than current single-crystalline wafers used in such production methods, as it can be reused indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;IBM says that growing a 4" GaN film today requires a 4" SiC substrate wafer that is destroyed using the process. The SiC costs about $3,000. Graphene can be used to replace the SiC and will be much cheaper in the long run. Graphene is also useful as it is flexible and can be better adapted for films that need to be transferred to a flexible substrate.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"We are very excited about IBM's sizeable commitment to search for a replacement for silicon and their high level of interest in graphene," said Bill Beifuss, Carbon Sciences' CEO. "Graphene has the potential to become the next-gen chip technology. To unleash its full potential for this application, a more highly controlled and efficient way to produce high quality graphene is needed. Our breakthrough process is intended to transform natural gas into graphene that can be fine-tuned with application-specific electrical and materials properties."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Carbon Sciences recently announced that it entered into an agreement with the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) to fund the further the development of a new graphene process.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;UCSB boasts five Nobel Laureates (four in sciences and engineering) and one winner of the prestigious Millennium Technology Prize. The 2014 Academic Ranking of World Universities ranked UCSB Engineering/Technology and Computer Science as #7 in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;About Carbon Sciences, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Carbon Sciences is developing a breakthrough technology to mass-produce graphene, the new miracle material. Graphene, a sheet of pure carbon that is only one atom thick, is flexible, transparent, impermeable to moisture, stronger than diamonds and more conductive than gold. Ever since the Nobel Prize was awarded for its discovery, experts believe graphene to be the miracle material that will enable revolutionary applications such as bendable touchscreen displays, rapid charge batteries, super-capacitors, low cost solar cells, extreme high-speed semiconductors, biosensors, as well as water purification. While the raw materials to make graphene are readily available, the lack of an industrial scale manufacturing process has hindered its commercial use. Carbon Sciences is developing a breakthrough process that will transform natural gas into commercial size sheets of graphene that can be fine-tuned with application-specific electrical and materials properties.

			About Mucosis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mucosis B.V. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel 
      vaccines on its proprietary Mimopath&#174; platform technology. 
      The Mimopath&#174; platform is being studied for various routes of 
      administration including those that provide additional protection in the 
      mucosa, the site where over 90% of pathogens enter the human body. 
      Mucosis&#8217;s lead product SynGEM&#174;, a stabilized prefusion F 
      protein recombinant vaccine to prevent RSV infection in various target 
      groups, is poised to enter human proof-of-concept studies. The company 
      has also developed PneuGEM&#174;, a vaccine to prevent diseases 
      caused by pneumococcal bacteria and FluGEM&#174;, a vaccine to 
      prevent influenza which served as a successful Mimopath&#174; 
      platform proof of concept through human clinical testing. Mucosis is 
      based in The Netherlands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Mimopath&#174; technology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Mimopath&#174; technology is based on Lactococcus lactis, 
      a Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) bacterium commonly used in the 
      food industry. Mucosis has developed a robust proprietary technique to 
      formulate the L. lactis bacteria into non-living bacterium-like 
      particles (BLPs) that can be covered with antigens from viral, 
      bacterial, parasitic or tumor origin. BLP-based vaccines are 
      particularly suitable to administer into the nose or mouth, without a 
      needle. Mucosal vaccines have been shown to raise protective immunity by 
      activation of both the innate and the adaptive immune system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About SynGEM&#174;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SynGEM&#174;, Mucosis&#8217;s lead vaccine candidate currently 
      completing preclinical studies, is being developed in cooperation with 
      corporate, governmental and non-governmental partners across the globe. 
      SynGEM&#174; is designed to prevent infections with RSV, which 
      affect over 60 million people worldwide and are responsible for more 
      than one million hospitalizations and 160,000 deaths annually. The 
      proprietary RSV prefusion F protein in SynGEM&#174; displays 
      valuable epitopes considered to be important for optimal virus 
      neutralization and is suitable for use in different formulations and 
      administration routes to efficiently address various target groups. 
      There are currently no available vaccines for RSV.

		&lt;p&gt;Lysaker, September 30, 2014. PCI Biotech will be presenting at SACHS Associates 14th Annual Biotech in Europe Forum for Global Partnering  Investment at Basel Congress Center, Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A presentation will be held September 30 local time 14:00 in room Darwin and the company will be represented by Mr. Ga&#235;l L'H&#233;v&#233;der, CBDO.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;About PCI BiotechPCI Biotech is a cancer focused biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Norway and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The company is developing therapeutic products based on its proprietary photochemical internalisation (PCI) technology. The PCI technology induces triggered endosomal release and may be used to unlock the true therapeutic potential of a wide array of modalities, such as small molecules, ADCs and siRNA. Two programs are currently in clinical development in patient populations with a high unmet medical need; recurrent head  neck cancer (phase II) and bile duct cancer (phase I/II).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The company is also developing PCI as a CTL induction technology for therapeutic and prophylactic vaccination. It has been demonstrated both in vivo and ex vivo that PCI significantly increases the number of activated antigen-specific CTLs (Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes) by enhancing the MHC I antigen presentation of antigen presenting cells. When applied more specifically to the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy, PCI can be used to enhance the important cytotoxic effect of therapeutic cancer vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
