&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Shanghai government will hold
a news briefing soon to discuss the latest developments
concerning a project to build a Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) theme park
in Shanghai, the city's mayor said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "There is much to talk about regarding this issue," Shanghai
Mayor Han Zheng told a news conference on Sunday, domestic media
reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Shanghai municipal government will soon hold a media
briefing to announce the latest news on the Disney project and to
respond to matters of concern to the media."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speculation has been mounting that Disney is finally about to
announce a long-awaited deal to build a theme park in Shanghai
and a Shanghai government source familiar with the situation told
Reuters last week that Beijing had given approval to the project,
the key step in allowing it to move forward.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said computers in countries with high rates of software piracy are more likely to be infected by malicious code because users are leery of applying security patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a direct correlation between piracy and the malware infection rate," said Jeff Williams, the principal group program manager for the Microsoft Malware Protection Center. Williams was touting the newest edition of his company's biannual security intelligence report .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Williams, the link between PC infection rates -- the percentage of computers that have been cleaned by the updated monthly Malicious Software Removal Tool, or MSRT -- and piracy is due to the hesitancy of users in countries where counterfeit copies abound to use Windows Update, the service that pushes patches to PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's piracy rate is more than four times that of the U.S., according to Microsoft's report, published today, but the use of Windows Update in China is significantly below that in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil and France also have a higher piracy rate, and lower Windows Update usage, than the U.S., Microsoft maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company's own data doesn't always support William's contention that piracy, and the hesitancy to use Windows Update, leads to more infected PCs. China, for example, boasted a malware infection rate -- as defined by the number of computers cleaned for each 1,000 executions of the MSRT -- of just 6.7, significantly lower than the global average of 8.7 or the U.S.'s rate of 8.2 per thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France's infection rate of 7.9 in the first half of 2009 was also under the worldwide average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the three countries Microsoft called out as examples of nations whose users are reluctant to run Windows Update because of high piracy rates, only Brazil fit William's argument: Brazil's infection rate was 25.4, nearly three times the global average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other countries with higher-than-average infection rates, however, also have high piracy rates, according to data published last May by the Business Software Alliance (BSA), an industry-backed anti-piracy organization, and research firm IDC. Microsoft is a member of the BSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Microsoft's tally, Serbia and Montenegro had the highest infection rate in the world, with 97.2 PCs out of every 1,000, nearly 10%, plagued by malware. Turkey was No. 2, with 32.3, while Brazil, Spain and South Korea were third through fifth, with infection rates of 25.4, 21.6 and 21.3, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BSA put Serbia's piracy rate, the percentage of the in-use software that's not licensed, at 74% in 2008, while Turkey, Brazil, Spain and Korea had estimated piracy rates of 64%, 58%, 42% and 43%, respectively. By comparison, the U.S.'s piracy rate was pegged at 20%, and the worldwide average at 41%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft wants users to patch vulnerabilities with Windows Update, people running counterfeit copies of Windows have traditionally been less-than-eager to apply fixes, believing that Windows Update will recognize their software as illegal and mark it as such with nagging on-screen messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's anti-piracy efforts, particularly the technology it pushes to users that sniffs out unlicensed copies of Windows, have met with resistance. Last year, for example, Chinese users raised a ruckus when Microsoft updated its Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) anticounterfeit validation and notification technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American users have complained about the technology, too. In June 2006, Microsoft infuriated users by pushing a version of WGA to XP users via Windows Update, tagging it as a "high-priority" update that was automatically downloaded and installed to most machines. A year later, a day-long server outage riled thousands of users who were mistakenly fingered for running counterfeit copies of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2006 incident sparked a lawsuit that accused Microsoft of misleading customers when it used Windows Update to serve up WGA. Last month, Microsoft filed a motion opposing a move by the plaintiffs to turn the case into a class-action lawsuit .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's security intelligence report can be downloaded from its Web site in PDF or XPS document formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) is
the largest foreign investor in China Haisheng Juice Holdings
(0359.HK), a Chinese company suing Goldman archrival Morgan
Stanley over a derivatives deal, the Financial Times reported
on its website on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley and Haisheng are battling in British and
Chinese courts over a hedging contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In London, Morgan Stanley is pursuing $26 million it
alleges it is owed after Haisheng failed to post collateral
relating to the renminbi-dollar hedges. The Chinese company
also is suing the U.S. investment bank in a domestic court,
accusing Morgan Stanley of misleading sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs made its first investment in Haisheng in
early 2005 and its private equity arm holds 20 percent of
Haisheng's Hong Kong-listed shares, the FT said. Goldman does
not have a board seat on Haisheng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Haisheng victory would likely embolden other Chinese
companies to take action against foreign banks, the FT said.
Goldman, for example, is negotiating with Shenzhen Nanshan
Power 000037.SZ, a utility, to settle a dispute relating to
oil derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Morgan were not immediately available for
comment.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
KBR (NYSE: KBR) today announced that it has been awarded a contract by Chevron
USA Inc. for the front-end engineering and design (FEED) of the topsides for the
proposed Big Foot development facility. The Big Foot field is located in the
Walker Ridge Block 29 of the Gulf of Mexico and is owned by Chevron USA Inc.
(operator), Statoil Gulf of Mexico LLC and Marubeni Oil &amp; Gas (USA) Inc. The
proposed facility will be installed in 5,300 feet of water approximately 200
miles from New Orleans and 35 miles south of Chevron`s producing Tahiti field. 

The goal is to develop Big Foot with a dry-tree floating drilling and production
facility. The hull would be an extended tension leg platform (ETLP), and the
topside oil and gas processing facilities would include inlet separation, gas
compression, dehydration and export, oil treatment and export pumping, produced
water treatment, and required utility systems. Water injection facilities would
be provided with the initial facility installation to enable reservoir pressure
maintenance early in the life of the field. KBR will provide engineering and
project management services to develop the process design; specify the required
equipment; layout, modularize and integrate the decks; perform the necessary
structural analyses; and provide the electrical power generation and
distribution system designed to support the platform and the downhole electrical
submersible pump requirements. KBR will also assist Chevron in estimating the
cost of the facility and plan the subsequent phases of the development. 

"We are proud to have been selected as the contractor of choice by Chevron for
the Big Foot topsides project," said Roy Oelking, Executive Vice President, KBR
Oil and Gas. "We are pleased with the opportunity to reenter the offshore
engineering market in the Gulf of Mexico alongside an industry leader such as
Chevron. I am confident that KBR will tap into its vast engineering portfolio
and execute a quality FEED for our client." 

KBR is a global engineering, construction and services company supporting the
energy, hydrocarbon, government services, minerals, civil infrastructure, power
and industrial markets. For more information, visit www.kbr.com.

LE PR&#201;SIDENT DU CONSEIL D`ADMINISTRATION D`EXXONMOBIL, REX W. TILLERSON A
COMMENT&#201; EN CES TERMES: 

&#171; Malgr&#233; la faiblesse &#233;conomique qui se poursuit au niveau mondial et la demande
en produits moins importante, nous avons continu&#233; notre robuste programme
d`investissements et r&#233;alis&#233; de solides r&#233;sultats. &#187;

&#171; Nos b&#233;n&#233;fices, hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels, pour le troisi&#232;me trimestre ont
atteint 4,7 milliards de dollars. Bien que nous ayons continu&#233; &#224; subir les
r&#233;percussions de la baisse des prix des mati&#232;res premi&#232;res et de faibles marges
sur les produits, nous avons continu&#233; &#224; porter notre attention sur l`excellence
op&#233;rationnelle et avons investi 19 milliards de dollars durant les trois
premiers trimestres de l`exercice en vue de d&#233;velopper de nouvelles ressources
&#233;nerg&#233;tiques. &#187;

&#171; La production en &#233;quivalent-p&#233;trole a augment&#233; de 3 % par rapport au troisi&#232;me
trimestre 2008 gr&#226;ce aux contributions de d&#233;marrages majeurs d`actifs de calibre
mondial, dont le Train 5 de Qatargas 2 et le Train 6 de Ras Laffan 3, au Qatar.
&#187;

&#171; Nous sommes bien positionn&#233;s pour une croissance continue de la production
avec des projets tels que QatarGas, RasGas et Gorgon LNG, lesquels contribueront
&#224; une longue production plateau suppl&#233;mentaire pendant des dizaines d`ann&#233;es et
apporteront une solide fondation &#224; ExxonMobil. &#187; 

&#171; La solidit&#233; financi&#232;re d`ExxonMobil, une des meilleures du secteur, nous a
permis de continuer &#224; investir dans l`ensemble du cycle &#233;conomique avec une
focalisation sur des opportunit&#233;s de classe mondiale. &#187;

&#171; Notre engagement envers une strat&#233;gie &#224; long terme focalis&#233;e et disciplin&#233;e en
mati&#232;re d`investissement permet &#224; ExxonMobil de se d&#233;marquer par rapport &#224; ses
concurrents. &#187; 

&#171; Outre le financement de nos programmes de capitaux et d`exploitation, nous
avons vers&#233; 2,0 milliards de dollars en dividendes et achet&#233; pour 4,0 milliards
de dollars d`actions ordinaires ExxonMobil pour r&#233;duire le nombre d`actions en
circulation au cours du troisi&#232;me trimestre. &#187;

FAITS MARQUANTS DU TROISI&#200;ME TRIMESTRE

* Les b&#233;n&#233;fices hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels ont atteint 4 730 millions de
dollars, une baisse de 65 %, soit 8 650 millions de dollars par rapport au
troisi&#232;me trimestre 2008. 
* Le b&#233;n&#233;fice par action hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels est ressorti &#224; 0,98 dollar,
une baisse de 62 %. 
* Les b&#233;n&#233;fices ont baiss&#233; de 68 % par rapport au troisi&#232;me trimestre 2008
lequel incluait des gains exceptionnels de 1 620 millions de dollars d&#233;coulant
de la vente d`une entreprise de transport de gaz naturel en Allemagne et une
charge exceptionnelle de 170 millions de dollars li&#233;e &#224; l`attribution de
dommages et int&#233;r&#234;ts &#224; titre punitif concernant l`Exxon Valdez. Les b&#233;n&#233;fices du
troisi&#232;me trimestre 2009 n`incluent pas d`&#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels. 
* Les d&#233;penses en investissement et d`exploration se sont &#233;lev&#233;es &#224; 6,5
milliards de dollars, en baisse de 5 % par rapport au troisi&#232;me trimestre 2008,
refl&#233;tant l`impact d`un dollar plus fort. 
* La production en &#233;quivalent-p&#233;trole a augment&#233; de pr&#232;s de 3 % par rapport au
troisi&#232;me trimestre 2008. Hors impact des volumes admissibles, effets des quotas
de l`OPEP et d&#233;sinvestissements, la production a augment&#233; d`environ 5 %. 
* Le flux de tr&#233;sorerie issu de l`exploitation et des cessions d`actifs &#233;tait
d`environ 9,0 milliards de dollars, dont 0,2 milliard de dollars en cessions
d`actifs. 
* Les achats d`actions d`un montant de 4,0 milliards de dollars ont r&#233;duit le
nombre d`actions en circulation de 1,2 %. 
* Deux sites majeurs de gaz naturel liqu&#233;fi&#233; (GNL) au Qatar - le Train 5 de
Qatargas 2 et le Train 6 de Ras Laffan 3 - sont entr&#233;s en production. D`une
capacit&#233; de production annuelle de 7,8 millions de tonnes chacun, les deux
trains se joignent au Train 4 de Qatargas 2, pour former le plus grand site de
production de GNL en exploitation du monde. 
* Les participants au projet de gaz naturel liqu&#233;fi&#233; (GNL) Gorgon LNG ont
approuv&#233; un plan de d&#233;veloppement qui comprendra trois trains de traitement de
GNL d`une capacit&#233; de 5 millions de tonnes par an chacun. La d&#233;cision de
d&#233;veloppement a fait suite &#224; l`ex&#233;cution d`accords de vente et d`achat de GNL
avec PetroChina International Company Limited et Petronet LNG Limited d`Inde
pour l`action participative d`ExxonMobil au GNL dans le projet. 
* Fujian Refining and Petrochemical Company Limited a annonc&#233; le d&#233;marrage de
deux nouvelles unit&#233;s chimiques - dont un vapocraqueur d`&#233;thyl&#232;ne, une unit&#233; de
poly&#233;thyl&#232;ne, une unit&#233; de polypropyl&#232;ne et des installations de produits
aromatiques - dans son nouveau complexe de raffinage et p&#233;trochimique
enti&#232;rement int&#233;gr&#233; de la Province de Fujian en Chine. 
* ExxonMobil a annonc&#233; un partenariat avec l`une des plus importantes soci&#233;t&#233;s
de biotechnologie, Synthetic Genomics Inc., en vue d`effectuer des recherches et
de mettre au point la future g&#233;n&#233;ration de biocarburants &#224; partir d`algues
photosynth&#233;tiques. Si les jalons de recherche et de mise au point sont atteints,
ExxonMobil pr&#233;voit de d&#233;penser plus de 600 millions de dollars dans le cadre de
ce programme.

Troisi&#232;me trimestre 2009 contre Troisi&#232;me trimestre 2008

Les b&#233;n&#233;fices issus des op&#233;rations en amont, hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels,
&#233;taient de 4 012 millions de dollars, en baisse de 5 339 millions de dollars par
rapport au troisi&#232;me trimestre 2008. Des r&#233;alisations de p&#233;trole brut et de gaz
naturel moins &#233;lev&#233;es &#233;taient en majorit&#233; responsables de cette baisse, faisant
baisser les b&#233;n&#233;fices d`environ 4,9 milliards de dollars, tandis que des co&#251;ts
d`exploitation plus &#233;lev&#233;s ont quant &#224; eux r&#233;duit les b&#233;n&#233;fices d`environ 300
millions de dollars. 

Sur une base d`&#233;quivalent-p&#233;trole, la production a augment&#233; de pr&#232;s de 3 % par
rapport au troisi&#232;me trimestre 2008. Hors impact des volumes admissibles, effets
des quotas de l`OPEP et d&#233;sinvestissements, la production a augment&#233; d`environ 5
%. 

La production de liquides a atteint 2 335 kbj (milliers de barils par jour), en
hausse de 45 kbj par rapport au troisi&#232;me trimestre 2008. Hors impact des
volumes admissibles, effets des quotas de l`OPEP et d&#233;sinvestissements, la
production de liquides a augment&#233; de plus de 5 %, une production plus importante
de projets aux &#201;tats-Unis et au Kazakhstan &#233;tant partiellement contrebalanc&#233;e
par le d&#233;clin des champs. 

La production de gaz naturel au troisi&#232;me trimestre &#233;tait de 8 129 mpcj
(millions de pieds cubes par jour), en hausse de 309 mpcj par rapport &#224; 2008. De
nouveaux volumes de production d`ajouts de projets au Qatar et aux &#201;tats-Unis
ont &#233;t&#233; partiellement contrebalanc&#233;s par la maintenance en Europe. 

Les b&#233;n&#233;fices issus des op&#233;rations en amont aux &#201;tats-Unis &#233;taient de 709
millions de dollars, 1 170 millions de dollars de moins qu`au troisi&#232;me
trimestre 2008. Les b&#233;n&#233;fices en amont en dehors des &#201;tats-Unis, hors &#233;l&#233;ments
exceptionnels, &#233;taient de 3 303 millions de dollars, en baisse de 4 169 millions
de dollars par rapport &#224; l`ann&#233;e derni&#232;re. 

Les b&#233;n&#233;fices en aval de 325 millions de dollars ont baiss&#233; de 2 688 millions de
dollars par rapport au troisi&#232;me trimestre 2008. Des marges de raffinage plus
basses ont conduit &#224; la baisse, faisant baisser les b&#233;n&#233;fices de 2,6 milliards
de dollars. Les ventes de produits p&#233;troliers de 6 301 kbj ont baiss&#233; de 387 kbj
par rapport au troisi&#232;me trimestre de l`ann&#233;e derni&#232;re, refl&#233;tant
essentiellement des cessions d`actifs et une demande moins importante. 

Les op&#233;rations en aval aux &#201;tats-Unis ont enregistr&#233; une perte de 203 millions
de dollars, en baisse de 1 181 millions de dollars par rapport au troisi&#232;me
trimestre 2008. Les b&#233;n&#233;fices en aval en dehors des &#201;tats-Unis de 528 millions
de dollars ont baiss&#233; de 1 507 millions de dollars par rapport &#224; l`ann&#233;e
derni&#232;re. 

Les b&#233;n&#233;fices des produits chimiques de 876 millions de dollars ont baiss&#233; de
211 millions de dollars par rapport au troisi&#232;me trimestre 2008. Des marges plus
faibles ont conduit &#224; la baisse, r&#233;duisant les b&#233;n&#233;fices de 170 millions de
dollars. Les ventes de produits de base au troisi&#232;me trimestre de 6 356 kt
(milliers de tonnes m&#233;triques) ont augment&#233; de 296 kt par rapport &#224; l`ann&#233;e
pr&#233;c&#233;dente, essentiellement en raison de l`absence de l`impact des ouragans de
l`ann&#233;e derni&#232;re. 

Les charges d`entreprise et les charges de financement, hors &#233;l&#233;ments
exceptionnels, se sont &#233;lev&#233;es &#224; 483 millions de dollars, en hausse de 412
millions de dollars, principalement du fait d`int&#233;r&#234;ts cr&#233;diteurs plus bas. 

Au cours du troisi&#232;me trimestre 2009, Exxon Mobil Corporation a achet&#233; 61
millions de ses actions ordinaires pour la tr&#233;sorerie &#224; un co&#251;t brut de 4,2
milliards de dollars. Ces achats incluaient 4,0 milliards de dollars en vue de
r&#233;duire le nombre d`actions en circulation, le solde ayant &#233;t&#233; utilis&#233; pour
compenser les actions &#233;mises en rapport aux plans et aux programmes de
prestations de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Les actions en circulation ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;duites de 4 806
millions &#224; la fin du deuxi&#232;me trimestre &#224; 4 747 millions &#224; la fin du troisi&#232;me
trimestre. On estime actuellement que les achats d`actions en vue de r&#233;duire les
actions en circulation totaliseront 2,0 milliards de dollars au quatri&#232;me
trimestre 2009. Les achats peuvent &#234;tre faits sur le march&#233; libre et par
transactions n&#233;goci&#233;es et peuvent &#234;tre augment&#233;s, diminu&#233;s ou interrompus &#224; tout
moment sans pr&#233;avis.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Nov 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Point Carbon identified the winners and losers in a proposed cap-and-trade
system for greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in its latest
report Carbon Exposure unveiled today at its annual fall conference
Carbon Market Insights Americas. Within the power and oil sectors,
representing 40% of covered emissions in the market, the greatest winners
and losers come from the power industry. Atlanta-based Southern Company
would suffer the most as a single entity under the cap while Exelon
Corporation will likely profit.

    The report by the world-leading provider of market analysis for the energy
and environmental markets is the first to identify the major market
participants and quantify the financial impact of a carbon cap on each of
them. Point Carbon's analysis uses the scope and structure proposed under
the Kerry-Boxer bill (S.1733) presently debated in the Senate.

    "Now, we can begin to see which firms would have larger market share and
corresponding ability to move carbon markets," noted Emilie Mazzacurati,
head of Point Carbon's North American research division. "We can also see
which companies will remain financially attractive, and which will be more
exposed to carbon risk."

    The most vulnerable companies come from the power sector. Namely, these
are Southern Company, American Electric Power and Duke Energy. Compliance
could cost Southern 12% of its operating income, AEP 11% of its operating
income and Duke 5% of its operating income. This is in spite of the fact
that the largest electric company in the US, American Electric Power or
AEP, emits less than half of what ExxonMobil emits. AEP's gross cost of
carbon, a company's total emissions multiplied by the price of allowances,
would be $2.3 billion while Southern Company's would be $2.2 billion.
However, AEP is anticipated to recover 90% of its net carbon cost thru
carbon revenues.

    "This information may entice some companies to explore pre-compliance
strategies such as offsets now, since that might reduce costs later," said
Mazzacurati. "If the more vulnerable companies were to do this now in a
thorough and strategic manner, they could hedge their exposure
considerably."

    Point Carbon's report makes clear that volume of emissions or nominal size
of compliance costs are not correlated positively to the financial impact
on the company. Indeed, the largest emitter in the United States is
ExxonMobil, alone accounting for over 6% of all US emissions. Yet
ExxonMobil's operating income will be only slightly affected under the
system.

    Using Point Carbon's forecasted average price of carbon at $15 for the
first few years of the program, ExxonMobil would need to pay $5.9 billion
annually to purchase the carbon allowances needed for compliance. This
corresponds to eight percent of ExxonMobil's operating income. However,
the company would likely recoup $5.6 billion by carbon revenues through a
small increase (5%) in gasoline prices, leaving its final cost of carbon
at $277 million and making its gross carbon cost small when contrasted to
its operating income of $84.1 billion.

    A $15 price of carbon translates into a $0.13 increase per gallon of
gasoline. Such a price increase is viewed as negligible when compared to
gasoline price swings caused by volatility in oil markets. Oil companies
of comparable size would fare similarly under a US system.

    Certain power companies would gain under the proposed cap-and-trade
system. The final cost of carbon for Exelon is a net gain of over 36
percent of its operating income. This is due to its large portfolio of
low-emission power generation facilities. Other energy companies that may
move forward financially are FirstEnergy and PG

&lt;p&gt;The official Xinhua news agency cited Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng as telling a media briefing on Sunday that the city would hold a news briefing soon to reveal the latest developments concerning the proposed park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This project will surely go forward, but first it must be approved by the central government," said the government source on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They will seek to clarify the situation with this upcoming news conference," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has been trying to build a park for years in Shanghai, in an on-again-off-again effort as it tries for a bigger footprint in a fast-growing China market where success has eluded most Western media companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors have swirled in Chinese media in the last two weeks that Shanghai could soon announce final plans to build a park with Walt Disney Co, possibly to coincide with a planned trip to the city later this month by U.S. President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The project is still in the planning stages and most of the details aren't mature yet," the source said, adding that the city had decided on a site in Shanghai's Pudong New Area for the project but was determining who the local business partners would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, approval for massive projects on the scale of Disney can be a long, opaque process that can drag on for years, with officials sometimes providing early indications before a final decision is formally announced to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is interested in Shanghai not only for the city's large population, but also for the many major cities, including the likes of Suzhou, Nanjing and Hangzhou, located within easy driving distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media reports have placed the cost of the park around $3.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney already has operations in Hong Kong, where its fifth resort was built in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Doug Young and Edmund Klamann; Editing by Chris Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Following a meeting in Seoul yesterday between the Vice Chairman and CEO
ofSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Yoon-Woo Lee, and the CEO of Microsoft, Steve
Ballmer, Samsung Electronics announced that it will collaborate with Microsoft
on efficient energy usage in computers. 

The two companies are aimed at encouraging PC users to purchase more
environmentally friendly PC systems. Samsung expects substantial energy savings
when Microsoft`s flagship Windows 7 operating system and Samsung`s 40 nanometer
(nm) class DDR3 DRAM are used together. 

Samsung, a strong supporter of Windows 7, will be migrating all of its corporate
PCs worldwide to the new operating system beginning in 2010. 

The Green IT collaboration effort between the world`s number one memory company
and the world`s number one software company is expected to contribute to the
revival of IT markets that have been depressed from the economic downturn. 

At the beginning of September, Samsung initiated its own global marketing
campaign centered around "Less Energy, More Speed", initially focused on its
energy-efficient, 40nm-class, 2Gb DDR3 DRAM. 

Also, Microsoft has announced significant reductions in power consumption with
the new power management function in its recently released Windows 7 operating
system. 

"Windows 7 was designed as a more environmentally-sound and energy-efficient OS,
particularly evident in its managing of memory and when shifting into lower
power mode," said Kim James Woo, Country Manager of Microsoft Korea. He added
that "users will enjoy the benefits when Windows 7 and DDR3 are combined." 

"There is no doubt that the combination of Windows 7 and 40nm DDR3 in new PCs
will make users very happy," said Dong-Soo Jun, executive senior vice president
of memory marketing at Samsung Electronics. He added, "If you opt for 4GB of
memory in a Windows 7-based system, over typical 2GB-based systems used today,
you`ll see an increase in performance, while using less power, thanks to the
efficiency of Samsung`s 40nm DDR3 DRAM." 

In the ensuing months, while measuring the effects of this and other
collaborative Green IT efforts, Samsung will continue to examine the potential
for other areas of global cooperation with Microsoft in IT technology
development. 

ABOUT GREEN DDR3

Samsung`s 40nm class DDR3 is one of the most environmentally friendly
mass-produced memories for PCs and servers worldwide. Providing up to 60 percent
power savings over 60nm-class DDR2 in PCs, Samsung`s Green DDR3 is available in
densities from 1GB to 4GB and is designed to work efficiently with all leading
operating systems, particularly Windows 7. Find out more about Samsung`s Green
DDR3 at www.samsung.com/ddr3.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.'s standing as an operating system developer is on the line with the launch of Windows 7 , according to analysts and other experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last month, the company formally unveiled its next-generation operating system -- the first new Windows release since co-founder and longtime CEO Bill Gates departed in 2008 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a reputation issue at stake here," said Michael Silver, an analyst at Gartner Inc. "Apple has been making fun of them, and Microsoft wants to put an end to that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston Gralla , a Computerworld contributing editor who has extensively reviewed Windows 7 , said that in following the roundly criticized Windows Vista operating system, "Windows 7 will show if [Microsoft] can do operating systems right, or if they've finally lost it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft finds itself vulnerable because of its continuing failure to persuade users to upgrade from Windows XP to Vista since the latter's release three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The older Windows XP is still used by 72% of computer users worldwide, while just 19% are running Vista, according to Net Applications in Aliso Viejo, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Microsoft last week acknowledged that "isolated issues" caused endless reboots among some users trying to upgrade from Vista to Windows 7, initial data from early corporate adopters of Windows 7 indicates that the new operating system can cut power costs while saving its users significant time by booting up more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group policy controls in Windows 7 are already helping IT personnel at Pella Corp. better manage power use, said Jim Thomas, director of IT operations at the Des Moines-based maker of windows and doors, which has distributed Windows 7 to 200 of its 4,000 users. Users can temporarily reset power management controls, "but every time the group policy reapplies, it puts the power setting down that we want to apply," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas conservatively estimated that using Windows 7 will result in about $20,000 in annual power savings once the software is fully deployed in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Automatic Data Processing Inc. in Roseland, N.J., about 300 of the 30,000 users are running the new operating system, said CIO Mike Capone. He said he has seen estimates that the power management capabilities could deliver savings "into the six-figure range" annually once ADP completes its full rollout, which it expects to do within 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randy Benz, CIO at St. Louis-based Energizer Holdings Inc., said that a Windows 7 pilot among 40 users found that the operating system boots up some 80% faster than XP, which can take up to five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. in Wayland, Mass., noted that "Microsoft in this case wanted to underpromise and overdeliver, which is the opposite of what it did with Vista." Freelance writer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Ferranti of the IDG News service and Linda Rosencrance contributed to this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

Facing increasing financial pressures, future uncertainty, and rising

Government Industry Framework provides:

* An incremental modernization and transformation strategy that speeds
deployment, providing quicker solutions to care for those in need 
* Industry best practices to lower risk and enable families and children to
reach their social and economic potential 
* An approach to align technology and business needs with the key goals and
objectives of the organization that results in positive, sustainable outcomes
for citizens 
* Support for adoption of open industry standards that enables organizations to
leverage existing investments while providing a clear path for technology
enhancements over time

"By coupling our market leading, citizen-centric solution for social services
with IBM`s flexible technology backbone, agencies will finally have access to a
solution that is easy to start, easy to manage &amp; secure, and easy to grow," said

on top of IBM`s Government Industry Framework. With such a strategic, integrated
platform, agencies can better ensure the economic health, welfare and security
of their citizens."

employ innovative eligibility and case management functionality; a citizen
self-service portal that provides anytime, anywhere access to citizens using a
`no wrong door` approach to providing services; Social Enterprise Management
(SEM) solution that integrates information and processes across government
agencies and provides outcomes-driven service delivery. 

"C&#250;ram Software is one of the first software providers for social services to be
validated on our new Government Industry Framework," said Lonne Jaffe director
Public Sector Solutions, IBM Software Group. "Curam's commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS) solution for social services, built on top of IBM's framework, provides
social services agencies with technology that is instrumented to empower field
workers, interconnected across agencies, and intelligent."

&lt;p&gt;  BEDFORD, MA, Nov 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Progress Software Corporation (NASDAQ: PRGS), a leading software provider
that enables enterprises to be operationally responsive, today announced
the availability of its enhanced Progress(R) DataDirect Connect(R) for
ODBC database driver for Microsoft SQL Server. The Microsoft SQL Server
native wire protocol driver, which is available in version 6.0 of the
DataDirect Connect line of ODBC drivers, includes new innovations intended
to streamline application development, boost performance and reduce
deployment and maintenance costs.

    The Progress DataDirect driver for Microsoft SQL Server simultaneously
supports all versions of the popular database and applications running on
Unix, Linux and Windows. New performance and enterprise-class features
have been shown to increase throughput performance by 35 percent with 75
percent greater Central Processing Unit (CPU) efficiency than with
previous versions of the Progress DataDirect driver. Performance testing
also shows significant improvements in response time, throughput and
scalability of database applications when compared to other third-party
drivers.

    Wire protocol architecture allows the DataDirect Connect for ODBC drivers
to deliver fast, scalable and secure application connections to relational
databases. By removing the need for database client-library software, time
consuming and complicated deployment and configuration issues related to
installing and maintaining different versions of the client software for
different databases, database versions and operating systems are
eliminated.

    Progress DataDirect continues its innovations with DataDirect Bulk Load,
introduced in version 6.0 of DataDirect Connect for ODBC and a
performance feature of the Microsoft SQL Server driver. The complete,
driver-based implementation delivers the best performance for bulk-load
scenarios without the need for database vendor tools or client libraries,
and has been shown to accelerate data warehousing and enable faster ETL
operations. A recent customer installation reports overnight batch cycles
that once took 4.5 hours can now be completed in only 45 minutes using
data connectivity components from Progress DataDirect.

    With the DataDirect Bulk Load functionality found in DataDirect Connect
for ODBC version 6.0, software developers can:


--  Load bulk data into a database the fastest way possible through ODBC
--  Export data from one database and import it into another quickly and
    easily
--  Perform a variety of bulk operations without having to use or deploy
    load tools from the database vendor
--  Boost the performance of existing batch operations without the need
    for application code changes
    

    
"Companies turn to Progress DataDirect not only to deliver reliable,
high-performance database connectivity but also to anticipate and respond
to changing data-access requirements through innovation and feature-rich
products," said John Goodson, vice president and general manager of
Progress DataDirect, the data infrastructure division of Progress
Software. "The Microsoft SQL Server native wire protocol driver from
Progress DataDirect has set the bar for excellence with its advanced
driver functionality, updated enterprise features and performance
enhancements."

    Other key features available in the DataDirect ODBC driver for Microsoft
SQL Server include  application failover to automatically redirect
requests to an alternate database server if the primary server is
unavailable because of a hardware failure or traffic overload; security
features including operating system authentication via Kerberos or NTLM
for creating a Single Sign-On environment and Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
encryption to protect critical data; security features including data
encryption via SSL; advanced connection pooling; and support for new
Microsoft SQL Server 2008 features. For more details and a complete list

&lt;p&gt; * OpenX and Microsoft announce multiyear partnership&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Companies to promote each others products to customers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Nov 2 (Reuters) - Online advertising
start-up OpenX and Microsoft Corp  (MSFT.O) announced a
partnership to promote each other's Internet technologies to
their respective customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal will significantly expand the distribution of
OpenX's technology for serving ads on websites, as the company
seeks to boost its roster of large Web publishers, said CEO Tim
Cadogan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OpenX will also make it easier for its Web publisher
customers to use Microsoft technology that analyzes the content
of a Web page and matches relevant ads to the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and OpenX did not disclose the financial terms of
the multiyear deal, though there will be the opportunity for
both companies to make money in the deal, said Peter MacDonald,
Microsoft's director of advertising business development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal marks the latest shift in the competitive
landscape for ad serving technology, which allows Web
publishers to manage ads across their sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OpenX competes with companies like Google Inc's (GOOG.O)
DoubleClick and Microsoft's own aQuantive product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MacDonald said that the OpenX ad server technology might be
more appropriate for certain types of Web publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Microsoft only offers ad serving technology that is
hosted in Microsoft's data centers, he noted that OpenX allows
publishers to install the software on their own computers.
OpenX technology is also open-source, allowing customers a wide
degree of customization options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MacDonald said the deal was not a sign that Microsoft was
shifting its focus away from offering ad serving technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft acquired aQuantive in 2007 for roughly $6
billion. In August, Microsoft sold aQuantive's ad agency
business, Razorfish, to Publicis for $530 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenX has more than 50 million Web publisher customers and
runs more than 300 billion page impressions a month through its
software. The company, which raised $10 million in funding in
May, launched a separate online ad exchange marketplace earlier
this year.

&lt;p&gt;N37B Ruggedized Handheld Computing Device Nearing Certification for Major
Telecom Company; Company Targets Ingram Micro as First Major Sales Channel
Partner
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Newport Digital Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: NPDT), a technology solutions driven
company focused on rapidly emerging businesses in the wireless technology space,
announced today that it has implemented the licensing agreement with Microsoft
Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) to develop applications for its Windows Mobile platform.
The Company has also progressed with their distribution agreement previously
announced with Ingram Micro, Inc. (NYSE: IM), which will serve as its initial
primary sales channel partner. 

Newport Digital Technologies, Inc. (NPDT), in conjunction with leading Taiwan
based R technology incubators, the Institute for Information Industry (III)
and the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), is commercializing a
number of leading edge Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies. The
first product is the N37B Ruggedized Handheld RFID reader and computing device
that was unveiled this week at the Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Solutions
Association (VICS) conference hosted by the University of Arkansas RFID Research
Center. NPDT is a named sponsor of this research center at the Sam Walton
College of Business. The N37B will also offer two more complementary integrated
options that include 3G connection module and location and navigation based GPS.
The 3G option will enable the handheld to have data connectivity anywhere a
cellular connection is available making for a "connect anywhere" scenario for
RFID business applications. The GPS option will allow for the N37B to not only
collect RFID data from item level inventory but to pinpoint and report the
location of the inventory scanned by the RFID reader. This greatly enhances and
expands the applications that can be offered from Independent Software Vendors
(ISVs). 

"We are thrilled to be approaching final certification of this RFID reader for
use on a major telecom`s wireless network," said NPDT CEO Gary DeMel. "We are
also excited by the response of the RFID industry at the VICS conference to the
total RFID solution NPDT demonstrated at the VICS conference. The N37B, which
will run on Microsoft`s Mobile Computing Platform, has wide application in the
RFID market. NPDT will offer this device along with a comprehensive line of
mobile computing products and solutions targeting RFID field applications for
asset tracking, inventory management and point-of-sale for various B2B markets."


NPDT's planned RFID product suite includes: Electronic Product Code (EPC) Global
certification laboratories, ruggedized, military/commercial-grade RFID enabled,
mobile handheld tablet computers, RFID forklifts, POS kiosks, POS Checkout, EAS
readers, USB readers and RFID tags. Utilizing the Microsoft Windows Mobile
operating system, NPDT will further extend the features and capabilities of its
products. 

"Newport Digital Technologies has developed truly innovative RFID technologies
and we are thrilled to work with them to bring these technologies and
applications to the Windows Mobile platform," said Daren Mancini, General
Manager in the Windows Mobile Sales division at Microsoft. 

"We are very excited to work with Microsoft's technology and business teams to
develop the next generation of RFID computing devices by utilizing Windows
Mobile with customized application suites," commented Gary DeMel, CEO.
"Microsoft, which provides software and hardware products and solutions
worldwide, is one of the world's premier companies and we are looking forward to
partnering with them through a successful licensing agreement. This agreement
may prove to be the springboard that launches Newport Digital into becoming a
recognized name in the wireless space. We are proud to be a company with
technology that Microsoft believes in." 

"At the VICS Conference NPDT was presented as sponsor alongside Motorola,
Impinj, Avery Dennison, and ADT; all leaders in the RFID industry today," said
NPDT CTO and COO Weiling Tsao. "The NPDT demonstration booth, in our opinion,
was by far the most elaborate, and the only one having live RFID demo`s. NPDT is
not interested in just selling a single device or product; our focus is to
deliver a total end-to-end RFID solution. Using the Microsoft Operating System
enables us to accommodate almost nearly all of our potential customer base. We
look forward to providing more guidance to our shareholders and clients as we
further develop our RFID solutions."

&lt;p&gt;PacketSentry`s Compliance, Audit Controls Bypass Expensive, Risky Modifications
Typically Required for Mainframe Applications
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
PacketMotion, pioneers of User Activity Management, today announced the
availability of new audit and compliance controls for the IBM mainframe
environment with the company`s low-risk, operationally efficient PacketSentry
solution. IT teams responsible for mainframe environments can now extract
network/application transaction activity down to the user level directly from
the network, bypassing the need for any changes to the mainframe applications. 

"Enterprises are increasing required to apply audit controls to mainframe
applications, but there are unwanted costs and risks associated with modifying
these applications to add the required controls," said Jonathan Gohstand, VP of
Marketing, PacketMotion. "Our solution provides the detailed audit trail plus
the reporting and policy enforcement required, with no software modifications or
in-line appliances that affect performance or availability. The bottom line is
cost-effective, application-level controls, rapidly deployed within one day and
with no risk." 

PacketMotion`s PacketSentry solution creates an audit trail of every mainframe
screen accessed via Telnet 3270 (TN3270) as well as what was entered on each
screen by individual users. Crucially, the solution decodes mainframe user IDs,
thereby reporting on specific mainframe user activities. For example, audit
controls can be easily implemented to track activity of "elevated privilege" or
superuser accounts normally used to modify applications or perform direct
database updates. Furthermore, the audit trail is correlated with the Microsoft
Windows domain IDs of the end users, so that mainframe account misuse or sharing
is easily detected and stopped. 

Real-time controls are also supported, for example, to block use of a mainframe
administration account except from specified domain-authenticated PCs or
approved locations. Multiple languages are supported, as is transparent
decryption of secure TN3270 using the optional PacketSentry Transparent SSL
Inspector. When combined with existing capabilities to audit database (DB2) and
web services (MQ) transactions, the TN3270 option completes PacketMotion`s
offering for mainframe activity management in a single solution. 

The new PacketMotion audit and compliance controls will be most beneficial to
industries with significant information resources within mainframes, such as
insurance, financial services, manufacturing, healthcare and well as government
agencies. These industries must conduct internal audits and fulfill compliance
requirements such as SOX, HIPAA and PCI DSS. 

PacketSentry TN3270 mainframe support is available now and is sold directly by
PacketMotion and its authorized resellers in the US and internationally. Support
for TN5250 (iSeries or AS/400) transactions is planned for an upcoming release.
TN3270 mainframe support is available as an option to PacketSentry, with pricing
starting at $50,000. For more product information, visit packetmotion.com. 

About PacketMotion

PacketMotion, Inc. has pioneered the development of User Activity Management
(UAM) to drive IT audit and compliance efficiency. Recognized by Gartner as a
"Cool Vendor in Identity and Access Management, 2009", PacketMotion`s unique
approach to automating compliance and security avoids the use of agent software
or in-line appliances, both of which can affect application availability or
performance. IT and security teams are able to integrate the solution in less
than a day, immediately lowering costs associated with complying with
regulations such as PCI DSS, SOX and HIPAA. The solution also is simultaneously
used to manage risks from insider fraud and protect sensitive data. For more

&lt;p&gt;TEL AVIV Nov 2 (Reuters) - Pfizer (PFE.N), the world's
largest drugmaker, is considering a cooperation deal with
Protalix Biotherapeutics (PLX.A) and may even try to buy the
Israeli company, TheMarker financial newspaper said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A Pfizer delegation visited the Protalix facilities in
Israel last week, TheMarker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protalix officials were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protalix has a market cap of $726 million and its stock has
surged 415 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protalix developed the ProCellEx system for producing
medical proteins through the genetic engineering of carrot
cells. This method is up to 90 percent cheaper than other
production methods including the genetic engineering of mammal
cells or bacteria, TheMarker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month Protalix said its experimental drug to treat
Gaucher disease, a rare genetic disorder, was successful in a
late-stage clinical trial. If approved, the drug, Uplyso, would
compete with Genzyme Corp's GENZ.O biggest-selling drug,
Cerezyme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protalix is 19 percent held by Israel's Biocell (BCEL.TA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protalix Chief Executive David Aviezer has said he expects
Protalix to sign a partnership agreement with another
pharmaceuticals company by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tova Cohen; Editing by Erica Billingham)

The EU has until Jan. 19 to decide whether it will accept the deal. [nLL257046] [nLP726458] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Oracle wants a quick resolution because it says that Sun, the fourth-biggest maker of computer servers, is losing $100 million a month as rivals like Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and IBM (IBM.N) poach customers amid uncertainty about the closing of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The largest and the most common rival was Oracle. In every deal we were competing against Oracle," Michael "Monty" Widenius, the founder of MySQL, told Reuters in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Widenius, one of the most respected developers of open-source software, left Sun earlier this year to set up his own small database firm Monty Program Ab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion just last year and Oracle has said it does not plan to divest MySQL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The global database market is dominated by technology heavyweights Oracle, IBM and Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MySQL has been a rare major newcomer to the industry -- pushing down prices of databases and their maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Widenius said that when large corporates start to use MySQL, they usually use it to replace databases running some 60-80 percent of their applications -- creating price pressure also on the databases used for the remaining applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MySQL's value to Oracle is much larger than its turnover as it would remove some of the pricing pressure on its own databases, Widenius said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MySQL pays for the whole Sun acquisition, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Oracle has said it plans to customise its software with Sun's hardware, selling specialised computers and storage devices that offer better performance than ones using hardware and software from other companies.    OPEN SOURCE WORTH A BILLION &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sun has lately positioned MySQL increasingly as a rival to Microsoft, but Widenius said not one of the large clients use MySQL on Windows, it has always had just a few developers working on Windows, and it has a direct, free rival there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This means that there is very little money to be made on the Windows side for MySQL. They are not going to make a profit there. The big money is on the Linux side where MySQL already successfully competes with Oracle, and where MySQL has put all their efforts during the last 10 years," Widenius said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Clients of MySQL, who wished not to be quoted due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters they have been switching between Oracle and MySQL databases for their different applications, based on changing business needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    They also said they are worried about the position of the rival database in the future product roadmap of Oracle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Widenius said he was worried his creation could be killed.  "It is easier to use and it's cheaper -- if cheapness was be removed, the attractiveness decreases," Widenius said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Donald Feinberg, an analyst at Gartner, said that any attempt by Oracle to kill MySQL would fail as with open source software others could take the code, re-name it and create their own versions, as has happened before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Widenius said that while the code could be easily copied, the main problem was the ecosystem around MySQL -- companies making business from it, developing it and using it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "If it would be easy to fork (copy) it, no-one would have paid a billion dollars for it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Additional reporting by David Lawsky in San Francisco; editing by Simon Jessop) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((tarmo.virki@thomsonreuters.com, +358-9-680 50 235, Reuters messaging: tarmo.virki.reuters.com@reuters.net))   Keywords: SUN ORACLE/MYSQL  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/HONG KONG Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Shanghai government
may soon give preliminary details on plans for a new Disney theme
park it hopes to develop, as it awaits Beijing's formal approval
for the project, a government source said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The official Xinhua news agency cited Shanghai Mayor Han
Zheng as telling a media briefing on Sunday that the city would
hold a news briefing soon to reveal the latest developments
concerning the proposed park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This project will surely go forward, but first it must be
approved by the central government," said the government source
on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak
to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They will seek to clarify the situation with this upcoming
news conference," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rumors have swirled in Chinese media in the last two weeks
that Shanghai could soon announce final plans to build a park
with Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), possibly to coincide with a planned
trip to the city later this month by U.S. President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The project is still in the planning stages and most of the
details aren't mature yet," he said, adding that the city had
decided on a site in Shanghai's Pudong New Area for the project
but was determining who the local business partners would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of property developers with holdings in Pudong
advanced on Monday. Shanghai Lujiazui Development (600663.SS) was
up 8.8 percent as of 0628 GMT and Xiamen Prosolar (600193.SS) was
up 6.81 percent. The broader Shanghai market .SSEC was up 2.37
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In China, approval for massive projects on the scale of
Disney can be a long, opaque process that can drag on for years,
with officials sometimes providing early indications before a
final decision is formally announced to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has been trying to build a park for years in Shanghai,
in an on-again-off-again effort as it tries for a bigger
footprint in a fast-growing China market where success has eluded
most Western media companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney is interested in Shanghai not only for the city's
large population, but also for the many major cities, including
the likes of Suzhou, Nanjing and Hangzhou, located within easy
driving distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Media reports have placed the cost of the park around $3.6
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney already has operations in Hong Kong, where its fifth
resort was built in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said a Disney agreement could be a feel-good
bilateral story, highlighting U.S. cultural influence and an
investment that does not entail U.S. job losses in the
manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China would get a boost to its leisure sector and to domestic
demand as it tries to trim its dependence on exports, which left
it vulnerable during the financial crisis, wrote Gong Weisong, an
editor at the state-run Shanghai Securities News last month.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) in a bid to buy $3 billion in tax credits from mortgage giant Fannie Mae, the Wall Street Journal's website reported, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday the Journal reported that Goldman, the largest and most profitable U.S. investment bank, is in talks to buy millions of dollars of tax credits from Fannie Mae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department, which controls Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after pouring $100 million into the housing-finance giants, may block the sale on the grounds that it wouldn't benefit taxpayers, WSJ said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sales would come as the public rails against government moves that aid banking giants, which are preparing to lavish big bonuses about a year after receiving trillions in taxpayer rescue funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which received federal bailout money last fall, in particular has come under fire for generating out-sized profits and preparing record bonuses as the economy continues to struggle. Buffett injected $9 billion into Goldman last fall through purchases of preferred stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credits are worth little to Fannie Mae, which also records losses each quarter as their value declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway and Goldman could not be reached immediately for comment. Treasury officials told the paper they are still reviewing the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax credits are incentives designed to bring more investment to low-income housing developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Passlogix&#174;, Inc., announced today that v-GO Single Sign-On (v-GO SSO), its
market-leading enterprise single sign-on solution, now supports Microsoft
Windows 7. v-GO SSO is compatible with both the 32- and 64-bit versions of
Microsoft`s newest operating system. 

Passlogix`s rapid support of Windows 7 will allow organizations using v-GO SSO
for password management to migrate to the new OS as soon as necessary to take
advantage of new Windows features that expedite everyday tasks and increase
computing performance. It will also enable those enterprises as well as new
customers using Windows 7 to eliminate the need for end users to create,
remember, input and manage multiple application passwords. 

v-GO SSO is one of the most widely adopted enterprise single sign-on solutions
in the world and the cornerstone of the v-GO Access Accelerator Suite, an
integrated set of solutions for sign-on, authentication and provisioning
enablement. The v-GO suite helps organizations improve business productivity,
strengthen information security and regulatory compliance readiness, and
streamline identity management deployments. 

v-GO SSO allows users to access any Windows, mainframe or Web application with a
single Windows logon by automating username and password entry for each account.
Remote, mobile and temporary users - including off-site employees and affiliates
such as third-party partners or contractors - can have the same single sign-on
advantages with v-GO On Demand, a companion solution that can be accessed with a
click from a corporate Web page without software installation on end users`
computers. 

Other solutions in the v-GO Access Accelerator Suite automate user sign-on and
sign-off of kiosk sessions; securely manage shared passwords for administrators
and others who must share account IDs; enable strong authentication to
applications, desktops and networks without expensive custom integration;
pre-load user IDs and passwords to the v-GO repository for easy provisioning;
and automate resets of Windows logon passwords. 

The solution scales to tens of thousands of users, enables wizard-based
integration that eliminates the need to write scripts or connectors even to
homegrown or legacy applications, and installs on existing servers without
adding dedicated or proprietary hardware. These features lower the total cost of
ownership and allow organizations to receive rapid payback on their investment. 

In addition to Windows 7, v-GO SSO is also compatible with Windows XP
Professional (SP2), Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista Business Edition. 

About Passlogix

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co has received Beijing's nod to build a theme park in Shanghai, in a major advance for the media and entertainment company in the tough China market ahead of President Obama's first China visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement caps years of on-again-off-again talks between Disney and Shanghai, reflecting the tough road that Western media firms have faced in China in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China is one of the most dynamic, exciting and important countries in the world, and this approval marks a very significant milestone for The Walt Disney Company in mainland China," Disney CEO Robert Iger said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of central government approval was seen as a major stumbling block for much of the last decade as Disney has sought to build a park in the wealthy city of Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney already has operations in Hong Kong, where its fifth resort was built in 2005, but that location has not been as successful as initially envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite years of effort, companies like Disney, Time Warner and News Corp have surprisingly little to show for their efforts in China, which strongly controls the activities of foreign media companies in its market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough comes just weeks ahead of a scheduled trip to China later this month by President Barack Obama, leading some to say the timing of the announcement could be related to the trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the central government's approval of Disney's project application report (PAR), the city of Shanghai and Disney must still work out more details on the park, said a Disney spokeswoman in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Essentially the PAR approval represents one milestone in the process," she said. The next stage enables us to proceed with detailed discussions with the Shanghai government to produce a final deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier rumors Disney had secured approval for the park also boosted shares of property developers that have holdings in Pudong. The city had decided on a site in Shanghai's Pudong New Area for the planned project but was still in discussions to determine who the local business partners might be, a government source told Reuters earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media reports have placed the cost of the park at around $3.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Shanghai park, which would be Disney's sixth, will inevitably affect the Hong Kong park, though the impact will be limited as the two parks will draw from different areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visitors from Guangdong and southern China will still find Hong Kong more convenient while Shanghai will attract visitors from northern and eastern China," said Paul Tang, chief economist of Bank of East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai is close to a number of other major cities within easy driving distance, including Nanjing, Suzhou and Hangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also doesn't view the two parks as competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From our point of view the Hong Kong and Shanghai parks are not competitors, they're complementary," the spokeswoman said. "We really believe that the greater China market is big enough to support multiple parks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Edmund Klamann in Shanghai, Doug Young, Don Durfee and Alison Leung in Hong Kong, and Edwin Chan in Los Angeles; Editing by Ken Wills, Jonathan Hopfner and Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's monthly predictions about whether hackers will create reliable exploit code for its bugs were right only about a quarter of the time in the first half of 2009, the company acknowledged Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's not as good as a coin toss," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. "So what's the point?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2008, Microsoft added an "Exploitability Index" to the security bulletins it issues each month. The index rates bugs on a scale from 1 to 3, with 1 indicating that consistently-successful exploit code was likely in the next 30 days, and 3 meaning that working exploit code was unlikely during that same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to give customers more information to decide which vulnerabilities should be patched first. Before the introduction of the index, Microsoft only offered impact ratings -- "critical," "important," "moderate" and "low" -- as an aid for users puzzled by which flaws should be fixed immediately and which could be set aside for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the first half of this year, Microsoft correctly predicted exploits just slightly more than one out of every four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Forty-one vulnerabilities were assigned an Exploitability Index rating of 1, meaning that they were considered the most likely to be exploited within 30 days of the associated security bulletin's release," Microsoft stated in its bi-annual security intelligence report , which it published Monday. "Of these, 11 were, in fact, exploited within 30 days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means Microsoft got it right about 27% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also tallied its predictions by security bulletins -- in many cases a single bulletin included patches for multiple vulnerabilities -- to come up with a better batting average. "Sixteen bulletins received a severity rating of Critical," it said in its report. "Of these, 11 were assigned an Exploitability Index rating of 1. Five of these 11 bulletins addressed vulnerabilities that were publicly exploited within 30 days, for an aggregate false positive rate of 55%."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company defended its poor showing -- even on a bulletin-by-bulletin level it accurately predicted exploitability only 45% of the time -- by saying it was playing it safe. "The higher false positive rate for Critical security bulletins can be attributed to the conservative approach used during the assessment process to ensure the highest degree of customer protection for the most severe class of issues," said Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's some validity to that," agreed Storms. "They're going to err on the side of caution, if only to prevent people saying 'I told you so' if an exploit appears later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Pescatore, Gartner's primary security analyst, agreed, but added, "If they want to stick with the index, they need to adjust the criteria so fewer vulnerabilities get a '1.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With vulnerability-by-vulnerability predictions correct only a fourth of the time, Storms questioned the usefulness of the exploitability index. "What's the point of the index if they're always going to side on the more risky side, as opposed to what's most likely?" he asked. "In some ways, we're back to where we were before they introduced the exploitability index."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Storms' point of view, the exploitability index was meant to provide more granular information to customers who wondered what should be patched first. Presumably, a vulnerability marked critical with an index rating of "1" would take precedence over a critical vulnerability tagged as "2" or "3" on the exploitability index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With these numbers of false positives, we are in no better place than we were prior to the index, in respect to granularity," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pescatore also questioned the usefulness of the exploitability index. "I doubt anyone even looks at it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Pescatore again argued, as he did last year when Microsoft debuted the index, that the company would better serve customers by abandoning its own severity and exploitability rankings, and move to the standard CVSS [Common Vulnerability Scoring System] ratings. The CVSS system is used by, among other companies and organizations, Oracle, Cisco and US-CERT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because Microsoft does its own exploitability index, enterprises can't compare theirs with Adobe's or Oracle's. It's an apples and oranges thing then," said Pescatore. "It's not just Windows bugs that companies have to deal with anymore."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He doubted Microsoft would take his advice. "They don't want to do that because then reporters and analysts can look and say, 'Microsoft has more higher-rated vulnerabilities than Oracle or Adobe,'" he said. "There's nothing in it for them to do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made the right call on all 46 vulnerabilities that were assigned an exploitability rating of "2" or "3," which indicate that an exploit would be unreliable or unlikely, respectively. "None were identified to have been publicly exploited within 30 days," Microsoft's report noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all its predictions in the first half of 2009 are considered, not just those marked as likely to be exploited, Microsoft got 57 out of a possible 87, or 66% of them, right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's security intelligence report, which covers the January-June 2009 period, was the first to spell out the accuracy of the exploitability index. But Microsoft has touted its forecasting before. A year ago, for example, Microsoft said in a postmortem of its first-ever index that although it had accurately predicted exploits less than half the time, it considered the tool a success . "I think we did really well," said Mike Reavey, group manager at the Microsoft Security Research Center (MSRC), at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's security intelligence report can be downloaded from its Web site in PDF or XPS document formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Nov 4 (Reuters) - The Shanghai government said on
Wednesday that it is in detailed talks to build a world-class
Disney theme park in the Pudong district of Shanghai, after
getting the nod from the central government in late October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) also said it had received approval
from the Chinese government for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Currently, the Chinese and U.S. sides of the project are in
deep discussions on concrete details of coopertation and will
work together to build a world-class Disney park in Shanghai's
Pudong New Area," the Shanghai government said in a statement.

&lt;p&gt;Intel today announced it is investigating reports from iPhone owners that they're unable to sync their devices to new PCs, although Microsoft said it had received no calls from customers about the glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, meanwhile, has asked users on its support forum to submit the make of their computer, the version of its BIOS, their iPhone or iPod model and other information to help it troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our leading theory is a BIOS or system configuration issue, but we are still investigating," an Intel spokesman said Tuesday, referring to reports on Apple's support forum that users have been unable get their iPhones to synchronize after upgrading to Windows 7, in particular the 64-bit edition of Microsoft's operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users first reported iPhone sync problems with Windows-based PCs in mid-September, but the traffic on the thread dedicated to the issue picked up when Microsoft released Windows 7 on Oct. 22. "I can plug [my iPhone] in again and iTunes will recognize it, but it says: 'iTunes could not connect to this iPhone because of an unknown error occurred (0xE8000065)'," said "MrBahr" in the kick-off message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people adding to the thread said that their PCs were equipped with Intel's P55 Express chipset, which is included on motherboards intended for machines powered by Intel's quad-core i7 and i5 processors. Desktop and notebook PCs running those CPUs are available now from the likes of Hewlett-Packard; Apple plans to ship iMacs with those processors later this month .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've got the same problem running Windows 7 Professional on a EVGA P55 SLI [mother]board, Core i7 860 processor," said a user identified as "e8link" on the Apple support thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Got the same stupid issue, already wasted 4 hours on this," complained "scamsel" on the same thread. "I have the new ASUS P55 EVO board using Windows 7 x64 Ultimate  just got a new rig this week, already this big issue, should have gotten a new iMac!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many pinned blame on Windows 7, some said that the new operating system was not at fault. "I have NO ISSUES with both Windows 7 32- and 64-bit on non-P55 [mother]boards," reported "scribbydagreat" in a Monday message. "Coincidence? Maybe. [But] installing the iTunes update on my P55 system bricked my iPhone forcing a restore and now it will not sync (or connect) on that computer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said that as far as it knew, Windows 7 was not responsible, but said it's looking into the problem nonetheless. " Microsoft has not seen this particular question posed in the Microsoft Answers for Windows 7 community forum, nor in any of our call centers," a company spokeswoman said today via instant message. "We reviewed the issue raised on the Apple Discussion Board and are currently investigating. If we determine this to be a problem specific to Windows 7, we will post an update on the Microsoft Answers site."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are iPhone-related questions on Microsoft's Answers support forum, none directly pertain to the synchronization problem being discussed on the Apple support site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For it's part, Apple is also investigating the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone tagged as "Roy B" asked users on Sunday to send system details to an apple.com e-mail address. "We would like to get some more details about systems that are experiencing this issue. If you are having issues connecting your iPhone or iPod to a Windows 7 computer with the Intel P55 chipset, please compose an e-mail with this information," Roy B said, then followed that with a list that included the computer maker and model, the motherboard maker and model, the BIOS version, and the iPhone or iPod model being used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users are frustrated. "Can't sync. Inconsistent and random failures ranging from inability to sync only pictures to completely making the iPhone unrecognizable to any iTunes computer requiring a Restore," said "WildWill" yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having tried everything I have read on the posts and forums on my P55, I am GIVING UP!" shouted scribbydagreat. "Nothing has worked and now am cynical that anything will until Apple issues an update."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

tailored to the Shanghai region and other amenities consistent with Disney`s
destination resorts worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yesterday re-patched Internet Explorer, the third time it's been forced to repair one of the updates from its largest-ever bug fix, which was delivered on Oct. 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday's fix targeted MS09-054 , the update that patched four vulnerabilities, all "critical," in Internet Explorer (IE). According to Christopher Budd, a spokesman for the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), the follow-on hotfix patches Web page display problems introduced by the update. Budd downplayed the severity of the problems, saying that the number of users affected was "limited."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A document on Microsoft's support site outlined the two issues, one that scrambles Web page elements, while the other spawns a "Type Mismatch" script error on sites that use VBScript or a mix of VBScript and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new problems can crop up in any still-supported edition of IE, including IE 5.01, IE6, IE7 and the newest version, IE8, on all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The troubles are serious enough to prompt Microsoft to push the re-patch to all users. "We plan to release this update through the same broad release channels as the original security update, MS09-054," Budd said in an entry to the MSRC blog yesterday. "Customers will see [the re-patch] offered by default through Windows Update, Microsoft Update and Automatic Updates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computerworld confirmed that Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 systems that had been fully patched last month were offered Monday's update through Windows Update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday's re-patch was the third correction related to Oct. 13's massive security update , which set records for both the number of separate bulletins (13) and the number of vulnerabilities quashed (34).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 14, Microsoft offered up a workaround for a problem with MS09-056 , then corrected several errors in MS09-062 last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also revised an August update, MS09-043 , last week to correct a patch-detection error that may have left some corporate users who receive updates via Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) unpatched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not unusual for Microsoft to re-release security updates. In June 2008, for example, the company admitted a patch intended to fix a problem in Windows XP's implementation of Bluetooth didn't work. Microsoft blamed human error for the snafu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update for MS09-054 can be downloaded from Microsoft's site, or retrieved using Windows Update or WSUS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Bank Failures Zoom to 115

The nine banks had 153 offices, out of which California National Bank had 68
branches. California National Bank was the biggest of FBOP's banks, the nation's
101st largest with assets of $7.1 billion. 

Failure of these institutions represents another impact on the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) fund for protecting customer accounts, as it has
been appointed receiver for these banks. The failure of 115 banks has cost the
federal deposit insurance fund more than $25 billion so far this year. The FDIC
insures deposits at 8,195 institutions with roughly $13.5 trillion in assets. 

When a bank fails, it reimburses customers for deposits of up to $250,000 per
account. The outbreak of financial institutions failing has significantly
stretched the regulator's deposit insurance fund. As on June 30, 2009, the fund
corpus fell to $10.4 billion, the lowest since 1993, from $13.0 billion in the
prior quarter. 

Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank, a division of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), has agreed
to assume the deposits and most of the assets of these nine banks. The FDIC and
U.S. Bank agreed to share losses on about $14.4 billion of the combined
purchased assets. 

In the second quarter of 2009, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 416 from 305 in the first quarter. This is the highest
since the savings and loan crisis in 1994. 

Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to cause hundreds
more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC anticipates the bank failures
to cost about $100 billion over the next four years. 

In order to replenish the declining fund, the FDIC board recently proposed that
the U.S. banks should pay fees for three years in advance. Also, the regulators
are considering requesting the healthy banks to bail out the government soon as
it is necessary to replenish the deposit insurance fund, which has slipped to
0.22% of insured deposits, below the mandated minimum of 1.15%. 

The failure of Washington Mutual last year was the largest in U.S. history. It
was acquired by JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The other major acquirers of failed
institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB), U.S.
Bancorp, Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq: ZION), SunTrust Banks (NYSE: STI), among others.

Ford Turns Impressive Profit

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) returned to profitability in the third quarter of
the year by posting a net income of $873 million or 26 cents per share, easily
clearing the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 15 cents per share as well as the
year-ago loss of 6 cents per share. 

This was, in fact, Ford's first operating profit since the first quarter of
2008. The company, which was on the verge of bankruptcy in the middle of the
year, accredited its rebound to improved product line, inviolable structural
cost reduction efforts and improved results at Ford Credit. 

Although revenue was down 2.5% to $30.9 billion, Automotive revenue rose $100
million to $27.9 billion from the year-ago level. This was attributed to
favorable net pricing and higher volumes, primarily in North America, offset
partially by unfavorable exchange. Total wholesale vehicles advanced 5% to
1,232,000 units. 

The Automotive division reported a pre-tax operating profit of $446 million
versus a pre-tax loss of $2.9 billion a year ago. This reflected favorable net
pricing, structural cost reductions, lower material costs and improved market
share -- not to mention the federal CARS ("Cash for Clunkers") program -- offset
partially by unfavorable exchange and lower industry volumes.

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Nov 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. ("NET") (NASDAQ: NWK), a leader in
network and VOIP solutions, and emFAST Inc., a pioneer in network fax
messaging, today announced a teaming agreement and the successful
completion of interoperability testing of NET's VX Series running "One
Number Fax" with emFAST's FACSys server. This combination provides a
comprehensive unified messaging solution, including fax delivery, for
Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 users.

    NET's VX Series switches offer a "One Number Fax" solution to deliver the
true vision of a single, unified phone number with automated fax delivery.
The "One Number Fax" solution detects and separates voice and fax calls by
CNG (fax tone) detection and automatically routes the calls to the proper
destination without ever ringing the phone when faxes are delivered. Faxes
are delivered directly to Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 Unified
Messaging, Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Unified Messaging, or to the
FACSys Fax server to help organizations round out their unified messaging
implementations and save costs.

    The combined solution of NET's VX Series and emFAST's FACSys server
enhances Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 Unified Messaging and Microsoft
Exchange Server 2010 Unified Messaging, giving users the ability to manage
not only their e-mail, voice mail, text and instant messaging, but also to
manage fax messages from a single mailbox.

    The solution complements and extends Microsoft Exchange Server's messaging
capabilities with the following benefits:


--  Enables the sending and receiving of faxes from Microsoft Office
    applications, helping boost employee productivity.
--  Reduces capital and operational expenses of procuring and managing fax
    machines.
--  Increases security and ensures regulatory compliance by having an
    audit trail of fax messages.
--  Integrates fax with various multi-function peripherals such as those
    from HP, Xerox, Sharp, Ricoh, and Canon.
--  Integrates fax services with enterprise resource planning, customer
    relationship management, and other line-of-business applications.
    

    
NET's VX Series is a fully integrated multi-service voice switch that
provides high-performance VoIP communications for enterprise Microsoft
Office Communications Server 2007 R2 deployments, interoperating with
leading PBX and IP-PBX vendor protocols while offering rapid deployment,
ease of installation, and low maintenance. The VX Series provides
additional value to Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2
enterprise voice customers by reducing the total number of servers that
need to be deployed in the network and reducing the operational and
capital costs of deployment.

    The VX Series provides branch offices with several key features,
including: native DSP support for Microsoft RT-audio; support for meshed,
high availability Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2
networks; end to end Quality of Experience (QoE) monitoring; secure, line
speed SRTP and TLS encryption; and automatic codec selection for improved
audio quality.

    "We are very pleased to have a teaming agreement with NET," said Frank
Kaufman, President of emFAST. " As a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, we
worked closely with the Microsoft Exchange team to seamlessly integrate
FACSys and fax messaging into the Microsoft Exchange Unified Messaging
framework. The solution we have jointly created with NET using the 'One
Number Fax' feature of the VX Series further enhances this functionality
by allowing a user to have a single phone number for both voice and fax."

    "'One Number Fax' is a step forward for all of us who want to deliver a
single, unified phone number with automated fax delivery solution that
will really make an impact," said Matthew D. Krueger, NET's VP Business
Development. "With emFAST, we deliver a well-defined integration that
provides practical benefits to organizations using Microsoft Exchange
2007/2010, as well as prospects considering the value of a unified
communications implementation."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to steal away Salesforce.com and Oracle CRM on Demand customers with a new offer that will provide them with six months' access to its own CRM Online application at no charge if they sign a 12-month contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft charges US$44 per month per user for CRM Online Professional edition. That compares to $65 per month per user for Salesforce.com Professional. Oracle CRM on Demand pricing starts at $70 per month per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft's application is comparable from a feature standpoint and "already about 35 percent cheaper" than the competition, said Brad Wilson, general manager of Dynamics CRM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six-month offer is valid through the end of this year. Microsoft will consider expanding access to customers of other CRM products once it sees how well the program is received, Wilson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months is about how long it takes a customer to know for sure whether an application is right for their business, said Ray Wang, partner with the analyst firm Altimeter Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But potential hurdles lie in the way of a smooth transition over to CRM Online, he added. For one thing, a customer and Oracle or Salesforce.com may have a year-to-year deal, which might still be in effect when the six-month trial period expires, Wang said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While contract terms may allow the customer to cancel, they may not get a refund on the year's remaining fees, according to Wang. "Hopefully you'd be [signed up] month-to-month. It's good to check and see where you are in that process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, however, "users win" in price wars like this, Wang said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Monday also announced price cuts for its Business Productivity Online Suite. Other SaaS (software as a service) vendors, such as NetSuite, have made a steady stream of financial enticements in recent months too, as sales slowed during the global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com has also quietly lowered monthly per-user fees for its two lowest-end editions, Contact Manager and Group Edition, to $5 and $25 respectively, down from $9 and $35. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft is announcing the CRM switch-over deal in conjunction with an update to CRM Online, Wilson said. It is also planning to roll out the software worldwide in the second half of 2010, he said. The service is now available in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new release, Microsoft made signing up for CRM Online "super-simple," he said. No credit card information is required to sign up, although users need to provide an e-mail address. They can then start a free trial with either Microsoft's Outlook client or a browser-based interface, Wilson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-day trials include sample data so users can begin experimenting with the system. A series of help tools provide information on setup and maintenance. Microsoft has also developed an improved data import wizard. In addition, mobile access is available at no additional charge for any phone with a HTML 4.0-compliant Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We specifically tried to engineer [the application] to make it really easy for people who don't have CRM systems," Wilson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features New Ne-Yo Single "Never Knew I Needed"

With Performances by Dr. John, Anika Noni Rose, Jim Cummings, Keith David,
Michael Leon-Wooley, Bruno Campos, Jenifer Lewis, and Terence Blanchard
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Walt Disney Records will release the soundtrack for The Princess and the Frog,
available digitally and in stores on November 23, 2009. The Princess and the
Frog marks the return to traditional hand-drawn 2D animation from the revered
team of John Musker and Ron Clements, with music by Oscar-winning composer Randy
Newman. The Walt Disney Pictures film takes place in New Orleans, whose sounds
of jazz, Zydeco, blues and Gospel present the perfect musical setting for the
film. Multi-platinum, 3-time Grammy Award-winning Def Jam recording artistNe-Yo
contributes "Never Knew I Needed," the featured end credit song of the film. The
soundtrack features performances by Dr. John, the film`s Anika Noni Rose, Jim
Cummings, Keith David, Michael Leon-Wooley, and Jenifer Lewis, with performances
on trumpet by Terence Blanchard. 

Ne-Yo made headlines one year ago when his most recent RIAA platinum album Year
Of The Gentleman debuted at the top of the Soundscan and UK national charts. The
album went on to generate a league-leading total of five Grammy Award
nominations - with its #1 R smash single "Miss Independent" winning in the
Best R Song (songwriters award) and Best Male R Vocal Performance
categories. Year Of The Gentleman followed up Because Of You (released May
2007), which won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R Album, and In My Own
Words (February 2006) - both of which debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 and
R/Hip-Hop Albums charts. 

Academy Award Winner Randy Newman is one of America`s greatest
singer-songwriters and film composers. He began writing songs as a teenager and
became known for his caustic wit and wry turn-of-phrase. This sense of humor and
ironic sense of timing has proved the perfect match for film. Beginning with
1995`s Toy Story, Newman`s work for Walt Disney has helped to create such
beloved films as Monsters, Inc, Toy Story 2 and 3, Cars, and A Bug`s Life.
Nominated an impressive 17 times, Newman won an Oscar in 2002 for "If I Didn`t
Have You" from Monsters, Inc.

Walt Disney Animation Studios presents the musical The Princess and the Frog, an
animated comedy set in the great city of New Orleans. From the creators of The
Little Mermaid and Aladdin comes a modern twist on a classic tale, featuring a
beautiful girl named Tiana (Anika Noni Rose), a frog prince who desperately
wants to be human again, and a fateful kiss that leads them both on a hilarious
adventure through the mystical bayous of Louisiana.

&lt;p&gt;Innovative Proposals by Grantees Will Train New Workers in Weatherization
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and the National Community Action Foundation
(NCAF) announced today they have awarded approximately $4 million in grants to
recipients of the ExxonMobil/NCAF Weatherization Training Partnership program.
The grants will support training for workers to improve energy efficiency of
low-income homes across the nation. 

The grant recipients proposed the most innovative new approaches and
partnerships to enhance training for workers delivering weatherization services
through the Department of Energy`s Weatherization Assistance Program. The
following nine community action agencies from around the country received
grants:

* Action Housing Inc., Pittsburgh, PA 
* Energy Coordinating Agency, Philadelphia, PA 
* Indiana Community Action Association, Indianapolis, IN 
* Community Services Agency, Reno, NV 
* Association for Energy Affordability, Inc., New York, NY 
* Corporation for Ohio Appalachian Development, Athens, OH 
* Community Housing Partners Corporation, Christiansburg, VA 
* Community Action Team Inc., St. Helens, OR 
* Montana Weatherization Training Center at MSU, Bozeman, MT

The announcement was made at the 2009 Community Investment Futures Energy
Conference in St. Petersburg, FL. Final details of individual grants are being
finalized, and grant amounts range from $300,000 to nearly $1 million. The
grants are in addition to a $100,000 demonstration grant awarded by ExxonMobil
and NCAF in August to a group of Ohio agencies who have teamed up to form a
weatherization training partnership. 

"The winners of the ExxonMobil/NCAF grants are combining the expertise of
community action agencies, educators, workforce development experts and the
private sector to give weatherization workers the best tools to help communities
take advantage of one of our greatest resources - energy efficiency," said
Sherman Glass, president of ExxonMobil Refining and Supply Company. "ExxonMobil
is committed to improving energy efficiency in our own operations and around the
world, and today`s grants will extend that commitment to communities in
America." 

"By creating novel training models and building capacity of energy efficiency
programs, today`s recipients are making the country more energy efficient,
helping American workers build careers and supporting community economic
development," said David Bradley, executive director of the National Community
Action Foundation. 

The ExxonMobil/NCAF Partnership Advisory Board reviewed more than 100 letters of
interest from community action agencies across the country. The board selected
nine proposals based on their ability to form meaningful partnerships with
organizations from other sectors, create models that will help prepare
weatherization workers to pursue a career in energy efficiency, and build the
capacity of weatherization programs to achieve the goal of making nearly 750,000
homes more energy efficient as established by the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act. 

ExxonMobil donated $5 million to NCAF to support projects that will expand the
scale and scope of existing training programs so workers are well prepared for
sustainable careers in the growing fields of energy efficiency and
weatherization. ExxonMobil`s grant is the largest private contribution to
community organizations that work with the Department of Energy`s Weatherization
Assistance Program.

benefit from Stantum's best-in-class multi-touch technology.

    "This is good news for existing and future Stantum licensees," said
Stantum CEO Etienne Paillard. "Our pioneering experience, added to a
long-term collaboration with Microsoft, has enabled this native
multi-touch support since the first beta versions of Windows 7. Having
the official logo now paves the way for OEMs considering our unique
multi-touch technology for their future Windows 7-compliant products."

    Stantum's technology enables virtually unlimited touch points, offering an
outstanding experience for the end user and surpassing other multi-touch
technologies, such as AMR (analog matrix resistive) and state-of-the-art
projected-capacitive solutions.

    The Slate PC demonstration platform features a 10.1-inch touch screen and
exemplifies the major benefits of Stantum's multi-touch technology:


--  10 or more simultaneous cursor points;
--  finger and stylus input;
--  finger-pressure detection;
--  low power consumption; and
--  native Windows 7 support, with no driver required.
    

    
Based on the Dell Inspiron Mini netbook platform, the demo is a slate
PC with the multi-touch display screen replacing the keyboard. All
operations -- typing, handwriting, gestures, and classic cursor control
-- are input via the multi-touch screen, enabling an unprecedented user
experience.

    Unlike capacitive multi-touch, Stantum's technology is particularly well
suited to netbook and MID (mobile Internet device) form factors, thanks
to:


--  low solution cost;
--  immunity to EMI issues, enabling an easy coexistence with Wi-Fi or
    Bluetooth antennas around the screen; and
--  passive stylus input and high precision, enabling handwriting
    recognition and empowered Windows 7 interface usability.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft signed a cooperation deal on Tuesday with a big Chinese bank, a potentially major enterprise customer in the country for its financial products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer attended a signing event in Beijing for the deal. Agricultural Bank of China, one of China's four big state-owned banks, will rely on Microsoft products and the U.S. company's global service network as it rolls out projects such as advanced online banking, the companies said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies' vague statement did not disclose a value for the products and services Microsoft will provide, but it suggested a large, long-term deal. The bank plans to spend up to five years upgrading its IT systems, it said. It will work with Microsoft to create an information portal for business clients and a multimedia system for bank operations. The bank has previously worked with Microsoft on online banking, the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few Chinese manage their bank accounts online, but Internet users often shop for everything from makeup to laptops online and make payments through online service providers. Credit cards are rare in the country and many online payments are made directly from a linked bank account or using widely available prepaid cards from companies like China Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - The main rival to Sun's JAVA.O MySQL database has always been Oracle ORCL.O not Microsoft (MSFT.O), the creator of MySQL said, as Europe nears an antitrust decision on Oracle's proposed $7 billion purchase of Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told Oracle last month it had failed to diminish worries that the purchase would hurt competition. The European Union has until January 19 to decide whether it will accept the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle wants a quick resolution because it says that Sun, the fourth-biggest maker of computer servers, is losing $100 million a month as rivals like Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and IBM (IBM.N) poach customers amid uncertainty about the closing of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The largest and the most common rival was Oracle. In every deal we were competing against Oracle," Michael "Monty" Widenius, the founder of MySQL, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle and Sun declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widenius, one of the most respected developers of open-source software, left Sun earlier this year to set up his own small database firm Monty Program Ab, which competes head-to-head with MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion just last year and Oracle has said it does not plan to divest MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global database market is dominated by technology heavyweights Oracle, IBM and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySQL has been a rare major newcomer to the industry -- pushing down prices of databases and their maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widenius said that when large companies start to use MySQL, they usually use it to replace databases running some 60-80 percent of their applications -- creating price pressure also on the databases used for the remaining applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySQL's value to Oracle is much larger than its turnover as it would remove some of the pricing pressure on its own databases, Widenius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySQL pays for the whole Sun acquisition, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle has said it plans to customize its software with Sun's hardware, selling specialized computers and storage devices that offer better performance than ones using hardware and software from other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEN SOURCE WORTH A BILLION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun has lately positioned MySQL as a rival to Microsoft, but Widenius said not one of the large clients use MySQL on Windows, it has always had just a few developers working on Windows, and it has a direct, free rival there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This means that there is very little money to be made on the Windows side for MySQL. They are not going to make a profit there. The big money is on the Linux side where MySQL already successfully competes with Oracle, and where MySQL has put all their efforts during the last 10 years," Widenius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two large European clients of MySQL, who wished not to be quoted due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters they have been switching between Oracle and MySQL databases for their different applications, based on changing business needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also said they are worried about the position of the rival database in the future product roadmap of Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widenius said he was worried his creation could be killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is easier to use and it's cheaper -- if cheapness was be removed, the attractiveness decreases," Widenius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Feinberg, an analyst at Gartner, said that any attempt by Oracle to kill MySQL would fail, as with open source software others could take the code, re-name it and create their own versions, as has happened before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widenius said that while the code could be easily copied, the main problem was the ecosystem around MySQL -- companies making business from it, developing it and using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it would be easy to fork (copy) it, no-one would have paid a billion dollars for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in New York and David Lawsky in San Francisco; editing by Simon Jessop and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DENVER--(Business Wire)--

Company has implemented its Cadence warehouse management software (WMS) in their

industry throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties. Today, Walters` network of

for inventory management, order fulfillment and to guarantee maximum customer
service. 

"The Cadence software provides an excellent platform for managing inventories
with a high volume of unique parts. Electric distributors like Walters store
upwards of 15,000 to 20,000 parts, so the accuracy derived from the Cadence
software is critical to their operation," said Daryl Grove, Vice President of
Professional Services at Cadre.

also integrates to Walters` Activant ERP business solution to provide a seamless
two-way flow of information for sales and purchase orders. This integration
provides continuity throughout the operation and connects critical business
components for Walters. 

"Walters has always believed in investing in technology to improve our company`s
ability to better service customers and drive costs out of the supply chain,"
said Roland Wood at Walters. "By doing so, we can maintain high service levels
and profitability during these difficult recessionary times."

&lt;p&gt;  PHILADELPHIA, PA, Nov 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Halcyon Software, specialist developer of multi-platform automated
operations software, today announced the release of Systems Operations
Suite 3.0, the latest version of its real-time systems assurance,
security auditing and alerting software for the IBM i platform. In
addition to handling IBM i messages, job queues, output queues and
devices for issues or threshold breaches, this new software release
allows for the monitoring of key business applications, supports flexible
scheduling and the proactive monitoring and automatic management of system
events, FTP activity and the security audit journal. Outsourcers,
corporate data centers and end-users will now feel more confident that
their IBM i is running at its full potential and system uptime is
maximized.

    John Dominic, Channel Manager, Halcyon Software, said, "The Systems
Operations Suite empowers system administrators to never be caught off
guard should a server, job, subsystem, critical line, device or other
resource become unavailable as the software automates system assurance. It
alerts administrators to problems, automates the correction process and
outlines what it has done, eliminating repetitions of the same issues,
avoiding late night support calls and significantly reducing manual tasks
and troubleshooting without the need for additional staff. Users can also
avoid unplanned outages by removing points of failure and scheduling
essential system backups and housekeeping tasks, to reflect their business
processes and escalation policies, in a completely unattended
environment."

    This major new release is based on feedback from the Halcyon's User Group
to ensure the Systems Operations Suite continues to address specific and
common operational challenges and the need for organizations to do more
with less resources. For example, the specialist monitoring of business
applications facilitates improved process visibility, greater operational
efficiencies and responsiveness. Automatic monitoring, using specialist
templates, allow critical business applications such as Movex (Lawson M3),
SAP, JD Edwards, Misys, Infor as well as High Availability solutions to be
effectively managed and controlled. The Systems Operations Suite's new
framework enables further integration into other Halcyon specialist tools
so that monitoring of any web-based business applications can now be
achieved.

    The Systems Operations Suite also offers proactive monitoring of the IBM
audit journal (QAUDJRN) for security-related events. Users can monitor for
and see at a glance system value and configuration changes, authority
failures, periods of inactivity, invalid sign-on attempts, specific
commands as well as user profiles that become disabled or are enabled.

    The QSECOFR user profile is the most powerful profile on the system and is
extremely important to control access. By using "rules" system
administrators can create and maintain a secure system. For example,
system administrators can ensure QSECOFR is not left signed on and
inactive for a defined period of time, be alerted to its usage and
monitor what it is being used for.

    With the Systems Operations Suite, the real-time system and message log
monitoring helps manage FTP requests as well as the security audit
journal, the system history log (QHST) and all other IBM i message
queues. By actively monitoring these system logs, system administrators
can see at a glance who executed an FTP transaction, modified a system
value, or the number of objects that were not saved in the most recent
backup. A logged event produces a message, allowing users to define an
action or number of actions including audible alert, SMS, email, advanced
graphical console, or run a command, to handle the message. This helps
protect organizations from actual or attempted security breaches and
allows users to demonstrate real-time monitoring and security alerting to
internal and external auditors.

    To combat downtime and ensure continuous operation of critical IT systems,
the Systems Operations Suite introduces intelligent templates. These
pre-defined templates significantly enhance productivity and facilitate
ease of monitoring for virtually any component, job, subsystem or device
on your system by automating key repetitive tasks and assigning "message
rules" to execute an action or procedure. For example, system
administrators can monitor system or interactive response times and
status, subsystems being inactive at certain times, performance alerting
if customizable system thresholds are met, memory and CPU activity both
overall and on an individual job basis, disk space utilization (ASP%),
cache battery as well as capped and uncapped processors. Additionally,
system administrators can install the software and test the configuration
and updates without affecting their live environment. These features
combined with remote installation means that software can be deployed and
configured within minutes.

    "Providing high quality Managed Support services for our IBM iSeries
customers is critical to NSPI," said Timothy Roe, Director Sales &amp;
Marketing, NSPI. "Our iSeries consultants can leverage the new features
and flexibility of System Operations Suite to obtain a single graphical
view of all systems within our data centers as well as remote systems at
customer locations."

&lt;p&gt;RAVEN Visual Analyzer adds analysis and visualization component to IBM Rational
Requirements Composer solution for Collaborative Requirements Definition


EMERYVILLE, Calif. &amp; AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Ravenflow, the leader in visual requirements definition software, and Ascendant
Technology (Atech), a Premier IBM systems integrator, today announced the
immediate availability of RAVEN Visual Analyzer for IBM Rational Requirements
Composer, a seamless embedded plug-in for IBM Rational Requirements Composer
(RRC) that improves the way stakeholders elicit, specify and validate business
requirements. By visualizing before developing, organizations can dramatically
cut implementation time and delivery cost of the resulting solution. Atech will
be selling RAVEN Visual Analyzer for Rational Requirements Composer as part of
its Requirements Engineering practice. 

"RAVEN Visual Analyzer for Rational Requirements Composer provides the most
cost-effective way for organizations to define and validate the requirements for
creating business applications before the expensive process of developing code,"
said Sam Fatigato, Chief Executive Officer of Ascendant Technology. 

"Ascendant Technology plays a crucial leadership role in applying IBM Rational
technology, as recognized by IBM with the 2009 Rational Beacon Award," said
Susan Boers, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ravenflow. "Atech`s
Software Engineering practice focus surrounding Rational Requirements Composer
and RAVEN Visual Analyzer will support business teams to communicate and
collaborate better with developers to provide maximum leverage in terms of
enabling business-driven development. The combination of both products brings
robust requirements analysis and visualization capabilities to stakeholders." 

IBM Rational Requirements Composer enables visual and textual requirements
definition in a collaborative environment,enabling business and IT stakeholders
to work more closely together as they capture business objectives and define
high quality software requirements. RAVEN Visual Analyzer allows users to
perform the following key functions directly within RRC:

* Automatically generate and insert business-friendly Activity Diagrams into any
of RRC`s requirements editors. 
* Analyze use case narratives, correct any errors, and insert the resulting
Activity Diagram in RRC. 
* Extend RAVEN-generated terms to the Enterprise Glossary that comes with RRC
for better consistency. 
* Highlight errors in process or use case text to help identify missing or
ambiguous requirements. 
* Preview RAVEN Activity Diagrams in a separate window then drag &amp; drop them
into any RRC editor.

RAVEN users report a dramatic reduction in the total time it takes to define and
confirm business requirements with key stakeholders. Instead of weeks and months
business requirements can be defined in just a number of days, accelerating
project schedules while increasing stakeholder confidence that the application
will be delivered as desired. RAVEN also helps produce higher quality
requirements, thereby reducing development costs by minimizing the amount of
rework required downstream. 

As part of the product launch Ascendant Technology and Ravenflow are offering a
series of live webcasts that highlight the new capabilities. Registration for
this webinar series is open at www.ravenflow.com.

and remote IT support/help desk, IT infrastructure planning, custom/offshore

"We expect that this planned acquisition will serve as the launch pad for
expanding our IT/R outsourcing capabilities in China to serve our global
clients," said C.K. Wong, chairman of CDC Global Services. "As part of our
acquisition strategy, Sowell is expected to serve as the platform for rolling up
other Microsoft Technology Centers and expanding our services throughout China.
In addition to Microsoft, Sowell is expected to continue to attract more key
clients, which we believe may include national and local government agencies in
China as well as local and multi-national companies. This is a key part of our
strategy in seeking strategic initiatives that may include acquisitions,
partnerships and investments that will help CDC Global Services grow and
increase its market share in the high growth outsourcing services market. 

"This planned acquisition is part of our strategic initiative to build CDC
Global Services into one of the world`s leading R and IT outsourcing centers
for premier technology companies like Microsoft," said Wong. "CDC Global
Services IT/R operations in China can also help serve the outsourcing needs of
some of CDC Software`s 6,000 customers worldwide. We believe this strategic
initiative will help unlock shareholder value for CDC Corporation shareholders. 

"Notably, this planned acquisition also further strengthens our relationship
with the Nanjing government, and we expect to continue our expansion in this
region. We believe China holds significant growth opportunity for the rapidly
growing market of IT/R outsourcing services. With other future planned
acquisitions like this, as well as partnerships with other software companies,
we expect to be well positioned to become a market leader in IT/R outsourcing
for customers around the world." 

The acquisition of this interest in Sowell is subject to several customary
closing conditions, including the satisfactory completion of due diligence by
CDC Global Services.

&lt;p&gt;International Studies to Evaluate Effects of Dimebon in Combination Therapy: One
in Patients on Background Donepezil, One in Patients on Background Memantine
NEW YORK &amp; SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and Medivation, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDVN) today announced the
initiation of CONTACT and CONSTELLATION, two Phase 3 trials of the
investigational drug dimebon (latrepirdine)* in patients with moderate-to-severe
Alzheimer`s disease (AD). 

The CONTACT study will assess as primary endpoints the potential benefits of
adding dimebon to ongoing treatment with donepezil HCI tablets, the leading AD
medication worldwide, on neuropsychiatric symptoms and activities of daily
living. The CONSTELLATION study will evaluate as primary endpoints the effects
of adding dimebon to memantine HCI, another standard of care, on cognition,
memory and activities of daily living. 

"Alzheimer`s disease is a growing global epidemic with an unmet clinical need.
Many patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer`s disease experience behavioral
and neuropsychiatric symptoms, which are among the leading causes of placement
in care facilities for these patients," said Pierre N. Tariot, MD, director of
the Memory Disorders Center at the Banner Alzheimer`s Institute and study
investigator. "These studies are intended to evaluate the potential added
benefits of dimebon in combination with current standards of Alzheimer`s care." 

In preclinical studies, dimebon has been shown to protect brain cells from
damage and enhance brain cell survival, potentially by stabilizing and improving
mitochondrial function. The dimebon mechanism is distinct from currently
available AD medications. 

"Pfizer and Medivation are committed to developing dimebon as a treatment that
may meaningfully improve the lives of patients across the full spectrum of
Alzheimer`s disease severity," said Lynn Seely, M.D., chief medical officer for
Medivation. "The initiation of the CONTACT and CONSTELLATION studies is an
important milestone in the broad clinical development of dimebon." 

These studies are part of a comprehensive Phase 3 clinical development program,
currently consisting of seven trials, to assess the safety and efficacy of
dimebon across all stages of Alzheimer`s disease, as monotherapy and in
combination with currently available Alzheimer`s treatments, and in Huntington
disease. 

*Latrepirdine is the proposed generic (nonproprietary) name for dimebon. 

About the CONTACT Study

This Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will enroll
approximately 600 patients with moderate-to-severe AD and neuropsychiatric
symptoms at approximately 75 sites in Europe and South America. Patients who are
already taking donepezil will be randomized to also receive either dimebon 20 mg
three times daily or placebo for six months. 

The CONTACT study is designed to assess patients` behavioral difficulties and
their ability to perform routine activities of daily living. Behavior will be
measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), while self-care and daily
function will be measured by the Alzheimer`s Disease Cooperative Study -
Activities of Daily Living (severe) (ADCS-ADLsev). Secondary endpoints include
measures of cognition, memory, global function, pharmacoeconomic impact, quality
of life and safety and tolerability. 

For more information about the CONTACT study, please visit www.ContactStudy.com
or email contactstudy@medivation.com. 

About the CONSTELLATION Study

This Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will enroll
approximately 570 patients with moderate-to-severe AD at approximately 80 sites
in the United States, Canada and Europe. Patients already taking memantine will
be randomized to also receive either dimebon 20 mg three times daily or placebo
for six months. 

The CONSTELLATION study will evaluate the potential benefits of adding dimebon
to ongoing memantine therapy on cognition, memory and activities of daily
living. Cognition and memory will be measured by the Severe Impairment Battery
(SIB), while self-care and daily function will be measured by the Alzheimer`s
Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (severe) (ADCS-ADLsev).
Secondary endpoints include measures of cognitive and behavioral symptoms,
global function, resource utilization, quality of life, safety and tolerability.

About Alzheimer`s Disease

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive degenerative brain disorder that gradually
destroys a person's memory and ability to learn, reason, make judgments,
communicate and carry out daily activities. As the disease progresses, patients
may experience changes in personality and behavior, such as delusions,
hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. 

About the Pfizer/Medivation Dimebon Collaboration

Medivation and Pfizer have a global collaboration to develop and commercialize
dimebon for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington disease. Under
the terms of the agreement, the companies are working in partnership to advance
the Phase 3 development program with the goal of submitting a new drug
application to the FDA and bringing dimebon to market in the United States. In
addition, pending FDA approval, Medivation will co-promote dimebon to specialty
physicians in the U.S. Pfizer has responsibility for development, regulatory and
commercialization outside of the U.S.

&lt;p&gt; (Refiles to add Masters' first name in third paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * EcoSecurities buy to help JPM clients manage price risks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * JPM commods head "happy" even if just pre-2012 portfolio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * New EcoSecurities CEO to be named soon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * EcoSecurities will not be integrated into JP Morgan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michael Szabo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - JP Morgan's JPM.M acquisition of
clean energy project developer EcoSecurities ECO.L will help
its clients manage commodity price risks, even if the investment
has a shelf life of only three years, JP Morgan's head of global
commodities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A 105 pence per share offer by Carbon Acquisition Company, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of JP Morgan, was declared unconditional
on Monday after reaching shareholder acceptances of over 80
percent. The offer values EcoSecurities at 129 million pounds
($211 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blythe Masters said the decision to buy EcoSecurities was
based on its large pre-2012 portfolio of carbon offsets
(estimated in August at around 100 million tonnes), its
post-2012 portfolio (around 125 million) and any upside
associated with a surge in carbon prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even if only the first source of value inherent in our
valuation of the company, i.e. its pre-2012 portfolio, were the
only thing to come forth we would end up being very happy with
our acquisition," Masters said in an interview late on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EcoSecurities invests in clean energy projects registered
under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with the Kyoto Protocol set to expire at the end of
2012, investors, already shaken by the global economic downturn,
are moving to the sidelines while policymakers scramble to agree
a successor treaty. [ID:nLN276794]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under this $6.5 billion CDM, companies invest in projects in
emerging nations like China and India, and receive offset
credits called Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) that can be
sold for profit to firms looking to meet emissions targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CER prices CER/RTR hit a 2009 high of nearly 14 euros
($20.68) a tonne last Friday, but are still well below their
all-time high of over 23 euros hit in July 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RISK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Masters said the acquisition would help JP Morgan clients
better manage risks in fluctuating commodity prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The reason for our expanding in the carbon space is
consistent with our overall thesis that commodity markets as a
whole will continue to be extremely active and volatile ... as a
function of economic activity and other policies," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Carbon is just a part (of JP Morgan's business model), and
an important component because of its linkages to the rest of
the energy complex and to various regulatory changes going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Masters said a new EcoSecurities CEO will be named soon,
"and from there we will review the overall structure of the
company to make sure we don't have any overlapping activities
that are confusing to clients".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current CEO Bruce Usher may be replaced by EcoSecurities'
Chief Operating Officer Adrian Fernando, who, according to a
company spokesman, has been assuming responsibilities for the
coordination of company operations since joining in Oct. 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike Climate Care, a voluntary carbon offset company JP
Morgan acquired in March 2008, Masters said EcoSecurities will
not be integrated into the company and will continue to exist
under its own brand name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Masters also said although United Nations-sponsored talks in
Copenhagen in December to agree a successor to Kyoto will likely
fail, the key will be climate legislation in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No matter what happens in Copenhagen, the key space to
watch will be the U.S. legislative process," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's hard to imagine anything meaningful or binding coming
out of Copenhagen without the U.S. having undertaken domestic
legislation. That will not have happened before Copenhagen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is
currently reviewing a climate bill that would require U.S.
manufacturers, utilities and refineries to reduce their carbon
pollution output 20 percent by 2020, from 2005 levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the House of Representatives having passed a similar
bill in June, the Senate bill now faces harsh opposition from
Republicans who claim it will hurt consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect there will be climate legislation impacting the
U.S. at some point," Masters said. "We don't believe it will be
before 2010 and it could be as late as 2011 if things get bogged
down with midterm elections."

fast, flexible and easy comparisons of Microsoft PowerPoint
presentations. For the first time, PowerPoint users have an easy and
intuitive way to track and manage edits made in PowerPoint slides --
whether it is changes made by collaborators and reviewers, or within
various versions of a presentation made by one individual.

    With an estimated 30 million presentations created every day, Workshare
Compare for PowerPoint provides users an easy way to identify slides and
slide elements that have been modified, deleted, or inserted. Users can
initiate a comparison directly within the PowerPoint interface to identify

    Whether comparing and identifying the differences in small presentations
or those with 1000+ slides, Workshare Compare for PowerPoint provides
ease of use and flexibility with multiple slide views, custom comparison
themes, and reporting options that provide a complete history of changes.
And after identifying the differences between presentations, Workshare
Compare for PowerPoint enables users to easily combine slides from
different versions into a single master presentation.

    For more than ten years Workshare has provided the leading comparison
software for Microsoft Word. Workshare has now applied its technology and
expertise to PowerPoint presentation slides. For employees and consultants
familiar with the nightmare of reviewing, editing and comparing large and
complicated PowerPoint slide decks, the Workshare solution saves time,
avoids mistakes, reduces frustration and allows users to spend more time
producing high quality presentations.

    "When I first heard there was a new product that tells you what changes
have been made to a PowerPoint file I could not believe my ears," said
Diane Raabe, a Senior Associate at a top four accounting firm. "Workshare
Compare for PowerPoint is a dream come true."

    "We know users have been looking for a way to manage collaborative
versions of PowerPoint slide decks for almost as long as Microsoft has
been offering PowerPoint and now for the first time a really efficient
application is available to make that possible," says John Grillos,
Senior Vice President of Marketing. "This product offers every PowerPoint
user a better way to manage and build presentations. And because users
can easily configure the software to meet their particular needs, this is
a very flexible solution which delivers significant time savings."

presentation

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co said on Tuesday it will invest $7 million in forest conservation projects in the Amazon, Congo and United States as part of its effort to reduce emissions, waste and energy use as a corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is slashing the price of its Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS) by a third as it debuts the service in 15 new countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft executive also touted BPOS' momentum, while questioning figures trumpeted by Google for its rival Google Apps suite .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPOS, which includes Web-hosted versions of Microsoft's Exchange e-mail, SharePoint collaboration, and other Office communication-related apps, now costs $10 per user per month, down from $15 per user per month. Microsoft also expanded the hosted storage limit to 25 GB per user, from the prior 10 GB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year after its official launch , BPOS is being used by 1 million paid customers, Microsoft announced on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Capossela, senior vice-president of the information worker product management group at Microsoft, told Computerworld on Monday that 70% of those users "are coming from IBM Lotus Notes or Novell GroupWise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is a wonderful figure, because it means we are getting new business, not just migrating existing business to the cloud," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has been also been bragging about its success at winning new business. It said last month that it now had 20 million active users for its Google Apps at 2 million companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters report that number includes millions of college students using a free version of Google Apps , which lists for $50 a year (about $4 per month) per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capossela said Microsoft also has millions of users for its free Live@Edu service, but said the company doesn't include them in its BPOS subscriber totals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a really hard time understanding their [Google's] numbers," he said. "You simply don't know what their paying user numbers are. Analysts predict that they are pretty small. It's hard for us to really know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what he thought of Google's high-profile win of the City of Los Angeles for a 5-year, $7.25 million deal to use Google Apps, he said, "I feel like we are winning lots and lots of deals. We can't spend too much time worrying about what they [Google] are doing. I feel good about how much progress we've made in a short period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To securely serve LA's 30,000 employees, Google is building a special version of its Google Apps service to be called GovCloud. It will offer extra security and be hosted on separate Google servers so that the city's data is not co-mingled with data from other companies. GovCloud will also be certified under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capossela said that Microsoft already had allowed larger customers (those with 5,000 employees or more) to have their data stored on separate servers through the BPOS Dedicated service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is seeking the ISO 27001 security certification for its data centers. It has "nothing to announce yet" regarding FISMA credentialing, Capossela said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reassuring customers worried by the T-Mobile Sidekick data outage that occurred on Microsoft's data centers, Capossela said Microsoft is "taking this very seriously and trying to learn from it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said recent executive departures in Microsoft's online services group, including chief Debra Chrapaty , are not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A couple of people internally have taken over her duties. We have a fantastically deep talent bench," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is officially starting this week to offer service in Singapore, while starting to trial service in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Poland, Romania and Taiwan. It also plans to offer the service commercially to India by the year's end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides cutting the price of the BPOS suite, Microsoft is cutting the price for most individual components. Exchange Online was reduced from $10 to $5 per user per month; SharePoint Online from $7.25 to $5.25 per user per month; Office Communications Online from $2.50 to $2 per user per month; Deskless Worker Suite from $3 to $2 per user per month; and Office Live Meeting will cost the same, $4.50 per user per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routinely accused of bloating Windows and Office, Microsoft Corp. has acted more like a skinny teenage boy with enterprise apps like SQL Server: desperate to bulk up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King of the middleweight databases, SQL Server has yet to be fully accepted by the big boys, admits Bob Muglia, president of Microsoft's Server  Tools division. "Really large data warehouses and extremely large scale-up apps are the last high-end problems" remaining for SQL Server, Muglia said in a keynote at the Professional Association of SQL Server (PASS) users' conference in Seattle on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, Microsoft announced plans to add heft to SQL Server. On Monday, it added some detail when it announced two new versions for when SQL Server 2008 R2 ships by the middle of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is a Datacenter edition aimed at companies needing to scale-up their online transaction processing (OLTP). Used in conjunction with Windows Server 2008 R2, the Datacenter version can support up to 256 logical processors (physical CPUs multiplied by the number of threads they can support) and what Microsoft claims is "unlimited virtualization" . It also supports complex event processing (CEP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other is a new Parallel Data Warehouse version that can immediately support tens to hundreds of terabytes of data in clusters scaling out to about 24 nodes , according to senior vice-president, Ted Kummert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That still pales compared to companies like Teradata Corp., which released a 50-petabyte data warehousing appliance last fall .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Microsoft can only claim one SQL Server data warehouse in the petabyte range .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, said Kummert, "Our intent is to build data warehouses of all sizes, including well over 100TB."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future plans include enabling parallelized SQL Server data warehousing clusters of 100 nodes, according to Fausto Ibarra, director of product management, SQL Server, as well as working with partners to optimize SQL Server for servers using solid-state disks (SSDs) for storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with increased capabilities comes an increase in price for SQL Server, though only slightly and only for some customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The per-processor price for SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard edition will go to $7,500 from $6,000, while the enterprise price will increase to $28,800 from 25,000. Kummert pointed out that most customers buy SQL Server via server and client access licenses (CALs), which do not change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the two new versions, SQL Server, including the cloud-based SQL Azure version , now comes in 10 flavors . That's not quite as many as a certain ice cream store, but is still hard for many customers to keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQL Azure remains on track to begin official service by year's end. Rather than cannibalizing SQL Server's business on the low-end, "I think of SQL Azure as giving customers flexibility and freedom of choice," Kummert said. He vowed to "move pretty aggressively" to add features and power to the hosted service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another threat to SQL Server on the low-end is the MySQL database owned by Oracle Corp. Some open-source figures suggest that Microsoft would benefit if the European Commission decides to block Oracle's merger with Sun Microsystems due to antitrust fears related to its ownership of MySQL. There's also been talk that Microsoft might be in the market to buy it if Oracle were forced to divest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kummert declined to comment on the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

gotten key central government approval ahead of a planned visit
by U.S. president Barack Obama this month [ID:nN03523281].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They did not release a shareholding structure for the park,
and the plan still faces more detailed talks between Disney and
Shanghai officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The People's Daily, the Communist Party's most important
newspaper, said on Thursday that an investment company owned by
the municipal government would hold 57 percent of the park, while
Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) would take 43 percent. It cited informed
sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is expected that the costs of acquiring land and moving
existing residents will reach 24 billion yuan ($3.52 billion), in
line with the cost of a park in Hong Kong that has struggled with
lower-than-expected attendance since it opened in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has long sought to build in Shanghai, a wealthy city
of about 19 million people that is ringed by the prosperous
Yangtze Delta, home to tens of millions more potential visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was less enthusiastic about building near Beijing, a much
less prosperous city with few other large population centers in
the immediate vicinity.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS Nov 4 (Reuters) - A bailiff inspected Disneyland
Paris on Wednesday to investigate allegations that recruitment
policies discriminated against staff who were not white but
found no evidence to support them, a Disneyland spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The inspection, ordered by a court in Meaux, outside Paris,
follows a report by anti-racism campaign group SOS Racisme,
accusing Euro Disney (EDLP.PA) of discriminating against people
who were not white when recruiting "cast members" for its
Disneyland Paris resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We can confirm that on the morning of Wednesday, November
4, a bailiff visited the site of Disneyland Paris to inspect
personnel documents and the Disneyland Paris recruitment site,"
the Disneyland Paris spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Following these inspections, the bailiff declared that he
had found no document or file of an ethnic or racial character,"
he said, adding that the resort did not select staff on the
basis of their racial or ethnic origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the report issued on Wednesday, SOS Racisme detailed a
series of practices which it said discriminated against people
of African, Caribbean or Arab origin looking for work at
Disneyland Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's policies, according to the group, were based
on the assumption that as most of the customers were white
Europeans, most of the staff should be of the same origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report also named several other bodies including
companies and public housing organisations in a broad attack on
what it said was the widespread practice of "ethnic filtering"
in selection for jobs and housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOS Racisme also said that on the Disneyland Paris
recruitment website, the resort required candidates to choose a
nationality from a drop-down menu that included sub-categories
of French people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The menu included several of France's overseas territories
like Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean and La Reunion
in the Indian Ocean as if they were separate nationalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People from those islands, of whom the majority are black,
are full French citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Disneyland Paris spokesman rejected the charges, saying
that the company noted the geographical origin of staff as part
of a standard annual report companies drew up on staff issues
like living conditions, training, pay and social charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The elements noted in the SOS Racisme report...can be quite
easily explained once they are put in context," he said, adding
that staff from overseas territories were identified because
they were covered by special travel cost regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; France has very strict laws banning the classification of
staff by ethnic origin.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Wednesday it is cutting a further 800 jobs across its operations, on top of 5,000 jobs already eliminated under a plan to reduce costs that was announced in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the world's largest software firm said the latest job cuts are spread across the company's global operations, but about 200 are in and around its headquarters in Redmond, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft originally had planned to cut 5,000 jobs, or about 5 percent out of 96,000, before June 2010. The Microsoft spokesman said that plan has been expanded with the new layoffs and is now complete, well ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of October 23, Microsoft had 91,005 employees worldwide, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Gerald E.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Marathon Beats, Production Up

Marathon Oil Corporation`s (NYSE: MRO) third-quarter 2009 results came in
better-than-expected, helped by the contribution from increased oil and natural
gas production. Earnings per share, excluding mark-to-market and divestment
losses, came in at 61 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. 

However, as has been the case with the other oil majors that have already
reported -- Exxon (NYSE: XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and Chevron (NYSE:
CVX) -- earnings and revenue comparisons with the year-earlier period were quite
ugly, severely hampered by lower realized commodity prices and weak refining
margins. Marathon`s adjusted earnings per share plunged 77.9%, while sales
declined 37.9% to $14.5 billion. 

Income from the upstream segment totaled $491 million during the quarter, down
43.5% from the year-ago level. 

The company reported production (available for sale) of 393,000 oil-equivalent
barrels per day (BOE/d), slightly below its interim guidance last month.
However, this represents a 5% year-over-year production growth, reflecting the
timing of international oil liftings. 

Lower realized oil and natural gas prices offset the upstream volume gains.
Marathon's worldwide realized crude oil price (from continuing operations) of
$64.12 per barrel was 42.1% below the year-earlier level, while natural gas
realizations (also from continuing operations) dropped 56.8% to $2.20 per
thousand cubic feet (Mcf). 

Enterprise Raises Dividend

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD) reported its third quarter
earnings per limited partners unit at 43 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus
Estimate and year-ago earnings of 49 cents. Before adjusting one-time items,
earnings per limited partner unit reached 36 cents. 

Importantly, Enterprise increased its quarterly distribution by 5.7%
year-over-year to the annualized run rate of $2.21 per unit. This was the 21st
consecutive quarterly distribution increase. Following the merger, Enterprise
and TEPPCO generated distributable cash flow of $359 million and $43 million,
respectively, in the quarter. Total distributable cash flow (DCF) for Enterprise
and TEPPCO provided 1.03X distribution coverage. 

Revenue for the quarter decreased nearly 27% year-over-year to $4.6 billion, due
primarily to lower commodity prices. However, gross operating margin increased
more than 17% to $561 million, driven by volume growth and strong natural gas
processing margins.

&lt;p&gt;
             Film to Play in Record Number of IMAX(R) Theatres
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 4, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMAX Corporation (Nasdaq:IMAX)
(TSX:IMX) and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures today announced that Disney's
A Christmas Carol, the spectacular Disney Digital 3D(TM) holiday release from
director Robert Zemeckis and starring Jim Carrey, will open in a record 181
IMAX(R) theatres domestically on November 6, 2009 and 57 IMAX theatres
internationally starting on November 5th, 2009. Disney's A Christmas Carol: An
IMAX 3D Experience has been digitally re-mastered into the unparalleled image
and sound quality of The IMAX Experience(R) with proprietary IMAX DMR(R)
(Digital Re-mastering) technology.

Commenting on the announcement, Mark Zoradi, president, Walt Disney Studios
Motion Pictures Group, said, "Seeing Disney's A Christmas Carol in IMAX(R) 3D is
the ultimate way to experience this extraordinary motion picture from acclaimed
filmmaker Robert Zemeckis. With its enormous screens, incredible sound, and
crystal clear imagery, moviegoers will feel like they're actually in the
Victorian world of Scrooge and the other classic Dickens' characters. 'Disney's
A Christmas Carol' takes the Disney Digital 3D experience to a delightful new
level of enjoyment, and the IMAX 3D engagements take that experience to the
maximum. Audiences are going to love seeing Jim Carrey and this wonderful cast
as they bring this holiday classic to life as never before."

"Robert Zemeckis has consistently delivered brilliant content that is ideally
suited to IMAX 3D and we're certainly looking forward to this next big 3D
adventure," said IMAX CEO Richard L. Gelfond. "Our growing theatre network
enables us to reach the widest audience ever for an IMAX opening, which is very
encouraging given the tremendous buzz surrounding the film."

"This film brings together the extraordinary talents of Robert Zemeckis, who is
a true 3D visionary, the marketing savvy of Disney, our friend Jim Carrey and
The IMAX Experience to create a major motion picture Holiday event," added Greg
Foster, Chairman and President of IMAX Filmed Entertainment. "We're very excited
to kick off the holiday season with this highly anticipated 3D movie that is
sure to transport IMAX audiences right into the classic Dickens tale with a cool
2009 edge."

Robert Zemeckis' takes the art of performance capture to the next level with
Disney's A Christmas Carol. This multi-sensory 3D motion picture captures the
fantastical essence of the classic Dickens tale in a groundbreaking motion
picture event. Ebeneezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) begins the Christmas holiday with
his usual miserly contempt, barking at his faithful clerk (Gary Oldman), and his
cheery nephew (Colin Firth). But when the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and
Yet to Come (all played by Carrey) take him on an eye-opening journey revealing
truths Old Scrooge is reluctant to face, he must open his heart to undo years of
ill will before it's too late.

Disney's A Christmas Carol: An IMAX 3D Experience is scheduled to open at the
following IMAX(R) Theatres beginning November 6th.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) in a bid to buy $3 billion in tax credits from mortgage giant Fannie Mae, the Wall Street Journal's website reported, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday the Journal reported that Goldman, the largest and most profitable U.S. investment bank, is in talks to buy millions of dollars of tax credits from Fannie Mae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department, which controls Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after pouring $100 million into the housing-finance giants, may block the sale on the grounds that it wouldn't benefit taxpayers, WSJ said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sales would come as the public rails against government moves that aid banking giants, which are preparing to lavish big bonuses about a year after receiving trillions in taxpayer rescue funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which received federal bailout money last fall, in particular has come under fire for generating out-sized profits and preparing record bonuses as the economy continues to struggle. Buffett injected $5 billion into Goldman last fall through purchases of preferred stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credits are worth little to Fannie Mae, which also records losses each quarter as their value declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway and Goldman could not be reached immediately for comment. Treasury officials told the paper they are still reviewing the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax credits are incentives designed to bring more investment to low-income housing developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt; * Two former bankers also charged in Alabama case&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Jefferson County faces multibillion dollar debt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * JP Morgan is county's main creditor
 (Revises first paragraph, adds JP Morgan statement, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Melinda Dickinson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov 4 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc. (JPM.N) reached agreement for more than $720 million with
the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle charges in an
unlawful payment scheme in the sewer financing of Jefferson
County, Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank will pay $75 million and forfeit more than $647
million it claimed in bond swap termination fees, the U.S.
agency announced in Washington on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The settlement could have a big impact on the county's debt
of around $4 billion, of which the bank was the largest
creditor. The debt threatens to force the county into the
biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC said the bank would pay a penalty of $25 million
and would pay $50 million to the county, which includes
 Birmingham, Alabama's largest city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferson County accumulated its debts earlier this decade
through swap and other bond deals to finance improvements to
its sewer system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swaps are derivatives that are intended to lower interest
rate costs but can turn against the user if rates move higher
unexpectedly. The debt spiraled in February 2008 when ratings
agencies downgraded the county's bond insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OUTSTANDING BONDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said it was pleased to have reached a settlement
with the SEC, noting that the charges principally relate to
municipal derivatives transactions that occurred six or seven
years ago in a business now discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The settlement does not impair any outstanding Jefferson
County bonds, and J.P. Morgan continues to work to achieve a
responsible restructuring of Jefferson County's financial
affairs," it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC also charged two former managing directors at
JPMorgan Securities, Charles LeCroy and Douglas MacFaddin, with
making more than $8 million in undisclosed payments to close
friends of "certain" Jefferson County commissioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In connection with the payments, the county commissioners
voted to select J.P. Morgan Securities as managing underwriter
of the bond offerings and its affiliated bank as swap provider
for the transactions," the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "J.P. Morgan Securities did not disclose any of the
payments or conflicts of interest in the swap confirmation
agreements or bond offering documents, yet passed on the cost
of the unlawful payments by charging the county higher interest
rates on the swap transactions," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bankers, who have not settled with the SEC, made
unlawful payments to win business and earn fees, Robert
Khuzami, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A county official welcomed the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Jefferson County's situation is greatly enhanced and
appears to be improving every minute," County Commission
President Bettye Fine Collins told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Collins wrote to the SEC in March asking that Jefferson
County be included in any action taken against JP Morgan and
said Wednesday she was satisfied with the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week former Birmingham mayor Larry Langford was
convicted on federal fraud and corruption charges involving
bond swap transactions he made earlier this decade when
president of the county commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC previously charged Langford in a parallel case.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has decided to pull the trigger on its most significant refresh of the MSN homepage in almost ten years. There is one huge problem with the new design that I just can't believe: I actually like the new MSN. Ever since I installed Vista and, soon after, swore to never say another kind word about Microsoft along comes this new MSN look. (I haven't installed Windows 7 yet)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new MSN, now in beta preview, is less customizable, but also less cluttered than iGoogle, and MSN is more streamlined and easier to use than the newly redesigned Yahoo homepage.  So the new MSN isn't perfect, but it's pretty good as online portals go.  Here's what I like, and what I think should be improved with the new MSN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook and Twitter Integration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the popularity of Facebook and Twitter, it's no surprise that one of the major additions to the new MSN would be the integration of both. The Facebook widget is pretty good, and gives you the basic status and account updates you'd expect from an external Facebook notifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSN's Twitter integration, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired.  If you're going to include Twitter on your homepage, you should at least make it function like a barebones Twitter client similar to something like TwitterFox (now Echofon) or the Flock browser's Twitter sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSN doesn't have any significant Twitter functionality; instead it's basically a Twitter message viewer with the option to update your own status.  Lacking basic things like an optional column view of "@reply" or direct messages, or even the ability to respond to tweets with an "@reply" button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other problem is the Twitter feed doesn't update automatically, and requires you to manually update instead.  One final quibble: if you're typing in an update, you can't navigate away to copy a URL.  If you do, MSN's Twitter client will reset itself and you'll have to re-type your message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotmail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E-mail integration is of course an obvious feature for the new MSN, but I'd like to see the option to view more than just Hotmail.  This will probably change when the new MSN officially rolls out early next year, according to All Things D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local Weather and News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new MSN has a great seciton for local news and weather, which is another obvious, yet great addition.  But I'd like the option to automatically set this section based on my computer's surrounding wireless access points, the way Google's My Location feature does.  That would be a great option to automatically update you on your new surroundings when traveling, but I'd want to be able to manually change the local settings in case I want to keep an eye on things back home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Microsoft on a roll?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these quibbles, I have to say I'm impressed with MSN's new design. I like the overall functionality of the new site, and its clean look is a welcome change from the bloated 90s-style version of the current MSN.  Microsoft also says it plans to roll out the new clean look across its other MSN properties over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of hating Microsoft's online presence, and loving Google's, I'm slowly being won over by Redmond's new products.  With MSN's new redesign rolling out early next year, the ability to sync files across multiple computers with Windows Live Sync for both Mac and PC, 25GB of free online storage with SkyDrive, a revamped search engine and the upcoming Microsoft Office Web Apps, there's really only one thing keeping me away from jumping to Microsoft services full time, and that's email.  Gmail is simply far more functional and customizable than Hotmail, and I don't see that changing any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/181383&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Nov 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on
Wednesday it is cutting a further 800 jobs across its
operations, on top of 5,000 jobs already eliminated under a
plan to reduce costs that was announced in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for the world's largest software firm said the
latest job cuts are spread across the company's global
operations, but about 200 are in and around its headquarters in
Redmond, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft originally had planned to cut 5,000 jobs, or
about 5 percent out of 96,000, before June 2010. The Microsoft
spokesman said that plan has been expanded with the new layoffs
and is now complete, well ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of Oct. 23, Microsoft had 91,005 employees worldwide,
according to its website.

&lt;p&gt;HERMES SoftLab Management Pack for Citrix XenServer Helps Enhance Citrix

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. &amp; LJUBLJANA, Slovenia--(Business Wire)--
HERMES SoftLab, a ComTrade company, today announced that its Management Pack

Citrix XenServer has successfully passed a series of tests established by Citrix
to work effectively and add value on top of the XenServer virtualization
platform. 

HERMES SoftLab MP for Citrix XenServer unifies the monitoring of your
XenServer-based infrastructure with the rest of the IT estate around a single
Microsoft System Center Operations Manager enterprise console. Immediately after
the dependencies between pools, hosts, VMs, and storage have been
auto-discovered and visualized, the operations monitoring staff can take over
routine day-to-day supervision tasks and resolve situations when, for example,
an overloaded host or VM is detected, or when shared storage utilization runs
high. XenServer experts can further use the historical performance information
to optimize resource utilization and better understand and resolve those hidden
bottlenecks, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the XenServer environment.
Last but not least, the non-invasive agent-less approach guarantees ease of
deployment and environmental stability. Citrix Ready products are featured in an
online catalog at www.citrixready.com, and carry the Citrix Ready logo.

Citrix Ready e-marketplace."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft celebrated its 20th year in Taiwan by agreeing to open a joint cloud computing center with the island's economics ministry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The center will be a first for Microsoft in Asia. It aims to give Taiwanese computer makers a place to test out new hardware and software made to work with Microsoft products, including new cloud computing applications and services, a joint statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies in Taiwan have already started developing new hardware for the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quanta Computer, the world's largest contract notebook computer manufacturer, plans to launch its first cloud computing products next year, including thin clients and other devices. The company has been working with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop new cloud computing and mobile technologies, a partnership called Project T-Party. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few other details of the new Microsoft center were immediately available. There was no information on where the center will be built, how many engineers will work there nor the size of the investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer praised Taiwan and said the cloud computing center is aimed at continuing the strong relationship between Microsoft and Taiwanese companies built over the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wouldn't have low-cost, high-availability computing today if it wasn't for companies here," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese telecommunications company Chunghwa Telecom also signed on with Microsoft on Wednesday to adopt the Windows Azure cloud services operating system, and to offer cloud services such as Microsoft Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Office Live Meeting and Office Communications Online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system has been doing well in the market since it launched nearly two weeks ago, Microsoft executives said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've heard positive things from our partners," said Steve Guggenheimer, vice president for OEM sales at Microsoft, on the sidelines of a news conference in Taipei. He said it's too early to say what Windows 7 sales look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The much anticipated OS went to market on Oct. 22, installed in a range of desktop and laptop PCs. Manufacturers around the world had been working overtime to ready devices for the launch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the global recession has caused people to question how Windows 7 sales have been since the launch. Growth has returned to many countries, including a 3.5 percent increase in third quarter GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in the U.S., but many economists say a full recovery will take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said the new OS will take over quickly among consumers, while in businesses he expects steady growth. "The overall response to Windows 7 has been positive," he said during a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Windows OSs have lost market share over the past several months to Apple, according to data tracker Net Applications. Microsoft's share of the OS market dropped to 92.55 percent at the end of October, compared to 93.66 percent in January. Apple's share has increased to 5.27 percent from 4.71 percent. Linux and other OSs make up the remainder of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have also been signs the PC industry is slowing down, which could hurt Windows 7. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acer, the world's second largest PC vendor, complained of component shortages in the third quarter that hampered its ability to bring products to market. Executives at the company said their third quarter shipments would have been better had they had the right materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the world's major PC contract manufacturers revised their shipment targets for the fourth quarter down compared to previous estimates, notes Jenny Lai, research analyst at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets, in a report from Monday. Guidance was cut by around 5 percent for the fourth quarter, she wrote. Shipments in the first quarter of next year could drop 10 percent to 15 percent, worse than expected, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the companies blame the target revision to component shortages, especially those in DDR2 (double data rate, second generation) memory, optical disk drive pick up heads and high-end MLCC capacitors," she wrote, adding that the "component shortage is real but in our view is not the only reason." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One additional reason is the expected launch of new Intel microprocessors in the first quarter, she said, noting that people might put off new PC purchases until the new chips are inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's decision to reduce the number of annoying security messages that Windows 7 delivers when users install software makes the new operating system more vulnerable to malware infection than Vista, a researcher said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"UAC was neutered too much by Microsoft," argued Chester Wisniewski, a senior security advisory with Sophos, talking about Windows' Users Account Control (UAC), the security feature Microsoft debuted with Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UAC prompts users for their consent before allowing tasks such as program and device driver installation to take place. In an effect to quash user complaints -- which had condemned the constant intrusions -- Microsoft modified UAC so it appears less frequently in Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't a good idea, said Wisniewski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to know if UAC was going to be effective in Windows 7," he said. "So we grabbed the next 10 [malware] samples that came in and tried them out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10 samples, most of them Trojan horses, were loaded onto a clean Windows 7 PC that lacked antivirus software, simulating payloads that an actual exploit would deposit on a compromised computer. Wisniewski then ran each piece of malware, as if a user had been duped into launching a file attachment or had surfed to a malicious site and been victimized by an drive-by attack and subsequent silent download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 10 samples, two would not run under Windows 7 -- not surprising since they were likely designed to execute on the far-more-common Windows XP and Vista -- and only one of the remaining eight triggered an UAC prompt, said Wisniewski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that the test was quick-and-dirty, and didn't accurately portray how secure Windows 7 was overall, or even how well it would withstand attack if protected by antivirus software, even basic programs like Microsoft's free Security Essentials . The point was to see how much Windows 7's reconfigured UAC would help block malware that made it past security software or got by other defensive measures of the operating system, like DEP (Data Execution Protection) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"UAC is really not protecting users properly," Wisniewski said. "Frankly, people should turn it back into the more aggressive mode, like Vista," he said, speaking of the ability to set the feature's prompting frequency. "And if you find it annoying, you might just as well turn it off, because otherwise it's not doing any good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UAC's effectiveness has been questioned before. Last February, for instance, a developer for a Virginia-based company that sells secure messaging software to the U.S. government and a well-known blogger claimed that a change to UAC 7 could be exploited by attackers to secretly disable the feature. Microsoft first denied that it was a bug, saying instead that it was by design, but then backpedaled and promised to fix the problem .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings is not taking rating actions on J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2007-LDP10, commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates as a result of interest shortfalls currently being incurred by the
trust. 

Classes A-JS through H-S and classes J through NR incurred interest shortfalls
for the October 2009 remittance. Of the total $1.6 million in current
shortfalls, approximately $950,000 are the result of non-recoverable advances
related to the Pelican Point loan, currently in special servicing. The advance
recoveries are expected to continue for two additional months through December
2009 but are ultimately recoverable; class A-JS is expected to recover
shortfalls in January 2010. 

The Pelican Point loan was modified by the special servicer and brought current.
Ongoing interest shortfalls of approximately $215,000 per month are expected as
the modification included a reduction in the interest rate to 3%. After the
advance recovery, interest shortfalls to junior classes will be ongoing during
the loan's remaining term. Ultimate losses due to these shortfalls are expected
as the modification does not require the borrower to reimburse the trust for the
interest rate differential. 

The trust is also incurring approximately $480,000 in interest shortfalls due to
appraisal reductions and special servicing fees for other loans in the pool. A
portion of these shortfalls may be recovered depending on loan workouts or sales
proceeds from liquidated loans. As the classes expected to experience ongoing
interest shortfalls are rated below investment-grade, Fitch is not taking rating
actions at this time.

&lt;p&gt;  PORTLAND, OR, Nov 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CompanionLink(R) Software, a leader in synchronization solutions, has
updated their two-way sync solution for Microsoft(R) Office Outlook(R)
with Business Contact Manager ("BCM") to synchronize with regular
Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange profiles. Contacts, calendar,
tasks, notes, opportunities, projects and marketing campaigns in BCM will
sync with Outlook folders.

    Outlook users who rely on a Microsoft Exchange Server to sync their data
with their phones can use CompanionLink's new BCM-to-Outlook sync
solution to get their BCM data on their phones. With CompanionLink, BCM
data will sync with Outlook and Microsoft Exchange, which then
synchronizes with phones using Exchange ActiveSync(R) Server or
BlackBerry(R) Enterprise Server.

    "CompanionLink has freed BCM data to work with existing Outlook, Exchange,
and push sync technologies. Customers who've invested in Microsoft
Exchange and Outlook Business Contact Manager can now get two-way sync of
their business data," said Rushang Shah, Director of Marketing at
CompanionLink Software.

    Microsoft's help and how-to website refers Outlook BCM users to
CompanionLink for two-way synchronization with devices that Microsoft
does not natively support -- such as BlackBerry, Apple iPhone, Google
Android, and Palm devices. Outlook users without an Exchange Server who
are looking to sync wirelessly with their phones can use CompanionLink's
secure wireless sync service.

    CompanionLink supports Outlook BCM versions 2007 and 2010, and is
available for a one-time license fee starting at $49.95. CompanionLink
offers free email and telephone support. A 14-day evaluation is available
at www.companionlink.com/bcm.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Legal IQ and IQPC will hold the 8th eDiscovery conference December 7-9, 2009 at
the Altman Building in New York, NY (www.ediscoveryevent.com/main). 

This conference brings together professionals involved in eDiscovery to share
practical advice on the continuous challenges in e-disclosure litigation
preparedness, including aligning IT with in-house and outside counsel,
leveraging early case assessment tools, understanding federal rules and most
importantly, cost-cutting techniques. 

"Cost management really comes down to people, processes and technologies.
Selecting the right people and suppliers who have the experience and can look at
this effort from a very strategic standpoint; people who do the job right the
first time," says Diane Barrasso, Principal Forensic and Dispute Services for
Deloitte Financial Advisory Services LLP, during a podcast interview with IQPC. 

Also a featured speaker at the December event in New York, Diane continues:
"Best practices come from significant experience, and being willing to adjust
processes over time as the industry changes and technologies adjust. There`s a
lot that can be done with technologies today as well, especially with respect to
software used to enhance document review solutions. Making effective choices
that are strongly defensible and not sloppy I think is really the ultimate
goal." 

Many organizations struggle with making these effective choices, especially when
dealing with the high costs, risks and challenges associated with e-disclosure.
Experienced organizations including Accenture, Blue Cross Blue Shield South
Carolina, Boehringer Ingelheim, General Electric, NBC Universal, Pfizer, Inc.,
Philips North America, Samsung Electronics America and Tyco will provide ways to
weigh out the options and set a clear roadmap in addressing these issues. 

The dedicated speaker faculty, which features top litigators and Magistrate
Judges, will lead discussions on the following topics:

* Determining judges` priorities when eDiscovery conflicts arise 
* Aligning the interests of IT, in-house and outside counsel 
* Handling eDiscovery via social media sites and other new sources of
electronically stored information (ESI) 
* Addressing the tension between preservation and effective data lifecycle
management 
* Controlling costs by employing Early Case Assessment tools and new
technologies 
* Comparing the Federal rules regarding ESI versus international laws and
regulations 
* Exploring how the states have emulated Federal rules and how they differ

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Mobile wireless carriers throughout the world are continuing to increase needed
backhaul capacity which will lead to a large upswing in the fortunes of backhaul
equipment vendors and service providers, according to a new report from Visant
Strategies. 

"The present increase in needed backhaul capacity is due mainly to the current
deployment of HSDPA, EV-DO and mobile WiMax, which are stretching traditional
limits of copper-based backhaul throughout the wireless network, even in the
middle network, and leading to an increased use of PTP microwave and bonded
copper," said Larry Swasey of Visant Strategies. "This will continue when HSPA+
and LTE are rolled out." 

"Copper will remain relevant even in mature wireless markets due to bonded
copper technology and higher speed DSL will be made possible by deeper fiber and
hence shorter copper distances. Fiber backhaul will make some inroads in middle
of network backhaul and lesser gains in edge of network backhaul," Swasey added.


"HSPA+, LTE and mobile WiMAX planning in established mobile markets is making
carriers rethink mobile backhaul strategies," said Andy Fuertes of Visant
Strategies. "We see 3.5G and 4G backhaul requirements possibly climbing from
20/50 Mbps to 100 Mbps per base station if data and data devices like the iPhone
remain so popular." 

According to "Global Mobile Backhaul 2010: World by Region 2G, 3G and 4G
Challenges," emerging wireless markets mainly using low-cost TDM microwave
radios to backhaul GSM/GPRS networks today provide substantial growth for
backhaul vendors. Next decade these markets will undergo the same 3.5G/4G
transition carriers in Western Europe and North America are undergoing now,
creating another round of backhaul prosperity. 

Included through 2015 are base station deployments by region and generation and
all wireless subscribers as well as 3G and 3.5G/4G subscribers. PTP microwave
shipments for backhaul and shipments of upper millimeter PTP links are given.
BTS backhaul links by capacity and type are provided for each region and overall
BSC/RNC and MSC deployments are provided.

&lt;p&gt;LYON, France--(Business Wire)--
Flamel Technologies (Nasdaq:FLML) today announced that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has
exercised its option to license Flamel`s Medusa technology for the development
of a controlled release formulation of an already-marketed therapeutic protein.
Flamel will receive a further payment of $1 million pursuant to the exercise of

milestone payments and royalties on any worldwide commercial sales. The program
was begun in 2007 with Wyeth, which was acquired by Pfizer last month. The
program leverages Flamel`s ability to create controlled-release formulations of
therapeutic proteins for intravenous administration. 

Stephen H. Willard, Flamel`s chief executive officer, commented, "Pfizer`s
decision to move forward follows a two year evaluation period during which
Flamel has developed and demonstrated an aspect of the Medusa platform which
allows us to work on controlled release formulations of molecules that are
injected intravenously. We believe that this work has the potential to benefit
patients in many ways, not least by lessening the time and costs associated with
frequent hospital visits." 

Flamel Technologies, S.A. is a biopharmaceutical company principally engaged in
the development of two unique polymer-based delivery technologies for medical

important solutions to threshold issues such as aggregation and solubility. 

This document contains a number of matters, particularly as related to the
status of various research projects and technology platforms, that constitute
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The document reflects the current view of
management with respect to future events and is subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contemplated in such forward-looking statements. These risks include risks that
products in the development stage may not achieve scientific objectives or
milestones or meet stringent regulatory requirements, uncertainties regarding
market acceptance of products in development, the impact of competitive products
and pricing, and the risks associated with Flamel's reliance on outside parties
and key strategic alliances. These and other risks are described more fully in
Flamel's Annual Report on the Securities and Exchange Commission Form 20-F for

&lt;p&gt;KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, Nov. 4 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major
Chevron (CVX.N) has started the third stage of testing a
improved oil recovery technique in the neutral zone between
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, it said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron has been testing the impact of steam flooding in the
Wafra oilfield to help boost output of heavy oil. Steam raises
the temperature below ground and loosens up crude that is
otherwise difficult to pump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $340 million pilot project (LSP), is the third and
"final test in a nearly 10-year staged assessment to determine
the technical and economic viability of thermal recovery
projects in the Eocene heavy-oil carbonate reservoir," Chevron
said in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This stage, which achieved first-steam injection in June,
would prove if Chevron can use this technology in full-field
development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron is applying new technologies to free-up in
commercial quantities the potential of extra heavy oil from
carbonate," George Kirkland, Executive Vice President for Global
Upstream and Gas at Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a potential in the onshore Partitioned Neutral Zone
and elsewhere measured in billions of barrels of new energy
resources, billions of dollars in investments and revenues,"
Kirkland added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This stage, that would last for three years includes 16

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co's breakthrough deal to build one of its signature theme parks in Shanghai marks a major advance for Western media and entertainment firms trying to crack a tough China market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's government approval for the theme park caps years of on-off talks between Disney and Chinese authorities, who are wary of too much foreign influence in the highly sensitive sectors of media and popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new park planned for the Pudong new district of China's financial capital will take years to contribute to a company that rakes in more than $30 billion in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts see the move as an important step forward for Disney and other Western media firms to make inroads into the vast and untapped Chinese media and entertainment market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've been laying the groundwork for a park for many years by exposing the population to Disney properties, film, TV and merchandising," said Christopher Marangi, senior analyst with Gabelli and Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adding a physical presence in the form of a park would really complete and add to the value chain in China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough comes just two weeks ahead of a scheduled trip to China by U.S. President Barack Obama, a visit analysts had expected to help spur a decision on the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal has been seen by some as a feel-good bilateral story, highlighting U.S. cultural influence and an investment that does not entail U.S. manufacturing job losses, while China gets a boost to its leisure sector and to domestic demand as it tries to trim its dependence on exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Shanghai, China's financial hub, Disneyland could keep tourists coming after the curtain falls on the 2010 World Expo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Disney will hope the park, with an estimated price tag of $3.6 billion, will fare better than its Hong Kong property, which has struggled with lower-than-expected attendance and financial losses since it opened in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMALL STEP FORWARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, Time Warner and News Corp have surprisingly little to show for their years of effort and extensive investments in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't say this is a one-off gain," said Vivek Couto, executive director of Media Partners Asia, on the deal's broader significance for foreign media's drive for a foothold in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it's in a non-sensitive space.

"I think whether it is for the government or for consumers like us, this is a very good improvement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But villagers at the planned park site more than an hour's drive from central Shanghai fear for their homes and farms, and are already talking about compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they want to demolish this place, those who have to move will have to move. There's no choice," said one villager, who gave only her surname, Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the country wants to develop this place, of course we have to support this," added 62-year-old villager Shen Jinbao. "But the government must also treat the residents and villagers here well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG COMPETITOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's Hong Kong operation, which cost $3.5 billion initially and is preparing for a $465 million expansion, has not been as successful as initially envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Shanghai park, which would be Disney's sixth, will inevitably affect the Hong Kong park, although the impact will be limited as they will draw from different areas, observers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visitors from Guangdong and southern China will still find Hong Kong more convenient, while Shanghai will attract visitors from northern and eastern China," said Paul Tang, chief economist at Bank of East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai is close to a number of other major cities within easy driving distance, including Nanjing, Suzhou and Hangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai's own population of around 19 million, combined with tens of millions more within a three-hour driving radius, would provide a more-than-ample base of local users for the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also doesn't view the two parks as competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Hong Kong and Shanghai parks are not competitors, they're complementary," said a Disney spokeswoman in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Royston Chan in SHANGHAI and Doug Young, Don Durfee and Alison Leung in HONG KONG; Editing by Jonathan Hopfner and Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds Shanghai, villagers, graphic link)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Samuel Shen and Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney
Co's (DIS.N) breakthrough deal to build one of its signature
theme parks in Shanghai marks a major advance for Western media
and entertainment firms trying to crack a tough China market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wednesday's government approval for the theme park caps
years of on-off talks between Disney and Chinese authorities,
who are wary of too much foreign influence in the highly
sensitive sectors of media and popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new park planned for the Pudong new district of China's
financial capital will take years to contribute to a company
that rakes in more than $30 billion in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts see the move as an important step forward for
Disney and other Western media firms to make inroads into the
vast and untapped Chinese media and entertainment market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They've been laying the groundwork for a park for many
years by exposing the population to Disney properties, film, TV
and merchandising," said Christopher Marangi, senior analyst
with Gabelli and Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Adding a physical presence in the form of a park would
really complete and add to the value chain in China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The breakthrough comes just two weeks ahead of a scheduled
trip to China by U.S. President Barack Obama, a visit analysts
had expected to help spur a decision on the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal has been seen by some as a feel-good bilateral
story, highlighting U.S. cultural influence and an investment
that does not entail U.S. manufacturing job losses, while China
gets a boost to its leisure sector and to domestic demand as it
tries to trim its dependence on exports. [ID:nSHA289860]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Shanghai, China's financial hub, Disneyland could keep
tourists coming after the curtain falls on the 2010 World Expo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Disney will hope the park, with an estimated price tag
of $3.6 billion, will fare better than its Hong Kong property,
which has struggled with lower-than-expected attendance and
financial losses since it opened in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMALL STEP FORWARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, Time Warner (TWX.N) and News Corp (NWSA.O) have
surprisingly little to show for their years of effort and
extensive investments in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I wouldn't say this is a one-off gain," said Vivek Couto,
executive director of Media Partners Asia, on the deal's
broader significance for foreign media's drive for a foothold

tough, as leading Internet portal Sina (SINA.O) found recently
when it scrapped a merger with Focus Media FMCN.O due to
government stonewalling over a deal that would have created a
major new domestic media player. [ID:nLS260924]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The central government's approval must still be followed by
more detailed talks between Disney and Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Specifics still to be finalised include ownership structure
and local partners for the park, a source close to Disney told
Reuters on condition of anonymity as talks were still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the meantime, Beijing has handed down guidelines it
wants followed on the deal's financial structure, as well as
infrastructure requirements, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This means we have a new place to party and a new theme

&lt;p&gt;A certain truth about the big IT vendors is they want to sell as much as possible to any one customer and now, with virtualization, cloud computing and very tight IT budgets, they believe they have an opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are effectively four enterprise vendors today: IBM, HP, Oracle-Sun Microsystems (which are due to merge), and now arguably Cisco Systems, EMC and VMware, which this week announced plans to jointly offer what they called a "Virtual Computing Environment" that will be supported through a joint venture called Acadia .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said Acadia is as good as anything arriving out of a merger. These mergers and joint agreements are giving the enterprise vendors the means to sell complete data center infrastructure environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle's acquisition of Sun, announced in April and approved by the DOJ in August , gives Oracle hardware capability. As well as teaming up with EMC, Cisco announced its decision in June to begin offering its own server hardware .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP's acquisition of EDS , completed one year ago, boosted its services capability considerably. IBM has always had the ability to offer complete systems and services from the days when the mainframe was the data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, HP sketched out its approach to data centers, its "converged infrastructure," that combines existing technologies and some new ones, including an updated Neoview enterprise data warehousing platform, into one single offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP believes that the best way for enterprises to strip costs out of the environments and free up IT dollars for other uses is to integrate, standardize and virtualize as much as possible. They couple that capability with business intelligence and warehousing systems built on its Neoview system that runs on its Integrity BladeSystems, as well as improve cross platform integration with its Unix systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has virtualized I/0 and storage, and can manage environmental systems through its smart grid technology that can tune infrastructure demands, power and cooling, to application loads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles King, an analyst at Pund-IT in Hayward, Calif., said that "there seems to be a move afoot to enable enterprises and service providers to exert the kind of highly integrated and optimize management of their data centers that in the old days that were able to exert across a mainframe system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP CEO Mark Hurd told users at Gartner Symposium/ITxpo last month that he didn't want to compete with other vendors on point solutions, but instead wanted to provide the entire stack. Part of that effort has been through acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example is the scale out storage technology HP acquired through its acquisition this summer of IBRIX, a privately held company in Billerica, Mass. Its technology has been integrated in HP s converged offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As HP and the big vendors generally expand the ability to offer broader range, by HP and others will be up against enterprise customers wary of lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordon Haff, an analyst at Illuminata Inc., said where competitive advantage for users matters the most is in the applications, not the infrastructure. "[Vendors will argue that] you don't get competitive advantage from bits and pieces of an infrastructure, you get competitive advantage from an entire infrastructure that is running smoothly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP is betting that users will invest in new technology, in part because of what it learned by interviewing more than 400 CIOs worldwide. In that survey, more than 70% of the respondents said that they would sanction more IT investment if it was improving time to market and creating opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deborah Nelson, senior vice president marketing of HP Enterprise Business, said they customers believes that the market will be unpredictable for several years and that is driving customers to seek improved insight, as well improvements in the ability to drive revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to start rolling out a redesigned MSN.com on Wednesday in the U.S., the first major update for the page in more than 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequent visitors to the site will immediately notice one major change: The new page has only half the number of links as the old one. That's a sharp departure from the previous design, which featured around 40 links on just the top third of the page. The site has also dropped the trademark blue background for a simpler white page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new design aims to address user feedback and complaints, said Erik Jorgenson, corporate vice president for MSN. Customers said they want a single site that is easy to use, he said. "What they don't like is too much clutter," he said. Users also said that they sometimes had a hard time finding what they were looking for, they were dissatisfied with search results prior to the launch of Bing, and they said the site had an outdated look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft called Wednesday's launch a preview of the redesign, meaning it will appear for some people immediately but will become widely available in the new year. Those who don't immediately get the new site can visit preview.msn.com to see it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site is now divided into just a handful of sections, many of which are fed information that may be personally relevant to the specific user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a box in the lower right corner of the home page includes three tabs: Windows Live, Facebook and Twitter. The Facebook tab shows a list of friends' recent updates to Facebook and lets the user update their Facebook status from the MSN page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A box in the lower left corner of the page displays local weather, headlines and events. Clicking on the local link launches a new page, MSN Local Edition. That page uses Bing search to draw in local news and information. It also displays more detailed weather information and a local map where users can view traffic data. The site draws on users' IP addresses to deliver local information to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also be testing out a version of the home page that uses Silverlight. That page won't launch Wednesday, but in the future people who have Silverlight installed may begin seeing the page. In the Silverlight version, clicking on the Twitter link, for example, pops up a box where users can view updates as well as trending topics. Around 50 percent of MSN.com users already have Silverlight, Jorgenson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, Microsoft's biggest portal competitor, also recently redesigned its home page, but with different results. The Yahoo page still includes a long list of links to other pages and otherwise mainly features a list of links to news stories. Yahoo users can build themselves a customized page to include instant messaging, stock quotes, e-mail, weather, calendar and other tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSN will also still offer MyMSN, a customizable page, but Microsoft has found that not many people use it. "A large majority of users aren't willing to put time into customizing and personalizing," Jorgenson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new design represents a change in thinking at MSN. "We've moved away from the days of being an Internet directory of everything to everyone," he said. Instead, MSN wants to deliver useful content across areas that it believes users find most important, Jorgenson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 100 million people in the U.S. visit MSN.com each month, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has agreed to sell half of its holding in Shineway Group, China's top meat processor, to a Chinese fund for about $150 million, earning roughly five times its investment from the landmark 2006 deal, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acquisition attracted wide public interest in 2006, in part because it involved foreign investors taking a stake in a national brand and industry leader. It was also among the first leveraged buyouts in China by a group of foreign investors, which included Singapore's state investor Temasek Holdings TEM.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources said the Asia Special Situation Group (ASSG) of Goldman Sachs signed a deal last week to sell part of its stake in Shineway to CDH Investments, an influential Chinese private equity fund and already a major shareholder of the meat processor.

 (Adds quotes, more shareholders and background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By George Chen and Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has
agreed to sell half of its holding in Shineway Group, China's
top meat processor, to a Chinese fund for about $150 million,
earning roughly five times its investment from the landmark
2006 deal, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition attracted wide public interest in 2006, in
part because it involved foreign investors taking a stake in a
national brand and industry leader. It was also among the first
leveraged buyouts in China by a group of foreign investors,
which included Singapore's state investor Temasek Holdings
[TEM.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources said the Asia Special Situation Group (ASSG) of
Goldman Sachs signed a deal last week to sell part of its stake
in Shineway to CDH Investments, an influential Chinese private
equity fund and already a major shareholder of the meat
processor. Shineway, well known in China for its sausage
products, has a listed arm, Henan Shuanghui Investment

parent to roughly 5 percent down from around 10 percent,
according to the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Including leverage used for the transaction, Goldman will
earn around five times its investment through the sale of its
Shineway stake, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the deal, CDH would become No.2 shareholder of
Shineway, in which the management of Shineway would remain its
control, said the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Temasek and New Horizon, a U.S. dollar private equity fund

the sources said Goldman paid about $75 million for a stake in

&lt;p&gt; * Sinopec in talks to buy gas from Exxon's PNG project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Preliminary offtake agreement is for 2 mtpy
 (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PERTH Nov 4 (Reuters) - U.S. major ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N)
has reached a preliminary deal to sell 2 million tonnes a year
of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its Papua New Guinea
project to China's Sinopec (0386.HK), a key step in moving the
project towards final approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement with Sinopec means the Exxon-led Papua New
Guinea LNG project is now in exclusive talks with four major
Asian LNG buyers for binding sales contracts which will
underpin almost all of the project's full 6.6 million tonnes
per year (mtpy) capacity, Exxon said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture, which includes Australia's Oil Search Ltd
(OSH.AX), Santos Ltd (STO.AX), Japan's Nippon Oil Corp 5001.T
and PNG land owners, is rushing to finalise sales agreements
for the project ahead of a final investment decision targetted
for Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinopec is the unnamed Asian buyer which the venture said
in April was seeking government approval on the terms of the
supply talks, said an Oil Search spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other potential gas buyers for the project are Japan's
Tokyo Electric (9501.T), Osaka Gas Ltd (9532.T) and Taiwan's
CPC Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinopec said in a separate statement that the LNG from the
Exxon project will be supplied to its Qingdao receiving
terminal which will be built in the Shandong province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal, if finalised, will also be Sinopec's first LNG
purchase agreement which will support its ambitions to expand
its share of the domestic gas market that is being dominated by
PetroChina (0857.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinopec has planned the Qingdao terminal for several years
but it has made little progress as it has not been able to
secure LNG supplies, lagging behind rivals CNOOC and PetroChina
which already have three and two terminals respectively that
are various stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The PNG LNG development is one of the handful of projects
among the dozens planned in the Asia-Pacific region that have
manage to secure customers to underpin all of its production
capacity -- giving it the front-runner status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's gas consumption is set to nearly triple over the
next 10 years, potentially rising to around 18 billion cubic
feet per day by 2020 and making the country the world's No. 3
gas market after Russia and the United States.

&lt;p&gt;Part of the IBM Banking Industry Framework, Norkom`s solutions will help clients
reduce costs, improve service and increase risk management
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Norkom Technologies has today announced that it is to offer its market leading
solutions to IBM System z clients, enabling financial institutions to run their
regulatory compliance and fraud solutions on one cost-effective and integrated
platform. 

Many of the world`s top financial institutions run IBM System z. With Norkom`s
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Multi-Channel Fraud solutions now available to
them, these financial institutions can lower both the total cost of ownership
and the costs of overall risk management through a more efficient use of
resources - including hardware, fewer software licenses, reduced labour
requirements and faster deployment of new services with fewer resources. 

"By enabling our end-to-end financial crime and compliance solutions to support
the IBM System z operating system, Norkom is committed to helping financial
institutions capitalize on new z technologies, and safeguard and leverage their
existing mainframe investments - in both hardware and personnel - in the fight
against financial crime, whilst maintaining the performance, scalability and
robustness they`ve come to expect from the mainframe," explains Paul Kerley,
Norkom`s CEO. 

Financial crime costs an estimated $19 billion in losses annually, while, at the
same time, operating costs related to regulatory compliance have been growing at
a pace of 43 percent year-on-year. Recent research by Norkom Technologies
clearly illustrates the plight facing financial institutions, grappling to limit
escalating fraud losses and lower the increasing cost of compliance. Norkom`s
financial crime and compliance software solutions enable banks to fight
financial crime and meet the most stringent demands of regulators. Now, Norkom
clients deploying the Norkom solution on System z will benefit from the
efficiency, resilience and security that it offers. 

"This is a substantial milestone for Norkom," adds Kerley, "because it`s all
about giving financial institutions more value for money - less costs, improved
efficiencies and increased risk management." 

Norkom is part of the ecosystem around the IBM Banking Industry Framework, which
provides banks access to industry proven data and process models from more than
250 financial institutions so they can safely and securely upgrade their
infrastructure on the fly. Banks are seeking ways to work smarter and the
combined IBM and ISV solutions offered by the IBM Banking Industry Framework
enable banking customers to speed time to market, reduce development risk, lower
development costs, and improve their return on investment. 

"Technology is an essential component of building a smarter banking system. With
an integrated platform to help prevent fraud, financial institutions can more
easily fight financial crime and improve their bottom line," said Karl Freund,
vice president IBM System z strategy and marketing. "Norkom is one of many new
ISVs making their world class applications available on System z, zLinux and
z/OS, the banking industry's gold standard for business-critical applications." 

Norkom Technologies (www.norkom.com):

Norkom Technologies (AIM: NORK.L, IEX: NORK.IE) enables financial organizations
to take intelligent action, control defenses, and evolve strategies against
fraud, money laundering, and other types of financial crime. Norkom has
established a solid track record of reducing financial losses, protecting users`
reputations, improving operational efficiencies and lowering the cost of
technology.

&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE Nov 4 (Reuters) - Three former bankers at the
Australian arm of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) formally launched a
boutique advisory firm on Wednesday, looking to emulate the
success of similar firms as Australia's economy picks up.&lt;/p&gt;

such as Caliburn and Gresham Partners, which have snared market
share from the major investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first nine months of this year, Gresham was second
in MA advisory rankings behind Goldman Sachs (GS.N),
outperforming big names like Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Credit
Suisse (CSGN.VX), UBS (UBSN.VX) and Macquarie Group (MQG.AX),
according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BKK plans to focus on a limited number of large companies
in sectors like banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We really want to target several key clients and work with
them right through as their private advisers," Walton, who is
the company's chairman, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to elaborate on who the firm was targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its first big client was National Australia Bank (NAB.AX),
whom BKK advised on its $89 million purchase of an 80 percent
stake in Goldman Sachs JBWere's private wealth management
business in July.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co's breakthrough deal to build one of its signature theme parks in Shanghai marks a significant advance for Western media and entertainment firms trying to crack a tough China market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's government approval for the theme park caps years of on-off talks between Disney and Chinese authorities, who are wary of too much foreign influence in the highly sensitive sectors of media and popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new park planned for the Pudong new district of China's financial capital will take years to contribute to a company that rakes in more than $30 billion in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts see the move as an important step forward for Disney and other Western media firms to make inroads into the vast and untapped Chinese media and entertainment market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've been laying the groundwork for a park for many years by exposing the population to Disney properties, film, TV and merchandising and adding a physical presence in the form of a park would really complete and add to the value chain in China," said Christopher Marangi, senior analyst with Gabelli and Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough comes just two weeks ahead of a scheduled trip to China by U.S. President Barack Obama, a visit analysts had expected to help spur a decision on the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal has been seen by some as a feel-good bilateral story, highlighting U.S. cultural influence and an investment that does not entail U.S. manufacturing job losses, while China gets a boost to its leisure sector and to domestic demand as it tries to trim its dependence on exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney will be hoping the Shanghai park, with an estimated price tag of $3.6 billion, will fare better than its Hong Kong property, which has struggled with lower-than-expected attendance and financial losses since it opened in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMALL STEP FORWARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, Time Warner and News Corp have surprisingly little to show for their years of effort and extensive investments in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't say this is a one-off gain," said Vivek Couto, executive director of Media Partners Asia, commenting on the deal's significance to the broader foreign media effort to gain a foothold in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it's in a non-sensitive space. It's a theme park. It's got nothing to do with television content that can be politically sensitive or competitive with other major Chinese companies in the space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even privately held domestic media can find the going rough, as leading Internet portal Sina found recently when it scrapped a merger with Focus Media due to government stonewalling over a deal that would have created a major new domestic media player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key central government approval must still be followed by more detailed talks between Disney and Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details that need to be finalized include ownership structure and local partners for the park, a source close to Disney told Reuters on condition of anonymity as talks were still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Beijing has handed down guidelines it wants followed on the deal's financial structure, as well as infrastructure requirements, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This means we have a new place to party and a new theme park to play," said Amanda Zhang, a Shanghai resident in her 30s. "I think whether it is for the government or for consumers like us, this is a very good improvement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG COMPETITOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's Hong Kong operation, which cost $3.5 billion initially and is preparing for a $465 million expansion, has not been as successful as initially envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Shanghai park, which would be Disney's sixth, will inevitably affect the Hong Kong park, though the impact will be limited as the two will draw from different areas, observers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visitors from Guangdong and southern China will still find Hong Kong more convenient, while Shanghai will attract visitors from northern and eastern China," said Paul Tang, chief economist at Bank of East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai is close to a number of other major cities within easy driving distance, including Nanjing, Suzhou and Hangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai's own population of around 19 million, combined with tens of millions more within a three-hour driving radius, would provide a more-than-ample base of local users for the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also doesn't view the two parks as competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From our point of view, the Hong Kong and Shanghai parks are not competitors, they're complementary," said a Disney spokeswoman in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really believe that the greater China market is big enough to support multiple parks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Royston Chan in SHANGHAI and Doug Young, Don Durfee and Alison Leung in HONG KONG; Editing by Jonathan Hopfner and Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likening its organizational plan to a museum featuring different galleries of interest, the Microsoft-backed CodePlex Foundation for open source projects this week is talking up its project submission guidelines, which were released last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines include allowing commercial sponsorship of project "galleries," with the foundation focused on being "commercial-friendly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Earlier this year, Sam Ramji, Microsoft's CodePlex Foundation leader, soaked in a stinging critique from standards expert Andy Updegrove. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will operate much like [how] a museum has galleries," said Sam Ramji, president of the foundation board of directors. The foundation plans to begin accepting projects this month and has already had some project submissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other guidelines include requiring that each project have a mentor and a strong project team. Projects must use an open source-friendly license. Project best practices will be maintained by the central foundation. New projects can be accepted even if they have overlapping functionality with another project. The foundation will provide mechanisms for code security,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The core mechanism of the foundation is that we exist to provide a legal framework for open source projects much like other open source foundations," with an intent to make it easy for corporations to contribute to open source projects, Ramji said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formation of the foundation was announced in September. Microsoft provided $1 million in initial funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CodePlex differs from other open source foundations in that it is specifically dedicated to connecting corporate software developers with open source community projects, Ramji said. "No other foundation is dedicated specifically to increasing contributions from corporations to community projects," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are 350,000 open source rojects worldwide, the flow of contributions from corporations to open source projects actually is small, said Ramji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now vice president of strategy at cloud infrastructure startup Sonoa Systems, Ramji&#160; recently left his position as senior director of platform strategy at Microsoft, where he was in charge of worldwide Linux and open source strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft-backed open source group outlines project guidelines," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

to send funds directly to recipients` Visa cards domestically and
internationally. Senders can initiate a Visa Money Transfer to make
person-to-person payments, send funds to friends or family members, or make
account transfers. Sender channels through which a Visa Money Transfer can be
initiated include internet banking, Automatic Teller Machines (ATM),
self-service kiosks, in person at a bank branch, or via the telephone. 

Following these launches, Visa Money Transfer programs are offered to consumers
in greater China, including Hong Kong; Georgia; India; Indonesia; Kazakhstan;
Malaysia; Russia; Singapore; Sweden; Ukraine; and the United Arab Emirates. Visa
Money Transfer is available via 50 sending institutions in 14 countries and
territories around the world. 

"Visa is well positioned to facilitate secure and cost-effective money transfer
services by extending the capabilities of our global network that connects 1.7
billion accounts," said Elizabeth Buse, global head of product, Visa Inc. "This
enables our clients to diversify into new fee-based services, while meeting
their customers` need for a convenient, secure and affordable way to send money
domestically and across borders." 

Working with Leading Institutions

ICBC - The ICBC Visa Money Transfer program, launched in China today will be
available initially in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen and will provide the
bank`s 70.8 million internet banking customers1 a safe and convenient option to
transfer funds to Visa cards globally. The World Bank estimates that more than
US$5.7 billion was sent in cross-border remittances from China in 2008. The new
Visa Money Transfer service will be targeted at those with family members
working or studying abroad, primarily in Canada, United Kingdom, Japan,
Singapore, Hong Kong, France and Germany and will make it easier for them to
send funds. 

EPS - For consumers in Hong Kong, EPS Hong Kong Limited (EPS), an online bill
payment platform provider owned by 21 leading financial institutions, has also
launched a Visa Money Transfer service. The service will be immediately
available to customers of Standard Chartered Bank and Wing Hang. It gives
customers of these banks in Hong Kong the ability to transfer funds to 14
countries in nine currencies either by phone or via its PPS online portal. Visa
Money Transfer has broadened the PPS platform from a domestic bill payment
service to now include international fund transfers. The PPS Visa Money Transfer
platform allows the service to be extended easily to additional member banks of
EPS based on bank and consumer demand. 

Combined, the ICBC and EPS programs will help to deliver Visa Money Transfer to
more than 72 million new consumers in Greater China. 

UAE Exchange - Visa and UAE Exchange, the leading global remittance and exchange
house in the United Arab Emirates, have come together to offer a cross-border
Visa Money Transfer program. The service will be offered through UAE Exchange`s
network of 79 branches across the country. Visa Money Transfer will represent a
new, more convenient funds delivery method to UAE Exchange customers. The
service is scheduled to launch later in November, using Visa Processing Services
for transaction processing. 

Worldwide - The Visa Money Transfer managed service launched today provides Visa
clients with an end-to-end packaged solution that gives them the ability to
customize several elements of the service including consumer fees, branding,
foreign exchange rates, transaction limits and language preferences, in addition
to core transaction processing. 

Continued Global Expansion

While the Asia Pacific region is leading the deployment of new Visa Money
Transfer programs, significant momentum has been gained around the world. Recent
momentum includes: 

Singapore - Singapore Post Limited (SingPost), which last year became the first
post office in the world to offer a Visa Money Transfer service, has expanded
its international remittance service to four additional recipient countries and
territories. Consumers can now send money to Visa cardholders in Bangladesh,
Hong Kong, New Zealand and Taiwan, in addition to Australia, China, India,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the United Kingdom.
Standard Chartered Bank has also teamed up with SingPost to offer a domestic
Visa credit card repayment service through SingPost`s self-service automated
machines. 

Russia -Nineteen banks in Russia already offer Visa Money Transfer through over
15,000 ATMs and kiosks in the country. In partnership with Alfa Bank, Visa
introduced the first implementation of its enhanced Visa Money Transfer service
for express funds transfer, now available to Alfa Bank and Severnaya Kazna
customers. 

Ukraine - In partnership with JCSB "Ukrsotsbank", Visa launched a money transfer
service which, from May 2009, allows any Visa cardholder in Ukraine to use the
service via one of the bank`s ATMs for domestic transfers to other Visa
cardholders in Ukraine.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said it will deliver six security updates Tuesday, less than half the number it issued last month, to fix flaws in Windows and Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updates will patch a total of 15 separate vulnerabilities , Microsoft said in a follow-up entry to its security response center's blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Six is the lucky number this month," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. "Really, anything less than 13 is a lucky number."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft released 13 updates that patched 34 vulnerabilities, both records since the company started shipping monthly updates more than six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six slated for next week, however, tie the record for the most issued in November, traditionally a light month for Microsoft updates. In November 2006, the company also delivered a half-dozen security updates. In 2007 and 2008, however, it shipped just two each year in November, while it released only one in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the half-dozen updates, Microsoft tagged three as "critical," the highest severity rating in its four-step scoring system, while the remaining trio were labeled "important," the next-lowest ranking. Four of the six affect one or more editions of Windows or Windows Server; the other two will patch Office, specifically Word and Excel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because there are no outstanding Microsoft-generated security advisories, Storms was at a loss about what next week's updates might fix. "But Bulletin 1 looks interesting," he said, noting that the critical update would patch only Vista and Server 2008. "Historically, you would expect a Vista patch to also affect XP, and maybe even Windows 7," Storms explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of Tuesday's updates will affect Windows 7, Microsoft's just-released operating system, or the also-new Windows Server 2008 R2, the companion server software. Last month, Microsoft released the first patches for Windows 7's final code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There aren't any Windows 7 patches at all," Storms said. "So, so far so good." Windows 7 will be worth watching, however. "It will be more interesting down the road to see if Microsoft disclosed bugs they found in Windows 7, and fixed during development, but are just now going back and fixing in the older OSes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another update to watch carefully next week is the one Microsoft named "Bulletin 3" in its advance notification , the monthly forewarning that includes only the barest of details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That update, also rated critical, affects everything version from the aged Windows 2000 to Vista and Server 2008. "I think No. 3 is the big one to watch next week," said Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another researcher agreed. "Our sources unanimously suggest that Bulletin 3 will be the issue that needs to be addressed first this month," echoed Sheldon Malm, senior director of security strategy at Rapid7, in an e-mail. "[Users] should take inventory of where Windows versions are within their environments so they can plan testing and roll-out of the patch for Bulletin 3 as quickly as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two Office updates, both important, will address issues in Word and Excel. The first update will impact Word 2002 and Word 2003 on Windows, and Word 2004 and Word 2008 on the Mac. The Excel update, on the other hand, will patch one or more problems in Excel 2002, Excel 2003 and Excel 2007 on the PC, Excel 2004 and Excel 2008 on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Office updates are interesting, but from what Microsoft gave us today, I think they'll be the kind of file format parsing bugs we've all come to know and love," Storms said today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vulnerabilities in Office file formats have been a treasure trove for hackers, who have successfully exploited them for years. Earlier this week, Microsoft acknowledged that the bulk of all attacks targeting Office in the first half of 2009 were leveraging a single vulnerability, which Microsoft patched in June 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second month in a row that Microsoft has disclosed not only the number of updates it will ship next week, but also the number of flaws those patches will fix. And that's a good thing, said Storms. "That's great," he said. "It aids the planning process, because six bulletins could be six vulnerabilities or 20."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release the six updates at approximately 1 p.m. ET on Nov. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold over three times more copies of Windows 7 in the week surrounding the Oct. 22 launch than it did Vista during its opening days in 2007, a retail marketing research analyst said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the week of Oct. 18-24, and including the large numbers of pre-orders that Microsoft and online retailers took starting last June, Windows 7 unit sales were 234% higher than Vista's in its first days in January 2007, said Stephen Baker, an analyst with the NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would call it pretty good," Baker said, "but I wouldn't call it great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker said that expectations for Windows 7 were even higher than its actual performance, but the tough economy and retailers' reluctance to give up on either Windows XP or Vista created what he called a "headwind" for Microsoft's new operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact of the matter is that prior to the launch, there were a lot of operating systems out there," Baker said. "When Vista launched, you didn't see a lot of Windows Millennium PCs," he said, referring to the edition that preceded Windows XP. "Windows 7 will be more of a long haul."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More retailers kept computers powered by Windows XP or Vista on their shelves in the days just before, and also after, Windows 7 launch, explained Baker. "We didn't see the precipitous decline in inventory that we saw before Vista. Then, retailers were 'cleaner,' they didn't have really anything available except for Vista. But now, netbook sales made it easier for retailers to carry inventory with XP up to Windows 7's launch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While unit sales of Windows 7 were up dramatically over Vista's early numbers, the new operating system brought in a less-than-stellar 82% revenue increase over Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker credited the smaller revenue boost to Microsoft's deep discounting of pre-orders last summer, when it sold Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade for $49.99 for two weeks in the U.S. Microsoft. And its OEM partners have also offered a second deal that discounts a Windows 7 upgrade as much as 58% when consumers purchase a new PC equipped with the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those bargains pushed down the average sales price, or ASP, of Windows 7 in NPD's initial tracking. The ASP of Home Premium Upgrade, for example, was just $76 by Baker's estimate, much lower than the $119.99 list price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those lower ASPs kept revenue from growing as much as unit sales," Baker said, adding that while NPD could not break out the percentage of sales for each retail edition, it was clear from the Home Premium ASP that that version made up the bulk of the early sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 Ultimate, he added, sold fewer copies than did Vista Ultimate in 2007, another factor that contributed to the smaller revenue gain by the new OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, in fact, has gone to some lengths to downplay Windows 7 Ultimate, with executives saying that it would account for a very small percentage of sales, and the company's marketing materials stressing that Home Premium is the version most consumers should purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither message about Ultimate will come as a surprise to many consumers who paid top dollar in 2007 for Vista Ultimate, then complained when Microsoft didn't deliver on promises for the "Ultimate Extras" feature. Microsoft subsequently discontinued development on Extras, which was to provide Ultimate-only free downloads, and then ditched the concept for Windows 7 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While retail copies did well, PC sales were less impressive. They were higher than any week during the high-volume third quarter, when back-to-school sales dominated, but they weren't as strong as the uptick during Vista's launch, Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC sales during the week of Oct. 18-24 were up 49% year-over-year, and up 95% over the week prior to Windows 7's debut. During the corresponding periods for Vista, however, PC sales were up 68% and 170%, respectively. Because of the drop in PC prices since 2007, particularly in the new netbook category, Windows-powered PC sales revenues were actually down 6% compared to sales during Vista's launch week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker expects Windows 7 hardware sales to improve. "There was a lot of speculation before Windows 7's launch about how many netbooks would be out there with XP," Baker said. "But it looks like the PC makers and Microsoft came to some kind of accommodation, because almost everything [in netbooks] is now running Windows 7 Starter. XP is going to be much smaller as we go into 2010 on netbooks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has characterized early Windows 7 sales as "positive," but has declined to reveal figures, saying that it's too soon to tell exactly how well it's doing. CEO Steve Ballmer, however, crowed that Windows 7 was doing great in Japan. "We've had a great response here in Japan," Ballmer said at a Tokyo news conference on Wednesday. "Certainly, we've seen initial sales be fantastic. The first 10 days were bigger than the first 10 days of XP or Vista or any other Windows launch that we have done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM on Thursday announced beta versions of new services aimed at developers who want to create and deploy applications on public and private clouds.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Like other vendors, such as Skytap, IBM is pushing cloud services as a way for programmers to get access to computing power quickly, something that can be difficult if many in-house projects are occurring and on-site computing resources are scarce. With the Smart Business Development and Test service, which runs on IBM's public cloud, developers can get a working environment in minutes, according to the vendor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also said it would begin deploying its Rational Software Delivery Services for Cloud Computing on private clouds. The offering, which was announced as a technology preview earlier this year, bundles best practices for agile development; services for test management and planning; and other tools, such as asset-tracking software that is supposed to help development teams run more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both services are set to be generally available in the first quarter of 2010, said Ashok Reddy, director of software delivery platform and security products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing hasn't been finalized, but the Smart Business Development and Test service will use the now-familiar pay-as-you-go model, according to Reddy. IBM also expects to use a token-based licensing option for Rational Software Delivery Services for Cloud Computing, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under such a system, companies buy a set number of "tokens" that can be moved from product to product as needs change. For example, early in a project, most tokens could be tied to developer tools, and as work concludes, the tokens would shift to testing software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although IBM is moving ahead aggressively with its cloud-development strategy, it's not clear when the market will be ready to fully embrace such services, according to one observer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not seeing a significant demand for cloud-based dev at this point," Forrester Research analyst Jeffrey Hammond said via e-mail. "Around 1 in 10 developers have indicated to Forrester they've even deployed a software project to the cloud at this point, and of those most are using the IAAS providers like Amazon EC2 to deploy complete apps that they've developed and tested in house. I think the concept of hosted development is intriguing, but it's going to take time for organizations to get comfortable shipping their software IP off site into the cloud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As an aside -- it's another matter for open source projects, which have been very successful using this type of model," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other data shows greater interest among developers in cloud computing, but again, more in regard to deployment than soup-to-nuts application development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Evans Data survey released in August found nearly 50 percent of respondents planned to deploy applications to a private cloud. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But half also said they are using public cloud services like EC2 for experimentation or prototypes, versus "business-critical" applications. And a full three-quarters believe in backing up applications running on public clouds, whether in storage or a private cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced it earned
$15.4 million, or basic net income per share of $1.68, in the third quarter of
2009 compared to a loss of $3.1 million, or basic net loss per share of $.34, in
the third quarter of 2008. The third quarter of 2009 results included $.5
million of mark-to-market after-tax gains ($.8 million on a pre-tax basis) due
to the Company`s fuel and aluminum hedging programs and also included $5.4
million in tax benefits which reduced the Company`s effective tax rate to 6.3%.
The third quarter of 2008 results included after-tax charges of $9.7 million
($18.8 million on a pre-tax basis) due to pension exit and strike settlement
costs, restructuring expenses and fuel hedging losses. 

The following table reconciles reported and comparable net income (loss) and

For the first nine months of 2009, the Company earned $36.1 million, or basic
net income per share of $3.94, compared to net income of $7.7 million, or basic
net income per share of $.84, for the first nine months of 2008. The results for
the first nine months of 2009 included $4.4 million of mark-to-market after-tax
gains ($7.3 million on a pre-tax basis) due to the hedging programs and also
included $7.1 million in tax benefits which reduced the Company`s effective tax
rate to 24.8%. The results for the first nine months of 2008 included $8.8
million of after-tax items impacting comparability ($17.0 million on a pre-tax
basis) which were due to pension exit and strike settlement costs, restructuring
expenses and fuel hedging gains.

(a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow investors to more
clearly evaluate operating performance and business trends. Management uses this
information to review results excluding items that are not necessarily
indicative of ongoing results. 

J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, "2009 has been a challenging
year for our industry and our Company, as it has been for the entire US economy.
Although we are very pleased with the significant improvement in our income from
operations, the comparable year over year results included several unusual
operating expense items last year that did not occur in 2009. On a comparable
basis, our bottom line performance was strong relative to last year on lower
volume, increased pricing and flat gross margin. Our team has worked hard this
year to achieve positive results through the first nine months, and we are
pleased given the difficult economic conditions in our territories. As we look
to the remainder of 2009 and into 2010, we continue to be extremely focused and
disciplined in our pursuit of profitable revenue growth and cost management." 

William B. Elmore, President and COO, added, "We have faced many challenges
since the fourth quarter of 2007. These two years presented us a difficult
operating environment which has caused us to intensify our focus on quality
customer service, productivity gains and diligent cost management. Our 2008
restructuring positioned us well in a very weak economy and, through nine months
of 2009, has helped us achieve a strong comparable operating performance (as
shown in the tables above). We appreciate the efforts of our employees, and we
will continue to find new and improved ways to deliver quality Coke products and
services."

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

China Booming Again

The long-term key for China is to generate more consumer demand at home so it is
not forever dependent on exports to fuel its growth. This is the mirror image of
what the U.S. needs. We cannot forever run trade deficits, consuming more from
the rest of the world than we produce. 

It is the trade deficit that drives the expansion of U.S. debt held by China,
not our fiscal deficit. Remember that point, it is an important one -- and one
that the vast majority of talking heads on TV just don`t seem to get. Of course,
each country`s exports are another country`s imports, and for every trade
surplus, there must be an offsetting trade deficit somewhere else in the world. 

So far it has been a pretty sweet deal for the U.S.: we get all the goods that
fill the shelves of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT), and they get
little green pieces of paper. Recently those little green pieces of paper have
been going down in value. How much longer does China want to send us real useful
stuff in return for those pieces of paper (or, more accurately, little blips
inside of computers)? 

They have done so thus far because along with the paper, making that stuff they
send abroad (actually, they export more to Europe than they do to the U.S.)
creates jobs, and China needs jobs for social stability. However, so does the
U.S., as our unemployment rate approaches 10%. 

The deal is getting progressively less sweet for both sides as the dollars keep
on piling up in Beijing. The solution over the long term is for China`s 1.3
billion people, the majority of whom still live in poverty, to start to consume
more. If that can be accomplished, then Chinese society will be more stable, it
will be able to maintain its employment levels and the U.S. might actually start
to add a few jobs. 

This would also greatly benefit the millions of smaller non-state-owned firms in
China. The best way to play that trend is in the Claymore China Small Cap ETF
(NYSE: HAO), which has by far the largest exposure to the Chinese consumer of
any of the China ETF`s. Buying individual stocks that are direct plays on the
Chinese consumer is a risky proposition and is probably best left to those who
can both read Mandarin and decipher financial statements written in it. 

While China`s market has done well so far this year, so have most emerging
markets. However, the economies of most emerging markets have not come close to
matching the performance of the Chinese economy. 

Underpinned by the strength in China, and rapidly growing inter region trade,
the World Bank sees all of East Asia growing at a 6.7% rate in 2009, up from
5.3% growth seen back in April. Since Japan`s growth is likely to be rather
sluggish (but also improving), that implies solid growth for the rest of the
region. As the auto sales numbers yesterday showed, the Korean auto industry is
not exactly hurting that much anymore. 

In short, there are better places in the world to invest than in the U.S., and
most U.S. investors are still far too heavily weighted towards domestic
investments. However, you don`t just have to buy ADR`s or ETF`s to have
international exposure. U.S. companies that get a high proportion of their sales
from Asia will also probably benefit from the growth there. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO)
would be a good example to take a well-known name. Aflac (NYSE: AFL) is another,
although for them the revenues come from Japan, not China.

not exactly hurting that much anymore. 

In short, there are better places in the world to invest than in the U.S., and
most U.S. investors are still far too heavily weighted towards domestic
investments. However, you don`t just have to buy ADR`s or ETF`s to have
international exposure. U.S. companies that get a high proportion of their sales
from Asia will also probably benefit from the growth there. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO)
would be a good example to take a well-known name. Aflac (NYSE: AFL) is another,
although for them the revenues come from Japan, not China.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's rivals have asked European antitrust regulators to modify the ballot screen that would give Windows users the chance to choose which browser they use in Windows, according to a report by the New York Times .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opera Software, which sparked the investigation into Microsoft's bundling of Internet Explorer (IE), Mozilla and Google will each send separate letters to the European Commission suggesting changes to the proposal put forward by Microsoft last summer, said the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope the commission is open to fixing the remedy," Hakon Wium Lie, Opera's chief technology officer, told the New York Times Wednesday. "It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make sure there is a working market for browsers. I don't think we are going to get another chance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, which makes the Chrome browser, declined to confirm that it is sending a letter to the commission. "We don't know how the commission's proceeding will evolve," William Echikson, a Google spokesman based in Brussels, said early Thursday in a telephone interview with Computerworld . "But we continue to believe that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the Web and a better user experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla also would not confirm that it has sent suggestions to the commission. "Our concerns were stated previously and we're confident that the EC is well aware of our position, including support for the resolution of the investigation," said a Mozilla spokesman today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera did not respond to a request for further comment Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early October, the commission tentatively approved Microsoft's plan, which would offer European users of Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 a Web-based page showing five browsers, then let them select which they would install and run on their PCs. To get that preliminary approval, Microsoft made several changes to its original July proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Opera and Mozilla have been vocal about their dissatisfaction with Microsoft's original plan, and with the revised concept that has been market tested by regulators for the last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, for example, Mozilla executives cited several concerns about the ballot screen. At the time, Mitchell Baker, the chairwoman of the Mozilla Foundation and the former CEO of Mozilla Corp., which produces Firefox, said that if Microsoft's proposal were accepted, IE would "still have a unique and uniquely privileged position on Windows installations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Opera has also been wary of Microsoft's plan. In July, Lie said Opera would suggest changes to the commission and argued that Microsoft should expand the deal to include all users, not only those in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, a Mozilla designer criticized the ballot layout for giving preference to Apple's Safari based on the alphabetical ranking by browser maker. "Safari has the smallest market share of the five other browsers," said Jenny Boriss in an Oct. 14 entry on her blog. Later, she edited the blog entry to say that the opinions were her own, and not that of her company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boriss countered that it would be fairer if the first position -- the browser at the far left of the five that will be shown on the first screen -- was selected randomly each time it was presented to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up blog entry published Monday, Boriss again denigrated the layout, claiming that it gave IE more than three times the space than rivals' browsers because the ballot would be displayed within the frame of Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera wants the ballot to be stripped of any Microsoft logo, which would presumably mean that IE could not be used to display the ballot, and a promise that Microsoft would prevent Windows from displaying any warnings, such as Vista's and Windows 7's user account control (UAC) prompts, when people pick an IE alternative to download and install.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other ideas that surfaced previously include a so-called "native" application to show the ballot, a move that would entirely eliminate the need to run IE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neelie Kroes, the current head of the EU's antitrust agency, seemed satisfied last month with the proposal. "We believe this is an answer," said Kroes in a press conference Oct. 7. "At the end of the day, that's what we are looking for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources have said it's likely that Kroes wants to resolve the dispute with Microsoft before the end of the year, when her term as the commission head expires. An early December date is most likely, those sources have said. That would mean Microsoft would push the ballot to users via Windows Update in February 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested parties, including the three browser makers, have until Monday to file comments with the commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's antitrust settlement offer to the European Commission needs minor, often cosmetic changes in order to restore fair competition to the market for Internet browsers, said some of the software giant's main rivals Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their concerns about the settlement are echoed by ECIS, a trade group representing Oracle, IBM, Red Hat and others, as well as by consumer organizations following the Microsoft antitrust case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has proposed that Windows operating systems should show users a ballot screen inviting them to choose a Web browser from among the most popular ones when they first attempt to access the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer organizations and the company's rivals generally approve of the idea, but believe the way Microsoft's ballot screen is designed is biased and will deter people from replacing Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser with another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also argue that a review period two years after the settlement would come into force is too long to wait, and they call for regular monitoring of the ballot screen every six months, to make sure it is having the desired effect of encouraging consumers to exercise their free choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this year the European Commission issued a statement of objections to Microsoft, accusing the company of abusing the dominance of Windows to skew competition in its favor in the Web browser market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accusations came five years after the Commission found Microsoft guilty of monopoly abuse in the markets for media players and workgroup server software, for which the company has been fined over 1 billion euros to date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with another costly and humiliating antitrust ruling against it in Europe, Microsoft last month offered to settle the browser case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes welcomed the offer, which was an improvement on an earlier offer submitted in July, saying she was broadly happy with the latest undertakings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But under E.U. antitrust rules, the settlement offer must be shown to interested third parties, including rivals and consumer groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera, a Norwegian browser maker, Google with its Chrome browser, and Mozilla, maker of Firefox, the closest competitor to Microsoft's Internet Explorer, are all on the point of submitting their formal response to the settlement offer, and all three agree on some small but crucial problems with the Microsoft offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes said she expects some objections to the latest Microsoft offer from some rivals. "A number of people are never 100 percent satisfied," she told journalists last month. But for her the offer is enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fearful of appearing troublesome and never satisfied, the companies most affected by the proposed settlement are treading very carefully in their submissions to Kroes and her team of antitrust officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ballot screen is a good solution and we support it, but there are some warts -- things that can  easily be fixed," said H&#229;kon Wium Lie,  the chief technology officer of Opera, the company that sparked the antitrust case two years ago by complaining to the E.U. Regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ballot screen as devised by Microsoft warns users more than once of the risks they are taking by attempting to open a non-Microsoft software product. Opera wants the warnings scrapped, allowing for a one-click route to replacing Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also objects to the design of the ballot screen, with its Internet Explorer branding in the crucial top left corner of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also calls for the order of the five ballot screens to be scrambled, instead of the browsers being listed alphabetically from left to right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order of browsers on the screen is a big issue for Mozilla, which could find itself in the least desirable right side of the screen if the list remains in alphabetical order by company name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If these warts are not removed it would be sad for the Web and sad for competition," Wium Lie said in a telephone interview, adding that the Commission has "a unique once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" to correct the imbalance in the browser market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECIS is expected to take a tougher line in its response, due in with the antitrust officials by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Experience in the E.U. and the U.S. has unfortunately demonstrated that anything less than a robust settlement agreement accompanied by effective compliance verification measures will likely lead to inadequate changes in Microsoft's behavior and a failure to redress damage resulting from many years of abusive practices," one person close to ECIS said, reading from a draft of the group's formal reply to the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French consumer group UFC Que Choisir is broadly in line with Opera and the other companies in its concerns about Microsoft's offer. Like them UFC Que Choisir is recognized as an interested third party in the antitrust case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dramatic changes are needed," said Edouard Barreiro, an expert following the IT industry for UFC Que Choisir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We support the ballot screen but Microsoft's idea for it will bring nothing in the form it is in now. We want the Commission to press Microsoft to make significant changes," he said, mentioning the same issues raised by Opera and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECIS, Google, Mozilla and the Commission were also unavailable to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had a prepared statement that didn't address the specific concerns of the groups. The statement concluded: "We look forward to the next steps in the process."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD (Reuters) - An Exxon Mobil-led consortium has beaten rival Russian, French and Chinese groups to secure initial rights to develop Iraq's West Qurna field, adding momentum to Iraq's bid to unlock its oil riches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, Del. Nov 5 (Reuters) - The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp asked a court for control over $3.7 billion
claimed by both bankrupt holding company Washington Mutual Inc
and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The government agency was appointed receiver last year for
Washington Mutual's lending operations, which were seized by
regulators at the height of the financial panic. The FDIC sold
the bank business to JPMorgan Chase Bank for $1.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual [WMPDC.UL] has asked a bankruptcy court
to force JPMorgan to return $4 billion, which is the amount it
had on deposit with one of its banks plus accrued interest.
JPMorgan has argued the money was actually a capital
contribution made to meet regulatory requirements, not a
deposit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge Mary Walrath has yet to rule in that dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a court filing on Wednesday, the agency asked Walrath to
lift the automatic stay of legal proceedings that accompanies a
Chapter 11 filing to allow the FDIC to invoke a clause in the
sale contract to take control of the disputed funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The FDIC-receiver seeks modification of the stay, to the
extent required, to enable it to demand JPMC to return the
disputed deposit balances," said the agency's court filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency said once returned, the funds would be held in a

pending lawsuits over the funds were resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual's attorney said the company would
challenge the request. He also noted that by invoking the
contract clause, the government agency is acknowledging the
funds are not a capital contribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By filing their papers the FDIC has effectively admitted
the $4 billion are the debtor's deposit and do not belong to
anybody else," said David Elsberg of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart
Oliver  Hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to the ownership of the funds, the bankruptcy
court must also determine if claims by JPMorgan and the FDIC
against Washington Mutual exceed the value of the disputed
deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main bankruptcy case is In re Washington Mutual Inc,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington), No.
08-12229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The adversarial suit over the deposits is Washington Mutual
Inc and WMI Investment Corp v JPMorgan Chase Bank National
Association, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware, No. 09-50934.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Phil Berlowitz)

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch authorities say they have banned use of a batch of Pfizer's Prevenar, or Prevnar, after three infants died within two weeks of receiving the anti-infection vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"On average about 5 to 10 deaths are reported annually after babies get vaccines," said a spokeswoman for the Dutch health institute RIVM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now have three cases in a short period, that is unusual and the reason for suspending the batch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said RIVM was investigating the cause of the infants' deaths. Other batches of Prevenar, known as Prevnar in the United States, will continue to be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer spokeswoman Gwen Fisher said preliminary investigations by the company and health authorities had found no link between the vaccinations and the deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the company initiated the "quarantine" of the batch which she said contained 110,000 doses of Prevenar, used to prevent pneumonia and related infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisher said the three infants also received two unrelated other vaccines as part of routine immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other Prevenar batches were suspended and infants in the Netherlands will continue to be vaccinated with it as part of routine immunization, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the European Medicines Agency in London said its officials were working with the Dutch authorities to find out if there were any safety issues with the vaccine batch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is one of the most widely used in the world and generated sales for U.S. drugmaker Wyeth of $2.7 billion in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth, which has just been acquired by U.S. rival Pfizer, had asked for the suspension of batch D66977 of Prevenar, RIVM said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at Pfizer in New York could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gilbert Kreijger, Ben Hirschler in London and Ransdell Pierson in New York; editing by Simon Jessop and David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), the second largest U.S. bank, has room to keep growing through acquisitions, the company's head of retail financial services said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the areas where JPMorgan is already present, the bank looks for branches networks that could fit with its plans of growth, Chief Executive of retail financial services Charlie Scharf said at a conference organized by the BancAnalysts Association of Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there is a specific area that we know next year, and the year after, and the year after that, we want to build 20 branches a year, if we can go and buy a bank with 25, 30 branches at the right price, with the right protection we would consider doing that," Scharf said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have actually looked at all the banks in the country. We have looked at which ones we would be interested in based upon those cutoffs and based upon the attractiveness, so if they do become available we are kind of ready to go. We have got a lot of room to do the things that we want to do if they become available," Scharf said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, any deal in markets where JPMorgan is not present would have to be significant to set a strong footprint, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has weathered the financial crisis better than its rivals, last year acquired investment bank Bear Stearns and the banking operations of Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank, with 5,126 branches in the United States, is No. 1 in deposits in New York, Chicago, and Phoenix, and third in Los Angeles and Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio; editing by Gunna Dickson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  BELLEVUE, WA, Nov 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Bsquare Corporation (NASDAQ: BSQR), the leading software solutions
provider to the global embedded device community, today announced that it
has signed an agreement with Microsoft Corp. under which Bsquare will be
the first company to distribute Windows Mobile software and mobility
applications internationally.

    Bsquare will begin supporting approximately 30 select Windows Mobile
partners with licensing, technical support and go-to-market activities as
their current direct agreements with Microsoft end. Bsquare will offer
personalized account management and highly-responsive technical support to
ensure these Windows Mobile OEMs are successful with current Windows
Mobile products.

    "Microsoft is pleased to announce Bsquare as the first distributor for the
Mobile Indirect Channel initiative. Microsoft continues to enrich and
expand its Windows Mobile ecosystem and build upon the stability,
reliability, performance and richness of Windows Mobile," said Daren
Mancini, general manager in the OEM division at Microsoft. "As developers
and OEMs expand the number of mobile applications, services and devices,
Microsoft is taking a new approach to sell and support Windows Mobile to a
broader base of both consumer- and enterprise-focused Windows Mobile
customers. Bsquare is uniquely positioned to leverage its deep knowledge
of the Windows Mobile operating system, ecosystem and marketplace and
serve the broader base of customers with its consultative approach."

    "Mobility solutions are one of the most sought after technologies in the
workplace today," according to Philippe Winthrop, director of enterprise
mobility at Strategy Analytics. "Given the opportunity for improved
flexibility and performance of a workforce, mobile platforms that can
support the needs of both knowledge works and field/fleet service
professionals provide valued scalability to IT and line of business
managers. Growth in this market will only accelerate as markets continue
to exit this global recession."

    Bsquare will work closely with Microsoft to take the Windows Mobile
platform to a broad set of mobility OEMs and operators. Bsquare will
enable new mobility OEMs to get to market more quickly with its TestQuest
automated testing products customized for Windows Mobile devices. Bsquare
also will provide Windows Mobile reference designs and board support
packages in partnership with leading silicon vendors, communication
stacks, technical support, training, engineering services and other
value-add products to the broad base of Windows Mobile customers.

    "Being named Microsoft's first Windows Mobile distribution partner is a
significant milestone for Bsquare. Windows Mobile is the only mobile
operating system that enables solution providers to offer seamless
integration of applications and connectivity for device users to
enterprise business centers making it the obvious choice not only for
handsets but also for ruggedized devices such as data collection
terminals or telematics devices," said Brian Crowley, Bsquare's president
and CEO. "We anticipate working with new and existing Windows Mobile OEMs
and moving them to market quickly with our experience in all phases of
Windows Mobile development and by offering our breadth partners support
throughout their development cycles."

    Bsquare will distribute Windows Mobile software internationally including
Windows Mobile 6.5, the latest version of Microsoft's mobile software
launched October 6, 2009. New Bsquare customers will include both handset
manufacturers developing Windows(R) phones for consumers and rugged device
manufacturers shipping data collection terminals to businesses and other
OEMs.

    Bsquare currently distributes Windows Embedded licenses in North America
and offers system integration services at 10 development centers located
in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Taiwan, China and India. During the last 12
months Bsquare has worked on service engagements with 15 unique Windows
Mobile customers on projects such as Windows Mobile porting, application
development, quality assurance testing and LTK (Logo Test Kit) testing
preparation.

&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND) announced today that its
research collaboration with Pfizer for JAK3 has been extended by one year. The
Research and License Agreement entered into in December 2006 with Wyeth provided
for an initial three year research term. Under this extension, Ligand will
receive $3.1 million in research payments to continue conducting drug discovery
and lead candidate optimization. Under the original agreement, Ligand is
entitled to receive up to $175 million in milestone payments for the successful
development and commercialization of multiple products. In addition, Ligand will
receive royalties on product sales. 

"We are very pleased to learn that Pfizer has elected to extend the JAK3
research collaboration with Ligand," said John L. Higgins, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Ligand. "We view JAK3 inhibitors as a very promising market
opportunity, and given Pfizer's clinical success with its own internal program
we are convinced that they are highly committed to this category. Ligand has an
exceptional record of drug discovery while serving major pharmaceutical
companies in a number of research collaborations. We are pleased with the team`s
progress and look forward to continued success as we drive the program forward
for Pfizer." 

About JAK3

JAK3 is a tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Janus family of enzymes, and it is
an important target for therapeutic interventions in the treatment of autoimmune
disorders, inflammation, and organ transplant rejections. JAK3 expression seems
to be limited to hematopoietic cells, and specific inhibitors of JAK3 could
represent a new class of immunosuppressant drugs. 

About Ligand Pharmaceuticals

Ligand discovers and develops new drugs that address critical unmet medical
needs of patients with muscle wasting, frailty, hormone-related diseases,
osteoporosis, inflammatory diseases, anemia, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and
psoriasis. Ligand's proprietary drug discovery and development programs are
based on advanced cell-based assays, gene-expression tools, ultra-high
throughput screening and one of the world`s largest combinatorial chemical
libraries. Ligand has strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Cephalon,
GlaxoSmithKline, Schering-Plough, Pfizer and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (now Pfizer).
With nine pharmaceutical agreements and more than 20 molecules in various stages
of development, Ligand utilizes proprietary technologies for identifying drugs
with novel receptor and enzyme drug targets. 

Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This news release contains forward-looking statements by Ligand that involve
risks and uncertainties and reflect Ligand`s judgment as of the date of this
release. These statements include those regarding timing and results of clinical
data for the JAK3 program, data analysis and evaluation of product candidates,
the potential commercial market for JAK3 inhibitors, and plans for continued
development of JAK3 inhibitors and related product candidates. Actual events or
results may differ from Ligand's expectations. For example, there can be no
assurance that trials or evaluations of any product candidates will be
favorable, that we will receive any milestone payments or royalties in the
future, that JAK3 inhibitors or related product candidates will provide utility
or benefits to patients, or that commercial development of any product
candidates will be initiated. The failure to meet expectations with respect to
any of the foregoing matters may reduce Ligand's stock price. Additional
information concerning risk factors affecting Ligand can be found in prior press
releases available at www.ligand.com as well as in public periodic filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, available via www.sec.gov. Ligand
disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements
beyond the date of this press release. This caution is made under the safe
harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is looking to expand ties with Japanese universities and has unveiled a multi-million dollar long-term plan to deepen its research roots in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Mount Fuji Plan" got its start this week and builds on the software maker's Institute for Japanese Academic Research and Collaboration (IJARC) that was formed in 2005 by Bill Gates. It focuses on fundamental-level research projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea is to create a mechanism to foster research, support students and build relationships," said Rick Rashid, senior vice president of Microsoft, in an interview in Tokyo on Thursday. The IJARC allowed Microsoft to form links with professors and offer internship programs as a first step to collaboration with Japanese academia and was modestly successful, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Mount Fuji Plan doubles down on that," said Rashid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project will be coordinated out of Microsoft Research Asia, the company's Asian research headquarters in Beijing, and offer universities and their professors and students a chance to collaborate with Microsoft, work in the company's labs as interns, promote academic exchange and get curriculum input from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Beijing research labs are perhaps best known for work on speech and optical character recognition but the Mount Fuji Plan won't limit its sights to any particular area, Rashid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese projects will likely focus on areas the country is best known for, like robotics, and areas where there is a lot of interest, such as digital preservation of cultural artifacts. Work from Japan in this area has already contributed to Microsoft Research Asia's e-Heritage project. Green technology and environmental and energy-related research is also expected to flow through the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We provide funding that doesn't have strings attached," Rashid said. That allows research to refocus should a more interesting or more promising discovery be made while pursuing the initial aim of the project, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will invest about US$300 million in fundamental research this year, said CEO Steve Ballmer at a Tokyo news conference. But that figure represents only a small part of the company's overall spending on research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft as a company will invest US$9.5 billion into innovations to drive cloud computing, new screens and new application types," Ballmer said. "It's that RD effort that gives us products like Windows 7 or some of the innovations you see in our search engine, Bing, or the kind of work we're doing in the new release of Microsoft Office 2010."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"US$9.5 billion is a bigger RD investment than any other company in the world and it reflects our fundamental optimism about what's possible and the need to drive very quickly to this new world of three screens and could computing," he said, referring to Microsoft's new concept of connecting with users via the three screens of a PC, cell phone and television and manage data in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's deal with Yahoo under which the software maker's new Bing search engine will be used to power Yahoo searches and Yahoo will sell premium advertising for both companies could be expanded overseas, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's possible we would extend that partnership outside of the U.S. but we'll have to wait and see until we actually are able to get approval and consummate our partnership with Yahoo inside the U.S. and perhaps there'll be news on that some other day," he told a Tokyo news conference after being asked if a similar deal would happen in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10-year search plan was originally announced in July with hopes of hammering out a deal by Oct. 27 but the companies missed the deadline. A day later they said talks will be extended for an unspecified period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal also faces scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice, which has begun studying if the broader competitive landscape would be impacted by the proposed search engine tie-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Microsoft and Yahoo trail in the search market behind Google, which enjoyed a 71-percent market share in the U.S. in October, according to data from Hitwise. Yahoo had a 16 percent share and Microsoft's Bing was third with just under 10 percent of the search market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders in Exchange Archiving and Disaster Recovery Collaborate to Reduce the
Cost of Storing, Retaining, Retrieving and Recovering Exchange Data in a Unified
Solution
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Mimosa Systems, the leader in next-generation email, file, and SharePoint
archiving solutions, today announced further integration betweenMimosa
NearPointTM and NetApp storage and data management solutions. Together, the two
companies have developed a comprehensive solution for shadowless archiving,
storage management and data protection for Microsoft Exchange environments. 

The Mimosa NearPoint archive leverages NetApp`s SnapshotTM technology as the
source for archived data and the compliant archival of data capture for all
Exchange database transactions and events. This includes all email, moves,
message deletes, calendar items and contacts. In addition, customers can
simplify application data management leveraging NetApp`s SnapManager for
Microsoft Exchange, which automates complex, manual, and time-consuming
processes associated with the backup, recovery, and verification of Exchange
Server databases while eliminating the need to implement Exchange Journaling. 

"Today`s business users rely on Microsoft Exchange as a business-critical
application. As a result, uncontrolled email growth can be crippling to IT
budgets," said Patrick Rogers, vice president of Solutions Marketing for NetApp.
"Together, NetApp and Mimosa are working to deliver deeper integration to
curtail the spiraling management costs IT organizations face in storing,
retaining, retrieving, and recovering Exchange data." 

A good example of the value of Mimosa and NetApp`s integration is at work in the
Chichester School District. With 4,000 K-12 students supported by a teaching
staff of 700, the Chichester School District in Boothwyn, Pa. protects its data
using a NetApp SAN. To further safeguard and manage its email content,
Chichester standardized on Mimosa NearPoint to enable simplified content
management, disaster recovery and record retention requirements in a unified
solution. 

"We needed an archiving solution to free our users from mailbox limit
constraints and reduce our overall storage costs," said Tim McGrath, senior
network administrator, Chichester School District. "Mimosa NearPoint was the
only solution we evaluated that could deliver an all in one solution without
impacting the performance of our Exchange server. The expanded integration
between Mimosa NearPoint and NetApp`s SnapManager for Exchange will deliver
additional value to organizations that need to archive and store content
long-term for compliance purposes." 

In addition to the new integration with NetApp SnapManager for Exchange, Mimosa
NearPoint also offers comprehensive integration with several other NetApp
technologies, including NetApp SnapManager for SQL Server, SnapDrive,
SnapMirror, and FlexVol. The integration leverages NetApp`s cascading Snapshot
technology for archived data protection, resulting in a combined solution that
features a storage footprint that is smaller to deploy, faster to recover and
lower in overall management costs. 

The NetApp-Mimosa solution also centralizes the management of disaster recovery
and retention policies so IT organizations can assure compliance with corporate
governance and regulatory mandates while streamlining overall storage management
processes for user generated content including email, calendar information, IMs
and files. Ultimately, this reduces overall management costs while increasing IT
administration staff productivity. 

"Our ongoing integration partnership with NetApp enables Mimosa to assure
seamless protection of the entire messaging environment - from the Exchange
Server to the archive while lowering storage costs," said T.M. Ravi, CEO, Mimosa
Systems. "The NetApp-Mimosa combination assures the best-in-class archiving
companies demand for the critical Exchange data that has become the vital core
of their business operations." 

Mimosa NearPoint is the industry`s most comprehensive unstructured information
management software solution for email, files, and instant messages, enabling
archiving, eDiscovery, storage management, and recovery in a unified solution.

&lt;p&gt;The Texas Secretary of State's office has pulled its voter registration systems out of an ongoing $863 million data center consolidation project being handled by IBM because of data security and disaster recoverability fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was prompted by an incident in August when a server being managed by IBM crashed resulting in a 13-day outage of the office's business records filing system, a report in the  Austin American Statesman  said today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident exposed "weaknesses" in IBM's ability to recover lost data a spokesman from the Secretary of State's office is quoted as saying. It prompted awareness of how a similar failure of the agency's statewide voter registration system at election time would have jeopardized the ability of counties in Texas to verify new voters as mandated under federal law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the concerns expressed by the Secretary of State's office, Texas Governor Rick Perry and the state's Department of Information Resources, which is overseeing the IBM contract, gave permission for the agency to withdraw its election systems from the contract, the newspaper said. Following its withdrawal from the IBM project, the agency will set up its own data center with two separate back-up locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official description of the work that IBM was performing for the Secretary of State's office shows that the project started in November 2004 and was supposed to have been completed by January 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the contract, IBM was supposed to have helped Texas build a statewide voter registration system that would be complaint with Help America Vote Act standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system known as the Texas Election Administration Management, or TEAM, system will replace the existing Texas Voter Registration System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that IBM has run into problems over its handling of the seven-year contract under which it is merging the separate data centers of 27 Texas state agencies into two facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2008, Gov. Perry suspended the transfer of state records to IBM over concerns about server breakdowns and data backups, which he said had put more than 20 state agencies in danger of data disruptions. Perry's decision stemmed from a server crash at the Texas Attorney General's office which led to the loss of critical state data. The same thing happened again with another system belonging to the AG's office this year which resulted in data relating to Medicaid fraud cases become unavailable for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's Statesman report quoted a spokesman for Gov. Perry's office as saying that the state had lost confidence in IBM's ability to get the election systems installed and tested at the consolidated data center in a timely manner. Missed deadlines, equipment and software failures, as well as inadequate disaster recovery options had raised questions about IBM's ability to have election systems properly installed and tested, the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the 27 states agencies have expressed frustration over data backup and server failure issues related to the IBM data center consolidation project, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Texas Secretary of State Hope Andrade's office did not return requests for comment, and the Texas Department of Information Resources did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Jeff Tieszen said today that the outage at the Secretary of State agency was due to a failure with an "aged, third party piece of equipment -- a SAN -- that IBM inherited," from the agency. Plans were in place to migrate that SAN (storage area network) to a new environment when the failure occurred, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tieszen said that IBM had worked closely with the Secretary of State's office to "correct a complex situation as quickly as possible." Though the agency's systems were down "intermittently" over the course of the remediation, all data was recovered and the SAN environment has been upgraded he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM continues to support the current TEAM voter registration system during the transition," he said. He added that the system performed "smoothly and without incident" during the Nov.3 elections in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tieszen also said that after last year's data loss at the Texas AG's office, IBM has made improvements across the environment to mitigate the chances of something similar happening again. "As a result, after the recent incident, all data was restored," he said referring the incident at the OAG's earlier this year involving Medicaid data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

Findings from Pfizer-Sponsored Study Presented as Late-Breaker at American
College of Chest Physicians Annual Meeting
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


New study results showed that 42.3 percent of smokers with mild-to-moderate
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who took CHANTIX/CHAMPIX&#174;
(varenicline) were able to quit smoking and remain abstinent during the last
four weeks of treatment (weeks 9-12) compared with 8.8 percent of those given
placebo (p&lt;0.0001). These findings were presented by investigators at CHEST
2009, the 75th annual international scientific assembly of the American College
of Chest Physicians (ACCP). 

"Quitting smoking is of paramount importance for all smokers, particularly those
with a smoking-related illness, such as COPD," said Dr. Donald Tashkin, study
investigator, emeritus professor of medicine at University of California, Los
Angeles. "This study shows that varenicline is an effective means of smoking
cessation for a highly nicotine-dependent, difficult-to-treat group of patients.
The safety profile of varenicline in this study was consistent with its
pre-approval clinical trials." 

Up to one-half of all people who smoke may eventually develop COPD, a serious
illness that includes both chronic bronchitis and emphysema.1,2 More than 12
million people in the United States are diagnosed with COPD, and 80 to 90
percent of them are smokers.3,4 Further, approximately 24 million U.S. adults
have evidence of impaired lung function, suggesting that many people who smoke
may have COPD and not yet realize it.5 Worldwide, COPD currently affects 210
million people and is expected to become the world`s third leading cause of
death by 2030.6

"We at Pfizer want to help people quit smoking," said Dr. Briggs W. Morrison,
senior vice president, Primary Care Medicines Development Group at Pfizer. "We
sponsored this trial to offer healthcare providers additional information on
smokers who are at risk for or diagnosed with COPD, who might especially benefit
from quitting. This is just one of several planned and ongoing studies of
varenicline that we hope will enhance the medical community`s understanding of
this important medicine." 

According to international treatment guidelines from the Global Initiative for
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), quitting smoking is the single most
effective--and cost-effective--intervention to prevent COPD and slow its
progression.7 The guidelines recommend that all smokers, including those who may
be at risk for COPD and those who already have the disease, be offered the most
intensive smoking cessation intervention feasible, such as medication and
support.7

About the Study

The multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 499 adults (at
least 35 years of age) who had smoked an average of 10 cigarettes or more per
day in the year before enrollment. Study participants had mild-to-moderate COPD
and smoked for an average of 41 years. Participants had a high level of nicotine
dependence as indicated by the average Fagerstr&#246;m Test for Nicotine Dependence
score of 6.1 (on a 10-point scale). 

Study participants were randomized to twelve weeks of treatment with either
varenicline (n=248) or placebo (n=251) and were followed to week 52 in a blinded
post-treatment phase. All participants received smoking cessation counseling
throughout the study. The primary efficacy objective was to compare 12 weeks of
treatment with varenicline (1 mg twice daily) to placebo for smoking cessation
in smokers with mild-to-moderate COPD, and to evaluate abstinence from smoking
for the 40 weeks after the treatment period. The safety objective was to gather
safety data for 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline or placebo in smokers
with mild-to-moderate COPD. 

During the last four weeks of treatment (weeks 9-12), 42.3 percent of study
participants with mild-to-moderate COPD who were randomized to take varenicline
remained abstinent compared with 8.8 percent of those given placebo (p&lt;0.0001).
At the end of 52 weeks, 18.6 percent of participants who took varenicline
remained abstinent, compared with 5.6 percent of participants randomized to take
placebo (p&lt;0.0001). 

Varenicline was generally well-tolerated in the study. Treatment-emergent
serious adverse events occurred in 2.8 percent of study participants treated
with varenicline compared with 4.4 percent of those given placebo. 

Certain COPD patients were excluded from this study, including those with
serious medical conditions, such as mental illness. There was one suicidal
ideation event for placebo and no such event for varenicline. Incidences of
other psychiatric adverse events were low and similar between varenicline and
placebo. 

The most common adverse events reported in the study were nausea (27.0 percent
for varenicline vs. 8.0 percent for placebo), abnormal dreams (10.9 percent vs.
2.8 percent), upper respiratory tract infection (9.7 percent vs. 8.4 percent),
insomnia (9.7 percent vs. 6.0 percent), headache (8.1 percent vs. 8.0 percent),
flatulence (7.3 percent vs. 5.2 percent), and vomiting (6.5 percent vs. 2.4
percent). 

This trial was sponsored by Pfizer Inc. 

CHANTIX/CHAMPIX&#174; (varenicline) is a prescription medicine to help adults 18 and
over stop smoking. Adults who smoke may benefit from quit smoking support
programs and/or counseling during their quit attempt. It`s possible that
patients might slip up and smoke while taking varenicline. If patients slip up,
they can stay on varenicline and keep trying to quit. 

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Some people have had changes in behavior, hostility, agitation, depressed mood,
suicidal thoughts or actions while using varenicline to help them quit smoking.
Some people had these symptoms when they began taking varenicline, and others
developed them after several weeks of treatment or after stopping varenicline.
If you, your family or caregiver notice agitation, hostility, depression or
changes in behavior, thinking, or mood that are not typical for you, or you
develop suicidal thoughts or actions, anxiety, panic, aggression, anger, mania,
abnormal sensations, hallucinations, paranoia or confusion, stop taking
varenicline and call your doctor right away. Also tell your doctor about any
history of depression or other mental health problems before taking varenicline,
as these symptoms may worsen while taking varenicline. 

Some people can have serious skin reactions while taking varenicline, some of
which can become life-threatening. These can include rash, swelling, redness,
and peeling of the skin. Some people can have allergic reactions to varenicline,
some of which can be life-threatening and include: swelling of the face, mouth,
and throat that can cause trouble breathing. If you have these symptoms or have
a rash with peeling skin or blisters in your mouth, stop taking varenicline and
get medical attention right away. 

The most common side effects include nausea (30%), sleep problems, constipation,
gas, and/or vomiting. Side effects that are bothersome or don`t go away should

&lt;p&gt;Parade Floats To Represent Company`s Live Positively Commitment
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Few brands can claim the inextricable link that Coca-Cola shares with one of the
world`s most beloved figures, Santa Claus. For nearly 80 years, Coca-Cola and
Santa have been refreshing families and sharing happiness during the holiday
season and this year is no different. Santa and the world`s best known brand
will spread the magic of the holidays as the presenting sponsor of "The 2009
Hollywood Christmas Parade/Live Positively Presented by Coca-Cola". The festive
parade will be held in Hollywood, Calif., on Sunday, November 29 at 6 p.m. 

"Coca-Cola is proud to be the presenting sponsor of The 2009 Hollywood Christmas
Parade, where Los Angeles residents come to share the joy of the holiday
season," said Luis Fernando Ramirez, vice president &amp; general manager, West
Region, Coca-Cola North America. "During these times of family togetherness we
want to give people a reason to cheer, open some happiness and share the magic
of the holidays. This iconic parade allows us to do just that and give back to a
city that means a lot to Coca-Cola." 

As part of the parade, the Company will have six interactive floats. Each float
will have a theme that embodies Coca-Cola`s `Live Positively` philosophy, which
guides the Company`s commitment to making positive contributions to its
customers, consumers and communities. 

Introducing the Theme of the Floats

* Active Living: For more than 80 years Coca-Cola has helped make Olympic dreams
come true. This float represents Coca-Cola`s role as a champion of living a
healthy lifestyle and engaging in regular physical activity. 
* Education: Coca-Cola has been a supporter of education for more than 100
years. Since 1986, Coca-Cola has contributed more than $50 million in
scholarships to students across the U.S. This float illustrates Coca-Cola`s
commitment to education through a message of hope and optimism. 
* Environment: Coca-Cola invests in environmental initiatives focused on three
areas - water stewardship, sustainable packaging, and energy management and
climate protection. This float uses a family of Coca-Cola polar bears to
symbolize the Company`s commitment to the environment. 
* Family Togetherness: Happiness is the feeling that people get when they`re
around family and friends. For 123 years Coca-Cola has been bringing people
together and spreading happiness every time they open an ice-cold Coke. This
float shows that all you need for fun is family, friends and a little Coca-Cola.

* Community: Coca-Cola, volunteerism and giving back to the community are at the
core of everything it does. This float represents `generosity` and depicts how
the holiday season is a time to be generous and spread happiness to all. 
* Holiday Happiness: No other brand has been so closely tied to the holiday
season, the happiness it evokes and Santa than Coca-Cola. Santa serves as a
reminder of the importance of celebrating happiness, togetherness and giving
during the holiday season.

In 1931, The Coca-Cola Company commissioned Swedish-American artist Haddon
Sundblom to lend his artistic genius to its holiday campaign. The artist`s
depiction of Saint Nicholas evolved into the picture-perfect look of "Father
Christmas" - the man in the red and white suit with the big brass belt buckle,
rosy cheeks, handsome white beard and twinkling eyes. Still cherished today,
Sundblom`s image of the Coca-Cola Santa Claus has become one of the most
recognizable emblems of the holiday season around the world. 

The 2009 Hollywood Christmas Parade/Live Positively Presented by Coca-Cola

The Hollywood Christmas Parade has been presented annually since 1928, marking
more than 80 years for this American tradition. This is the first time in over
80 years that the parade will air as a two-hour television primetime event.
MyNetworkTV will telecast the parade on Thursday, December 10, 2009 from 8:00 -
10:00 p.m. (Local Time)/7:00-9:00 p.m. (Central), with an Encore Presentation on

&lt;p&gt;Daughter of RFK Appalled by "Chevron`s Chernobyl"
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
The massive oil contamination for which Chevron faces a potential $27 billion
liability in Ecuador`s courts is a "clear violation" of the rights of indigenous
peoples to life, security, and self-determination, said Kerry Kennedy, a human
rights advocate and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, in an opinion piece
posted on the Huffington Post this week. 

Kennedy recently visited an area of Ecuador which borders Colombia and is
considered the site of the worst oil-related contamination on the planet at the
invitation of the local indigenous communities. She returned "appalled" at the
"nightmarish landscape" which the plaintiffs estimate is at least thirty times
worse than the Exxon Valdez spill, according to the article. 

"&#8230;Beneath the cloud cover and canopy, the jungle is a tangle of oil slicks,
festering sludge, and rusted pipeline," Kennedy wrote in reference to what is
left of the once-pristine rainforest. "Smokestacks sprout from the ground,
spewing throat-burning fumes into the air. Wastewater from unlined pits seeps
into the groundwater and flows into the rivers and streams." 

Kennedy added: "I saw a poisonous pit abandoned by Texaco in 1974 and never used
by any other company. The pipes leading from that pit have clear liquid running
from them. When I put that liquid to my nose, it smelled like gasoline. It runs
directly into an adjoining stream, which is the main source of drinking water
for people who live along its banks." 

Texaco, which operated in the region from 1964 to 1992, is accused of dumping
more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste directly into the waterways and
forests of the Amazon and abandoning 916 unlined waste pits. Evidence at trial
shows high rates of cancer and other oil-related health problems, while five
indigenous groups maintain their traditional lifestyles have been decimated and
that an area roughly the size of Rhode Island has been poisoned. 

Last year, a court-appointed Special Master who reviewed all of the evidence in
the case found damages could be as high as $27.3 billion and that Chevron is
responsible for at least 1,401 excess cancer deaths. A final decision on
liability and damages is expected in 2010. 

"I had heard about what has been called `Chevron's Chernobyl in the Amazon` for
years," Kennedy wrote. "But nothing could prepare me for the horror I witnessed
&#8230; Texaco knew people would die because of what they were doing, and they ignored
it. At last count, 1,400 children, women, and men have died of illnesses
directly attributed to Texaco's contamination." 

Most of the scientific evidence in the Special Master report comes from an
estimated 50,000 chemical samplings results produced by Chevron during
court-ordered judicial inspections that document extensive cancer-causing toxins
at its own well sites, which were mostly built in the 1970s. The plaintiffs have
long asserted that Chevron proved the case against itself. 

Kennedy called on Chevron`s shareholders and citizens to take action to stem the
humanitarian crisis in the region, saying the company "has tossed up one delay
after another" and does not appear interested in living up to its stated
commitment to support human rights. 

Kennedy is the second high-profile American to visit the region and come back
questioning Chevron`s account. U.S. Rep. James P. McGovern, who toured the
contaminated sites last year, wrote in a letter to President Barack Obama: "As
an American citizen, the degradation and contamination left behind by this U.S.
company in a poor part of the world made me angry and ashamed." 

Kerry Kennedy began working in the field of human rights in 1981, when she
investigated abuses committed by U.S. immigration officials against refugees
from El Salvador. In 1988, she founded the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for
Human Rights. She has led over 40 human rights delegations across the globe. 

Upon returning from Ecuador in mid-October, Kennedy wrote to Chevron CEO David
O`Reilly and the Chevron Board of Directors to request a meeting to exchange
ideas about Ecuador. Kennedy said neither O`Reilly nor the Chevron Board has
responded to her request. 

To date, no senior member of Chevron`s management team or Board of Directors has
visited the impacted area of Ecuador, according to the plaintiffs.

ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has commenced offers to exchange (the

2009 (the "early exchange date"). The exchange offers expire at 12:00 a.m. EST,
on Monday, December 7, 2009 (the "expiration date"). We are conducting the

&lt;p&gt;Automate the Process of Managing Collections, Purchases and Invoicing - Abandon
Paper for Good!


ALPHARETTA, Ga.--(Business Wire)--
Equisys, one of the leading developers of software solutions for document
management and delivery, and a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, announced today
the launch of Zetadocs for Microsoft Dynamics NAV 3.0. 

Zetadocs 3.0 makes it much simpler for NAV users to enable electronic delivery
and filing of financial documents. Installation is now so simple, it can be
deployed on an NAV test system in a couple of hours. It is also much quicker and
easier to send larger batches of documents and multiple users can now process
captured documents simultaneously. 

The release of Zetadocs for NAV 3.0 is the latest version of Zetadocs for NAV,
released by Equisys and certified for Microsoft Dynamics NAV in 2007, which
enables smart electronic document management and delivery for NAV. Zetadocs
uniquely combines the process of automating the electronic creation, delivery
and archiving of batches of financial documents, with a set of tools that let
NAV and non-NAV users alike quickly find all documents that relate to a
financial transaction. 

Other changes include:

* Fileserver archive option - allows the optional use of SharePoint. Companies
that don't use SharePoint can archive documents to shared folders on their
fileserver instead. 
* Silent client - enables batches of documents to be sent in the without
interruption. 
* Wider version support - compatibility with Navision 3.60, and 3.70 in addition
to NAV 4.0, 5.0, 2009.

"In times where every business is facing increasing costs and a requirement to
be ever more efficient," said Chris Oswald, CEO of Equisys, "Zetadocs can add
real business value by removing a substantial proportion of the costs most
businesses allocate to managing their financial transactions. From automating
the process of invoicing through to managing collections, Zetadocs takes away
the need for paper and in a few mouse clicks makes documents available to
employees, customers and partners that need to see them." 

And return on investment is still very important. Zetadocs for NAV capitalizes
on customers` investment in Microsoft Dynamics and other Microsoft technologies,
including SharePoint, Windows Workflow Foundation, and Microsoft Office. By
eliminating the mountains of paper within their offices, many of our customers
see an ROI in a few months. If paper is strangling your business, the
integration of Zetadocs for NAV 3.0 is the tool to abandon paper for good! 

Zetadocs for NAV is sold exclusively through Microsoft Dynamics Certified
Partners. For more background and product information about Zetadocs for NAV

&lt;p&gt;Nov 6 (Reuters) - J.P Morgan raised Macy's Inc (M.N) to
"overweight" from "neutral," citing improving monthly
comparable store sales at the department store operator and a
potential for earnings upside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We expect a healthy EPS beat in the third quarter ...and
see potential upside to fourth-quarter earnings," the brokerage
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With improving same-store sales trends, higher-margin
private label and exclusive products outperforming, and SGA
dollars remaining down year-over-year, Macy's is poised to beat
current consensus estimates materially, the brokerage added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "My Macy's" localization initiative and an improving
New York City shopping backdrop would help improve top-line
results, the brokerage wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also raised its price target on the stock by
$4 to $23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cincinnati-based Macy's stock was up 3 percent at $18.50
Friday in trading before the bell. It closed at $18.02 Thursday
on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Gesamtf&#246;rderung &#252;bersteigt eine Milliarde Barrel
IRVING, Texas, USA--(Business Wire)--
Die Tochtergesellschaft der Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM), Esso
Exploration Angola (Block 15) Limited (Esso Angola), feiert 15 Jahre sichere und
erfolgreiche Betriebst&#228;tigkeit in Angola. Esso Angola und ihre Partner beim
Projekt Block 15 arbeiten mit der Regierung von Angola zusammen, um den Wert der
Ressourcen des Landes zu maximieren und langfristigen Nutzen f&#252;r die
angolanische Bev&#246;lkerung zu schaffen. 

Im September &#252;berschritt die kumulative F&#246;rderung in diesem Block die H&#252;rde von
einer Milliarde Barrel und f&#246;rdert derzeit &#252;ber 600.000 Barrel &#214;l pro Tag. Es
ist der derzeit gr&#246;&#223;te F&#246;rderblock im Land. Seit 1994 haben das Unternehmen und
seine Partner Ressourcenfunde von insgesamt fast f&#252;nf Milliarden Barrel
&#214;l&#228;quivalent gemeldet. 

&#8222;Wir sind stolz auf die beeindruckende Bilanz des sicheren und verl&#228;sslichen
Betriebs von Block 15 sowie auf seinen Beitrag zur wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung
in Angola", sagte Andy Swiger, Senior Vice President von ExxonMobil. &#8222;Wir freuen
uns auf die Fortsetzung unserer Partnerschaft mit der Regierung von Angola sowie
darauf, zur &#228;u&#223;erst vielversprechenden Zukunft des Landes beizutragen." 

Esso Angola setzte Spitzentechnologien ein, um die Erschlie&#223;ung der
Kohlenwasserstoffe von Block 15 so schnell und kosteneffizient wie m&#246;glich aus
der Planungsphase in die Produktion zu &#252;berf&#252;hren. Dazu war die Installation von
f&#252;nf riesigen schwimmenden F&#246;rder-, Lager- und Verladeschiffen (FPSOs) n&#246;tig
sowie von zwei &#214;lbohr-Zugseilverankerungsplattformen und einem komplexen Netz
von Unterwassereinrichtungen. Au&#223;erdem wurden umfassende technische Schulungen
durchgef&#252;hrt, Weiterbildungsma&#223;nahmen erm&#246;glicht und es wurden Arbeitspl&#228;tze f&#252;r
Angolaner geschaffen. Au&#223;erdem wurden nach M&#246;glichkeit lokale Waren und
Serviceleistungen in Anspruch genommen.. 

Die &#214;lerschlie&#223;ung in Block 15 macht weiterhin Fortschritte und ein Projekt ist
in Gang gesetzt worden, das bei der &#214;lf&#246;rderung anfallende Gas der Angola LNG
Entwicklung zuzuf&#252;hren. 

Esso Angola leistet Beitr&#228;ge f&#252;r Gesundheits-, Bildungs- und
Infrastrukturprojekte auf Gemeindeebene in ganz Angola. Im Verlauf der letzten
f&#252;nf Jahre haben Esso Angola, Block 15 und ExxonMobil mehr als 40 Millionen US
Dollar in Gesundheitsprogramme investiert, die sich mit der Bek&#228;mpfung von
Malaria und HIV/Aids besch&#228;ftigen. Andere Initiativen unterst&#252;tzen die Schul-
und technische Berufsausbildung von Frauen und M&#228;dchen in Angola. Die
Gesundheits- und Bildungsprogramme von Esso Angola erfuhren 2008 gro&#223;e
Anerkennung vom US-Au&#223;enministerium. Dar&#252;ber hinaus unterst&#252;tzen Esso Angola,
Block 15 und die ExxonMobil Foundation ein Projekt zum Schutz der
Rappenantilope, die bis vor wenigen Jahren als ausgestorben galt. 

Mit einer Beteiligung von 40 Prozent ist Esso Exploration Angola (Block 15)
Limited Betreiber von Block 15. Die anderen Partner sind BP Exploration (Angola)
Limited (26,67 Prozent), ENI Angola Exploration B.V. (20 Prozent) und Statoil
Angola Block 15 A.S. (13,3 Prozent). Der Konzession&#228;r ist Sonangol E.P.

plataformas do tipo TLP de cabe&#231;a de po&#231;o ("Wellhead Tension Leg Platforms") e
uma rede complexa de componentes submarinos. O trabalho envolveu, igualmente,
uma forma&#231;&#227;o t&#233;cnica significativa, maior desenvolvimento e mais postos de
trabalho para os Angolanos, bem como a aquisi&#231;&#227;o de bens e servi&#231;os locais. 

Por outro lado, prosseguem os trabalhos de desenvolvimento dos recursos
petrol&#237;feros do Bloco 15 e, ao mesmo tempo, est&#225; em curso um novo projecto que
se destina ao fornecimento do g&#225;s associado &#224; produ&#231;&#227;o petrol&#237;fera para o

projectos de infra-estruturas em prol das comunidades em todo o pa&#237;s. Ao longo
dos &#250;ltimos cinco anos, a Esso Angola, o Bloco 15 e a ExxonMobil investiram mais
de 40 milh&#245;es de d&#243;lares dos Estados Unidos em apoio aos programas de
assist&#234;ncia m&#233;dica para o combate &#224; mal&#225;ria e ao VIH/SIDA. Outros programas t&#234;m
proporcionado oportunidades de educa&#231;&#227;o e forma&#231;&#227;o t&#233;cnico-profissional a
mulheres e raparigas em Angola. Os programas da Esso Angola nas &#225;reas de sa&#250;de e
educa&#231;&#227;o mereceram o reconhecimento do Departamento de Estado dos EUA em 2008.
Al&#233;m disso, a Esso Angola, o Bloco 15 e a Funda&#231;&#227;o ExxonMobil apoiam um projecto

&lt;p&gt;Total Production Exceeds One Billion Barrels
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) affiliate Esso Exploration Angola (Block 15)
Limited (Esso Angola) is celebrating 15 years of safe and successful operations
in Angola. Esso Angola and its venture partners in Block 15 have worked with the
government of Angola to maximize the value of the country`s resources, creating
long-term benefits for the Angolan people. 

The block surpassed one billion barrels in cumulative production in September
and is currently producing over 600,000 barrels of oil per day. It is currently
the single largest producing block in the country, and since 1994, the company
and its co-venturers have announced resource discoveries totaling nearly 5
billion oil-equivalent barrels. 

"We are proud of Block 15`s impressive record of safe, reliable operations and
its contribution to economic development in Angola," said Andy Swiger, senior
vice president for ExxonMobil. "We look forward to our continued partnership
with the government of Angola and to being a part of the country`s very
promising future." 

Esso Angola has applied world-class technologies to move Block 15 hydrocarbon
development from front-end engineering and design to production as quickly and
cost-effectively as possible. This included the installation of five massive
floating production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs), two wellhead
tension leg platforms, and a complex network of subsea components. It also
involved significant technical training, development and jobs for Angolans and
the purchase of local goods and services. 

Continued oil development in Block 15 is progressing, and a project to deliver
associated gas from oil production to the Angola LNG development is under way. 

Esso Angola contributes to community health, education, and infrastructure
projects across Angola. Over the past five years, Esso Angola, Block 15, and
ExxonMobil have invested more than U.S. $40 million in support for health-care
programs that combat the spread of malaria and HIV/AIDS. Other programs support
educational and vocational-technical training opportunities for women and girls
in Angola. The Esso Angola health-care and education programs earned recognition
from the U.S. State Department in 2008. Additionally, Esso Angola, Block 15 and
the ExxonMobil Foundation support a project to help protect the Giant Sable
Antelope, which until a few years ago was believed to be extinct. 

Esso Exploration Angola (Block 15) Limited is the operator of Block 15 with 40
percent interest. The other co-venturers are BP Exploration (Angola) Limited
(26.67 percent), ENI Angola Exploration B.V. (20 percent) and Statoil Angola
Block 15 A.S. (13.33 percent). Sonangol E.P. is the concessionaire. 

Cautionary Statement: Statements regarding future events or conditions in this
release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project
plans, could differ materially due to changes in long-term market prices of oil
and gas; changes in law or government regulation; the outcome of commercial
negotiations; unforeseen technical difficulties; and other factors discussed
under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" on the Investors section of
ExxonMobil's website. References in this release to resources and oil-equivalent
barrels include quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved
reserves under U.S. SEC regulations, but that we believe will ultimately be
produced.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 6 (Reuters) - Schroders (SDR.L) said on Friday
it had hired Hardeep Dogra from Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to assist
Clive Dennis on the recently-launched Global Managed Currency
Fund LP68012571.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dogra, who joined Schroders in October, worked as an
associate in the fixed income, currency and commodities group at
Goldman Sachs International in London, focusing on interest rate
and inflation analysis in global bond markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund is Schroders' first ever currency fund, a
long-only, actively managed vehicle investing predominantly in
cash instruments, and has some $43 million under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since inception on June 2 it is up 0.13 percent, compared
with a benchmark global currency index return of -0.13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is currently overweighting commodity related currencies,
Scandinavia, Asia and the euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Institutional investors such as pension funds have shown
more interest in investing in currency as a standalone asset
class due to perceived diversification benefits and a relatively
strong showing during the financial crisis.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats for wider distribution)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Nov 9 (Reuters) - The first red-chip and foreign
companies could list their shares on the Shanghai stock exchange
next year, Jing Ulrich, chairman of China equities at J.P.
Morgan, said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Red chips are Chinese firms that have their business on the
mainland but are incorporated outside China and listed on
overseas bourses, usually Hong Kong. They are currently
prohibited from selling shares inside China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Within the next 12 months there should be at least a handful
of red chip companies or foreign companies listed in Shanghai,"
Ulrich told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She mentioned China Mobile (0941.HK) and CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK)
as red chips that might sell shares in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked about the attitude of Chinese regulators, Ulrich said:
"There is strong support for this initiative, and I think the
conditions are ripe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said listings by red chips and foreign companies would
open up new choices for Chinese investors and allowing foreign
companies to tap into a market with ample liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number of foreign companies, including global banking giant
HSBC (0005.HK)(HSBA.L), have expressed interest in listing on the
new board mooted in Shanghai for overseas firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert McCooey, a senior vice president of the NASDAQ OMX
Group (NDAQ.O), said his exchange had communicated its interest
both to China's securities regulator and to the Shanghai stock
exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will continue to have dialogue with them and see how the
international board progresses. We are interested in becoming
part of it if it makes sense at the time," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NASDAQ is the largest overseas bourse for Chinese companies,
with 117 listings, and McCooey said a NASDAQ listing in Shanghai
would be a reciprocal show of support for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYSE Euronext NYX.NNYX.PA, the parent of the New York
Stock Exchange and a rival to NASDAQ, is also keen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We hope that NYSE Euronext is in the first group of
(overseas) companies to list, but we don't know if it will be the
first," Ronald Keng, NYSE Euronext's head of international
listings for Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Asia, told
the Hong Kong Economic Times in remarks published on Monday.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is lifting a salary freeze it put in place last year, according to an internal memo, a sign of its growing confidence in the economic recovery after it reported several quarters of improving investment-banking profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, the bank said it is adding more than 300 staff to its branches to support a $4 billion increase in small business lending. The initiative, like its mortgage modification program for homeowners, is an effort to show it is extending lending and helping to revive the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As year-end bonus season approaches, bankers' compensation looms as a hot-button issue again. When the financial crisis was deepening, the industry came under fire from lawmakers for paying large bonuses to its executives even as it was being propped up with taxpayer money and cutting loans to a trickle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision by JPMorgan to lift the salary freeze is part of its year-end performance and compensation review process, according to the memo from human resources director John Donnelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo was confirmed by a spokesman for the firm, which has returned $25 billion it got from the government -- unlike peers Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan believes its pay practices for top executives follow best principles, Donnelly wrote in the memo, noting that the bank's senior executives receive most of their compensation in stock that vests over multiple years and it eliminated so-called golden parachutes for executives in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Jamie Dimon did not receive a bonus last year and it is not yet clear whether he will get one this year. For 2008, he received about $19.7 million in total compensation, including a $1 million salary and stock and options awarded in previous years, according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank will also return to matching eligible U.S. employees' 401(k) pension plan contributions, after suspending those payments earlier this year, according to the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve last month issued bank pay guidelines aimed at curbing incentives for risk-taking that officials say contributed to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd was expected on Tuesday to unveil draft legislation to tighten bank and capital market regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is possible that the regulatory rules will change compensation standards and we will, of course, adhere to all regulatory standards," Donnelly wrote in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will continue to be committed to being highly competitive and paying for performance," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has publicly defended the bank's need to pay for talented staff, although at a recent industry gathering he said the bank would not actively seek to hire from banks including Citi and Bank of America that still face pay restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank will pay a $500 special award to employees globally that receive less than $60,000 in total compensation, Donnelly wrote in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As JPMorgan announced it was boosting staffing for its small business lending, the Federal Reserve on Monday announced the percentage of banks tightening lending standards declined in the third quarter, while the pace at which loan demand was falling eased as the economy began to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While showing credit was still tight and loan demand soft, the Fed's October survey of bank loan officers signaled a further easing in the number of banks tightening credit, which hit a peak last year in the depths of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan this summer repaid $25 billion it received from the U.S. government's Troubled Asset Relief Program but the Treasury still holds warrants to buy the bank's stock as part of that program. The bank has said it is letting the Treasury auction the warrants, rather than pay an inflated price to buy them back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup and Bank of America have yet to return the money they got from the government and still face pay restrictions for their top executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMAX Corporation (Nasdaq:IMAX)
(TSX:IMX) and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures today announced that Disney's
A Christmas Carol, the spectacular Disney Digital 3D(TM) holiday release from
director Robert Zemeckis and starring Jim Carrey, grossed $4.2 million from 181
IMAX(R) theatres domestically from November 6th through November 8, 2009,
registering 14% of the film's total domestic gross of $30 million on
approximately 3% of the screens. The IMAX release generated a per screen average
of $23,000. The film also grossed $560,000 internationally from 28 IMAX theatres
from November 5th through November 8th, 2009. There are 29 more international
IMAX locations scheduled to open the film in the weeks ahead, with IMAX
locations in Japan and Spain opening this coming weekend.

Disney's A Christmas Carol: An IMAX 3D Experience has been digitally re-mastered
into the unparalleled image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience(R) with
proprietary IMAX DMR(R) (Digital Re-mastering) technology.

Commenting on the announcement, Chuck Viane, president, Walt Disney Studios
Motion Pictures Distribution, said, "We're pleased with how the film performed
this weekend and we're particularly impressed with the significant contribution
that the IMAX network made to the overall opening results. We look forward to
continued success as we head into the holiday season."

"Based on our experience with the IMAX releases of Robert Zemeckis' last two
films (The Polar Express and Beowulf) and given this is the only 3D release
currently in theatres, we expect the IMAX per screen average to stay strong over
the next several weeks," said IMAX CEO Richard L. Gelfond. "The IMAX theatre
network's significant contribution to the film's overall box office results is
very encouraging as it demonstrates the growing consumer appetite for The IMAX
Experience."

"Given the natural connection between the unique vision of Robert Zemeckis and
his history with IMAX(R) 3D, this initial performance bodes well for IMAX
theatres in the coming weeks," added Greg Foster, Chairman and President of IMAX
Filmed Entertainment. "Disney has done a great job of calling out IMAX in its
marketing campaign, and we're very happy to be a part of a winning combination
of brands that is clearly resonating with consumers - Disney, Robert Zemeckis
and IMAX."

Robert Zemeckis takes the art of performance capture to the next level with
Disney's A Christmas Carol. This multi-sensory 3D motion picture captures the
fantastical essence of the classic Dickens tale in a groundbreaking motion
picture event. Ebeneezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) begins the Christmas holiday with
his usual miserly contempt, barking at his faithful clerk (Gary Oldman), and his
cheery nephew (Colin Firth). But when the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and
Yet to Come (all played by Carrey) take him on an eye-opening journey revealing
truths Old Scrooge is reluctant to face, he must open his heart to undo years of
ill will before it's too late.

&lt;p&gt; * To hire 325 additional bankers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Raises lending to small businesses to $10 bln in 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elinor Comlay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co JPM.N is
raising lending to small businesses by $4 billion this year and
hiring more than 300 new bankers to cater to these businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second largest U.S. bank said it now plans to add about
$10 billion in total new lending this year to companies with
annual sales of less than $20 million and it will hire about
325 bankers to help with this push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've seen from our customers some renewed vigor for
credit," said Kevin Watters, chief executive of business
banking at Chase, in an interview. "Demand has started to pick
up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The improving economy also prompted JPMorgan to increase
lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Things we're seeing in terms of some stabilization in the
economy would tell us this is a very good time to aggressively
gain market share in small business lending," Watters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like other banks that received billions of dollars in bank
bailout funds last year, JPMorgan has come under pressure from
lawmakers to boost lending to help the U.S. economy out of
recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. bank repaid its $25 billion in
Troubled Asset Relief Program funds this summer and it has
taken pains to show it is making loans and supporting the
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have never stopped lending," said Watters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This latest move follows other initiatives, including a
mortgage modification program for homeowners and a new credit
card for business customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, JPMorgan lifted on Monday a freeze on salaries
for employees earning more than $60,000, according to a memo
that a spokesman confirmed. [ID: nN09183206]

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
EOG Resources Inc. (NYSE: EOG), Grupo Televisa S.A. (NYSE: TV), OGE Energy Corp.
(NYSE: OGE), Edison International (NYSE: EIX) and Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN).

the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

EOG Resources Remains Neutral

EOG Resources Inc. (NYSE: EOG) reported third-quarter earnings of 81 cents per
share, compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents and a year-ago
profit of $2.34. Before adjusting one-time items, earnings were 2 cents per
share. Despite an increase in production volumes, earnings were down from the
year-earlier level due primarily to significantly lower commodity price
realizations. 

Total volumes during the quarter increased approximately 4% year-over-year to
195.9 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), or 2,129 million cubic feet
equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), 76% of which was natural gas and 24% liquids.
Natural gas volumes decreased 3% year-over-year, led by an approximately 6%
decrease in the U.S. volumes to 1,128 MMcf/d, and more than 2% decrease in
Canadian volumes to 219 MMcf/d. 

Grupo Televisa Reports Mixed Results

Grupo Televisa S.A. (NYSE: TV), the largest media company in Mexico, reported
mixed financial results for the third quarter 2009. Quarterly consolidated net
revenue of $970 million was an improvement of 5.5% over the prior-year quarter.
However, this was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $983 million. 

The year-over-year increase in the top-line was mainly attributable to healthy
revenue growth in Sky, Cable &amp; Telecom, Programming Exports, Pay television
Networks, and Other Business segments, partially offset by a fall in revenue in
Publishing and Television Broadcasting segments. 

OGE Energy Tops Expectations

OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE: OGE) reported third quarter earnings per share (EPS) of
$1.40, topping the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate of $1.34. However, EPS in the
reported quarter came a dime short, compared to the year-ago EPS of $1.50. 

Earnings were boosted in the reported quarter by strong results at Oklahoma Gas
and Electric Company (OG), offset by cooler weather in the OG service
territory, lower commodity prices in the Enogex midstream pipeline business and
an increase in the number of shares outstanding. 

Edison Pushes Past Estimate

Edison International's (NYSE: EIX) adjusted EPS of $1.09 in the third quarter of
fiscal 2009 pushed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 by 4 cents.
However, adjusted EPS for the quarter fell short of the year-ago $1.46 EPS. 

On a GAAP basis, the company reported quarterly EPS of $1.23, compared to $1.33
in the year-ago quarter. The discrepancy between GAAP and adjusted EPS were due
to non-cash accounting benefit from the final regulatory approval to transfer
its Mountainview power plant to utility rate base. 

Dynegy Sunk on Charges

Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) has reported a net loss of $212 million, or 25 cents per
share in the third quarter 2009, compared to a net income of $605 million, or 72
cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The net loss in the reported quarter
was primarily driven by asset impairment charges and mark-to-market losses. The
company recorded mark-to-market losses of $128 million ($78 million after tax),
compared to mark-to-market gains of $889 million ($542 million after tax) in the
year-ago quarter. 

In the reported quarter, however, adjusted earnings rose to $388 million,
compared to $269 million in the year-ago quarter. The growth was primarily
driven by the sale and assignment of a multi-year power sales contract, higher
capacity and tolling revenues and higher realized energy prices in the Midwest.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc's phoenix-like rise from the ashes has propelled its market value to $180 billion, raising the possibility that it could challenge Microsoft Corp for the technology crown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is now the world's most valuable tech company with a commanding market capitalization of $250 billion. Its Windows software is in nine out of 10 personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would take impressive execution for any company to unseat Microsoft at the top of the technology heap. But Apple, flush with cash and fat margins, has catalysts in the iPhone, the Mac PC and a highly anticipated but unconfirmed tablet device expected to launch next year, analysts and investors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Apple's revenue growth continues to outpace, driven by market-changing innovation and sticky software offerings that lead to repeat purchases," said David Dillon, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which owns both Apple and Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft is more of a value-based play, with "a strong product cycle coming with Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's revenue is still far smaller than that of its arch nemesis, but it is growing at a more rapid rate. Apple's annual revenue has more than doubled since 2005 to $36.5 billion, with earnings per share up more than four-fold to $6.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the same period, Microsoft's revenue has risen 47 percent to $58.4 billion, with EPS up 45 percent to $1.62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton Hooper, an analyst with Weitz Funds, which owns shares of Microsoft but not Apple, called the giant software company a "moderate growth story" with a strong balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rate of growth of Microsoft isn't happening nearly as fast as it is for Apple," he said. But he noted that Microsoft still has solid growth drivers, such as the corporate PC refresh cycle and its server and tools business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple trades at around 24 times forward earnings estimates, as does Google Inc, which has a similar market capitalization and is viewed as another potential challenger to Microsoft. Microsoft trades at roughly 16 times forward earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For a comparison of the companies' performance since 2005, see here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE REBIRTH OF APPLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's last quarterly results blew past Wall Street estimates and sent its shares to a record-high $208.71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the stock has retreated in recent weeks in a broad market pullback, analysts have a price target as high as $280 on Apple, which would give it a market value of $250 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following its quarterly report last month, analysts also boosted their price targets on Microsoft to as high as $36, which would take its market cap to $320 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is now visible in Microsoft's rearview mirror, but a decade ago the picture was far different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies were born in the 1970s at the dawn of the personal computer era. But by the late 1990s, Apple was struggling with annual losses, management turmoil and layoffs as the company worked to improve its operating system. Meanwhile, Microsoft was at the height of its dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1997, after years of legal wrangling, Microsoft invested $150 million in Apple -- which angered some of the Apple faithful, but which sent Apple shares up more than 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of 1998, Microsoft was the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of around $270 billion, according to an annual ranking compiled by the Financial Times. Apple was scarcely on the radar, valued at roughly $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after the return of Steve Jobs, Apple's fortunes began to improve. The company branched into consumer electronics and entertainment, and the phenomenal success of the iPod, iTunes and, in the last two years, the iPhone has remade Apple into a leading light of the technology world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erick Maronak, chief investment officer for the Victory Large Cap Growth Fund, said he would not be surprised to see Apple's market cap approach Microsoft's in the next two years, though he also likes the software company's growth prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest overriding reason why the company still has room to run is that its business is growing ... The day they introduce the tablet, that's going to drive a lot of earnings," said Maronak, whose fund owns shares in both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's shareholders have been handsomely rewarded over the past decade, with its stock up close to 900 percent. Over the same period, Microsoft's shares have fallen around 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and analysts repeatedly point to Apple's robust cash generation -- perhaps even more than its track record for innovation -- as a reason for the stock's rich valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's cash flow from operations was $3.1 billion in its most recent quarter, and it sits on a war chest of $34 billion in cash and marketable securities, with no debt, the equivalent of around $37 a share in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low interest rates and conservative tax decisions on offshore cash have helped to "collectively understate Apple's reported earnings power relative to its peers," according to a research note by Sanford Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe on a cash flow basis the stock remains attractively valued and that earnings estimates are likely to continue to increase going forward," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gabriel Madway, editing by Tiffany Wu and Gerald E. McCormick)&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, Microsoft was at the height of its dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1997, after years of legal wrangling, Microsoft invested $150 million in Apple -- which angered some of the Apple faithful, but which sent Apple shares up more than 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of 1998, Microsoft was the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of around $270 billion, according to an annual ranking compiled by the Financial Times. Apple was scarcely on the radar, valued at roughly $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after the return of Steve Jobs, Apple's fortunes began to improve. The company branched into consumer electronics and entertainment, and the phenomenal success of the iPod, iTunes and, in the last two years, the iPhone has remade Apple into a leading light of the technology world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erick Maronak, chief investment officer for the Victory Large Cap Growth Fund, said he would not be surprised to see Apple's market cap approach Microsoft's in the next two years, though he also likes the software company's growth prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest overriding reason why the company still has room to run is that its business is growing ... The day they introduce the tablet, that's going to drive a lot of earnings," said Maronak, whose fund owns shares in both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's shareholders have been handsomely rewarded over the past decade, with its stock up close to 900 percent. Over the same period, Microsoft's shares have fallen around 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and analysts repeatedly point to Apple's robust cash generation -- perhaps even more than its track record for innovation -- as a reason for the stock's rich valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's cash flow from operations was $3.1 billion in its most recent quarter, and it sits on a war chest of $34 billion in cash and marketable securities, with no debt, the equivalent of around $37 a share in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low interest rates and conservative tax decisions on offshore cash have helped to "collectively understate Apple's reported earnings power relative to its peers," according to a research note by Sanford Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe on a cash flow basis the stock remains attractively valued and that earnings estimates are likely to continue to increase going forward," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gabriel Madway, editing by Tiffany Wu and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co is lifting a salary freeze it put in place last year, according to an internal memo from human resources director John Donnelly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank, which in the summer returned $25 billion it received from the government's bank bailout fund, will also return to matching eligible U.S. employees' 401(k) pension plan contributions, after suspending those payments earlier this year, according to the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank froze the salaries of employees earning more than $60,000 last year, as financial markets globally tumbled and the investment bank Lehman Brothers failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay a $500 special award to employees globally that receive less than $60,000 in total compensation, Donnelly wrote in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to lift the salary freeze is part of the bank's year-end performance and compensation review process, according to the memo, which was confirmed by a spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks broadly have come under fire for paying large bonuses to bankers even amid the financial crisis and as year-end bonus season approaches, it has again become a hot-button issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is possible that the regulatory rules will change compensation standards and we will, of course, adhere to all regulatory standards," wrote Donnelly in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will continue to be committed to being highly competitive and paying for performance," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;Retalix to Incorporate Microsoft SQL Server 2008 With Its Retail and Supply
Chain Software

DALLAS, Nov. 9, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Retalix(R) (Nasdaq:RTLX) has announced
that it will integrate Microsoft SQL Server 2008 with its retail and supply
chain software offerings.

The Retalix products that will use Microsoft SQL Server 2008 include

 * Retalix Loyalty -- A powerful, targeted promotions and consumer
   interaction solution that delivers offers, tracks performance
   and personalizes communications. As an enterprise-wide,
   real-time, scalable system, the software seamlessly ties
   together centralized operations, marketing management, special
   promotions, IT and the shoppers themselves.

 * Retalix Demand AnalytX (DAX) -- A browser-based, demand-driven
   replenishment solution, designed specifically for food and
   fast moving consumer goods retailers to optimize inventory and
   streamline the order process. It is comprised of four core
   modules: Demand Forecasting, Inventory, Ordering, and Analytics,
   and contains unique algorithms to interpret demand and optimize
   replenishment orders.
"Microsoft SQL Server 2008 offers many new database features that will greatly
enhance our software offerings for the retail and supply chain industries," said
Roy Simrell at Retalix. "The combination of our technologies will help retailers
and distributors benefit from faster, more advanced and intuitive management
capabilities for integration in an existing IT infrastructure. This will result
in greater productivity and increased customer service."

"SQL Server 2008 is Microsoft's leading database product," said Bill Gonzalez,
general manager, Worldwide Distribution and Services, Microsoft. "The
integration of Retalix and SQL enhances the value of Retalix as a solution for
our customers in the retail and distribution business."

SQL Server 2008 delivers on Microsoft's Data Platform vision by helping
enterprises manage any data, any place, any time, and store data from
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents, such as images and rich
media, directly within the database. SQL Server 2008 delivers a rich set of
integrated services that support a variety of functions, including query,
search, synchronize, report and analyze.

SQL Server 2008 provides the highest levels of security, reliability and
scalability for business-critical applications. To take advantage of new
opportunities in today's fast-moving business world, companies need the ability
to create and deploy data-driven solutions quickly. SQL Server 2008 reduces the
time and cost of management and development of applications.

With SQL Server 2008, companies can access data from across the enterprise and
provide control over the data no matter where it is stored -- from the largest
servers within the data center to desktops to mobile devices. SQL Server 2008
provides a comprehensive platform that delivers intelligence where users want
it. Information workers, for example, can access data directly using the tools
they use every day, such as the 2007 Microsoft Office system.

SQL Server 2008 also enables data to be consumed from custom applications
developed using Microsoft .NET and Visual Studio and from within
service-oriented architectures (SOA) and business processes through Microsoft
BizTalk Server.

&lt;p&gt;NEW Citrix XenApp &amp; XenDesktop Management Pack for System Center Operations
Manager, and Oracle Siebel CRM/BI MP PRO extension for System Center Virtual
Machine Manager
BERLIN &amp; LJUBLJANA, Slovenia--(Business Wire)--
HERMES SoftLab, a ComTrade company, today announced two new extensions to its
Management Packs for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager. The Management
Pack for Citrix Xen now includes comprehensive support for Citrix XenApp and
XenDesktop. The Oracle Siebel CRM/BI Management Pack has been upgraded with a
Performance and Resource Optimization (PRO) extension for Microsoft System
Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM). Following the successful launch of both
Management Packs at the 2009 Microsoft Management Summit, these significant
upgrades will be unveiled during the Microsoft TechEd 2009 event in Berlin this
week. 

PRO-enabled Management Packs work in conjunction with SCVMM to provide PRO tips
that let administrators manage their virtual infrastructure more effectively.
HERMES SoftLab, working in partnership with Microsoft, developed the PRO
extension for its Oracle Siebel CRM/BI Management Pack as part of a Green
Technology initiative, which promotes the development of energy conserving
virtualization technologies. With PRO-enabled Management Packs adding additional
virtual Siebel application servers or optimizing disk resources for Siebel file
system virtual servers has never been easier. 

HERMES SoftLab`s Management Pack for Citrix Xen extends the capabilities of
Microsoft Systems Center Operations Manager by providing comprehensive Citrix
health, performance, and topology information that is fully integrated into the
Operations Manager environment. Working closely with both Microsoft and Citrix,
HERMES SoftLab is delivering enterprise class, service-management solutions and
best practices for Citrix XenApp, XenServer, and XenDesktop. 

The Citrix Xen Management Pack is designed to deliver immediate and long-term
value across IT organizations: from operations staff and Citrix specialists to
IT managers and CIO`s. Organizations that standardized their operations
management around Microsoft System Center Operations Manager are now able to
equip their staff with out-of-box monitoring knowledge, tasks, and reports to
handle the day-to-day supervision of their Citrix Xen estate. 

"Our extensive experience in key Citrix product segments has put us in a unique
position to offer an extensive, power-user grade management solution for the
Citrix Delivery Center," said Janko Cajhen, HERMES SoftLab CEO. "The new
PRO-enabled Oracle Siebel CRM/BI Management Pack allows SCVMM to perform
workload and application aware resource optimization, which allows for the
reliable automation of some very critical systems management tasks." 

"Microsoft`s System Center suite of products enables organizations to reduce the
cost of delivering the datacenter services and applications that drive business
success," said Paul Ross, Senior Product Marketing Manager for System Center
Datacenter Management, Microsoft Corp. "HERMES SoftLab`s Management Packs build
on the System Center platform to address core enterprise technologies that are a
clear value-add for organizations - especially the ones using System Center
solutions with existing investments in Citrix or Siebel." 

Citrix Xen Management Pack benefits:

* Infrastructure monitoring: Availability, performance, and capacity of XenApp,
XenServer, and XenDesktop infrastructure is continuously monitored and tracked. 
* End-user probing: Synthetic application and desktop launch probing ensures
availability issues are quickly identified. 
* End-user latency monitoring: From logon to log-off, latency issues can be
confirmed and isolated to specific components. 
* Web access resilience: The Citrix Web Interface configuration is
auto-discovered and continuously probed to ensure web-based access availability.

* Integrated management: The Citrix Xen Management Pack automatically integrates
performance and availability information from the Citrix infrastructure with
that of the back-end application layers, and acts as an operations bridge for
different subject matter experts. 
* Unified management: Further leverage your investment in Microsoft System
Center Operations Manager, operations personnel, processes, and procedures to
extend ITIL and Enterprise Systems Management to the Citrix Xen environment. 
* Native: The Citrix Xen Management Pack natively integrates with the Microsoft
System Center Operations Manager. No connectors/secondary consoles are required.

* Complete: No more blind-spots in your Citrix infrastructure - the Citrix Xen
Management Pack provides complete coverage of your Citrix Xen infrastructure.
XenApp servers, XenServer hosts and VMs, Web Interface servers, License servers,
Provisioning servers, and Desktop Delivery Controllers - are all kept under
control by the Citrix Xen Management Pack.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is emphasizing the potentially money-saving features of Exchange 2010, the latest revamp of its e-mail application officially released Monday at its TechEd European customer conference in Berlin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Exchange 2010, Microsoft is trying to entice CIOs in a tough economic environment to upgrade, contending that Exchange 2010's new features lets companies buy cheaper storage systems, eliminate their voice-mail systems and drop licenses for separate e-mail archiving software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although enterprise e-mail changes and deployments can take much time, Microsoft expects Exchange 2010 to be "quite aggressively deployed," said Stephen Elop, president of Microsoft's business division, which oversees products such as the Office suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its case to customers, Microsoft is citing a study it commissioned from research analyst Forrester. The study says that companies can expect to recoup their costs of deploying Exchange 2010 within six months through savings in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchange 2010 can now be used with less expensive attached storage devices rather than SANs (storage area networks), Elop said. Another money-saving feature is Exchange's ability to take voice mail messages. A speech-to-text feature let users read rather than listen to the messages. Microsoft has also added an e-mail archiving feature, which Elop said eliminates the need for companies to purchase other archiving software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While promoting the new software release as an economizing measure, Microsoft did acknowledge there will be a "slight" increase over previous versions of Exchange for advanced features such as archiving and voice mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new version has other features to make e-mail more manageable, such as conversation threading, the ability to ignore ongoing conversations between co-workers, and protections to ensure that e-mail with sensitive information isn't released. On the security side, Microsoft also released Forefront Protection 2010 for Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conference, Microsoft is also pushing Windows Server 2008 R2, the latest version of the server product. Last week, Microsoft made an abrupt change to its product roadmap. The company was not planning on making Exchange 2007 compatible with Windows Server 2008 R2. It meant that those who wanted to upgrade to the latest server product also had to use Exchange 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Earlier this year we made a decision in one direction, and due to the feedback we have received on this blog and elsewhere, we have reconsidered," wrote Kevin Allison, a general manager for Exchange, on a blog. "In the coming calendar year we will issue an update for Exchange 2007 enabling full support of Windows Server 2008 R2."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not given a date when the update may be released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other news at TechEd, Microsoft released a community technology preview for SQL Server 2008 R2, which will be available for download on the company's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds location, production capacity of platforms.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, Nov 9 (Reuters)- Chevron (CVX.N) said on Monday
that production has been shut in at its Tahiti, Blind Faith and
Petronius platforms ahead of Tropical Storm Ida's movement
through the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tahiti, about 190 miles (306 km) south of New Orleans with
capacity to produce 125,000 barrels per day of oil and 70
million cubic feet of natural gas per day, is the largest of
the three, according to the company's website. Tahiti began
producing in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blind Faith, about 160 miles (257 km) southeast of New
Orleans, can produce up to 65,000 barrels oil and 55 million
cubic feet of gas per day. Petronius, about 130 miles (209 km)

&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
atsec performed the FDCC Scanner validation testing for Microsoft System Center
Configuration Manager 2007 Extensions for SCAP under the current SCAP standard. 

"Microsoft recognizes the importance of supporting industry standards. For our
public sector and government customers, it is important to add support for
SCAP-compliant reporting formats. System Center Configuration Manager 2007
provides a strong collection of core functionalities for hardware and software
inventory, as well as robust reporting services and the ability to define,
deploy, and measure configuration baselines in a managed environment. By adding
the SCAP reporting format support to System Center Configuration Manager,
organizations can meet FDCC mandates for compliance reporting," said Jeff
Wettlaufer, technical product manager, System Center marketing at Microsoft
Corp. 

The Microsoft team worked diligently to meet the complex requirements of the
FDCC (Federal Desktop Core Configuration) scanning tool. The System Center
Configuration Manager Extensions for SCAP is an add-on to System Center
Configuration Manager. 

Steve Weingart, who leads the testing effort for atsec, comments: "Working with
the Microsoft development team was a great experience. At each step the
Microsoft team spared no effort to ensure that the tool met the long and complex
list of NIST SCAP requirements. The best part about the tool is that it is
integrated into the Windows Server environment making it extremely easy to map
mixed Windows XP and Windows Vista systems in a domain to the appropriate SCAP
configuration for each. In addition, report management from either the client or
the server is easy."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to acquire technology that has enabled Microsoft's TFS (Team Foundation Server) software to be an ALM (application lifecycle management) server for different software development platforms. The company will purchase Teamprise-related assets from SourceGear. Teamprise software lets Java developers using Eclipse-based IDEs or developers leveraging operating systems including Unix, Linux, and Mac OS X build applications via Visual Studio TFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move is in recognition of heterogeneous development shops building in both .Net and Java, Microsoft officials said. TFS serves as a central software artifacts repository. "We've just built a bridge to Java developers. ... If you're building [in] Java today and want to share assets with Visual Studio developers, you'll do that with the Teamprise technologies," said Dave Mendlen, Microsoft's senior director of development marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ InfoWorld's Martin Heller shows off the highlights of Visual Studio 2010. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users often have a business need to develop on multiple platforms but developers must collaborate and understand different parts of the work being done, said Doug Seven, senior product manager for Visual Studio at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's acquisition of Teamprise technologies addresses concerns of development shops reluctant to deal with a smaller vendor like SourceGear, said analyst Jeffrey Hammond of Forrester Research. "They were uncomfortable with a small partner providing the connectivity for their Java development teams," Hammond said. "Now they have Microsoft supporting their Java developers if they choose TFS as their single ALM solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Seven concurred that some customers had issues with the previous arrangement. "We've had a close relationship with Teamprise for a long time as being the provider of our heterogeneous development support, and both of us have heard from joint customers for a long time that it has been a struggle," Seven said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hammond lauded the acquisition. "I think it's a great move, and they should have made it a long time ago," he said. TFS offers a less expensive alternative to products such as Rational Team Concert, Hammond said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functionality from Teamprise Client Suite will be integrated into Microsoft's Visual Studio product line beginning with the Visual Studio 2010 IDE. Visual Studio 2010 will be officially launched on March 22, 2010 and ship around that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leveraging Teamprise Client Suite technologies, developers on multiple platforms can use TFS for version control, work-item tracking, build management process guidance and business intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teamprise Client Suite includes:&lt;/p&gt;

Teamprise Plug-in for Eclipse, allowing developers to access TFS from such IDEs as Rational Application Developer, JBoss and Adobe Flex Builder
Teamprise Explorer, combining functionality available to Eclipse developers using Teamprise Plug-in into a standalone, cross-platform GUI application for team members working outside of an IDE, such as graphic designers and quality assurance testers
Teamprise Command-Line Client, offering a non-graphical interface for TFS &lt;p&gt;Teamprise Client Suite technology will be updated to work with TFS 2010, which will feature improvements in areas such as work item-tracking and build automation. The Teamprise software will continue to work with prior versions of TFS as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers can jointly purchase Teamprise Client Suite technology and one Team Foundation Server client access license.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is emphasizing the potentially money-saving features of Exchange 2010, the latest revamp of its e-mail application officially released Monday at its TechEd European customer conference in Berlin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Exchange 2010, Microsoft is trying to entice CIOs in a tough economic environment to upgrade, contending that Exchange 2010's new features lets companies buy cheaper storage systems, eliminate their voice-mail systems and drop licenses for separate e-mail archiving software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although enterprise e-mail changes and deployments can take much time, Microsoft expects Exchange 2010 to be "quite aggressively deployed," said Stephen Elop, president of Microsoft's business division, which oversees products such as the Office suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its case to customers, Microsoft is citing a study it commissioned from research analyst Forrester. The study says that companies can expect to recoup their costs of deploying Exchange 2010 within six months through savings in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchange 2010 can now be used with less expensive attached storage devices rather than SANs (storage area networks), Elop said. Another money-saving feature is Exchange's ability to take voice mail messages. A speech-to-text feature let users read rather than listen to the messages. Microsoft has also added an e-mail archiving feature, which Elop said eliminates the need for companies to purchase other archiving software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new version has other features to make e-mail more manageable, such as conversation threading, the ability to ignore ongoing conversations between co-workers, and protections to ensure that e-mail with sensitive information isn't released. On the security side, Microsoft also released Forefront Protection 2010 for Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conference, Microsoft is also pushing Windows Server 2008 R2, the latest version of the server product. Last week, Microsoft made an abrupt change to its product roadmap. The company was not planning on making Exchange 2007 compatible with Windows Server 2008 R2. It meant that those who wanted to upgrade to the latest server product also had to use Exchange 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Earlier this year we made a decision in one direction, and due to the feedback we have received on this blog and elsewhere, we have reconsidered," wrote Kevin Allison, a general manager for Exchange, on a blog. "In the coming calendar year we will issue an update for Exchange 2007 enabling full support of Windows Server 2008 R2."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not given a date when the update may be released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other news at TechEd, Microsoft released a community technology preview for SQL Server 2008 R2, which will be available for download on the company's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i365 offre une productivit&#233; et une efficience accrues pour EVault Data
Protection, l`analytique et les solutions de stockage avec Windows 7 et Windows
Server 2008 R2
SANTA CLARA, Californie--(Business Wire)--
i365, Inc., A Seagate Company (NASDAQ : STX), un Microsoft Gold Certified
Partner, a annonc&#233; aujourd`hui que la soci&#233;t&#233; &#233;tait un sponsor platine du
lancement de Microsoft Efficiency. En sa qualit&#233; de sponsor platine, i365
s`associe &#224; Microsoft pour apporter son soutien &#224; la mise sur le march&#233; de
Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 et Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 et pour
faire part des avantages de ces nouveaux produits &#224; sa client&#232;le. Les solutions
d`i365 de protection des donn&#233;es et de reprise apr&#232;s sinistre sont optimis&#233;es
pour la plateforme Microsoft et i365 travaille en &#233;troite collaboration avec
Microsoft Corp. pour apporter une meilleure performance &#224; l`utilisateur et lui
permettre de mieux naviguer, rechercher et visualiser des donn&#233;es et d`avoir une
meilleure interaction avec celles-ci. 

&#171; Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 et Exchange 2010 sont des sorties
d`importance et ils repr&#233;sentent un point d`inflexion pour un autre niveau de
productivit&#233; pour les clients de nos solutions de protection de donn&#233;es EVault,
d`analytique et de stockage sur site et en nuage &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Terry Cunningham,
directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral d`i365. &#171; Nos produits capitalisent sur les nouvelles
fonctions et fonctionnalit&#233;s de ces offres Microsoft pour rendre l`interaction
avec nos solutions encore plus facile et am&#233;liorer la performance. &#187; 

Avec la croissance fulgurante des donn&#233;es cruciales &#224; l`entreprise, il est
maintenant essentiel de trouver des moyens nouveaux et meilleurs de g&#233;rer,
examiner et interagir avec les donn&#233;es afin d`am&#233;liorer l`efficience des
sp&#233;cialistes de l`information. En tant qu`&#233;diteur de logiciels, cette nouvelle
gamme de produits Microsoft offre &#224; i365 de nouvelles capacit&#233;s lui permettant
d`am&#233;liorer l`exp&#233;rience utilisateur. Gr&#226;ce aux fonctions comme la
reconnaissance tactile, gestuelle et vocale, les clients i365 peuvent traiter
l`information et g&#233;rer les applications plus rapidement et plus facilement. 

Am&#233;liorer l`utilisation des performances de r&#233;seau est aussi d`une importance
cl&#233;, tant pour les clients i365 que ceux Microsoft, &#233;tant donn&#233; que les liaisons
de donn&#233;es sont d`une largeur de bande limit&#233;e et qu`elles repr&#233;sentent des
co&#251;ts permanents non n&#233;gligeables. Une meilleure gestion de la largeur de bande,
gr&#226;ce &#224; des technologies telles que DeltaPro d`i365 et BranchCache de Microsoft,
permet aux conceptions d`applications mises &#224; niveau d`am&#233;liorer la performance
globale et de faire en fait &#233;conomiser de l`argent aux clients en r&#233;duisant la
pression associ&#233;e sur leurs infrastructures IT. La technologie DeltaPro, par
exemple, utilise la d&#233;duplication de donn&#233;es par bloc pour ne sauvegarder que
les blocs ayant chang&#233; dans les donn&#233;es, et pas des fichiers entiers,
c`est-&#224;-dire que moins de donn&#233;es sont d&#233;plac&#233;es sur le r&#233;seau. Ceci est crucial
pour les succursales ou les bureaux distants qui souhaitent centraliser les
sauvegardes, ainsi que pour les solutions de protection des donn&#233;es dans le
nuage. De m&#234;me, la technologie BranchCache dans Windows Server 2008 R2 am&#233;liore
la performance des applications WAN. Avec la technologie BranchCache, lorsqu`un
fichier est demand&#233; dans une succursale ou un bureau distant, les serveurs
locaux communiquent entre eux pour d&#233;terminer si le fichier est d&#233;j&#224; pr&#233;sent ou
un serveur dans le bureau en question est d&#233;sign&#233; comme machine de mise en
m&#233;moire cache, de sorte qu`un fichier pr&#233;existant localement n`a jamais besoin
de circuler entre les bureaux, &#233;liminant ainsi du trafic g&#233;n&#233;r&#233; inutilement dans
le r&#233;seau et am&#233;liorant la performance. 

&#171; Les soci&#233;t&#233;s d`aujourd`hui requi&#232;rent un acc&#232;s rapide 24 h sur 24 &#224;
l`information de l`entreprise &#187;, a quant &#224; lui confi&#233; Eric Jewett, directeur de
la division Windows Server et services d`outils de Microsoft Corp. &#171; Notre
relation avec i365 offre &#224; nos clients communs une exp&#233;rience informatique
rationalis&#233;e, leur donnant de puissantes capacit&#233;s de visualisation,
manipulation et analyse de leurs donn&#233;es d`une mani&#232;re conviviale. &#187; 

&#192; propos d`i365

i365, A Seagate Company, propose des solutions &#233;prouv&#233;es pour la protection, la

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager &#233;tendu gr&#226;ce au logiciel i365
EVault pour la prise en charge des environnements h&#233;t&#233;rog&#232;nes tant sur site que
dans le nuage
SANTA CLARA, Californie--(Business Wire)--
i365, Inc., A Seagate Company (NASDAQ : STX), a annonc&#233; aujourd`hui une
collaboration avec Microsoft au d&#233;veloppement d`une solution h&#233;t&#233;rog&#232;ne qui va
permettre aux directeurs IT d`&#233;tendre Microsoft System Center Data Protection
Manager (DPM) 2010 &#224; l`ensemble des plates-formes non-Microsoft et dans le
nuage, &#224; l`aide du logiciel de protection des donn&#233;es EVault et de
l`infrastructure de solutions de stockage reli&#233;e au nuage d`i365. La solution
group&#233;e sera disponible dans diff&#233;rentes configurations. La premi&#232;re
configuration inclura une solution de sauvegarde bas&#233;e sur applicatif, de
technologie Seagate, dont la livraison est pr&#233;vue pour le premier semestre 2010
avec la sortie en fabrication de DPM 2010. Cette collaboration comprend des
composantes technologiques et de mise sur le march&#233; en commun. 

&#171; On constate une plus grande traction de System Center Data Protection Manager
sur le march&#233; des logiciels de protection et r&#233;cup&#233;ration des donn&#233;es alors que
de plus en plus de soci&#233;t&#233;s en font leur norme de protection de leurs
environnements Windows &#187;, a expliqu&#233; Laura DuBois, directrice de recherche d`IDC
pour les logiciels de stockage. &#171; Ce partenariat est une proposition &#171;
gagnant-gagnant &#187; pour les deux soci&#233;t&#233;s, permettant aux clients Microsoft de
b&#233;n&#233;ficier de la technologie, de l`expertise et de l`infrastructure en nuage
&#233;prouv&#233;es d`i365 pour non seulement &#233;tendre leur protection des donn&#233;es &#224;
l`ensemble des plates-formes non-Microsoft mais aussi dans le nuage pour une
protection hors site. &#187; 

Un nombre croissant de soci&#233;t&#233;s adopte System Center Data Protection Manager
comme norme pour la sauvegarde et la r&#233;cup&#233;ration sous Windows. Pourtant, nombre
de ces soci&#233;t&#233;s ex&#233;cutent &#233;galement d`autres syst&#232;mes d`exploitation et
applications pour une partie de leurs activit&#233;s et souhaitent disposer d`une
solution unique pouvant &#233;tendre la protection des donn&#233;es par System Center Data
Protection Manager tant aux environnements Windows qu`aux environnements
non-Windows. Cette collaboration apportera aux clients un environnement int&#233;gr&#233;
de protection des donn&#233;es pour les serveurs et applications de fichiers Windows,
ainsi que pour les autres plates-formes et applications telles que UNIX, Linux,
Novell Netware, VMware, IBM i et Oracle. Une seule solution int&#233;gr&#233;e pour toutes
les plates-formes permet aux &#233;quipes IT d`offrir une protection des donn&#233;es et
une reprise apr&#232;s sinistre de mani&#232;re plus efficiente et &#224; un co&#251;t moindre.
L`option du nuage am&#232;ne automatiquement les donn&#233;es hors site, garantissant
ainsi la continuit&#233; des op&#233;rations, m&#234;me si un site est endommag&#233; ou d&#233;truit. 

&#171; Notre technologie EVault fait de la protection des donn&#233;es dans le nuage une
part importante des initiatives en mati&#232;re de reprise apr&#232;s sinistre pour des
clients de plus en plus nombreux tous les jours, optimisant l`efficience, la
s&#233;curit&#233; et la souplesse du transfert de donn&#233;es via Internet. Gr&#226;ce &#224; des
applicatifs de p&#233;riph&#233;rie uniques, &#224; la compression et &#224; une technologie de
d&#233;duplication par bloc, nous offrons les avantages d`une reprise apr&#232;s sinistre
d`une sauvegarde hors site, sans les co&#251;ts des bandes ou des transferts
physiques de supports &#187;, a confi&#233; pour sa part George Hoenig, vice-pr&#233;sident des
op&#233;rations produits chez i365. &#171; Nous sommes ravis de pouvoir offrir ces
capacit&#233;s &#224; la client&#232;le Microsoft dans le cadre de la strat&#233;gie li&#233;e au nuage
d`i365. &#187;

&lt;p&gt;  SANTA CLARA, CA, Nov 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Mimosa Systems, the leader in next-generation email archiving, file
archiving, and SharePoint archiving solutions, today announced that Mimosa
NearPoint(TM) will deliver support for Microsoft Exchange Server 2010
beginning November 30, 2009. As a Microsoft Technology Adoption Program
(TAP) member and Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, Mimosa will leverage
its NearPoint for Exchange 2010 solution to establish an organizational
archive that complements Exchange 2010 personal archive functionality for
the long-term storage and retention management of email and historical
PST content without any impact to the production email environment.

    "Email is a critical business application for our campus," said Michael
Bowden, systems engineer, Bowdoin College. "As a result this can place a
strain on our IT infrastructure due to exploding data growth, shrinking
backup windows and the need to store data long-term for compliance
purposes. Mimosa delivers an integrated archive solution that was built
from day one to support Microsoft Exchange. As we plan our Exchange 2010
migration we know Mimosa will be there to make this a seamless
transition."

    Long-term email archiving continues to be a critical business requirement
as email volumes grow, and companies keep email as critical business
records, then dispose of these according to their records management
policies. Additionally, legal workflow to manage the long-term
preservation and review of responsive content is also driving the need
for an organizational archive. Corporations have a requirement to retain
information for regulatory compliance and need a robust organizational
archive that goes well beyond the personal archive to provide historical
storage, retention adherence and eDiscovery workflow to ensure compliance.

    Alternatively, companies that leverage Mimosa NearPoint, with its support
for Exchange 2010, will benefit from the following advantages:


--  A comprehensive organizational archive that provides single-instance
    storage, retention and eDiscovery across Exchange, File System, and
    SharePoint content
--  An integrated application set to manage workloads across the
    information lifecycle including retention and classification of business
    records, employee supervision for data loss prevention, and electronic
    discovery to manage in-place legal holds
--  Offline access to archived content through the NearPoint archive cache
--  Storage of archived content on compliance devices such as EMC Centera,
    NetApp SnapLock and Hitachi HCAP
    

    
"As an active Microsoft TAP partner, Mimosa was able to provide
Microsoft feedback on the archiving features included in Exchange 2010
and with NearPoint, has established an organizational record archive that
complements Exchange 2010 archive functionality for long-term retention,"
said T.M. Ravi, CEO, Mimosa Systems. "We have architected a solution that
leverages the advanced features being delivered with Exchange 2010 for
companies that wish to deploy a long-term archive for email, file system,
and SharePoint data."

    About Mimosa NearPoint

    Mimosa NearPoint addresses critical customer requirements around
archiving, eDiscovery, regulatory compliance, business continuity, and
storage optimization in a unified solution. Mimosa NearPoint proactively
captures email, files, SharePoint content and instant messages; and

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, Nov 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Avanade, a business technology services provider, has become one of the
first companies to deploy a large-scale Microsoft Exchange Server 2010
infrastructure. Utilizing the new features in Exchange Server 2010,
Avanade is able to reduce its total cost of ownership (TCO), improve
reliability and stability, broaden system redundancy to include the data
center and increase user satisfaction. Additionally, through its early
adoption, Avanade has honed its expertise and services for customers
interested in migrating to the new version.

    Avanade's internal implementation of Microsoft Exchange Server 2010
enables the company to increase consultants' awareness of the server's
improved features and pass that knowledge on to customers. By bridging a
virtualized data center with an optimized workplace, Avanade has helped
the company and ultimately, its customers, to simply and seamlessly
achieve tangible business benefits today:


--  Transform the user computing infrastructure with a streamlined, lower-
    cost messaging environment that increases IT manageability and improves
    user satisfaction through improved mobility, reliability and ease of use.
    Integrating with unified messaging products and technologies like Microsoft
    Office Communications Server 2007 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server
    helps further transform the user computing environment.
--  Drive greater IT operating efficiency through managed virtualization,
    to reduce costs, maximize system availability and increase operational
    agility.
--  Enable staff to communicate more effectively, to make well-informed
    decisions quickly and reduce time to market.
    

    
"An integral part of the Avanade business model is developing an
extensive knowledge of solutions and products that we recommend to
customers by first using them internally," said Scott Rodgers, Senior
Vice President and Chief Architect for Infrastructure Services for
Avanade Americas. "During the pilot stages and our pre-release Microsoft
Technology Adoption Program (TAP) work with Exchange Server 2010, the
biggest challenge we saw first is simply making the migration, which is
typically complex because our customers have thousands of mailboxes in
use. Customers are concerned about disruptions to their communications
while a system upgrade is taking place."

    To address the challenge, Avanade uses its Messaging Migration Engine, a
set of technical and project delivery tools to help organizations analyze
the impact of upgrading their messaging systems. With this information,
Avanade Exchange Server experts can recommend upgrade steps that include
task automation to help reduce or eliminate disruption to employee
productivity.

    Avanade customers also want flexibility in accessing rich communications
tools whether employees are in corporate headquarters or are mobile. While
the Avanade internal deployment of Exchange is not virtualized, Microsoft
Corp.'s new Database Availability Group (DAG) wizard provides increased
availability options. "We put a lot of value on this," says Jeff Cagle,
service manager for IT communications at Avanade. "More than 80 percent of
our staff is usually in the field, and they need both reliable systems and
communications tools that will help them perform their work regardless of
location. The same needs are increasingly a part of the top requests we
get from our customers."

    By working early on pre-release versions of Exchange Server 2010 and using
the software internally before launch, Avanade is able to quickly assist
its enterprise customers in planning efficient upgrades, integrating
different applications to streamline internal communications and providing
solutions for increased availability and flexibility.

    "With the economic crisis, corporations are taking a close look at cutting
costs. Yet organizations also need the ability to transform ideas into
value to maintain their competitive advantage," Rodgers said. "Exchange
Server 2010 is a mission-critical application for large enterprises to be
able to harness ideas and collaborate internally to drive business value."

    "Microsoft is delighted Avanade could be part of the Exchange 2010
Technology Adoption Program and we are confident their early experience
with Exchange 2010 will help provide their customers with a smooth and
efficient upgrade," said Betsy Frost, general manager, UC Marketing at
Microsoft Corp. "We are delighted to have Avanade in our community of
partners ready to help customers take advantage of the innovations in
Exchange 2010."

&lt;p&gt;  MANSFIELD, MA, Nov 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IneoQuest Technologies, Inc., the global provider of advanced quality and
service assurance solutions for digital video, today announced that it
has expanded its product line for optimizing Microsoft(R) Mediaroom(TM)
operations. iDMS(TM) Telco now leverages the data collected on
IQDialogue(TM) IPTV Mediaroom(TM) Installer to give operations managers a
consolidated collection of historical deployment data. Using IneoQuest's
technology, providers can implement uniform procedures to ensure high
quality installation, maximize overall support for technicians and
efficiently engineer their network for improved performance.

    Telecommunications providers are currently using IneoQuest's IQDialogue
IPTV Mediaroom Installer to test the performance of Microsoft Mediaroom
residential deployments and assure that the setup and configuration of
television, video-on-demand (VOD) and multi-room DVR services operate
properly. Now, iDMS Telco allows for a centralized collection of all data
and measurements gathered in the field, including deployment location and
time, pass/fail results, fault identification, channel change timing and
packet loss, with specific identifiers for each IQDialogue IPTV Mediaroom
Installer probe.

    Using the data, iDMS Telco enables telecommunications providers to hone
operations management for improved deployment service, expense reduction
and staff support. With iDMS Telco, providers can review deployments for
adoption of uniform processes and cross-reference job details in case of
follow up and additional service. At the same time, providers can survey
the type of jobs or regions where deployments took the most time, enabling
them to identify network challenges or provide training to streamline
deployments.

    In addition to operations management, iDMS Telco provides a snapshot of
performance over time, giving providers trending analysis in order to
resolve issues proactively and plan for future upgrades. For example, iDMS
Telco details top deployment failures and issues, number of hours per
deployment and individual identification of test probes. Since large
repositories of historical data can be stored, providers can solve
systematic issues to lessen the overall impact on subscribers.

    With its centralized version control feature, iDMS Telco also notifies
network technicians to the latest updates to software and allows for an
automated download of updates to each probe during the synchronization
process, ensuring all technicians are outfitted with the most recent
software version for standardized service.

    "The adoption of IPTV products like Microsoft Mediaroom is growing as a
result of the interactive and innovative services that IPTV delivers to
subscribers," said Gino Dion, vice president of strategic solutions at
IneoQuest. "To ensure superior Quality of Service and Quality of
Experience to viewers served by Microsoft Mediaroom deployments, providers
must leverage tools like IneoQuest's family of Mediaroom products to
optimize every facet of deployment, from field testing and advanced
analysis to long-term network trending and human interactions."

    As a result of its partnership with Microsoft, IneoQuest is able to offer
a family of products for Microsoft Mediaroom deployment support. In
addition to iDMS Telco and IQDialogue IPTV Mediaroom Installer, IneoQuest
also offers the IQDialogue(TM) IPTV Mediaroom(TM) Advanced for high-tier
analysis and testing, monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities.

    About IneoQuest Technologies

    Recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in North America by
Deloitte LLP for the third year in a row and receiving numerous awards for
its product innovation, IneoQuest has a rich heritage of developing

&lt;p&gt;Announcement Follows Recent Sponsorship Renewal Through 2020 Olympic Games


SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a Worldwide Olympic Games Sponsor for more than two
decades, today announced the global launch of its Olympic-themed marketing
campaign for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, Go World. This global
campaign, which features television, digital and out-of-home advertising, host
market merchant activation programs and usage promotions, enables Visa to
connect with cardholders and Olympic and Paralympic Games fans to drive
preference for and usage of Visa products worldwide. 

This launch follows the recent extension of Visa`s Olympic Games sponsorship for
another eight years - through 2020 - enabling Visa`s financial institution
clients and merchant partners to continue to build strong relationships with
their customers through unique Visa marketing programs. 

"Go World builds on the concept that ran so successfully in the United States
during the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games," said Antonio Lucio, Chief Marketing
Officer of Visa Inc. "To connect with Olympic fans globally, we`ve taken this
platform and created a campaign that transcends borders, resonates with fans`
sense of national pride, builds our own business and that of our clients, and
advances the spirit of the Olympic Movement." 

The Go World campaign celebrates athleticism and human triumph through unique
athlete stories. It features a wintry blue tone throughout all creative
executions and will be customized to maximize local relevance in key markets.
The campaign also includes merchant offers, enhanced social media applications
and a deeper focus on Visa-sponsored athletes (Team Visa - Vancouver). 

US Television Advertising &amp; Customization

On Sunday, November 1, "Get Closer," the first of several television
commercials, aired in the United States. "Get Closer" reinforces Visa`s history
of supporting Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls and connects directly with fans
through a new Olympic-themed usage promotion. When United States cardholders use
their Visa card between November 1 and December 31, 2009, they will be
automatically entered for a chance to win a trip for four to the Vancouver 2010
Olympic Winter Games. Each trip will include airfare, hotel, and VIP hospitality
access, as well as event tickets, courtesy of Visa. In addition, Visa will award
five first prize winners a Panasonic High-Definition Blu-Ray Theater featuring a
58-inch Plasma HDTV and a $500 Visa gift card, and five second prize winners
will receive a $500 Visa gift card. Official rules are available at
www.visa.com/goworld. No purchase or obligation necessary to enter or win. 

The second spot, "Anthem," will air in the coming weeks to build anticipation
for the Games with images of a burning Olympic Cauldron and a montage of iconic
Olympic Games moments to remind viewers of global commonalities and the power of
the Olympic Spirit. 

"When we introduced More people go with Visa earlier this year, we focused on
people taking action - and the role of Visa in that action," Lucio said. "No
group embodies this concept of empowerment more than the thousands of Olympic
and Paralympic athletes chasing their Olympic dreams." 

Upcoming creative executions of Go World will feature Olympic and Paralympic
athletes of the past and present - including a series of television commercials
during NBC`s broadcast of the 2010 Winter Games in the United States, where Visa
will enjoy category exclusivity for the duration. 

Similar to More people go with Visa, elements of the Go World campaign will be
localized in Canada, Russia, Japan, Korea, China and Latin America to strengthen
the campaign`s relevance in those markets. 

US Go World Web Site

Visa`s efforts in the digital space also put the athletes at the center,
offering cardholders and Olympic and Paralympic Games fans a unique glimpse at
the personal journey of these hopefuls. By providing this behind the scenes
access, Visa reinforces its role in the Olympic Movement and strengthens its
relationships with millions of Olympic and Paralympic Games fans worldwide. 

The campaign will also include an extensive Web site (US- www.visa.com/goworld),
which contains exclusive merchant offers, behind the scenes Team Visa -
Vancouver training videos, downloadable photos of athletes in action, and
athlete training playlists with songs available for purchase. Team Visa -
Vancouver (US) athletes featured here include Julia Mancuso (alpine skiing),
Lindsey Jacobellis (snowboard, snowboard cross), Ryan St. Onge (freestyle
skiing, aerials), Angela Ruggiero (ice hockey), and Paralympian Alexi Salamone
(ice sledge hockey). 

Athlete widgets will be available for download and posting on social media
networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Visa has also worked with its network of
merchant partners to provide exclusive offers to Visa cardholders as they
prepare for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. Available at
www.visa.com/goworld, Visa cardholders are able to access savings at popular
merchants including The Hilton Family New York City, CoSport, Finish Line, Alamo
Rent A Car and National Car Rental. In the coming weeks, Visa will introduce six
Visa Gift Card designs featuring Team Visa - Vancouver athletes and a Whistler
landscape image for purchase at Gift Card Mall via www.visa.com/goworld. 

The Go World online content will also be customized for Olympic and Paralympic
Games fans in Canada and Russia. In Canada, the Go World Web site features Team
Visa - Vancouver athletes including Emily Brydon (alpine skiing), Clara Hughes
(speed skating), Colette Bourgonje (Paralympic cross-country skiing), Brian
McKeever (Paralympic cross-country skiing, biathlon), Jennifer Heil (freestyle
skiing, moguls), Alexa Loo (snowboard) and Jeff Christie (luge), mentors Kurt
Browning (figure skating), Nathalie Lambert (short track speed skating) and Ian
Balfour (Paralympic alpine skiing), and ambassadors Jeffrey Buttle (figure
skating), Danielle Goyette (ice hockey) and Diedra Dionne (freestyle skiing,
aerials). Russia`s Go World Web site spotlights Team Visa - Vancouver athletes
OIga Zavyalova (cross-country skiing) and Albert Demchenko (luge). 

Athlete Support &amp; Olympic Sponsorship Activation

Visa believes that the Games begin and end with the athletes and has created a
unique global program, Team Visa, to provide long-term support to these hopefuls
as they prepare for one of the greatest challenges of their lives: competing at
the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Since 1986, Visa has empowered thousands of
these athletes to achieve their dreams by providing them with financial support,
financial literacy training and valuable marketing exposure in pursuit of their
goals. In the run-up to the 2010 Winter Games, Visa will support more than 30
individual athletes, all with the potential to be selected for their National
Teams. Currently, Team Visa - Vancouver includes top athletes as well as
national teams from the United States, Canada, China, Japan and Russia. 

Over the past few months Visa has been working with itsfinancial institution
clients globallyto offer Visa cardholders the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to
attend the Games and with national and international merchant partners to help
them generate business and excitement among their customers leading up to the
Games. Go World is prominent on the interior (register branding, point-of-sale)
and exterior (banners) of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Superstore (Hudson Bay
Company) in downtown Vancouver. Additionally, Go World will be featured
throughout Visa`s presence program, including point of sale materials at
merchants around Vancouver and Whistler. 

Visa remains the only card accepted at 2010 Winter Games venues in Vancouver and
Whistler and at select U.S. Olympic Team Trials in the United States. This
extends to the purchase of Visa Olympic Winter Games merchandise online, in
Olympic Games retail stores and by catalog. At the Olympic and Paralympic Games,
Visa installs a special Games ATM network and hundreds of point-of-sale
acceptance devices at competition and non-competition venues. Onsite at the
Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, Visa personnel will also
provide a variety of card payment related services to cardholders.

&lt;p&gt;CoTweet Brings in First Revenue as Fortune 500 Companies Embrace
Enterprise-level Services for Twitter
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
The world`s leading brands have embraced the power of the real-time web, and
CoTweet is playing a key role in their success. CoTweet today announced that
companies including Coca-Cola, Ford, McDonald`s, Microsoft, SunTrust, Whole
Foods and others have enrolled in the CoTweet Enterprise Innovators Program, a
new program that includes exclusive Enterprise Edition product features and
services that help companies manage their brands on Twitter. The program is
available to customers for a fee, demonstrating one of the first examples of a
Twitter ecosystem application to generate revenue. 

Companies recognize that Twitter has become an essential channel for
communication with customers and other constituents - one that is uniquely
direct, genuine and immediate - with significant upside potential for
enterprises that can "crack the Twitter code." 

CoTweet`s Enterprise Innovators Program offers companies a set of
uniquely-tailored business tools that include:

* Reach analytics - provides visibility into the true reach of Twitter messages
and click-through rates on embedded links 
* Engagement analytics - reports on inbound and outbound message types (DM,
@replies, @mentions), response rates and times, most active users 
* Influence analytics - measures the social media influence of brands and users,
including those most influential in specific industries and topics; provided
through partnership with Klout. 
* Extended customer conversation history - a lifetime archive of customer
interactions 
* Priority updates - faster access to Twitter updates 
* Dedicated account management - a single point of contact providing account
analysis and priority product support and training

Additionally, Enterprise Innovator Program participants will play a key role in
shaping the future direction of the CoTweet product based on their emergent
requirements. 

"In social media, the experience you give people on their first effort to reach
you had better be the way you want them to remember you," said Scott Monty,
Digital and Multimedia Communications Manager at Ford. "CoTweet helps us engage
customers in authentic two-way conversations that ensure we're consistent and
coordinated as a team and that we leave a positive impression." 

"Successful social business design requires focus on people, process and
technology," said Peter Kim, Managing Director, North America at Dachis Group.
"At a time when so many social technology companies are struggling to prove an
effective business model, the CoTweet team has shown they know what it takes to
help a growing number of companies derive measurable value from their social
media initiatives." 

CoTweet allows multiple people to communicate through corporate Twitter accounts
and stay in sync while doing so. A sophisticated workflow engine enables users
to manage multiple accounts from a single dashboard, support multiple editors
for each account, track conversations, assign tasks, create follow-up tasks and
schedule posts, and designate who is replying on a company`s behalf. CoTweet
also offers direct integration with bit.ly, enabling users to tap into real-time
click tracking and analytics from the industry`s leading URL shortening service.


"Businesses have different requirements than consumers when it comes to social
media engagement," said Jesse Engle, CEO of CoTweet. "Companies must monitor
their brands, provide customer service and measure the impact of outbound
marketing. Team collaboration is key. CoTweet is the only tool that's focused
exclusively on the needs of enterprises, from grocers to bankers, and everyone
in between."

&lt;p&gt;RightAnswers Eases Increase in Support Issues During Application Transition
Spanning 36,000 Users
CLARK, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
RightAnswers, Inc., the recognized leader in providing self-service and internal
support knowledge management solutions, today announced that it has solidified
its commitment to the higher education market through its continued support of
the Microsoft Live@edu program. Live@edu provides educational institutions with
a set of hosted collaboration services, communication tools, web-based
applications, and much more. As part of the Microsoft Partner Program,
RightAnswers supports the current Live@edu offering within the company`s
Knowledge-Paks Library. 

The RightAnswers Knowledge-Paks Library is comprised of more than 150,000
pre-written solutions covering 300 of the most popular commercial off-the-shelf
software applications, and contains comprehensive application feature,
functionality, and usage information. Through the Knowledge-Paks, clients have
access to articles on the current offering of Live@edu. In addition,
RightAnswers will support Live@edu applications that will be added in the
future. 

As educational institutions take advantage of the benefits offered by moving to
Live@edu, providing comprehensive self-help support for students, faculty and
staff becomes increasingly important. When an educational institution makes a
major change in the standard applications supplied to their installed base,
those end-users will have questions and need support during the transition.
RightAnswers provides a robust knowledge base to answer those questions, along
with a user-friendly, web-based interface for self-help that enables end-users
to resolve issues on their own. This reduces the number of calls to the support
center. 

"We recently made the switch to Live@edu to provide our students with its
enhanced features and functionality," said Nathan Eatherton, Service Desk
Manager at the University of Missouri. "As part of this effort, we moved more
than 36,000 students from our old e-mail system to the new Live@edu e-mail
service. Knowing we weren`t staffed to handle such a large undertaking on our
own, we relied heavily on our RightAnswers self-help portal to provide students
with the most up-to-date information (instructions and frequently asked
questions). Students leveraged the self-help portal with its 24/7 availability
for most of their support needs (over 23,000 solutions viewed) during the
transition. With only a modest increase in calls to the service desk, we were
able to maintain the level of service we provide for all of our other solutions
- something we couldn`t have done without the RightAnswers self-help portal." 

"We are very committed to the higher education market, and we understand their
pains in trying to resolve support issues quickly and easily," explained Jeff
Weinstein, President and CEO of RightAnswers. "Within our RightAnswers
University Edition we support many software applications specific to higher
education customers, and our continued support for the Live@edu program further
solidifies this commitment. We have given our higher education customers an even
greater ability to self-resolve incidents, while at the same time improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of support analysts."

solutions at www.rightanswers.com/rightanswers-self-service-university-edition.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - The Jonas Brothers are keepers at Disney Channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cable channel has ordered a second season of the pop stars' comedy series "Jonas," but only after parting ways with the executive producers who launched the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jonas" premiered in the spring to solid numbers, but couldn't match the heights of Disney Channel hits like "Hannah Montana." It has been winning its Sunday time slot in key kids demographics, averaging 3.4 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production on Season 2 is slated to begin in February for a premiere in the middle of next year. It will follow Kevin, Joe and Nick Jonas as they set out on a summer vacation in Los Angeles that leads to them landing gigs in show business. In real life, the brothers are in Italy as part of the European leg of a world concert tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Disney Channel has renewed the trio's short-form reality series "Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream" for a second season. Filming already is under way for a premiere early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These guys are the superstars of their generation," said Gary Marsh, Disney Channels Worldwide entertainment president. "We had the opportunity to extend our relationship with them, which we did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network hired two new executive producers for "Jonas": showrunner Lester Lewis ("The Office") and director Paul Hoen, who has shot nine Disney Channel movies. They replace Michael Curtis and Roger S.H. Schulman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release on Tuesday guidelines for developers building online applications and for those utilizing the Agile code-development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Agile guidelines apply principles from Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) to Agile, an umbrella term for a development model frequently used for Web-based applications released under short deadlines, called "sprints."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft adopted the SDL following the company's pledge in 2002 to build more secure code after several high-profile worms and other malicious software posed dangerous risks to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the original SDL doesn't fit the Agile process. Agile differs in that developers have a set time in which to develop certain features, after which the application is immediately released in order to get customer feedback, said Bryan Sullivan, security program manager for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SDL was originally designed for products, such as the Windows OS, that are non-iterative, meaning that there aren't frequent releases of the product that add just a feature or two. However, all of the SDL requirements have been adopted for the Agile process, but implemented differently, Sullivan said. Agile is used by 85 percent of technology industry professionals, according to Forrester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft breaks the SDL down into three requirements: one-time only tasks, those that need to be done for every sprint, and finally "bucket" tasks, which need to be repeated periodically -- such as every six months -- but not for every sprint, Sullivan said. The Agile guidelines will be available on Tuesday on www.microsoft.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also releasing a white paper on security for online Web applications. As those applications are increasingly interacting and exchanging information, security is paramount, said Steve Lipner, senior director of security engineering at Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white paper outlines key security issues that developers should consider for Web applications, Lipner said. It also discusses security issues that developers should think about when choosing a hosting provider, such as data and physical security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, Nov 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) today announced updates to its backup and
archiving software solutions to support Microsoft Exchange Server 2010
and other Microsoft applications. Symantec's information management
solutions help extend Exchange 2010 by further protecting customers'
information, reducing storage and server costs and quickly recovering
information for business, legal and regulatory compliance purposes.

    Symantec's Enterprise Vault archiving solution adds direct drag-and-drop
access to the archive from Outlook, so users no longer have to rely on
"shortcut" links from their mailbox. This is now available for previous
versions of Exchange and is scheduled to be available for Exchange 2010 in
early 2010. Available now, Symantec Backup Exec System Recovery 2010
provides fast, reliable system backup and restore for Microsoft Exchange
2010. Over the next several months, Symantec is scheduled to deliver
updated versions of NetBackup, Backup Exec and Enterprise Vault to reduce
storage by deduplicating information stored in Microsoft Exchange 2010,
as well as other applications such as Microsoft SharePoint and Windows
Server 2008 R2.

    "Organizations of all sizes are wrestling with massive information growth
across multiple Microsoft platforms and applications, but especially
Exchange," said Mathew Lodge, senior director of product marketing,
Symantec Information Management Group. "Symantec helps by providing backup
and archiving platforms to centrally protect, manage and discover critical
information within Exchange 2010 and other Microsoft platforms."

    New Archiving Support Provides Comprehensive Search and Management of
Exchange 

    Symantec Enterprise Vault unifies deduplication, tiered storage, policy
enforcement and e-discovery of information across multiple applications,
such as Exchange, SharePoint, file servers and instant messaging.
Available now, Enterprise Vault 8.0 with virtual vault eases the end user
experience for organizations archiving Microsoft Exchange by combining
access to live, legacy and archived emails in Microsoft Outlook without
any visible change to the appearance of the message or stub files. This
new capability allows end users to easily drag, search, move and retrieve
archived email within Outlook just as they would with a .pst but without
additional complications related to e-discovery or corruption.
Additionally, Enterprise Vault is scheduled to provide fully-integrated
archiving support for Exchange 2010 early next year.

    "Symantec has unique expertise in backup and archiving solutions, and we
are happy to have them as a Microsoft partner for Microsoft Exchange
Server 2010," said Betsy Frost, general manager, UC Marketing at
Microsoft Corp. "Partners are critical to Microsoft's success and, by
building on Exchange 2010, Symantec helps us deliver more value to our
customers and meet the needs of a wider variety of organizations. We are
delighted to have Symantec included in our community of partners who are
energized and ready to help customers take advantage of the innovations
in Exchange 2010."

    Symantec Backup and Recovery Delivers Granular Recovery of Exchange

    Symantec Backup Exec System Recovery 2010 provides small businesses with
full system backup and recovery of the latest Microsoft platforms,
including Microsoft Exchange 2010, Windows 7 and Microsoft Server 2008 R2.
This allows organizations moving to these new Microsoft environments to
ensure that their data and systems can be quickly recovered should they
encounter an outage or disaster.

    Additionally, Backup Exec System Recovery 2010 and the next versions of
NetBackup and Backup Exec are scheduled to provide granular recovery of
Exchange 2010 email messages, files, mailboxes, and public and private
folders from single-pass database backups.

    Product Availability

    Backup Exec System Recovery 2010 and Enterprise Vault with virtual vault
are currently available. The following products are scheduled to be fully
Exchange 2010 compatible in the next several months: Backup Exec,
NetBackup and Enterprise Vault.

&lt;p&gt;Unisys Services, Software Solutions and Servers Extend Capabilities of Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 R2, Microsoft Windows 7, and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010
Throughout Clients` Enterprises
BERLIN--(Business Wire)--
Unisys Corporation (NYSE:UIS) today announced at the Microsoft TechEd Europe
conference that it is providing multiple services-based solutions for the new
Microsoft Windows 7, Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and Microsoft Exchange
Server 2010 environments. 

The solutions include data center transformation solutions whose value is
demonstrated by Unisys proof-point tests, as well as end-user services and a
unified communications service that Unisys is hosting for Microsoft Corp. 

"When Microsoft delivers software innovations, Unisys is there with innovative
solutions that help clients realize the full value of the products," said Colin
Lacey, vice president, Systems and Storage, Unisys. "We`re doing that again for
these latest Microsoft offerings to help users improve their operations and make
their people better able to do business anywhere at any time." 

These Unisys solutions are designed to help enterprises boost information
workers` productivity no matter where they are or how they work, improve the IT
infrastructure so it supports business more efficiently, and reduce the costs of
IT service delivery and support. 

"Unisys deep understanding of both data centers and end-user experiences adds an
extra dimension that helps Microsoft customers realize new efficiencies in
computing across the enterprise," said Betsy Frost, general manager, UC
Marketing Management at Microsoft Corp. "We are impressed at the range and depth
of solutions that Unisys is offering to support Microsoft Windows 7, Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 R2 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010." 

Tests Show that Unisys Data Center Transformation Solutions Boost Windows Server
2008 R2

Unisys builds on expertise and best practices in virtualized infrastructure -
especially through Unisys Data Center Transformation Services, Infrastructure
Management Suite of solutions, and family of Enterprise Servers - to help
clients use Windows Server 2008 R2 to transform their data centers for greater
efficiency at lower cost. 

Unisys recently conducted proof-point tests that demonstrate the power of
Windows Server 2008 R2 in a virtualized environment. 

In the first test, Unisys demonstrated that the Unisys ES7000 Model 7600R
Enterprise Server provides a powerful platform for Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2
database consolidation. 

Using Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter Edition, a single Unisys ES7000 server
supported the same workload as 32 dual-socket quad-core commodity servers, each
running two 85-gigabyte SQL Server 2008 R2 databases, while providing better
response times. 

Unisys achieved those results while quadrupling the utilization rate of the
commodity servers and using 55 percent less power. The 32:1 consolidation ratio
shows that Unisys can help clients configure and manage their SQL Server
database infrastructure more efficiently and significantly reduce their
facilities, server maintenance and support costs. 

In the second proof-point test, Unisys demonstrated high availability for
virtualized SQL Server 2008 R2 workloads delivered through the new Live
Migration capability of Microsoft Hyper-V. 

In the past, clients` inability to move virtual machines (VMs) from one host to
another without any perceived downtime or service interruption - a capability
especially important in large-scale clustered SQL Server environments - has been
a key barrier to virtualizing SQL Server workloads with Hyper-V. Unisys solved
this challenge with the Hyper-V Live Migration capability. 

Unisys migrated 12 VMs, with each running two 85-gigabyte databases in a single
instance of SQL Server 2008 R2 with 20 concurrent users, between two nodes of an
ES7000 Model 7600R clustered server. During the Live Migration process, users
experienced virtually no loss of performance or interruption of service. 

A third test supported the Unisys decision framework that helps clients make the
right virtualization choices for their environment. Unisys demonstrated the
significant performance and total-cost-of-ownership (TCO) advantages delivered
by Hyper-V. The proof-point test revealed that a 12-socket Unisys ES7000 Model
7600R can support 384 VMs - the maximum currently supported under Windows Server
2008 R2 - with a three-year TCO per VM of $578. In contrast, a two-socket server
using the latest generation of Intel processors could support only 16 VMs at a
far higher three-year TCO per VM of $2,035. 

End-User Services Extend Benefits of Exchange Server 2010 and Windows 7

Unisys End-User Productivity Services enable IT organizations to realize the
full business potential of Exchange Server 2010 and Windows 7. These services
provide multiple options for end users to securely access key productivity
environments - whether running centrally managed applications locally on mobile
devices such as netbooks and smartphones, accessing them through cloud-based
services or using a mixture of delivery options. 

For example, users of Exchange Server 2010 can benefit from Unisys Unified
Communications as a Service (UCaaS), which delivers Microsoft Exchange,
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server and Microsoft Office Communicator
applications in a multi-tenant environment through Unisys Secure Cloud Solution.


In addition, Unisys provides migration and management support for Windows 7 to
help clients deploy the new environment most efficiently and effectively. Also,
the advanced desktop management, support and flexible applications delivery
capabilities of Unisys End-User Productivity Services give Windows 7 users
anywhere, anytime access to their critical productivity environments. 

Unified Communications Solutions Help End-Users Explore the Possibilities

Based on Unisys expertise in managed services, Microsoft has selected Unisys to
build and manage the Microsoft Unified Communications Virtual Experience for
Exchange Server 2010 and Office Communications Server 2007 R2. This cloud-based
trial service enables enterprise users to try, free of charge, the latest
Microsoft UC technology. 

The service gives organizations worldwide the opportunity to test key new
features of the Microsoft offerings, such as multi-party instant messaging and
voice and video conferencing, and evaluate the potential benefits of Microsoft
unified communications for their business. It also helps them assess how they
can help employees collaborate more productively using the devices and
technologies that best suit their work styles - whether PCs, web browsers or
mobile phones.

&lt;p&gt; * China Mobile, CNOOC seen as likely listing candidates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * JP Morgan sees a handful of foreign listings within 12 mths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * NASDAQ, NYSE Euronext express interest in listing
 (Adds comments from stock exchange official)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEIJING, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The first red-chip and foreign
companies could list shares on the Shanghai stock exchange next
year, Jing Ulrich, chairman of China equities at J.P. Morgan,
said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Red chips are Chinese companies that have their business on
the mainland but are incorporated outside China and listed on
overseas bourses, usually Hong Kong. They are currently
prohibited from selling shares inside mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Within the next 12 months there should be at least a handful
of red chip companies or foreign companies listed in Shanghai,"
Ulrich told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She mentioned China Mobile (0941.HK) and CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK)
as red chips that might sell shares in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked about the attitude of Chinese regulators, Ulrich said:
"There is strong support for this initiative and I think the
conditions are ripe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said listings by red chips and foreign companies would
open up new choices for Chinese investors and allow foreign
companies to tap into a market with ample liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number of foreign companies, including global banking giant
HSBC (0005.HK)(HSBA.L), have expressed interest in listing on the
new board mooted in Shanghai for overseas companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shanghai Stock Exchange vice-president Liu Xiaodong said
listing rules overseas companies were still being drafted and
there was no timetable. He added that those looking to list would
need to have a China-related business rationale for doing so and
not just use it as a venue to raise capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert McCooey, a senior vice-president of NASDAQ OMX Group
(NDAQ.O), said his exchange had communicated its interest to
China's securities regulator and to the Shanghai stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will continue to have dialogue with them and see how the
international board progresses. We are interested in becoming
part of it, if it makes sense at the time," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NASDAQ is the largest overseas bourse for Chinese companies,
with 117 listings, and McCooey said a NASDAQ listing in Shanghai
would be a reciprocal show of support for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYSE Euronext NYX.NNYX.PA, the parent of the New York
Stock Exchange and a rival to NASDAQ, is also keen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We hope that NYSE Euronext is in the first group of
(overseas) companies to list, but we don't know if it will be the
first," Ronald Keng, NYSE Euronext's head of international
listings for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia, told
the Hong Kong Economic Times in remarks published on Monday.

&lt;p&gt;Erh&#246;hte Produktivit&#228;t und Effizienz f&#252;r Datensicherungs-, Analytik- und
Speicherl&#246;sungen EVault von i365 mit Windows 7 und Windows Server 2008 R2
SANTA CLARA, Kalifornien (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Das Unternehmen i365, Inc., A Seagate Company (NASDAQ: STX) und ein Gold
Certified Partner von Microsoft, hat heute bekannt gegeben, dass es ein
Platinsponsor des Microsoft Efficiency Launch ist. Als Platinsponsor arbeitet
i365 mit Microsoft zur Unterst&#252;tzung der Einf&#252;hrung von Windows 7, Windows
Server 2008 R2 und Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 und zur Bekanntmachung der
Vorteile dieser neuen Produkte zusammen. Die L&#246;sungen von i365 zur
Datensicherung und Disaster Recovery sind f&#252;r die Microsoft-Plattform optimiert
und i365 arbeitet eng mit der Microsoft Corporation zusammen, um Verbesserungen
bei der Leistung und den F&#228;higkeiten von Benutzern zur Navigation, Suche,
Visualisierung und Interaktion im Zusammenhang mit Daten zu erzielen. 

&#8222;Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 und Exchange 2010 sind wichtige Versionen und
stellen einen Wendepunkt auf dem Weg zu mehr Produktivit&#228;t f&#252;r unsere Kunden
dar, die die Datensicherungs-, Analytik- und Speicherl&#246;sung EVault entweder vor
Ort installiert haben oder als Cloud-Version nutzen", erkl&#228;rt Terry Cunningham,
Gesch&#228;ftsf&#252;hrer von i365. &#8222;Unsere Produkte schlagen Kapital aus den neuen
Eigenschaften und Funktionen bei diesen Microsoft-Angeboten, die die Interaktion
mit unseren L&#246;sungen noch einfacher machen und auch die Leistung verbessern." 

Mit der explosionsartigen Zunahme gesch&#228;ftskritischer Daten ist es unerl&#228;sslich
geworden, neue und bessere M&#246;glichkeiten zur Verwaltung, &#220;berpr&#252;fung und
Interaktion im Zusammenhang mit diesen Daten zu finden, um die Effizienz von
Spezialisten zu f&#246;rdern. Als Softwareentwickler erh&#228;lt i365 durch diese neue
Produktreihe von Microsoft neue M&#246;glichkeiten zur Verbesserung des
Benutzererlebnisses. Funktionen wie Tast-, Gestik- und Spracherkennung geben
i365-Kunden die M&#246;glichkeit, rascher und einfacher Informationen zu verarbeiten
und Anwendungen auszuf&#252;hren. 

Die Verbesserung der Netzwerkauslastung ist sowohl f&#252;r i365- als auch f&#252;r
Microsoft-Kunden ebenfalls von entscheidender Bedeutung, da die Bandbreite bei
den Datenlinks begrenzt ist und erhebliche laufende Kosten verursacht.
Verbesserungen im Bandbreitenmanagement anhand von Technologien wie DeltaPro von
i365 oder BranchCache von Microsoft erm&#246;glichen bei aktualisierten Anwendungen
eine Steigerung der Gesamtleistung und sparen den Kunden sogar Geld, indem die
damit verbundene Last auf der IT-Infrastruktur gesenkt werden kann. Die
DeltaPro-Technologie beispielsweise verwendet eine Datendeduplizierung auf
Blockebene nur zur Sicherung der ge&#228;nderten Datenbl&#246;cke und nicht von ganzen
Dateien, was bedeutet, dass weniger Daten im Netzwerk verschoben werden. Dies
ist entscheidend bei Au&#223;enstellen, die ihre Sicherungskopien zentralisieren
m&#246;chten, sowie bei Datensicherungsl&#246;sungen auf Cloud-Basis. Auf &#228;hnliche Weise
verbessert die BranchCache-Technologie auf dem Windows Server 2008 R2 die
Anwendungsleistung auf WAN-Basis. Wenn eine Datei von einer Au&#223;enstelle
angefordert wird, stellen die lokalen Server anhand der BranchCache-Technologie
fest, ob die Datei bereits vorhanden ist oder ob ein Server der Au&#223;enstelle als
Caching-Maschine dient, so dass eine lokal vorhandene Datei nie zwischen den
einzelnen Niederlassungen hin und her verschoben werden muss, was unn&#246;tigen
Netzwerk-Traffic vermeidet und die Leistung verbessert. 

&#8222;Unternehmen von heute ben&#246;tigen raschen Zugang zu gesch&#228;ftlichen Informationen
rund um die Uhr", so Eric Jewett, Leiter der Abteilung Windows Server und Tools
Services bei der Microsoft Corporation. &#8222;Unsere Beziehungen zu i365 bieten
unseren gemeinsamen Kunden eine optimierte Computernutzung und geben ihnen
leistungsstarke M&#246;glichkeiten zur Ansicht, Ver&#228;nderung und Analyse von Daten auf
benutzerfreundliche Art und Weise."

Das Unternehmen i365, A Seagate Company, bietet bew&#228;hrte L&#246;sungen zum Schutz,

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager zur Unterst&#252;tzung heterogener
Umgebungen, sowohl fest installiert als auch in Clouds, mit EVault-Software von
i365 erweitert
SANTA CLARA, Kalifornien (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Das Unternehmen i365, Inc., A Seagate Company (NASDAQ: STX) hat heute eine
Zusammenarbeit mit Microsoft zur Entwicklung einer heterogenen L&#246;sung bekannt
gegeben, mit deren Hilfe IT-Manager Microsoft System Center Data Protection
Manager (DPM) auf fremden Plattformen und in Clouds mit der
Datensicherungs-Software EVault von i365 sowie mit Cloud-Speicherl&#246;sungen
erweitern k&#246;nnen. Die kombinierte L&#246;sung wird in verschiedenen Konfigurationen
erh&#228;ltlich sein. Die erste Konfiguration enth&#228;lt eine anwendungsbasierte
Backup-L&#246;sung mit Seagate-Technologie und wird voraussichtlich im ersten
Halbjahr 2010 zusammen mit der Version zur Herstellung des DPM 2010
ausgeliefert. Die Zusammenarbeit umfasst sowohl technische Bestandteile als auch
gemeinsame Marketingaktivit&#228;ten. 

&#8222;System Center Data Protection Manager setzt sich auf dem Markt f&#252;r
Datensicherungs- und Recovery-Software zunehmend durch, da sich immer mehr
Unternehmen darauf hin normieren, um ihre Windows-Umgebungen zu sch&#252;tzen", sagte
Laura DuBois, Forschungsleiterin f&#252;r Speichersoftware bei IDC. &#8222;Diese
Partnerschaft stellt eine Gewinnsituation f&#252;r beide Unternehmen dar, bei der
Microsoft-Kunden von der bew&#228;hrten Technologie, Fachkompetenz und
Cloud-Infrastruktur von i365 profitieren, durch die sie ihre Datensicherung
nicht nur auf Microsoft-fremde Plattformen, sondern auch auf externe Clouds
ausdehnen k&#246;nnen." 

Eine wachsende Anzahl an Firmen &#252;bernimmt System Center Data Protection Manager
als Norm f&#252;r Windows-Backup und -Recovery. Viele dieser Firmen verwenden f&#252;r
gewisse Gesch&#228;ftsbereiche jedoch auch andere Betriebssysteme und Anwendungen und
m&#246;chten eine einheitliche L&#246;sung, durch die mit dem System Center Data
Protection Manger sowohl Daten aus Windows-Umgebungen als auch aus anderen
Umgebungen gesichert werden k&#246;nnen. Durch diese Zusammenarbeit erhalten Kunden
eine integrierte Datensicherungsumgebung f&#252;r Windows-Dateiserver und
-Anwendungen sowie f&#252;r andere Plattformen und Anwendungen wie UNIX, Linux,
Novell Netware, VMware, IBM i und Oracle. Dank einer integrierten L&#246;sung f&#252;r
alle Plattformen k&#246;nnen IT-Abteilungen Datensicherung und
Notfallwiederherstellung wirksamer und kosteng&#252;nstiger vornehmen. Durch die
Cloud-Option werden die Daten automatisch extern gelagert, wodurch die
gesch&#228;ftliche Kontinuit&#228;t auch bei Besch&#228;digung oder Zerst&#246;rung einer Anlage
gew&#228;hrleistet ist. 

&#8222;Durch unsere EVault-Technologie wird die Datensicherung in Clouds dank
Optimierung der Effizienz, Sicherheit und Flexibilit&#228;t der Daten&#252;bertragung &#252;ber
das Internet t&#228;glich f&#252;r mehr Kunden zu einem wesentlichen Teil von
Notfallwiederherstellungs-Programmen. Durch einzigartige Anwendungen,
Kompression und Deduplizierungstechnologie auf Blockebene bieten wir die
Vorteile eines externen Backups bei Notfallwiederherstellung ohne die Kosten f&#252;r
B&#228;nder oder f&#252;r physische Daten&#252;bertragungen", sagte George Hoenig, Vice
President der Produktabteilung bei i365. &#8222;Wir freuen uns, den Microsoft-Kunden
diese Funktionen im Rahmen der Cloud-Strategie von i365 anbieten zu k&#246;nnen." 

Die kombinierte L&#246;sung wird Kunden auch die M&#246;glichkeit geben, DPM und andere
Daten in Clouds zu sichern - eine attraktive Erg&#228;nzung zum internen Backup und
Recovery. Mit sofortigem Zugriff auf die Datensicherungs-Cloud von i365
profitieren DPM-Kunden von einem Netz an Tier-3- und
Tier-4-Hosting-Einrichtungen mit Zertifikat nach SAS 70 Typ II, von
WAN-optimiertem Backup und Recovery, von Notfallwiederherstellung-Spezialisten
und -Verfahren sowie von einer zw&#246;lfj&#228;hrigen Erfolgsgeschichte bei der

&#8222;Durch unsere Zusammenarbeit mit i365 k&#246;nnen unsere Kunden den von System Center
Data Protection Manager gebotenen Schutz sowohl auf Windows-Infrastrukturen und
-Anwendungen wie auch auf andere Plattformen innerhalb derselben Umgebung
ausdehnen", sagte Vij Rajarajan, Gesch&#228;ftsf&#252;hrer der Abteilung Management und
Services bei der Microsoft Corporation. &#8222;Infolgedessen k&#246;nnen Kunden die
Sicherung heterogener Daten rationalisieren und mit weniger Aufwand mehr

customers," said Terry Cunningham, general manager of i365. "Our products
capitalize on the new features and functionality in these Microsoft offerings to
make it even easier to interact with our solutions and improve performance." 

With the explosive growth of business critical data, it has become essential to
find new and improved ways to manage, review and interact with data to improve
knowledge worker efficiency. As a software developer, this new line of Microsoft
products provides i365 with new capabilities for improving the user experience.
Features such as touch, gesture and voice recognition capabilities enable i365
customers to more quickly and easily process information and manage
applications. 

Improving network performance utilization is also of key importance to both i365
and Microsoft customers as data links are of finite bandwidth and represent
significant ongoing costs. Improvements in bandwidth management through
technologies such as i365`s DeltaPro and Microsoft`s BranchCache enable upgraded
application designs to improve overall performance and actually save customers
money by reducing the associated demand on their IT infrastructures. DeltaPro
technology, for example, utilizes block level data deduplication to back up only
the changed blocks in the data, not entire files, meaning that less data is
moved across the network. This is critical for branch or remote offices that
want to centralize backups as well as for cloud-based data protection solutions.
Similarly, the BranchCache technology in Windows Server 2008 R2 improves
WAN-based application performance. With BranchCache technology, when a file is
requested in a branch or remote office location, local servers communicate to
determine if the file is already present or a server in the office is designated
as a caching machine, so that a locally pre-existing file never has to travel
between offices eliminating unnecessary network traffic and improving
performance. 

"Today`s businesses require fast, around-the-clock access to business
information," said Eric Jewett, director, Windows Server and Tools Services
Division, Microsoft Corp. "Our relationship with i365 provides our joint
customers with a streamlined computing experience, giving them the powerful
abilities to view, manipulate and analyze their data in a user-friendly way."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager Extended with i365 EVault
Software for Support of Heterogeneous Environments Both On-Premise and to the
Cloud
SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
i365, Inc., A Seagate Company (NASDAQ:STX), today announced a collaboration with
Microsoft on development of a heterogeneous solution that will allow IT managers
to extend Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) 2010 across
non-Microsoft platforms and into the cloud, using i365`s EVault data protection
software and cloud-connected storage solutions infrastructure. The combined
solution will be available in several configurations. The first configuration
will include an appliance-based backup solution, powered by Seagate technology,
which is scheduled for delivery in first half of 2010 with the release to
manufacturing of DPM 2010. This collaboration includes both technology and joint
go-to-market components. 

"System Center Data Protection Manager is seeing greater traction in the data
protection and recovery software market as more companies standardize on it to
protect their Windows-based environments," said Laura DuBois, IDC's research
director for Storage Software. "This partnership is a win-win for both
companies, allowing Microsoft customers to benefit from i365's proven
technology, expertise and cloud infrastructure to not only extend their data
protection across non-Microsoft platforms but also into the cloud for offsite
protection." 

A growing number of companies are adopting System Center Data Protection Manager
as their standard for Windows backup and recovery. Yet many of these companies
also run other operating systems and applications for part of their business and
want a single solution that extends System Center Data Protection Manager to
protect data from both Windows and non-Windows environments. This collaboration
will give customers an integrated data protection environment for Windows file
servers and applications, as well as other platforms and applications, such as
UNIX, Linux, Novell Netware, VMware, IBM i, and Oracle. One integrated solution
for all platforms enables IT teams to provide data protection and disaster
recovery more efficiently and with less cost. The cloud option automatically
brings the data offsite, ensuring business continuity even if a facility is
damaged or destroyed. 

"Our EVault technology is making cloud-based data protection an important part
of disaster recovery initiatives for more customers every day, optimizing the
efficiency, security, and flexibility of data transfer over the Internet.
Through unique edge appliances, compression, and block level deduplication
technology, we deliver the disaster recovery benefits of an offsite backup,
without the costs of tapes or transfers of physical media," said George Hoenig,
vice president, product operations, at i365. "We are delighted to be able to
offer these capabilities to the Microsoft customer base as a part of i365`s
cloud connected strategy." 

The combined solution will also give customers the ability to protect DPM and
other data in the cloud - an attractive complement to onsite backup and
recovery. With immediate access to the i365 data protection cloud, DPM customers
will benefit from a network of SAS 70 Type II certified, Tier 3 &amp; 4 hosting
facilities, WAN optimized backup and recovery, disaster recovery experts and
processes, and a 12-year track record protecting data for over 22,000 customers
across the globe. 

"By working with i365, our customers will be able to extend the protection
offered by System Center Data Protection Manager to both Windows infrastructure
and applications, but also other platforms within the same environment," said
Vij Rajarajan, general manager, Management and Services Division at Microsoft
Corp. "As a result, customers will be able to streamline the way they protect
heterogeneous data, achieving more with fewer resources." 

Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager is a member of the Microsoft
System Center family of management products, designed to help IT Professionals
manage their Windows environment. DPM 2010 delivers unified data protection for
Windows servers and clients as a best-of-breed backup and recovery solution from
Microsoft, for Windows environments. DPM 2010 provides the best protection and
most supportable restore scenarios for Windows environments to disk, tape and

Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Indian unit, which employs 5,300 people, has "no

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has rechristened its Oslo software modeling technology with the new name of SQL Server Modeling and will release a CTP (community technology preview) of the platform that uses the new name next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The codename, &#160;Oslo, will no longer be used, a Microsoft representative said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Keep up with the latest app dev issues and trends with InfoWorld's Fatal Exception and Strategic Developer blogs. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CTP, due at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference in Los Angeles, will feature: The M textual language for defining schemas, queries and domain-specific languages for SQL Server databases; the Quadrant tool for interacting with large datasets stored in SQL Server databases; and Repository, a SQL Server role for secure sharing of models between applications and systems. The components of the CTP will ship with a future version of SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In deliberating over Oslo in the past year, Microsoft determined the technology had value when applied to SQL Server, said Doug Purdy, Microsoft software architect, in a blog post on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Time after time we heard that M would make interacting with the database easier, provided we offered a good end-to-end experience with tools (Visual Studio) and frameworks (Entity Framework and Data Services) that developers use today," Purdy said. "We heard that developers wanted to use the novel data navigation/editing approach offered by Quadrant to access their data in whatever SQL Server they wanted, not just the Repository.&#160; We heard that the notion of a Repository as something other than SQL Server was getting in the way of our conversations with customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oslo was revealed in 2007 as a multi-year, multi-product effort to simplify the application development lifecycle by enhancing .Net, Visual Studio, BizTalk, and SQL Server, Purdy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At PDC (Professional Developer Conference) 2008, we announced that various pieces of Oslo were being spun off and shipped in the application server (Dublin), the cloud (.Net Services), and the .Net Framework (WF/WCF 4.0)," Purdy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, three community technology previews based on Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 2008 PDC, Microsoft found that customers were confused by using the Oslo name to talk about several technologies including a new version of BizTalk, a new tool and a new workflow engine, Purdy said in an August blog post. The company also found it was possible to roll out Oslo technologies in already-established products rather than creating a separate Oslo "wave," Purdy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft then decided to use the term "Oslo" to refer just to the modeling pieces of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft rechristens Oslo modeling platform," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has pulled out of a mandate to handle what would be South Korea's largest IPO since 2006, worth an estimated $2 billion, with Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) picked to replace the U.S. investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea Life Insurance Co, the country's No. 2 life insurer, said on Wednesday that Goldman had dropped out of its IPO process, citing unspecified internal matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Korea Life picked six banks, including Goldman, JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), and three domestic securities houses to manage the IPO, expected to take place in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman and Credit Suisse declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debates over mandates for IPOs and rights offerings have surfaced in South Korea this year, as a stock market recovery emboldens companies to push ahead with delayed offering plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, KB Financial Group (105560.KS), the parent company of top South Korean bank Kookmin, switched the foreign underwriters for its $900 million rights offering following a disagreement over fees, banking sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korea Life joins a rash of planned insurance offerings in Asia as the industry seeks to expand and rising stock markets lift earnings for life insurers, for which investment returns are a key source of income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Asia insurance IPO list includes AIG's (AIG.N) AIA, Shanghai-traded China Pacific Insurance (601601.SS), which aims to raise $3.5 billion in Hong Kong, Reliance Life in India and Japan's Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kim Yeon-hee; Editing by Jonathan Hopfner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has yanked a tool it touted as a way for netbook owners to install Windows 7 without a DVD drive after a prominent blogger accused the company of using open-source code without acknowledging where it originated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free utility, Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (WUDT), has been pulled from Microsoft's site, as has the page of instructions on how it was to be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released the Download Tool last month, and at the time trumpeted the utility as a workaround that would let netbook owners create a bootable flash drive from a downloaded .iso file, or disk image, of Windows 7 purchased from Microsoft's online store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are currently looking into this issue and are taking down WUDT from the Microsoft Store site until our investigations are complete," a Microsoft spokeswoman said in an instant message reply to questions Tuesday. "We apologize to our customers for any inconvenience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move was prompted by Rafael Rivera's claim last Friday that WUDT included code gleaned from a GPLv2-licensed open-source project. Rivera, who writes the Within Windows blog, said Microsoft had "obviously lifted" code from the ImageMaster project, and had then compounded the problem by not sharing the source code for its modifications, or the tool itself, to the project, as required by the terms of GPL (GNU General Public License).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPL is a widely-used free software license that was originally drafted by Richard Stallman of the GNU project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has previously released several code modules under GPL, including the Live Services Plug-in for Moodle last July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Microsoft declined to answer questions about the future of WUDT, including whether it would re-release the tool at some point, and whether the utility had been removed from its site because of the GPL brouhaha that Rivera instigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivera said he was "99.9999% sure" that Microsoft used the open-source code within WUDT, and provided code examples to prove his point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not a GPL expert -- the thing reads like Latin -- but it is my understanding that the tool would have to be open-sourced, as required by GPL," Rivera said today in an interview conducted via instant messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, the algorithm in question originated with the open-source file archiving software, 7zip, which is licensed under the LGPL, or GNU Lesser General Public License, a software license published by the Free Software Foundation, said Rivera. Microsoft's tool grabbed code from the GPL-protected ImageMaster project, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to Microsoft's next step, the company was mum, although Rivera took a stab at its alternatives. "Ultimately, I believe one of two things will happen: The tool will either be rewritten or open-sourced," said Rivera. "I suppose the third option would be [to make it] no longer available."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today patched 15 vulnerabilities in Windows, Windows Server, Excel and Word, including one that will probably be exploited quickly by hackers. None affect Windows 7, the company's newest operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 15 flaws fixed in Tuesday's six security updates were less than half the record 34 Microsoft patched last month in 13 separate bulletins. Of today's 15 bugs, three were tagged "critical" by Microsoft, while the remaining 12 were labeled as "important," the next-lowest rating in the company's four-step severity scoring system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts agreed that users should focus on MS09-065 first and foremost. That update, which was ranked critical, affects all still-supported editions of Windows with the exception of Windows 7 and its server sibling, Windows Server 2008 R2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Windows kernel vulnerability is going to take the cake," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. "The attack vector can be driven through Internet Explorer, and this is one of those instances where the user won't be notified or prompted. This is absolutely a drive-by attack scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richie Lai, the director of vulnerability research at security company Qualys, agreed. "Anyone running IE [Internet Explorer] is at risk here, even though the flaw is not in the browser, but in the Win32k kernel mode driver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Storms and Lai were referring to the one bug marked critical in MS09-065, which actually patched a trio of vulnerabilities. According to Microsoft, the Windows kernel improperly parses Embedded OpenType (EOT) fonts, which are a compact form of fonts designed for use on Web pages. EOT fonts, however, can also be used in Word and PowerPoint documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackers could also launch attacks by attaching Word or PowerPoint documents to e-mail messages, then duping users into opening those documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lieu of patching the problem, users can easily block the most likely attacks by disabling IE's support for embedded fonts. "That's a low-impact mitigation," Lai said. "The worst that could happen is that some sites might look ugly." His advice would still leave PCs open to attack via malicious Word or PowerPoint documents, a point Microsoft also made in the vulnerability's write-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were not affected by the MS09-065 update, Storms and Lai assumed that Microsoft caught the bug before it wrapped up the final code, or release to manufacturing (RTM) build, of the operating system, and is only now getting around to plugging the holes in Windows 2000, XP and Vista, as well as Server 2003 and Server 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 7 Release Candidate [RC] is probably vulnerable," said Storms, citing Microsoft's policy of not providing security updates for preview versions of an operating system when the final has been released. "That's why you don't see Microsoft patching Windows 7 RC or Beta," said Storms. "For anyone still running RC, they should take heed and upgrade to the RTM."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Storms speculated that Microsoft knew the EOT font flaw was a security issue -- and waited until now to patch older Windows -- Lai thought that Microsoft didn't realize until recently that it was also a security vulnerability in editions prior to Windows 7. "I think they fixed this bug as part of the code sanitization during [Windows 7's] development cycle. It was actually only publicly disclosed recently, and then they patched it in other Windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acknowledged that information about the EOT vulnerability had gone public before today's patch. "While the initial report was provided through responsible disclosure, the vulnerability was later disclosed publicly by a separate party," stated the accompanying advisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms expects to see attackers jump on the EOT vulnerability. "This is the one to watch in the coming weeks, not only because of its novelty, but also because it can be exploited through IE, which is the easy route, as well as through Word and PowerPoint documents," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also issued critical updates for Vista and Server 2008 , as well as for Windows 2000 Server. On the latter, which harbors a bug in its implementation of the License Logging Server , a tool originally designed to help customers manage Server Client Access Licenses (CAL), Storms urged users of that aged operating system to apply the patch pronto, even though the machines are probably well-protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 2000 Server has the logging server enabled by default, but those systems are likely behind multiple firewalls, and people running [Windows 2000 Server] are pretty cognizant of the fact that it's an older version and will act accordingly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excel and Word also received patches today. Eight vulnerabilities were addressed in Excel in MS09-067 and one in Word with MS09-068 . Both updates also affected the Mac editions, Office 2004 and Office 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are the kind of file format vulnerabilities we've seen many times before," said Storms, noting in a follow-up instant message that the bugs are in the older, binary file formats, not in the newer XML-based formats that Microsoft debuted in Office 2007 for Windows and Office 2008 for Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month's security updates can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

JAVA Earnings Beat, Sales Lag

Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq: JAVA) reported results for the first quarter of
fiscal 2010 in an SEC filing. Lower operating expenses and higher gross margin
helped the company lower its first quarter GAAP loss to $120 million, or 16
cents per share from a loss of $1.68 billion or $2.24 per share reported in the
year-ago period and beating the Zacks Consensus estimate of a loss of 23 cents
per share. 

Earnings on a non-GAAP basis (excluding one-time items) rose to 2 cents per
share in the quarter from a net loss of 8 cents per share in the year-ago
period. Gross margin improved to 43.4% from 40.2% a year ago. Operating expenses
were down 62.3% year over year, as a result of which operating margin improved
to -4.5% from -55.2% in the year-ago quarter. 

However, total revenue fell 25% to $2.24 billion, with both Products and Service
revenues declining 32.7% and 13.9%, respectively from the year-ago period.
Revenue was lower than the Zacks Consensus estimate of $2.34 billion. Sales on a
year-over-year basis were down 19.1% in North America, down 29.2% in Europe,
down 32.8% in emerging markets and down 23.3% in the Asia-Pacific. 

Revenue from servers fell 31.4% and from storage products almost 35.9% compared
to the year-ago period. Revenue from new products dropped 33%, while unit sales
of servers were down 41%. 

Revenue from Support Services decreased primarily due to customers seeking
higher discounts, delays in service contract renewals and strong competitive
pressures. Professional Services revenue decreased primarily due to decreased
sales in the Systems business. 

The company said that revenue fell across all of its product lines negatively
impacted by the pending approval from the European Commission and other foreign
regulators on its acquisition by Oracle Corp. (Nasdaq: ORCL). The delay in
approval from the regulatory body is causing Sun Micro to lose about $100
million each month. 

Sun had earlier announced a headcount reduction of 3,000 or 10% over the next 12
months. It has already eliminated 7,600 positions in the past three years. The
company, which is under severe financial pressure, is struggling to survive the
recession. 

Despite cost-cutting efforts and increased layoffs, we remain concerned about
the delay in closing the merger, which could reduce its value for Oracle's

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Bank Failure Tally Reaches 120

The FDIC entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with Ameris Bank,
Moultrie, Georgia, to assume all of the deposits of United Security Bank;
Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana, to assume all of the
deposits of Home Federal Savings Bank; Alerus Financial, National Association,
Grand Forks, North Dakota, to assume all of the deposits of Prosperan Bank;
Central Bank of Kansas City to assume all of the deposits of Gateway Bank of St.
Louis; and East West Bank, Pasadena, California, to assume all of the deposits
of United Commercial Bank. 

In order to replenish the declining fund, the FDIC board recently proposed that
approximately 8,100 insured U.S. banks and savings institutions should pay fees
for three years in advance. Also, the regulators are considering requesting the
healthy banks to bail out the government as soon as it is necessary to replenish
the deposit insurance fund, which has slipped to 0.22% of insured deposits,
below the mandated minimum of 1.15%. 

In the second quarter of 2009, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 416 from 305 in the first quarter. This is the highest
since the savings and loan crisis in 1994. Increasing loan losses on commercial
real estate are expected to cause hundreds more bank failures in the next few
years. The FDIC anticipates the bank failures to cost about $100 billion over
the next four years. 

The failure of Washington Mutual last year was the largest in U.S. history. It
was acquired by JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Other major acquirers of failed
institutions since 2008 include U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq:
ZION), SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), to name a few.

</body></entry><entry author="None" date="2009-11-10T21:07:29+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/idgSmallBusiness/idUS21217314220091110"><headline>Opinion: SharePoint: Is Microsoft's biggest recent success at risk?</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;In several years of mostly gloomy news coming out of Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash., there has been one bright spot for the company: The enterprise portal and collaboration tool SharePoint. While Windows sales have lagged, and the company's Internet business is still heavily in the red, SharePoint is thriving and showing the kind of market growth that even a start-up would envy. But the good times may not stay around forever, particularly if Google ever makes serious inroads into the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start off with the good news for Microsoft. In late October, the company held its annual SharePoint conference, and it drew 8,000 attendees, up from 1,300 for the inaugural conference in 2006. Back then, Microsoft said it had 75 million licensed SharePoint users. Last year, Microsoft reported more than 100 million users, and total SharePoint sales of more than $1 billion. This year, according to Jeff Teper, Microsoft's corporate vice president for SharePoint, sales will be over $1.3 billion, for a growth rate of more than 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that SharePoint was first launched in 2000, when it was called Office Server Extensions, those are pretty impressive figures -- from zero to more than $1.3 billion in less than a decade. Steve Ballmer has even called SharePoint "Microsoft's next big operating system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, an IDC report issued in October found that 53.4% of IT professionals in its survey said their companies have already deployed SharePoint, 62.2% have already deployed it or plan to deploy it, and 70.6% have already deployed it, are committed to deploying it or will consider deploying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given all that, what could be wrong? To begin with, the IDC report found that only 22% of employees in the companies surveyed were actually using SharePoint. That might mean that it might be "shelfware" -- software purchased but not used. If that's the case, growth might be a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IDC report also found that companies that use SharePoint team sites for collaboration have a difficult time managing content on the sites -- 54.2% say that doing so is a tremendous challenge. That means that if simpler alternatives were available, SharePoint could be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, there's Google, which continues to target the enterprise. Although Google Docs doesn't do nearly what SharePoint does, it still allows for basic collaboration. And Google has released a very early version of a more sophisticated tool, Google Wave , which is clearly aimed at workgroup, departmental and long-distance collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence that Google is making some headway. Google claims that Google Apps is being used at 2 million companies, with 20 million active users . Recently, Google signed a five-year $7.25 million deal with the city of Los Angeles for Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't to say that SharePoint faces an imminent threat. Google Docs is still a crude collaboration tool compared to SharePoint. Google Wave may be innovative, but it doesn't offer nearly all of the kinds of collaboration that SharePoint does. And Google, despite some headway, still hasn't seriously cracked the enterprise market. As for a simpler collaboration tool, no serious competitor has yet materialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for now it's full speed ahead for SharePoint. Microsoft is expanding its use, pushing the company's Business Productivity Online Suite by lowering its price and introducing it into 15 more countries -- and SharePoint is included in that suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft knows better than any company that market dominance can quickly fade. There was a time, after all, when WordPerfect was the dominant word processor, and Netscape the most popular browser. So Microsoft would do well to hold off on the champagne. If Google Docs and Google Wave ever take off, SharePoint could eventually be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston Gralla is a contributing editor for Computerworld.com and the author of more than 35 books, including How the Internet Works (Que, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through Power Purchase Agreement with SunEdison, Procter &amp; Gamble Will Help
Offset an Estimated 36.9 Million Pounds of Carbon Dioxide Emissions over 20
Years
OXNARD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
SunEdison and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG) celebrated today the activation of a
1.1 megawatt (MW) photovoltaic solar system at Proctor &amp; Gamble`s paper products
manufacturing plant in Oxnard, California. The event was attended by Mayor Tom
Holden of Oxnard; Senator Fran Pavley of the 23rd District; Karen Kukurin,
Deputy Director, Community Liaison Office of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger; and
a representative from the office of Congresswoman Lois Capps of the 23rd
District. Also attending were executives from Procter &amp; Gamble and SunEdison,
the solar services provider that financed, built and will maintain the solar
energy system. 

The roof-mounted photovoltaic solar energy system is projected to produce more
than 1.9 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of clean solar energy during its first
year of operation. Over 20 years, the system is estimated to produce more than
34 million kWh, enough energy to power 3,267 average U.S. homes for a year. 

According to Vera Ingenhuett, plant manager of the P Oxnard facility,
"Activating this solar energy system is a milestone in meeting our goals for
sustainability. P recently doubled the corporation`s 2012 per-unit reduction
targets for greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation and water and energy
consumption, and solar energy is a major component of our energy strategy. For
our Oxnard project, SunEdison`s SPSA business model allowed us to move from
construction to activation in two-and-a-half months." 

Brian Jacolick, SunEdison`s General Manager, Americas, said, "P continues to
be a model for corporate energy responsibility. Activation of this
zero-emissions system in Oxnard means that, over 20 years, an estimated 36.9
million pounds of carbon dioxide that would have been emitted during the
production of electricity from fossil fuels will be removed. This is the
equivalent of taking 3,620 cars off the road for one year." 

Carlos Domenech, President of SunEdison, commented, "We are delighted and
honored to enable P to achieve its environmental and energy goals. This is the
type of leadership needed to inspire others to take an active role protecting
the environment, managing energy, and creating jobs in their communities. We are
delighted to be part of this project." 

The 20-year solar power services agreement (SPSA) with SunEdison required no
upfront capital from P Electricity from SunEdison will be purchased by P at
long-term, predictably priced rates.

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Returns from commodities are
expected to remain strong up to another two years as prices of
key raw materials such as oil, copper and corn rise further
from supply deficits, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Tuesday.

 Wall Street's most-watched investment banker and commodity
markets mover said it was also bullish on gold after a streak
of record highs above $1,000 an ounce in the precious metal.

 "For gold, the ongoing shift of central banks and
governments from being net sellers of gold to net buyers in the
context of declining real rates have continued to lend support
to prices, with risks remaining to the upside despite recent
gains, in our view," Goldman said in a research note.

 "Going forward, we maintain that key commodities across the
complex including oil, copper and corn, will shift into global
deficits in the coming months owing to a combination of demand
and supply drivers, which would likely generate substantial
further price and returns upside," Goldman said.

 The uptrend could continue for up to two years, with
intermittent volatility, it said.

 Goldman also projected returns of 17.5 percent over a
12-month period on the SP GSCI Commodities Index .SPGSCI and
recommended investors to be overweight commodities.

 "We believe that the recent performance is just the
beginning of strong expected commodity returns over the coming
12 to 24 months," it said.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has brought out its legal hammer against a businessman who publicized a problem with an incentive program run alongside the company's Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bing Cashback program returns to shoppers a small percentage of money for items they buy that were found through some ads on the search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to attract customers with a rebate and allow advertisers to only pay Microsoft for searches that result in a purchase, known as a "pay-per-action" fee. The rebate is based on a percentage of the purchase price and is determined by the advertiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Samir Meghani, who co-founded a price-comparison search engine called Bountii.com, wrote on his blog on Nov. 4 that he had found an error in the way purchases are reported back to Bing for the cashback deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merchants can place a tracking pixel on their order confirmation page that will report to Bing when a transaction is complete. Meghani said he found it was possible to report fake transactions back to Bing, making customers eligible for cashback rewards when in fact they haven't bought anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meghani wrote that Bing seemed unable to detect the fake transactions right away, and that his Cashback account held $2,080.06. He did not post technical details of the flaw, but wrote that "it's not complicated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It probably doesn't help that Meghani's Bountii.com could be viewed as a competitor to Bing, albeit a minor one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft responded by sending Meghani a cease-and-desist letter dated Nov. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft believes that your actions and the direction you are providing to others regarding this method of misuse violates various laws related to computer intrusion, unauthorized access and unauthorized use of information," wrote Gabriel M. Ramsey, of Orrick, Herrington  Sutcliffe, on behalf of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meghani has since removed his original blog post, but the post is still held -- ironically -- in Bing's cache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also closed Meghani's cashback account. In a subsequent post, Meghani said he had no intention of defrauding the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The purpose of my post was to show an implementation problem, not to encourage defrauding Microsoft," Meghani wrote. "I am surprised they would go through this much trouble to make me take down information that is obvious to anyone reading their documentation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft officials in London could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on Mobile Bay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 10 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said
Tuesday its U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations have returned to
normal following Tropical Storm Ida, but it's waiting for
better weather to assess and restart offshore production at its
Mobile Bay facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokesman said the structures the company operates
in Mobile Bay, located in waters near Mobile, Alabama, were for
natural gas production only. Ida swept ashore close to Mobile
Bay early Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once Exxon can ensure that the Mobile Bay operations are
"both safe and operational," the company will restart normal
operations there, it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ida has been downgraded to a tropical depression.

&lt;p&gt;Business intelligence competency center reduces reporting demands, improves
productivity
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Nucleus Research analysts examined the deployment of IBM Cognos BI at Martin`s
Point Health Care and found a 1,185% return on investment (ROI) with payback in
one month. 

Martin`s Point Health Care is a not-for-profit regional health care provider
operating nine facilities in Maine and New Hampshire. The agency also
administers the US Family Health Plan in northern New England and New York, as
well as Medicare Advantage health plans and health management services in Maine.


Martin`s Point Health Care needed a more efficient way to make information
available to its employees. The company did not have a unified approach to
reporting and data publication, plus the updating of reports was labor intensive
and costly. The approach to make custom reports for each end-user in support of
operational and financial decisions prevented the company from benefiting from
better analytics and data management. Martin`s Point Health Care decided to
address this issue by realigning the informatics team and building a unified
view of the agency`s data and interactive functionality built upon its existing
IBM Cognos BI solutions. As a result they built a new Business Intelligence
Competency Center (BICC). 

The new BICC reduced the costs of report creation and improved the productivity
of data users. In selectively fulfilling report requests, Martin`s Point Health
Care has reduced report building by 20%. The company has further improved
productivity by being able to spend far less time locating and manually
analyzing information from various reports and databases. 

"This deployment shows how a BICC can leverage existing software investments.
The BICC initiated a cultural shift around reporting and persuaded people to
better utilize existing end-user driven reporting and analysis tools. As a
result, report request volumes decreased significantly and data users became
more productive," said David O`Connell, senior analyst, Nucleus Research. 

All Nucleus Research ROI case studies are independent assessments, evaluating
the costs and benefits from the IT deployment. The case study is available at
www.NucleusResearch.com

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chase, one of the nation`s leading home lenders, today announced that it plans
to hire 1,200 mortgage loan officers by the end of 2010, increasing the sales
force 60 percent to help more Chase customers finance home purchases or reduce
their monthly payments through refinances. 

"We have made a number of strategic investments in our organization," said Dave
Lowman, head of home lending at Chase. "We have invested in new systems,
aggressively grown our capacity and now are looking to increase our sales force.
With our vast branch network and growing customer base, the opportunity for
Chase loan officers is tremendous." 

New loan officers will serve customers through bank branches in 23 states --
including key states such as California, Florida and Texas and key metro areas
such as New York and Chicago - as well as metro markets outside the bank`s
branch footprint, such as Boston, St. Louis and Washington D.C. They will help
consumers meet their home financing needs by working with personal bankers and
referral sources, such as real estate agents and builders, as well as with their
own network of homeowners. 

"With nearly 5,200 bank branches -- one of the largest networks in the country
-- we need to ensure each branch has seasoned mortgage professionals to help
meet the needs of their communities and is well positioned when the housing
market fully recovers," said Lowman. "We see the mortgage business as core to
our relationship with consumers and expect to be a major leader in the industry
for many years to come." 

Chase`s home lending team is well-equipped to serve consumers:

* The financial strength of parent company JPMorgan Chase enables it to continue
to lend prudently to an array of customers - from exclusive union member
relationships, to being a top FHA mortgage lender, to having a strong jumbo
portfolio capability. 
* Chase is the nation`s third-largest lender, originating $37.1 billion in
mortgages in the last quarter. 
* 43 percent of U.S. households are near a Chase branch. 
* 55 percent of the nation`s real estate offices are within five miles of a
Chase branch. 
* Its new patent-pending Chase Exclusives 1% Mortgage Cash Back offer can save
homeowners thousands and shorten their mortgage by months by paying them 1% of
their scheduled monthly principal and interest mortgage payment annually.

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) said gold could rise to record highs in a range
from $1,150 to $1,200 an ounce, driven by declining real
interest rates and renewed buying interest by central banks.

 The fact that the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) remained under 1.5
percent suggested upside risk to its gold forecast, Goldman
said in a note dated Monday,

 Goldman continues to have a 12-month target of $960 an
ounce for gold. Spot bullion XAU= traded at above $1,100 an
ounce on Tuesday after a strong rally in the last two months.

 "Should 10-year TIPS yields remain at these levels, we
would expect gold price to move to $1,150 to $1,200 a troy
ounce," Goldman said.

  The sale of 200 tonnes of gold to India by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) signaled an ongoing shift of
central banks and governments from being net sellers to net
buyers of gold, the bank also said. [ID:nSP375900]

 "The purchase by India highlights the growing trend of
central banks and governments in the emerging economies to
increase gold holdings as a means of diversifying their
currency reserves," Goldman said.

"Programmer productivity and time to market are key areas of focus for all of
us. This unique development environment put together by Avnet and Analog Devices
offers the hardware power and flexibility to address a full range of
applications," said Colin Miller, Product Unit Manager, Microsoft. "By enabling
the .NET Micro Framework on this board, the developers now have access to modern
programming models and tools(including Visual Studio) that have made the desktop
environment so productive while maintaining the access to the underlying
hardware that is needed. The virtualization of the hardware `future proofs` the
applications so that work done on these development platforms can migrate easily
to the eventual products." 

"Embedded devices continue to become a more common part of the larger design
solution. Integrating technologies such as the BF518F FMC Development Kit into
applications gives designers the capabilities and enhancements they need,

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX, Nov 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Alliance for Gray Market and Counterfeit Abatement (AGMA), a
non-profit organization dedicated to addressing the gray marketing and
counterfeiting of branded goods around the globe, today announced that
its base of member companies continues to grow as some of the biggest
names in the high tech industry unite behind its cause. IBM, Oracle and
Samsung Electronics America have joined AGMA.

    AGMA provides a platform for sharing collaborative strategies, brand
protection programs and effective processes which address the growing
threats of counterfeiting, gray market fraud and service and warranty
abuse in the IT sector. Ultimately, AGMA and its member companies, now
including IBM, Oracle and Samsung Electronics America, strive to reduce
the risks these threats present to consumers and the IT industry as a
whole. The goal is to render these illegal activities more difficult,
undesirable and unprofitable for the perpetrators.

    "Samsung Electronics America is pleased to join with other leaders in the
technology industry as a member of AGMA," said Jeff Sampson, supplies
marketing manager for Samsung Electronics America ITD. "The goals and
activities of AGMA are in alignment with our ongoing efforts to mitigate
the negative economic and social effects of gray marketing, counterfeiting
and service abuse on Samsung's unsuspecting customers. Samsung is
dedicated to taking aggressive actions to protect our customers, our
reseller channels and the value of the Samsung brand against these
abuses."

    AGMA conferences are an open forum to discuss trends, issues and
approaches to gray market fraud, counterfeiting and service abuse in the
technology sector. Members and guests receive invaluable insights to
combat, deter and prevent the global impact of the gray market and
counterfeiting on their intellectual property rights. AGMA's recent
quarterly conference held October 21-22 and hosted by Juniper Networks in
Sunnyvale, Calif. is one example:


--  Mitch Gaynor, senior vice president and general counsel for Juniper
    Networks, presented his perspective on gray market fraud and
    counterfeiting, noting several keys to combating these issues while
    maximizing revenue and maintaining a solid corporate reputation;
--  Cisco's Jeff Bonham, senior manager of service abuse investigations,
    provided members with a case study that detailed service abuse in action,
    as well as ways to identify and combat the problem;
--  Marla Briscoe, HP's brand protection, Americas manager and AGMA vice
    president, discussed the importance of having executives sign on to
    implement policies and procedures that can prevent and detect gray market
    fraud.
    

    
The conference also featured a collective discussion about the recent
whitepaper issued by AGMA and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, titled "Service
Blues: Effectively Managing the Multi-Billion Dollar Threat from Product
Warranty and Support Abuse." This whitepaper is intended to help raise
awareness of the issue of warranty and service abuse, as well as offer
strategies, programs and effective processes to combat this growing
problem. Click here to obtain a copy of this whitepaper from the AGMA
website: Service Blues: Effectively Managing the Multi-Billion Dollar
Threat from Product Warranty and Support Abuse.

    According to AGMA president Ram Manchi, "We look forward to a positive,
synergistic relationship with our new member companies, all of whom are
leaders in their respective fields and have much to offer, including
unique educational resources and best practices. Our mission to mitigate
the counterfeiting of IT products and stem the unauthorized flow of goods
into the gray market cannot succeed without our members."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, in Conjunction with Partner DataCore Software, is Showcasing
End-to-End Solutions to Help Customers Deploy Integrated Site Recovery
Solutions; Supports Simple, Cost-Effective Distributed Site Recovery for Both
Physical and Virtual Infrastructures
BERLIN &amp; FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
DataCore Software, a leading provider of storage virtualization, is being
featured within the Microsoft Tech-Ed Virtualization pavilion. DataCore will
showcase its ground-breaking Advanced Site Recovery (ASR) solution for virtual
and physical IT infrastructures. Unlike other site recovery approaches that are
limited to a specific vendor`s virtual machine recovery, DataCore ASR enables
both physical and virtual servers to be protected across multiple sites.The
combination of DataCore ASR and Microsoft Hyper-V/ Microsoft Windows Server 2008
R2 Failover and Clustering features enables businesses to embrace "real-world"
Distributed Disaster Recovery (D-DR) - allowing organizations to
cost-effectively spread disaster recovery (DR) responsibilities across several
smaller sites. 

Market Forces: New Virtualization Drivers; Comprehensive Solutions

Despite the tough economic times, Microsoft has noted recent studies which have
reported that over 30% of businesses surveyed this year indicated DR will be
their main driver for virtualization. These reports show a continued shift, as
IT professionals look at addressing new challenges beyond test/dev and basic
server consolidation scenarios in deploying virtualization technologies. 

Microsoft has clearly recognized the importance of site recovery solutions in
terms of addressing real-world user scenarios and the benefit of partnering to
provide end-to-end solutions that together overcome the limitations of
single-vendor, specific site recovery solutions such as VMware`s SRM. 

Microsoft and DataCore Software Combine to Address `Real-World` Site Recovery

Taking machines from one site and replicating them to another site before a
calamity unfolds is not new. But buyer beware. Many other disaster recovery
products are limiting in that they assume recovery, from one environment to an
identical or very similar environment or they support only a subset of the
infrastructure. Often physical servers are not supported or require a separate
solution from applications and virtual servers. DataCore ASR enables users to
execute site recovery operations in a way that is fundamentally different from
existing solutions in the marketplace today by bringing the data center together
into a single solution. 

"The industry is conditioned to think of DR as a one-to-one proposition. This
places unreasonable demands on a single recovery site that mirrors the main
site," argues Augie Gonzalez, product marketing director at DataCore Software. 

"But most organizations aren't structured that way. They look more like a hub
and spoke, with smaller branches emanating from the central data center. For
this reason, DataCore's Advanced Site Recovery distributes the disaster recovery
workloads among these smaller entities, allowing each of them to accept a more
manageable role in keeping the business going." 

The combination provides a cost-effective way to have IT assets at remote office
and branch offices (ROBOs) take over for the main datacenter when the central
machines are unable to meet processing obligations. Whether this is during
planned facility outage or an unexpected disaster makes no difference. 

"We recognize that economic pressures preclude all but the most affluent
organizations from dedicating another mirror site to back up their main data
center. So we've chosen to tap the horsepower available at the ROBOs during
emergencies," adds Gonzalez. "Given a choice, customers will opt to run their
business on systems in a remote office or branch office machine versus not doing
business at all." 

The combination of DataCore`s storage virtualization, ASR software and Microsoft
supports site configurations where different physical servers and storage
devices are used at ROBOs from those found at the central site, as is
commonplace in most distributed organizations. 

DataCore Advanced Site Recovery

DataCore ASR performs its work in the background, continuously replicating disk
updates between the main datacenter and each participating branch office. Only
the subset of information appropriate to a branch's back-up role is transmitted.


When an emergency ensues, the push of a button triggers ASR to use the last
known good state from the central site to quickly restart the workloads at the
back-up locations. From this point on, the designated remote machines carry on
their portion of the workload in place of the main datacenter servers. The
switchover process is reversed when the main site is once again ready. 

Beyond the clear cost savings of repurposing ROBO IT assets and personnel for
business continuity, DataCore's innovative distributed approach yields several
other benefits. For example, regular disaster recovery tests and refresher
training can be performed at each branch during periods of slow activity while
the main datacenter processing continues undisturbed.

A Winning Combination: Microsoft and DataCore Software

DataCore`s Advanced Site Recovery solution can be seen this week in the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co JPM.N is raising lending to small businesses by $4 billion this year and hiring more than 300 new bankers to cater to these businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second largest U.S. bank said it now plans to add about $10 billion in total new lending this year to companies with annual sales of less than $20 million and it will hire about 325 bankers to help with this push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've seen from our customers some renewed vigor for credit," said Kevin Watters, chief executive of business banking at Chase, in an interview. "Demand has started to pick up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The improving economy also prompted JPMorgan to increase lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things we're seeing in terms of some stabilization in the economy would tell us this is a very good time to aggressively gain market share in small business lending," Watters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other banks that received billions of dollars in bank bailout funds last year, JPMorgan has come under pressure from lawmakers to boost lending to help the U.S. economy out of recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank repaid its $25 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program funds this summer and it has taken pains to show it is making loans and supporting the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have never stopped lending," said Watters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest move follows other initiatives, including a mortgage modification program for homeowners and a new credit card for business customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, JPMorgan lifted on Monday a freeze on salaries for employees earning more than $60,000, according to a memo that a spokesman confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

of the Calix E7 Ethernet Service Access Platform (ESAP). 

Calix has worked closely with Microsoft to implement the full extent of current
and emerging Mediaroom features and map them to the realities of communications
service provider deployments. The Calix C7 and E7 platforms have been
specifically optimized to support many of the unique features enabled by
Mediaroom: 

1. For service providers transitioning from legacy middleware environments to
Microsoft Mediaroom, the Calix Unified Access Infrastructure can support dual
middleware environments and has the capacity to handle the duplication of
extensive channel line-ups. 

2. Calix supports video service quality management functionality, which
seamlessly manages the subscriber experience in situations where the breadth of
Microsoft Mediaroom functionality may exceed the total bandwidth available in
bandwidth-constrained deployments. 

3. Network address translation (NAT) support across the Calix Unified Access
Infrastructure enables a home gateway model, allowing Microsoft Mediaroom to
deliver robust media sharing functionality throughout the subscriber home
environment. 

4. Comprehensive support for advanced Microsoft Mediaroom services and features
across the Calix Unified Access Infrastructure, including virtually any wireline
protocol (ADSL2+ and VDSL2, including bonding, GPON, and Active Ethernet) and
any physical media (copper or fiber). 

Dan McCrary, director of business development, TV, Video &amp; Music Platforms
Business, Microsoft, said: "While our initial success with Mediaroom has
centered on the major tier-1 Telcos, we have since optimized the platform to
make it more accessible and compelling for operators and deployments of all
sizes. By partnering with communications equipment providers such as Calix we
are able to scale our deployment capability and provide specialist expertise to
the broader range of customers choosing to deliver advanced TV services with
Microsoft Mediaroom." 

"This year at TelcoTV, Calix is once again raising the bar by demonstrating the
most advanced home entertainment experience on the show floor across an access
infrastructure that offers the most deployment flexibility," said Geoff Burke,
Calix senior director of corporate marketing. "Calix has created a clear picture
of how service providers can redefine the integrated home experience, and
implement it with flexible access solutions. Most importantly, our customers
deploying Microsoft Mediaroom over the Calix Unified Access Infrastructure,
which range from small rural IOCs to major regional ILECs, have communicated
that this combination is cost-effectively providing them with the differentiated
services they need to compete and win."

&lt;p&gt;TAMPA, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
nFinanSe Inc. (OTCBB:NFSE) (www.nfinanse.com) today announced it will be
launching its new Visa Reloadable Prepaid Debit Card in Winn-Dixie Supermarkets
in December 2009. 

As shown, the new, deep gold card and stylish metallic blue packaging present a
bold, striking, yet elegant effect, and has been designed to attract the eye of
a consumer as she approaches a retail store display fixture. The card and
packaging were designed by Fifty Eight Advertising, an Atlanta-based advertising
firm. 

Mike Gustafson, Creative Director for Fifty Eight Advertising, said, "We wanted
to design packaging that was sleek and aesthetically pleasing yet, we wanted it
to `pop' when you saw it on the retail display fixture. We decided to achieve
this by developing a modified-monochrome look which highlights two key focal
points - a $3 retail sales price, which we believe to be the lowest in the
marketplace, and the Visa logo." 

The Company also stated that another objective of its new Visa Reloadable
Prepaid Debit Card packaging design was to improve the transparency of fees for
consumers. 

Jerry R. Welch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of nFinanSe, said, "We have
worked hard to bring a consumer friendly approach to the prepaid card industry
and have been a leader in establishing `best practices` such as low fees and
free 24/7 customer service - and now extending that leadership to drive more
transparency of associated fees for consumers." 

The Company`s new Visa Reloadable Prepaid Debit Card will feature what the
Company believes to be the best overall pricing in the marketplace at this time.
The new card will sell for $3 at retail stores and will not charge the consumer
any fees on purchase transactions. It will have a low $2.95 monthly maintenance
fee for an unlimited number of purchase transactions and will allow consumers to
load additional funds for only $2.95. The Company`s Visa Reloadable Prepaid
Debit Card will charge a customer $1.50 to withdraw funds at an ATM but will
offer free direct deposit of payroll, free receipt of bank transfers to the
card, free live customer service in English and Spanish and free cell phone text
message alerts with purchase and balance information after each transaction. 

Furthermore, all major fees will be clearly displayed on the packaging so that
consumers will be able to discern the costs of carrying an nFinanSe Visa
Reloadable Prepaid Debit Card and will be able to compare it to any competing
product. Mr. Welch continued, "We are proud of the positioning of our product to
the consumer and we encourage them to compare our pricing and features to that
of our competitors. Our industry is still in the early stages of development and
we believe that as many as 100 million adults have a need for a reloadable
prepaid card. Accordingly, we have designed our card for mass appeal and are
focused on creating trial and usage for our product through our aggressive
pricing."

&lt;p&gt;* New consulting services reduce deployment headaches with workshops, readiness
assessments, design, implementation and deployment services 
* Two new architecture models simplify deployment and can result in greater
productivity, infrastructure efficiency and lower total cost of ownership 
* Dell provides a single point of contact to help customers speed deployment of
Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 software

ROUND ROCK, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Dell today introduced new reference architectures and services to help customers
reduce the cost and complexity of deploying Microsoft Exchange 2010. With these
new tools and services, customers will be able to quickly and efficiently move
beyond deployment to begin taking advantage of new Exchange 2010 features
including support for 10GB mailboxes, reduced disk I/O, enhanced mobility,
greater fault-tolerance and enhanced voicemail and email integration. 

Dell also conducted several months of rigorous performance testing on Microsoft
Exchange Server 2010 to optimize performance across its entire line of server
and storage platforms. Beginning today, Dell`s complete line of 64-bit PowerEdge
servers and PowerVault, EqualLogic, and Dell|EMC storage solutions support
Microsoft Exchange Server 2010. 

The News:

Simple and Effective Blueprints Take Guesswork Out of Exchange 2010 Deployment

Dell has developed two architecture models to help customers reduce risks and
accelerate the process of deploying Microsoft Exchange 2010. As a result,
customers can achieve greater productivity and infrastructure efficiency. Dell
took advantage of its broad server and storage portfolio, internal Microsoft
Exchange expertise and the Exchange 2010 Technology Adoption Program (TAP) to
develop these architecture blueprints:

* Agile Consolidated Model: This architecture is ideal for customers who are
building a dynamic data center through server and storage consolidation and
standardization instead of deploying unique and dedicated application
infrastructures. In this model, server and storage virtualization play a central
role in abstracting customers` application and operating system from the
hardware infrastructure. Dell PowerEdge blade or rack servers paired with
EqualLogic PS series or Dell|EMC CX4/AX4 storage area network (SAN) solutions
provide the server and storage foundation for this model. 
* Simple Distributed Model: This architecture provides a server and storage
infrastructure optimized and tuned to deploy Exchange 2010 in the simplest, most
highly available and cost-effective manner. This model leverages server and
storage components in two distinct manners - through the storage dense PowerEdge
R510 without any requirement of external storage, or through a standard
PowerEdge rack server with direct attached storage device like the Dell
PowerVault MD1000.

New Consulting Services Provide Guidance and Proven Processes

Dell created ProConsult consulting services to assist customers in the
evaluation, assessment, design and implementation of upgrades or complete
migrations to Microsoft Exchange Server 2010. Unlike traditional consulting
engagements, Dell ProConsult services use Dell`s targeted consulting methodology
based on experience gained through thousands of customer engagements to keep
projects on time and on task. 

Dell`s new ProConsult services for Exchange 2010 include:

* Workshop: A roundtable session focused on helping customers understand how
Exchange 2010 can benefit their organization, what to consider for
enterprise-wide deployment and how to utilize SaaS-delivered services. 
* Fast Track: An end-to-end service that includes assessment, design and
validation consulting performed in a phased, uninterrupted approach. 
* Assessment: Delivered on-site, the assessment will identify detailed business,
technical and operational requirements, and assess existing IT infrastructure
readiness. 
* Design: Customers work with Dell experts to design an Exchange Server 2010
solution that can provide exceptional scalability and performance, while
providing flexibility in usability and management. 
* Implementation and Validation: Helps organizations efficiently and
cost-effectively roll a design into production while helping to minimize risk to
normal business operations.

Next Generation Messaging Powered by Dell Server and Storage Platforms

Dell`s server and storage solutions provide an ideal platform for customers
looking to retire aging hardware investments and/or to run more efficiently on
Microsoft Exchange 2010. With increased memory capacity and I/O rates, Dell`s
lineup of 64-bit PowerEdge servers and PowerVault, EqualLogic, and Dell|EMC
storage solutions, offer customers better TCO than previous versions of
Microsoft Exchange running on legacy hardware. Dell`s 11th Generation PowerEdge
servers provide up to three times greater processing power over Dell`s 9th
Generation servers1. 

A Single Point of Contact

Dell ProSupport services provide full support for both the hardware and Exchange
Server 2010. By providing a single point of contact, customers can reduce the
risk, costs and time associated with implementing Exchange 2010 all while
increasing the performance, quality and reliability of their messaging
environment. Dell`s standard-based technology platforms are designed to help
customers improve flexibility, efficiency and scalability without promoting
vendor lock-in through proprietary solutions. 

Quotes

"Microsoft is one of our key partners and Dell is staying in lock-step with all
their software developments including the launch of Microsoft Exchange Server
2010. This announcement is significant for Dell`s customers because it

infrastructures. Dell is in a unique position to offer the right mix of products
and services to help businesses asses, plan and deploy Microsoft Exchange Server
2010 and capture the benefits of the latest technology." - Don Mann, vice
president and general manager, Dell Global Services

 (Adds detail, shares) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MILAN, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) cut
its stake in Italian cable maker Prysmian SpA (PRY.MI) in a
larger-than-expected placement, leaving it with 16.8 percent,
the U.S. bank said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs sold 14.3 percent, more than the 12 percent it
previously said it planned to sell on Monday. Two Milan brokers
said the shares were sold at 12 euros per share, below the
13-euro level reached after Prysmian's third-quarter results
last week. [ID:nL5569419]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This placement doesn't bode particularly well, in our view.
Goldman's strong position in Prysmian's capital gives it access
to a high level of information about the group," a broker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see its decision to reduce its stake by more than a
third as a sign that it sees no upside in the coming quarters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 0940 GMT, Prysmian shares were down around 7 percent at
12 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another Milan broker called the Goldman move "good news"
since it removed an overhang of shares which the U.S. bank had
been expected to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broker said Goldman had offered the shares in an
11.80-12.30 euros range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A third broker said Prysmian could become a takeover target,
though Prysmian's market capitalisation of 2 billion euros ($3
billion) does not make it an easy target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; South Korea's Taihan Electric Wire Co Ltd (001440.KS) has a
9.9 percent stake and there is speculation it will raise its
holding via the placement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has agreed a 60-day lock-up on further sales of its
remaining stake, it said.

&lt;p&gt;BEND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Alchemy Solutions, Inc., (www.alchemysolutions.com) provider of legacy
modernization solutions for the Microsoft .NET Framework, today celebrates the
first anniversary of its spinoff from Fujitsu's Software Group. A Microsoft Gold
Certified Partner, Alchemy Solutions is marking the occasion in its
balloon-festooned booth at Microsoft`s TechEd Europe conference in Berlin,
Germany. 

The market-leading Alchemy Solutions software preserves and extends customer
investments in their legacy mainframe systems by modernizing applications during
the process of being migrated to the .NET environment. One year after its
formation from the Legacy Modernization group at Fujitsu, Alchemy Solutions has
tripled the company's size, launched a major new partnership program, and
announced significant new customers like personal productivity pacesetter
Day-Timer, Inc. 

Among the key management additions is Larry Blaustein, who recently joined the
company in the role of director of partner sales. Blaustein comes to Alchemy
Solutions from Sun Microsystems where, as U.S. Partner Alliance Manager, he
co-developed programs that enabled business partners to profitably increase
professional services sales and delivery revenue. 

"It is rewarding to have achieved this growth and acceptance in such a short
time," said Ron Langer, vice president of sales and general manager for Alchemy
Solutions. "With Fujitsu's legendary product line and our own .NET-focused
mainframe modernization products, Microsoft customers have quickly recognized
that Alchemy continues to deliver value by reducing the total cost of ownership
while exploiting the capabilities of Visual Studio and the .NET Framework." 

In addition to company growth and new customer signings this year, Alchemy
Solutions rolled-out NeoServices, a Windows-based system for service-enabling
mainframe business logic and integrating with modern application and web
environments. NeoServices gives enterprises the ability to service-enable
existing mainframe, as well as NeoKicks-based business logic, with no code
changes. These services enable a company`s proven mainframe assets to be
leveraged in new initiatives like new portals, CRM and ERP applications, or new

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6affcb/japan_food_and_dri) has
announced the addition of the "Japan Food and Drink Report Q4 2009" report to
their offering. 

The Japan Food and Drink Report provides industry professionals and strategists,
corporate analysts, food and drink associations, government departments and
regulatory bodies with independent forecasts and competitive intelligence on
Japan's food and drink industry. 

As Japan appears to be slowly emerging from the 'Great Recession', there is
little doubt that the country is substantially weaker than before. While the
economy does seem to be improving, it is from a very deep trough, and as
discussed in the recently published Japan Food &amp; Drink Report for Q409, this has
had a major impact on consumer confidence and the country's food and drink
industry. Japan benefits from a large and highly dynamic alcoholic drinks
industry, which accounts for around 19% of the combined food and beverage
industries. However, the outlook for the alcoholic drinks industry is poor. It
is suffering from the effects of market saturation and from the country's recent
economic downturn, which negatively impacted on alcoholic drinks sales,
stymieing consumer purchasing patterns and preventing the emergence of
premiumisation, which has driven alcohol sales growth in other highly mature
markets. The tough times for the industry are clear from the recent financial
results of a number of the country's main brewers, released in August. Local
brewing giant Kirin announced that during H109 (ended June 30 2009) its net
profit plummeted by 82% year-on-year (y-o-y) to JPY14.96bn (US$157.5mn) while
its sales registered a 1.2% y-o-y growth to JPY1.06trn (US$11.16bn). The company
has reported that it's operating profit declined by 16% y-o-y to JPY40.18bn
(US$423.0mn) as a result of Australian dollar weakness and poor performance of
its soft-drink business. Brewing and distilling company Suntory announced that
during H109 its net income declined by 28.4% y-o-y to JPY8.16bn (US$85.5mn)
while its sales registered 1% y-o-y growth to JPY731bn (US$7.66bn). Suntory
attributed the drop in net income to a rise in raw material costs and
appreciation of the yen against other operating currencies. Meanwhile, beer and
soft drink company Sapporo Holdings announced that during H109 it registered a
net loss of JPY738mn (US$7.8mn) as compared to a net profit of JPY9.59bn
(US$100.9mn) during H108. During the same period, sales declined by 6% y-o-y to
JPY182.41bn (US$1.92bn), with the ongoing economic slowdown blamed for the poor
results. 

The sector's advanced stage of maturity, exacerbated by stagnant wage growth and
an ageing population, has seen the market become sluggish and all leading
brewers are now seeking diversification, either geographic, in product terms, or
both. These difficult times will also likely lead to industry consolidation. In
fact, in July it was revealed that Kirin and Suntory, both industry giants, are
considering a merger. Already working together in the fields of procurement and
distribution, such a merger would lift both companies' domestic pricing and
earnings power, as well as improving their ability to accelerate international
expansion. Combined, the two parties would hope to have more weight to compete
in high profile international M activity and more resources to support organic
expansion. They would also have an improved footprint in the ultra-competitive
local soft drinks industry, a segment both have struggled to penetrate in the
way they have the beer industry. Clearly, the impact of the recession on the
drinks industry will be felt for some time to come.

&lt;p&gt;The alliance between Microsoft Corp. and Novell Corp. continues to bear fruit three years after it was first signed , say the two companies -- one the world's largest proprietary software vendor, the other one of the largest open-source companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once outright enemies on the opposite sides of an anti-trust lawsuit , Microsoft and Novell bridged that divide when they signed a controversial deal that included co-marketing arrangements as well as patent protection from Microsoft for Linux users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They now have 475 joint customers running both Windows Server and Novell's SUSE Enterprise Linux side-by-side in data centers, the companies said at a press conference in Seattle on Monday. That's up from 100 a little more than a year ago , and the 300 it announced just 5 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Novell, the alliance has been a particular boon. Revenue related to SUSE Enterprise Linux is up 50% year over year, said Susan Heystee, vice-president and general manager for global strategic alliances at Novell. Most of that comes from $225 million in SUSE support vouchers purchased and sold by Microsoft to customers running both Windows Server and SUSE Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the $240 million in vouchers it first purchased, Microsoft agreed last August to buy up to an additional $100 million in vouchers. Ted MacLean, general manager for strategic partnerships and licensing at Microsoft, said it was too early for Microsoft to commit to buying more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novell also claims 20 customers that are moving from using Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS to SUSE, for which it is temporarily providing support until they complete the transition to Novell's platform, Heystee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further broaden its base, Novell is considering adding support for Oracle Unbreakable Linux, Heystee said. "We're looking at it, since we've gotten quite a few requests from people having support issues" with Oracle, she said. "You do see a trend there, of customers wanting to work with the manufacturer of the Linux distro itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heystee said customers see only the upsides of the alliance, which on the technical side involves making SUSE Linux "the perfect guest" on Windows Server's Hyper-V virtualization, and easier to manage for Windows administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don't fixate on the political ramifications, such as the Linux patent protection deal, she said. "It was controversial in the beginning; it is far from that today," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has also been increasing its cooperation with Red Hat , MacLean said there's no comparison with its tie-up with Novell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd characterize the relationship between Microsoft and Red Hat as fairly one-dimensional. We validated each other's solutions, and that's it," MacLean said. "With Novell, it is multi-dimensional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, SUSE Linux can now be moved as a guest OS from server to server without any downtime using Windows Server 2008 R2's Live Migration feature. This helps Windows Server and Hyper-V compete better against VMware Inc.'s ESX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Microsoft and Novell are working to enable Linux users to be able to automatically log into SharePoint and other Microsoft applications, said Jose Thomas, a technical solutions director at Microsoft. This is done by making interoperable Microsoft's Active Directory Federation Service and Novell's Access Manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software is being developed to run this on top of a Dell Inc. server that will come to market by the first half of next year, Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrester Research Inc. analyst Christopher Voce said such interoperability is desperately needed. "Islands may be great for vacations, but they are not so good for the data center," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was Microsoft's Patch Tuesday for the month of November. There are 6 new Security Bulletins this month: 3 rated as Critical and 3 rated as Important. Not all Critical Security Bulletins are created equally though. You need to understand the implications of the flaw being patched and how it applies to your systems to determine how urgent the update is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With one month left in 2009, Microsoft would have to have a record-breaking month in December to surpass the 78 Security Bulletins released in 2008. So, in that regard you can say its been a better year for Microsoft. It is also worth noting that this month's Security Bulletins do not affect the new Windows 7 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Security Bulletins may be rated Critical by Microsoft, but only impact platforms or applications you don't use so they don't pose much threat to your system. Others may be exploited by worms, or with unauthorized drive-by malicious downloads like Security Bulletin MS09-065.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Tyler Reguly, Lead Security Research Engineer with nCircle, says "There's no question that this month, the most important bulletin to patch quickly is MS09-065. Given the drive-by attack vector presented in Internet Explorer, combined with the Office document vector, this bulletin is dangerous and should be patched as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small and medium businesses are often between a rock and a hard place when it comes to security flaws and updates. They tend to have a more diverse collection of hardware and software than consumers, but they also have to balance patching against business needs and ensure that software updates don't break applications or impact productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reguly notes "In general with SMBs, operation of the company usually seems to trump security in a big way. It's important that they remember that security is important and apply the more serious patches as quickly as possible, and roll out the remainder as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One issue that plagues small and medium businesses is reliance on legacy software. They don't have the budgets and enterprise licensing agreements that larger enterprises have, so they try to squeeze out every last drop of usability from an operating system or application before investing in upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have seen many SMB's that are still running Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 (SBS). I've seen setups where the SBS is sitting open on the internet-- these entities are affected by both the license logging service and active directory vulnerabilities (MS09-064 and MS09-066) and should probably apply the patches as soon as possible. We can always be hopeful that in 2009 few people are still running SBS 2000 but I'm sure it's still out there" says Reguly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;User education and awareness training are also critical components of mitigating against these threats. Pending the testing and implementation of  the necessary patches, SMB's can prevent exploits by making sure that employees know what to avoid and how to exercise some common sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reguly summarized by stating "Many enterprises have implemented training programs, but in the SMB I'm not sure that it's overly common. Ensuring users know to ignore unsolicited attachments and avoid sketchy websites is an important thing for a SMB Sys Admin to convey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more real-world tech solutions for small and midsized businesses--including cloud services, virtualization, and complete network overhauls--check out PC World's Tech Audit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bradley tweets as @PCSecurityNews, and can be contacted at his Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/181962&lt;/p&gt;

QUANZHOU, PROVINCE DE FUJIAN, Chine--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil et ses partenaires, Sinopec, la province de Fujian et Saudi Aramco,
ont f&#234;t&#233; aujourd`hui la pleine exploitation de la premi&#232;re usine p&#233;trochimique
et de raffinage int&#233;gr&#233; en Chine avec une participation &#233;trang&#232;re. Cette usine,
le Projet de Joint-venture de raffinage et d`&#233;thyl&#232;ne int&#233;gr&#233; de Fujian, va
aider &#224; satisfaire aux besoins croissants de la r&#233;gion en carburants et produits
chimiques. 

&#171; Notre participation dans ce complexe de classe mondiale illustre notre
engagement envers la r&#233;gion et notre mission qui est de fournir &#224; nos clients
les produits dont ils ont besoin &#187;, a confi&#233; Rex W. Tillerson,
pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral d`Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE : XOM), qui &#233;tait
pr&#233;sent &#224; la c&#233;r&#233;monie qui a eu lieu &#224; Quanzhou pour marquer l`&#233;v&#233;nement. 

&#171; Il s`agit d`un partenariat sans pr&#233;c&#233;dent, fruit de nombreuses ann&#233;es de
collaboration. Le soutien de la part de nos partenaires va contribuer &#224; la
s&#233;curit&#233;, &#224; la fiabilit&#233; et &#224; la performance la meilleure de sa cat&#233;gorie de ces
installations. &#187; 

Plus de 4,5 milliards de dollars ont &#233;t&#233; investis dans le complexe, qui a tripl&#233;
la capacit&#233; de la raffinerie actuelle &#224; 240 000 barils par jour afin de produire
des carburants de transport et d`autres produits raffin&#233;s. Par ailleurs, le
projet a ajout&#233; un nouveau complexe p&#233;trochimique qui inclut un vapocraqueur
d`&#233;thyl&#232;ne d`une capacit&#233; de 800 000 tonnes par an, une unit&#233; de poly&#233;thyl&#232;ne
d`une capacit&#233; de 800 000 tonnes par an, une unit&#233; de polypropyl&#232;ne d`une
capacit&#233; de 400 000 tonnes par an et une unit&#233; de paraxyl&#232;ne d`une capacit&#233; de
700 000 tonnes par an. 

Le complexe comprend &#233;galement des installations de cog&#233;n&#233;ration de 250
m&#233;gawatts &#224; la pointe du progr&#232;s, qui alimenteront la majorit&#233; des besoins en
&#233;lectricit&#233; du site. La cog&#233;n&#233;ration est la production simultan&#233;e d`&#233;lectricit&#233;
et de chaleur ou de vapeur utilisables &#224; partir d`&#233;nergie de d&#233;chets, qui
entra&#238;ne des co&#251;ts d`exploitation plus bas et des &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de
serre consid&#233;rablement r&#233;duites. 

M. Tillerson a indiqu&#233; que l`int&#233;gration entre les op&#233;rations de raffinage, de
produits chimiques et de commercialisation de carburants offrait des synergies
importantes et contribuait &#224; prot&#233;ger la profitabilit&#233; globale. 

Par exemple, un des avantages de l`int&#233;gration des installations de raffinage et
de produits chimiques r&#233;side dans la synergie au niveau des charges
d`alimentation : les produits de raffinage sont utilis&#233;s comme charges
d`alimentation dans la production de produits p&#233;trochimiques, tandis que les
sous-produits issus des installations de produits chimiques repartent &#224; la
raffinerie pour y &#234;tre convertis en produits &#224; valeur &#233;lev&#233;e, des carburants
pour moteur, par exemple. L`int&#233;gration des sites de fabrication, comme celui de
Fujian, permet &#224; ExxonMobil de maximiser la souplesse de l`exploitation et de
capturer les &#233;conomies qui en d&#233;coulent. 

Le complexe est d&#233;tenu conjointement par Fujian Petrochemical Company Limited
(50 %), ExxonMobil China Petroleum and Petrochemical Company Limited (25 %) et
Saudi Aramco Sino Company Limited (25 %).* 

Il est par ailleurs totalement int&#233;gr&#233; avec la Joint-venture de
commercialisation de carburants de Fujian, officiellement enregistr&#233;e sous le
nom de &#171; Sinopec SenMei (Fujian) Petroleum Company Limited &#187;, d&#233;tenue par
Sinopec (55 %), ExxonMobil China Petroleum and Petrochemical Company Limited
(22,5 %) et Saudi Aramco Sino Company Limited (22,5 %). L`entreprise g&#232;re et
exploite environ 750 stations-service et un r&#233;seau de terminaux dans la province
de Fujian.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - A study of internal company documents suggests Pfizer Inc altered or omitted unfavorable study findings to expand its epilepsy drug Neurontin's market, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday, offering a look at how drugmakers influence scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Enzon Beats, Announces Sell-off

Enzon (Nasdaq: ENZN) achieved break-even earnings during the third quarter of
2009, better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 7 cents but below the
year-ago earnings of 1 cent. The company reported revenues of $44.6 million, a
decline of 9% compared to $48.8 million reported in the third quarter of 2008. 

Enzon records revenues from three sources -- products, royalties and contract
manufacturing. The three segments recorded a decline of 1%, 6% and 56%,
respectively, compared to the year-ago period. 

Enzon has four marketed products -- Oncaspar for the treatment of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); DepoCyt for lymphomatous meningitis; Abelcet for
antifungal infection related to cancer and Adagen used to treat severe combined
immunodeficiency disease (SCID), commonly known as the "bubble boy" disease.
Apart from Oncaspar, whose sales remained unchanged from the year-ago period,
the other three recorded a decline of 4%, 15% and 10%, respectively. 

Enzon earns royalties from several products, which have been manufactured using
its proprietary PEGylation technology -- Pegintron, marketed by Merck (NYSE:
MRK); Macugen, marketed by OSI Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: OSIP) and Pfizer (NYSE:
PFE); Pegasys, marketed by Hoffmann-La Roche; and Cimzia, marketed by UCB
Pharma. The company earns a majority of royalty revenue from sales of Pegintron,
which is approved for the treatment of hepatitis C. Unfavorable movement of the
foreign exchange brought down royalty revenues during the quarter. 

Additionally, cancelled shipments and discontinuation of customer schedules were
responsible for lower contract manufacturing revenues. We expect contract
manufacturing revenues to suffer going forward since many of the current
contracts are to expire in the next two years. 

R expenses during the quarter were $15.8 million, unchanged from the year-ago
period. The company has several pipeline candidates: PEG-SN38, the HIF-1 alpha
antagonist, Survivin (antagonist) and other LNA- and PEGylation- based programs.


The company`s financial position continues to worry us. At the end of the
reported quarter, total cash reserves including investments were $201.3 million,
down compared to $206.9 million at the end of December 2008, primarily due to
the repurchase of $20.4 million of notes in 2009 offset by the cash provided by
operating activities. 

Shortly after announcing its third quarter results, Enzon announced that it has
decided to sell its specialty pharmaceutical business to the Sigma-Tau group of
Italy for $300 million. In addition, the company is eligible to receive another
$27 million based on success milestones and royalties of 5% - 10% on incremental
net sales above a 2009 baseline amount from its four marketed products through
2014. 

BofA Extends $184B in Credit

In its latest quarterly Lending &amp; Investing Initiative report, Bank of America
Corporation (NYSE: BAC) said on Monday that it has extended about $184 billion
in credit during the third quarter of 2009 to support households and
communities. 

The report makes obvious how BofA is utilizing the bailout money to support the
U.S. economy. According to the report, since the fourth quarter of 2008 when the
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was initiated, BofA had extended $759
billion in new credit. This represents almost $17 for every dollar of the $45
billion it received under the TARP. BofA also continues to provide a significant
return on investment to the U.S. taxpayers. The bank is expected to pay more
than $2.5 billion in dividend to the U.S. Treasury through Nov 16, 2009. 

The extension of home loans continues to be among BofA`s priorities. The company
extended $96 billion alone in first mortgages during the reported quarter. The
loans helped nearly 450,000 people purchase a home or refinance an existing
mortgage. 

BofA is also extending credit to the municipalities and non-profits and has
already provided $7 billion to help meet local needs and serve communities
across the country.

&lt;p&gt;Through Power Purchase Agreement with SunEdison, Procter &amp; Gamble Will Help
Offset an Estimated 36.9 Million Pounds of Carbon Dioxide Emissions over 20
Years
OXNARD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
SunEdison and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG) celebrated today the activation of a
1.1 megawatt (MW) photovoltaic solar system at Procter &amp; Gamble`s paper products
manufacturing plant in Oxnard, California. The event was attended by Mayor Tom
Holden of Oxnard; Senator Fran Pavley of the 23rd District; Karen Kukurin,
Deputy Director, Community Liaison Office of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger; and
a representative from the office of Congresswoman Lois Capps of the 23rd
District. Also attending were executives from Procter &amp; Gamble and SunEdison,
the solar services provider that financed, built and will maintain the solar
energy system. 

The roof-mounted photovoltaic solar energy system is projected to produce more
than 1.9 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of clean solar energy during its first
year of operation. Over 20 years, the system is estimated to produce more than
34 million kWh, enough energy to power 3,267 average U.S. homes for a year. 

According to Vera Ingenhuett, plant manager of the P Oxnard facility,
"Activating this solar energy system is a milestone in meeting our goals for
sustainability. P recently doubled the corporation`s 2012 per-unit reduction
targets for greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation and water and energy
consumption, and solar energy is a major component of our energy strategy. For
our Oxnard project, SunEdison`s SPSA business model allowed us to move from
construction to activation in two-and-a-half months." 

Brian Jacolick, SunEdison`s General Manager, Americas, said, "P continues to
be a model for corporate energy responsibility. Activation of this
zero-emissions system in Oxnard means that, over 20 years, an estimated 36.9
million pounds of carbon dioxide that would have been emitted during the
production of electricity from fossil fuels will be removed. This is the
equivalent of taking 3,620 cars off the road for one year." 

Carlos Domenech, President of SunEdison, commented, "We are delighted and
honored to enable P to achieve its environmental and energy goals. This is the
type of leadership needed to inspire others to take an active role protecting
the environment, managing energy, and creating jobs in their communities. We are
delighted to be part of this project." 

The 20-year solar power services agreement (SPSA) with SunEdison required no
upfront capital from P Electricity from SunEdison will be purchased by P at
long-term, predictably priced rates.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Kindler said the drugmaker is integrating its Wyeth purchase far faster than previous big acquisitions, and it will no longer be overly dependent on one or two blockbuster medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Reuters Health Summit on Wednesday, Kindler said Pfizer has melded and reshaped its research and development facilities within 20 days of buying Wyeth on October 15. With previous huge mergers, he said, that process had taken "literally years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The primary lesson we've learned over the years is how important it is to act very quickly and very decisively," he said, referring to slow prior integrations of U.S. drugmakers Warner Lambert and Pharmacia over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer earlier this week said it would close six RD sites and trim jobs in the United States and Britain following its $67.3 billon acquisition of Wyeth. It plans to reduce the square footage of its research sites 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift reorganization of the two companies' research operations stands in contrast to "the distractions, the disruptions and the delays that have plagued mergers of our company and others in the past," Kindler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, has been overly dependent on the world's top-selling drug -- its nearly $12 billion-a-year Lipitor cholesterol fighter, which will face U.S. generic competition in late 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wyeth deal "definitively addresses" Pfizer's need to bolster itself ahead of the U.S. patent expiration on Lipitor, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler said in the future "no one product will represent more than 10 percent of revenue" at Pfizer. Lipitor now accounts for 25 percent of Pfizer's annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While developing its now-bigger array of experimental drugs, Kindler said Pfizer will continue to license or buy medicines and acquire other drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will have all the resources we need to do all the business development deals we need; that will not be a challenge for us," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said the company would like to collaborate more with other drugmakers in order to share the risk of costly drug development, even though it also would mean sharing profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler did not signal whether Pfizer's pace of dealmaking would change following the Wyeth merger. "It's really opportunistic; we don't have any predetermined view on that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he hates to pick favorites but has a "particular passion" for drugs that might be able to tackle Alzheimer's disease. "Society has not adequately addressed this terrible disease and I'm excited about the possibility that Pfizer has a fair chance of making a significant contribution" in that fight, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is conducting late-stage trials of Dimebon, an Alzheimer's disease treatment licensed from Medivation Inc, and bapineuzumab, a Wyeth drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler said pain is another highly promising therapeutic area and Pfizer is developing "potential breakthrough" treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is best known in the United States for its branded medicines, but is becoming a bigger competitor overseas in generic drugs -- particularly in emerging markets like China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time we expect it to contribute growth to the company," Kindler said. "Our objectives are to stabilize and grow it ... It will become a more prominent area of our business over next several years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Wednesday its crude and natural gas production operations in
the Gulf of Mexico and Mobile Bay, Alabama withstood "minimal
storm related impact" from Tropical Storm Ida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In an email, an Exxon spokesman did not elaborate on how
much of shut-in output had already been restored. Exxon has
seven offshore platforms and 20 well templates in the Mobile
Bay area, the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon had said late Tuesday that Gulf operations were back
to normal, but it needed time to assess potential damage and
restart natural gas production in the Mobile Bay, Alabama area,
near where Ida made landfall on Tuesday before it was
downgraded into a Tropical Depression.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Kingland Systems, a premier provider of financial services software and data
solutions, today announced it will embed IBM`s InfoSphere Master Data Management
Server and other IBM software into its 360 Data line of enterprise data
management solutions for the financial services industry through an original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreement with IBM.This agreement marks an
expansion of Kingland`s relationship with IBM, focusing on worldwide Master Data
Management (MDM) software and data solutions, optimized for large financial
services institutions.

David Kingland, President and CEO of Kingland Systems, says that, "in this era
of risk sensitivity, mergers and acquisitions, and evolving compliance
regulations, the need for highly accurate data and enterprise-class MDM software
has never been greater.Our years of experience have shown us that financial
services enterprise data problems require customizing the solution to the
precise needs of the client, so we chose to team with IBM, whose new MDM
software products are built for customization and will enable us solve our
customers` problems much faster and more precisely."

"Through the technologies and industry-specific expertise we are bringing
together, Kingland and IBM can deliver master data management solutions that are
tailored to the unique needs of financial institutions," said Rob Thomas, vice
president, Information Management, IBM."By incorporating IBM technologies into
its own offerings, Kingland can more quickly deliver flexible and scalable
financial services master data and software solutions."

To address customers` needs for customized MDM solutions, IBM recently
introduced Master Information Hub, an optional component of InfoSphere Master
Data Management Server 9.0.Master Information Hub was created for businesses
seeking to build a master data management system that includes custom-built data
domains in addition to IBM`s pre-built domains for customer, product and
account. These customers can use Master Information Hub to develop a custom MDM
environment to establish a trusted view of any type of master information. For
example, using Kingland's "securities and corporate hierarchy" domains together
with IBM`s MDM Server, a bank's risk operation would gain access to a
comprehensive view of all enterprise holdings, clients, subsidiaries, and
complex business relationships from across multiple lines of business.

Kingland`s 360 DataTM includes two types of outsourced reference data solutions,
360 Data Master File and 360 Data Reference Desk.360 Data Master File is a
managed data solution that provides clients with a highly accurate database of
business entities, securities, complex relationships, events and other types of
financial services data.This master file is managed with client-specific
business rules and includes a concordance to multiple industry and
client-specific identifiers, and can be provided via file or web services.The
360 Data Reference Desk solution provides "on demand" data cleansing,
augmentation, and validation for critical business processes such as client
on-boarding, risk analysis, and compliance functions.

Both solutions are supported by Kingland`s proprietary suite of data management
software, IBM`s new Master Information Hub, and Kingland`s extensive database of
more than 4 million global securities and 5.25 million unique industry
identifiers with linkages to more than 900,000 business entity records and
corporate hierarchies.

Kingland will also be launching a new financial services optimized MDM platform
in 360 Data Enterprise Hub.Developed using IBM`s InfoSphere Master Data
Management Server, 360 Data Enterprise Hub will provide financial institutions
with industry specific data domains, feed handlers, business process and data
management workflows, user interfaces, data maintenance and quality processes
that are all optimized to support the wide variety of data critical to large
banking, capital markets, and other financial services firms.

Tony Brownlee, head of financial services MDM at Kingland says, "the combination
of IBM`s investment in MDM and Kingland`s financial services data expertise will
be powerful for our customers.Our focus with 360 DataTM is enterprise
scalability, customizable data models, flexible architecture, and as always,
highly accurate data."The 360 Data suite of solutions helps companies drive
cross-organizational revenue growth, manage enterprise risk and compliance, and
reduce overall IT costs in their enterprise data management projects.

QUANZHOU, PROV&#205;NCIA DE FUJIAN, China--(Business Wire)--
A ExxonMobil e suas parceiras Sinopec, Fujian Province e Saudi Aramco
comemoraram hoje o funcionamento integral das primeiras instala&#231;&#245;es integradas
de refinaria e petroqu&#237;mica da China com participa&#231;&#227;o estrangeira. A instala&#231;&#227;o,
o Projeto de joint venture de refinaria e etileno integrado de Fujian, vai
ajudar a atender &#224;s crescentes necessidades de combust&#237;veis e produtos qu&#237;micos
da regi&#227;o. 

"Nossa participa&#231;&#227;o nesse complexo de categoria internacional ilustra nosso
compromisso com a regi&#227;o e com a oferta dos produtos de que os nossos clientes
precisam", disse Rex W. Tillerson, presidente do conselho e diretor executivo da
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), que compareceu &#224; cerim&#244;nia em Quanzhou para
marcar a ocasi&#227;o. 

"Essa parceria sem precedentes se desenvolveu a partir de anos de colabora&#231;&#227;o. O
apoio dos nossos parceiros vai ajudar a garantir seguran&#231;a, confiabilidade e o
melhor desempenho da categoria nessas instala&#231;&#245;es." 

Mais de US$ 4,5 bilh&#245;es foram investidos no complexo, que triplicou a capacidade
de produ&#231;&#227;o da refinaria existente, elevando-a a duzentos e quarenta mil barris
di&#225;rios de combust&#237;veis de transporte e outros produtos refinados. Al&#233;m disso, o
projeto acrescentou um novo complexo petroqu&#237;mico que inclui oitocentas mil
toneladas-ano de craqueamento a vapor de etileno, uma unidade de polietileno de
oitocentas mil toneladas-ano, uma unidade de polipropileno de quatrocentas mil
toneladas-ano e uma unidade de paraxileno de setecentas mil toneladas-ano. 

O complexo tem tamb&#233;m instala&#231;&#245;es avan&#231;adas de cogera&#231;&#227;o de 250 megawatts, que
v&#227;o atender &#224; maior parte de suas demandas energ&#233;ticas. Cogera&#231;&#227;o &#233; a produ&#231;&#227;o
simult&#226;nea de eletricidade e calor ou vapor &#250;til a partir de energia de
res&#237;duos, o que reduz os custos operacionais e diminui significativamente as
emiss&#245;es de gases do efeito estufa. 

Tillerson disse que a integra&#231;&#227;o das opera&#231;&#245;es de marketing de refinaria,
produtos qu&#237;micos e combust&#237;veis oferece sinergias significativas e ajuda a
proteger a lucratividade geral. 

Por exemplo, um dos benef&#237;cios da integra&#231;&#227;o das instala&#231;&#245;es de refinaria e
produtos qu&#237;micos &#233; a sinergia de mat&#233;rias-primas: fluxos de refino s&#227;o usados
como mat&#233;ria-prima para a produ&#231;&#227;o de produtos petroqu&#237;micos, enquanto
subprodutos das instala&#231;&#245;es de produtos qu&#237;micos s&#227;o reenviados &#224; refinaria para
convers&#227;o em produtos de alto valor, como, por exemplo, combust&#237;veis para
motores. A integra&#231;&#227;o de unidades de fabrica&#231;&#227;o, como em Fujian, permite que a
ExxonMobil eleve ao m&#225;ximo a flexibilidade operacional e obtenha economias de
custo associadas. 

O complexo pertence conjuntamente &#224; Fujian Petrochemical Company Limited (50%),
ExxonMobil China Petroleum and Petrochemical Company Limited (25%) e Saudi
Aramco Sino Company Limited (25%).* 

O complexo tamb&#233;m &#233; totalmente integrado &#224; Fujian Fuels Marketing Joint Venture,
formalmente registrada como "Sinopec SenMei (Fujian) Petroleum Company Limited",
de propriedade da Sinopec (55%), ExxonMobil China Petroleum and Petrochemical

&lt;p&gt;Zeremonie begeht den vollen Betrieb des ersten integrierten Komplexes f&#252;r
Raffination und Petrochemie unter ausl&#228;ndischer Teilhaberschaft in China

* Multibillionen-Dollar-Komplex hilft bei der Befriedigung des wachsenden
Energieverbrauchs Chinas 
* Integration stellt Wettbewerbsf&#228;higkeit und Leistung der Weltklasse sicher 
* Kraft-W&#228;rme-Kopplung liefert Gro&#223;teil des Energiebedarfes der Einrichtung

QUANZHOU, PROVINZ FUJIAN (China)--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil und seine Partner Sinopec (Provinz Fujian) und Saudi Aramco haben
heute den vollen Betrieb der ersten chinesischen Einrichtung f&#252;r Raffination und
Petrochemie mit ausl&#228;ndischer Beteiligung gefeiert. Diese Einrichtung, das
&#8222;Fujian Integrated Refining and Ethylene Joint Venture Project", wird dabei
helfen, den wachsenden Bedarf der Region an Brennstoffen und chemischen
Produkten zu decken. 

&#8222;Unsere Mitarbeit an diesem Komplex der Weltklasse unterstreicht unser
Engagement in der Region und zur Lieferung der ben&#246;tigten Produkte an Kunden",
sagte Rex W. Tillerson, Chairman und CEO der Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:
XOM), der in Quanzhou einer Zeremonie zu diesem Anlass beiwohnte. 

"Es handelt sich hier um eine Partnerschaft ohne Beispiel, die auf Jahren der
Zusammenarbeit aufbaut. Die Unterst&#252;tzung unserer Partner wird dabei helfen, die
Sicherheit, Zuverl&#228;ssigkeit und un&#252;bertroffene Leistung dieser Einrichtungen
sicherzustellen." 

In den Komplex wurden mehr als 4,5 Milliarden US-Dollar investiert und damit die
Kapazit&#228;t der bestehenden Raffinerie auf 240.000 Barrel pro Tag verdreifacht. Es
werden Treibstoffe und andere Raffinerieprodukte hergestellt. Zus&#228;tzlich wurde
im Rahmen des Projekts ein weiterer petrochemischer Komplex gebaut, der unter
anderem &#252;ber einen Ethylen-Steamcracker (Kapazit&#228;t: 800.000 Tonnen pro Jahr),
eine Polyethyleneinheit (Kapazit&#228;t: 400.000 Tonnen pro Jahr) und eine
Paraxyleneinheit (Kapazit&#228;t: 700.000 Tonnen pro Jahr) verf&#252;gt. 

Der Komplex verf&#252;gt zudem &#252;ber eine hochmoderne Anlage f&#252;r die
Kraft-W&#228;rme-Kopplung mit einer Leistung von 250 Megawatt, die den Gro&#223;teil des
Energiebedarfs der Anlage abdeckt. Bei Kraft-W&#228;rme-Kopplung handelt es sich um
die gleichzeitige Produktion von Elektrizit&#228;t und n&#252;tzlicher W&#228;rme oder Dampf
aus Restenergie. Dies f&#252;hrt zu geringeren Betriebskosten und einer signifikanten
Reduzierung der Emission von Treibhausgasen. 

Rex Tillerson sagte, dass die Integration der Zweige Raffination, Chemieprodukte
und Treibstoffverkauf signifikante Synergien ergebe und bei der
Gesamtrentabilit&#228;t helfe. 

Ein Beispiel f&#252;r den Nutzen der Integration von Raffination und Chemie in den
Einrichtungen ist die Synergie bei den Treibstoffen: Produkte aus der
Raffination werden als Betriebsstoffe in der Produktion der Petrochemie genutzt.
Nebenprodukte aus den Chemieeinrichtungen gehen zur&#252;ck an die Raffinerie und
werden dort zu Produkten h&#246;heren Wertes (zum Beispiel Treibstoffe) raffiniert.
Die Integration von Produktionseinrichtungen wie zum Beispiel Fujian erm&#246;glicht
es ExxonMobil, die betriebliche Flexibilit&#228;t zu nutzen und entsprechende
Ersparnisse einzufahren. 

Der Komplex befindet sich im gemeinsamen Eigentum der Fujian Petrochemical
Company Limited (50 Prozent), ExxonMobil China Petroleum and Petrochemical
Company Limited (25 Prozent) und Saudi Aramco Sino Company Limited (25
Prozent).* 

Er ist zudem voll integriert mit dem Fujian Fuels Marketing Joint Venture,
(registriert als &#8222;Sinopec SenMei (Fujian) Petroleum Company Limited"), das den
folgenden Firmen geh&#246;rt: Sinopec (55 Prozent), ExxonMobil China Petroleum and
Petrochemical Company Limited (22,5 Prozent) und Saudi Aramco Sino Company
Limited (22,5 Prozent). Das Joint Venture managt und betreibt ungef&#228;hr 750
Tankstellen und ein Netzwerk von Terminals in der Provinz Fujian. 

*Die Fujian Petrochemical Company Limited geh&#246;rt gleichen Teilen der China
Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) und der Regierung von
Fujian.ExxonMobil China Petroleum &amp; Petrochemical Company Limited ist ein
angeschlossenes Unternehmen im Gesamtbesitz der Exxon Mobil Corporation. Die
Saudi Aramco Sino Company Limited ist ein angeschlossenes Unternehmen im
Gesamtbesitz der Saudi Aramco.

QUANZHOU, PROVINCIA DE FUJIAN, China--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil y sus socios, Sinopec, la provincia de Fujian y Saudi Aramco,
celebraron hoy la puesta en marcha total del primer complejo integrado de
refiner&#237;a y petroqu&#237;mica de China con participaci&#243;n extranjera. Esta planta, el
Proyecto integrado de asociaci&#243;n conjunta de refiner&#237;a y etileno de Fujian
(Fujian Integrated Refining and Ethylene Joint Venture Project), ayudar&#225; a
satisfacer las crecientes necesidades de la regi&#243;n relacionadas con combustibles
y productos qu&#237;micos. 

"Nuestra participaci&#243;n en este complejo de primer nivel demuestra nuestro
compromiso con la regi&#243;n y nuestra dedicaci&#243;n para proporcionar a los clientes
los productos que necesitan", coment&#243; Rex W. Tillerson, presidente y director
ejecutivo de Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), quien asisti&#243; a una ceremonia
en Quanzhou para celebrar la ocasi&#243;n. 

"Es una asociaci&#243;n sin precedentes, desarrollada a partir de a&#241;os de
colaboraci&#243;n. El apoyo de nuestros socios nos ayudar&#225; a garantizar la seguridad,
la confiabilidad y el rendimiento de primer nivel de las instalaciones". 

M&#225;s de $4.500 millones se invirtieron en el complejo, que triplic&#243; la capacidad
de refiner&#237;a existente a 240.000 barriles por d&#237;a para la producci&#243;n de
combustibles de transporte y otros productos refinados. Adem&#225;s, el proyecto
agreg&#243; un nuevo complejo petroqu&#237;mico que incluye un craqueador de etileno a
vapor con una capacidad de 800.000 toneladas por a&#241;o, una unidad de polietileno
de 800.000 toneladas por a&#241;o, una unidad de polipropileno de 400.000 toneladas
por a&#241;o y una unidad de paraxileno de 700.000 toneladas por a&#241;o. 

El complejo tambi&#233;n cuenta con instalaciones de cogeneraci&#243;n de vanguardia de
250 megavatios, que cubrir&#225;n la mayor parte de la demanda de energ&#237;a de la
planta. La cogeneraci&#243;n es la producci&#243;n simult&#225;nea de electricidad y calor &#250;til
o vapor a partir de energ&#237;a de desecho, que permite reducir los costos y
disminuir significativamente las emisiones de gas de efecto invernadero. 

Tillerson coment&#243; que la integraci&#243;n entre las operaciones de comercializaci&#243;n
de combustibles, productos qu&#237;micos y refiner&#237;a permite una sinerg&#237;a
considerable y ayuda a proteger la rentabilidad general. 

Por ejemplo, uno de los beneficios de integrar las instalaciones de refiner&#237;a y
productos qu&#237;micos es la sinergia de las materias primas: Las corrientes de
refiner&#237;a se utilizan como materia prima en la producci&#243;n de petroqu&#237;micos
mientras que los productos derivados de las instalaciones de productos qu&#237;micos
se env&#237;an nuevamente a la refiner&#237;a para ser convertidos en productos de alto
valor, como los combustibles automotrices. La integraci&#243;n de las f&#225;bricas, como
sucede en Fujian, permite que ExxonMobil maximice la flexibilidad operativa y
logre el ahorro de costos asociado. 

El complejo es propiedad conjunta de Fujian Petrochemical Company Limited (50%),
ExxonMobil China Petroleum and Petrochemical Company Limited (25%) y Saudi
Aramco Sino Company Limited (25%)*. 

Tambi&#233;n est&#225; completamente integrado con la asociaci&#243;n conjunta de
comercializaci&#243;n de combustibles de Fujian, registrada formalmente como "Sinopec
SenMei (Fujian) Petroleum Company Limited", propiedad de Sinopec (55%),
ExxonMobil China Petroleum and Petrochemical Company Limited (22,5%) y Saudi
Aramco Sino Company Limited (22,5%). La asociaci&#243;n administra y opera
aproximadamente 750 estaciones de servicio y una red de terminales en la
provincia de Fujian. 

*Fujian Petrochemical Company Limited pertenece en un 50% a China Petroleum and
Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) y otro 50% al gobierno de Fujian.ExxonMobil China
Petroleum &amp; Petrochemical Company Limited es una afiliada de propiedad absoluta
de Exxon Mobil Corporation y Saudi Aramco Sino Company Limited es una afiliada
de propiedad absoluta de Saudi Aramco.

Declaraci&#243;n preventiva:Los enunciados presentados en este comunicado con
respecto a eventos venideros son declaraciones a futuro.Los resultado futuros
reales, incluso la producci&#243;n de las instalaciones, podr&#237;an diferir
sustancialmente debido a cambios en el precio de mercado del petr&#243;leo y el gas,
y de los productos petroqu&#237;micos; cambios en las leyes o en las normativas
gubernamentales; el resultado de negociaciones comerciales; medidas de los
competidores y otros factores analizados bajo el t&#237;tulo "Factors Affecting
Future Results" (Factores que afectan los resultados futuros) en la secci&#243;n

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, Nov 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Reported by Annette Kreuger, Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land,
Texas) -- Early Monday morning, the buzz at the International Society of
Pharmaceutical Engineers (ISPE) conference in San Diego, California, was
that Pfizer Incorporated (NYSE:PFE) (New York, New York) was planning to
sell its massive St. Louis/Chesterfield, Missouri, research site to
Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) (St. Louis). By day's end, the truth had
proven to be more dramatic than the rumors: To achieve a 35% reduction in
global square footage, the company is going to close six research and
development sites across the United States and lay off an estimated 2,000
people.

&lt;p&gt;Ceremony Marks the Full Operation of China`s First Integrated Refining and
Petrochemical Complex with Foreign Participation

* Multibillion dollar complex to help meet China`s growing energy needs 
* Integration ensures competitiveness and world-class performance 
* Cogeneration supplies the majority of the site`s power demands

QUANZHOU, FUJIAN PROVINCE, China--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil and its partners, Sinopec, Fujian Province and Saudi Aramco, today
celebrated the full operation of China`s first integrated refining and
petrochemical facility with foreign participation. This facility, the Fujian
Integrated Refining and Ethylene Joint Venture Project, will help meet the
region`s growing need for fuels and chemical products. 

"Our participation in this world-class complex illustrates our commitment to the
region and to provide our customers with the products they need," said Rex W.
Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation
(NYSE:XOM), who attended a ceremony in Quanzhou to mark the occasion. 

"This is an unprecedented partnership built on years of collaboration. The
support from our partners will help ensure the safety, reliability and
best-in-class performance of these facilities." 

More than $4.5 billion was invested in the complex, which tripled the capacity
of the existing refinery to 240,000 barrels per day to produce transportation
fuels and other refined products. In addition, the project added a new
petrochemical complex that includes an 800,000 tons-per-year ethylene steam
cracker, an 800,000 tons-per-year polyethylene unit, a 400,000 tons-per-year
polypropylene unit and a 700,000 tons-per-year paraxylene unit. 

The complex also features a state-of-the-art 250 megawatt cogeneration facility,
which will meet the majority of the site`s power demands. Cogeneration is the
simultaneous production of electricity and useful heat or steam from waste
energy, resulting in lower operating costs and significantly reduced greenhouse
gas emissions. 

Tillerson said integration between the refining, chemicals and fuels marketing
operations provides significant synergies and helps protect overall
profitability. 

For example, a benefit of integrating refining and chemicals facilities is the
synergy of feedstocks: refining streams are used as feedstock in the production
of petrochemicals while byproducts from the chemicals` facilities are sent back
to the refinery for conversion to high-value products, like motor fuels.
Integration of manufacturing sites, like Fujian, allows ExxonMobil to maximize
operating flexibility and capture associated cost savings. 

The complex is jointly owned by the Fujian Petrochemical Company Limited (50
percent), ExxonMobil China Petroleum and Petrochemical Company Limited (25
percent) and Saudi Aramco Sino Company Limited (25 percent).* 

It also is fully integrated with the Fujian Fuels Marketing Joint Venture,
formally registered as "Sinopec SenMei (Fujian) Petroleum Company Limited,"
owned by Sinopec (55 percent), ExxonMobil China Petroleum and Petrochemical
Company Limited (22.5 percent) and Saudi Aramco Sino Company Limited (22.5
percent). The venture manages and operates approximately 750 service stations
and a network of terminals in Fujian Province. 

*Fujian Petrochemical Company Limited is owned 50 percent by China Petroleum and
Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) and 50 percent by the Fujian
Government.ExxonMobil China Petroleum &amp; Petrochemical Company Limited is a
wholly owned affiliate of Exxon Mobil Corporation and Saudi Aramco Sino Company
Limited is a wholly owned affiliate of Saudi Aramco.

Cautionary Statement:Statements regarding future events or conditions in this
release are forward-looking statements.Actual future results, including facility
throughputs, could differ materially due to changes in the market price of oil,
gas, and petroleum and petrochemical products; changes in law or government
regulation; the outcome of commercial negotiations; actions by competitors; and
other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" on
the Investors section of ExxonMobil's website.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Britain's Justin Rose, chasing his first PGA Tour win, took the first round lead at the Disney Classic at Lake Buena Vista, Florida, on Thursday in windy and cool conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former European number one Rose, starting on the back nine, fired three birdies in his opening five holes and then finished his round in style with birdies on three of the last four holes to shoot a seven-under-par 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a bogey-free round out there and although the courses aren't the most difficult in the world, it certainly was tricky out there and even good shots at times weren't going close to the flags because of gusting winds," said Rose, who has yet to win in 148 previous attempts on the PGA Tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Englishman, Greg Owen, was one of three players who shot 66 to be a stroke off the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 37-year-old Owen shot seven birdies and a bogey in his round in temperatures surprisingly cool for Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've got a long sleeve shirt and sweater on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unusual, very unusual. A couple of weeks ago it was 95 degrees (35 C). It's a nice change but hopefully it'll warm up a little bit," said Owen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owen shared second place with Americans Rickie Fowler and Casey Wittenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian Matt Jones could well miss the cut after shooting six over including a horrific eight on the par-four second but compatriot Nick O'Hern was well-placed in the heavily domestic field after shooting four under on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Champion Davis Love III withdrew after Thursday's round, complaining of neck pain after shooting a 73.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Simon Evans in Miami; Editing by Greg Stutchbury)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney -- which earlier announced that its finance chief, Tom Staggs, and the head of its parks division, Jay Rasulo, will soon swap jobs -- rose 3.3 percent after the company reported its earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The management shift is part of a broader shake-up in the top ranks of Disney in recent months, and analysts said it could give Staggs the type of broader experience we would need to someday succeed Chief Executive Bob Iger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as Disney is shifting executives, it is performing far better than many expected at soldiering through big drops in spending by advertisers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is partly due to cost cutting -- something Iger promised the company would continue to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also reflects relatively healthy sales. In the most recent quarter revenue climbed 4.5 percent to $9.87 billion, setting it apart from News Corp, Viacom Inc. and Time Warner Inc, all of which posted sales declines. What is more, Disney's revenue surpassed analyst expectations of $9.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They crushed forecasts, based on very strong cable results and material outperformance on the parks," said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales at Disney's media network division, the largest in terms of revenue and profit and home to its lucrative cable networks, rose 14 percent on the back of stronger results from ESPN and growth at the worldwide Disney Channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney executives also said TV advertising is starting to recover -- which would only further support sales in the media networks division. The market for last-minute TV commercial spots is up about 20 percent from contracts that marketers signed for longer-term deals, a signal of rising demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the parks division, which encompasses Disney's theme parks, resorts, cruise lines, and vacation and time share operations, operating income fell 17 percent. But that was nonetheless seen as a positive, given it was less than analysts had expected due to the pullback in consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Iger sounded several cautious notes during a call with investors and analysts. "While there are some signs of recovery, the environment remains challenging and we're managing accordingly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed to Disney's movie business as one area of concern. In September, Disney Studios Chairman Dick Cook abruptly departed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As our numbers indicate, our studio had an extremely disappointing year in 2009," Iger said. "This is primarily due to the performance of our live action slate but we also see challenges to the motion picture industry business model and we are taking steps to address them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, net income in the fiscal fourth quarter, ended October 3, rose to $895 million, or 47 cents per share, from $760 million, or 40 cents a share, in the year-ago fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items, the company earned 46 cents a share compared with 44 cents in the prior year quarter, and beating analysts' average forecasts for 41 cents a share on that basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares rose to $30.01 after closing at $29.05 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Susan Zeidler, Paul Thomasch; Editing by Gary Hill and Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day

stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Macy`s Raises Earnings Guidance

Macy`s Inc. (NYSE: M) recently reported third-quarter 2009 results. The company
posted a loss of 3 cents a share that outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate
loss of 9 cents, and improved substantially from a loss of 8 cents delivered in
the prior-year quarter. 

Effective inventory management and division consolidation to lower costs helped
the company to post a narrower quarterly loss. 

The better-than-expected results prompted management to raise its earnings
guidance. Macy`s now expects full year 2009 earnings in the range of $1.01 to
$1.06 per share, up from the previously anticipated 70 cents to 80 cents a
share. For the fourth-quarter 2009, earnings are expected between $1.00 and
$1.05 per share. 

On a reported basis, including one-time items, Macy`s reported a quarterly loss
of 8 cents a share, an improvement over a loss of 10 cents delivered in the
year-ago quarter. 

Nissan to Build World`s Cheapest Car

Carlos Ghosn, the Chief Executive of the alliance Renault and Nissan (OTC:
NSANY), has revealed that the company will roll out a small car with its Indian
partner, Bajaj Auto, that will be cheaper than any other car in India -- and in
the world. The car, which is scheduled for launch in India in 2012, would beat
India`s largest automaker Tata Motors` Nano both in terms of pricing and
fuel-efficiency, and become the world's cheapest car. 

Presently, Tata Nano is the world's cheapest car. The car has a starting price
of about Rs100,000 ($2,150). When Renault and Bajaj started discussing on their
"ultra low-cost" car 2 years ago, it has been revealed that the car would have
been priced between $2,500 and $3,000. However, at the World Economic Forum
meeting in New Delhi, India, Mr. Ghosn announced that the ultra low-cost car
would be cheaper than the Nano. 

So far, India`s bottom-end motor vehicles market has been well known for
motorcycles. After the hearty response to the Tata Nano, automakers around the
world realized the huge market potential for small cars in India. Hence the
initiative for the world's cheapest car. 

Priceline Beats, Guidance Strong

Priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN) reported very strong third quarter results, with
earnings beating the consensus by 57 cents and revenue beating by 5.3%. 

Revenue of $730.7 million was up 21.0% sequentially and 30.1% year over year.
The significant increase from the year-ago quarter was helped by easier comps as
the third quarter of 2008 was impacted by the recession, while the third quarter
of 2009 benefited from strengthening demand. 

Revenue growth was driven by significantly higher room night volumes, which
offset the decline in average daily rates (ADRs). Room nights increased 14.1%
sequentially and 56.3% year over year. Both airline ticket units and rental car
days declined sequentially, although they were up 30.2% and 11.6%, respectively
from the year-ago quarter. 

GE to Sell Security Systems

General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) is in talks to sell its security systems unit,
most likely to United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX), for more than $1.5 billion
in an effort to reshuffle its extensive portfolio and raise capital for
strategic acquisitions. 

United Technologies Corp. is a diversified company whose products include
Carrier heating and air conditioning, Hamilton Sundstrand aerospace systems and
industrial products, Otis elevators and escalators, Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft
engines, Sikorsky helicopters, UTC Fire &amp; Security systems and UTC Power fuel
cells. The company has been lately looking to expand its security business. 

GE`s move to sell its fire alarms and security division comes as it is
finalizing a bigger deal to hive off its NBC Universal television and movie unit
into a joint venture controlled by the cable operator Comcast. Strategically, GE
wants to raise funds to expand its core businesses - which include
infrastructure, oil and gas equipment, and energy - partly by hiving off
peripheral divisions.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Southern Copper`s Earnings Jump

Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE: PCU), one of the leading copper producers in
the world, posted net earnings of 37 cents in the third quarter of 2009, better
than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. Earnings jumped 78.6% from 21
cents sequentially while it declined 22.3% from 47 cents year on year. The
company attributed lower costs for driving earnings. Operating costs decreased
15.8% year over year due to higher productivity. 

Copper production in the quarter improved 1.3% to 120,240 tons from 118,657
tons, driven by higher production at the La Caridad mine in Mexico and the
Peruvian mines, on the back of better ore grades. Molybdenum production
increased 14.3% to 5,191 tons, compared to 4,541 tons in the year-ago quarter.
Higher ore grades and recoveries lead to an increase of 631 tons at La Caridad
and 734 tons production at the Cuajone mine in Peru. These increases were
partially offset by 715 tons of lower production at the Toquepala mine in Peru
due to lower ore grades. 

Logitech Acquires LifeSize

Logitech International (Nasdaq: LOGI) announced that it has agreed to acquire
privately held LifeSize Communications of Austin, Texas for $405 million in
cash. LifeSize is a global leader in high definition (HD) video communication
solutions, with more than 9,000 video conferencing customers across 80 countries
in large enterprises, small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) and public healthcare,
education and government organizations. 

The acquisition will enable Logitech to extend its leadership in video
communication beyond the desktop. 

Logitech and LifeSize plan to pursue existing and new relationships with unified
communications, collaboration and VoIP industry partners and competitors to
drive the development of an open eco-system for interoperable video
communication. 

LifeSize expects approximately $90 million in revenues in CY 2009, with CY 2010
revenues expected to grow between 40% and 60%. Logitech expects the acquisition
to be neutral to slightly positive to its operating income (excluding
acquisition-related charges) in FY 2011, ending March 31, 2011, and positive
thereafter. 

For a long time, videoconferencing was limited to big businesses that could
afford to build expensive systems in their conference rooms. But
videoconferencing has become more accessible because Internet connections are
commonplace, video has become more efficient and the price has dropped for
high-definition cameras and displays. 

Now, many companies are trying to reach small businesses and individuals that
previously used low-quality webcams on PCs. In the previous month, Cisco Systems
Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO) announced its intention to buy Tandberg, a Norwegian video
communications company, for $3 billion. Tandberg makes smaller and less
expensive videoconferencing tools that can be fitted on desks. 

Logitech engages in design, manufacture, and marketing of personal peripherals
for personal computers and other digital platforms in Europe, the Middle East,
Africa, the Americas, and the Asia Pacific. The company was founded in 1981 and
is based in Apples, Switzerland. Major competitors include Microsoft Corp.
(Nasdaq: MSFT) and Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV (NYSE: PHG).

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) as the Bull of the
Day and Potash Corporation (NYSE: POT) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company (NYSE: JPM),
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) is a leading provider of IP-based networking and
other products. The company's first quarter results were a significant
improvement over prior quarters, with both revenue and earnings exceeding our
expectations. 

Of particular note is the growth in orders, which indicates continued business
momentum. Improving operating performance, solid financials, a sound
restructuring policy and new growth initiatives are the drivers behind our
Outperform rating. 

However, we caution investors about the increasing competition, market share
losses, complicated decision-making process and integration risks. 

Bear of the Day: 

We downgrade Potash Corporation (NYSE: POT), the world's leading producer of
potash and fertilizer, to Underperform. The company has been hit hard by the
global economic crisis, leading to weak demand and prices as farmers reduce
their use of fertilizers. This has induced a sharp fall in profits for
fertilizer producers. 

Potash Corp.'s earnings declined 79% in the third quarter of 2009. The company
expects fertilizer demand to remain weak for the rest of 2009, and plans to cut
potash production. Potash Corp. has also lowered its expected earnings and
slashed 2010 global potash demand expectations. 

About 40% of global potash production capacity stands idle since the second half
of 2008. The company also expects some of its capacity to remain curtailed in
2010.

JPMorgan to Lift Salary Freeze

According to an internal memo to all employees, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company (NYSE:
JPM) will lift a salary freeze it put in place last year. The salary freeze was
applicable for employees making more than $60,000 a year. 

The decision to lift the salary freeze is a part of JPMorgan`s compensation
review process, following its profits for last several quarters in its
investment-banking operations. 

The bank also intends to pay a $500 special award globally to employees who
receive less than $60,000 a year. 

Additionally, the bank also plans to add more than 300 staff to its branches to
support a $4 billion increase in small business lending in an effort to help
revive the U.S economy. Also, to boost new loans and refinancing, JPMorgan will
hire 1,200 mortgage loan officers by the end of 2010. This addition will
increase the company`s sales force by approximately 60%. 

According to the company, lifting the salary freeze and hiring new employees
will help it to increase access to working capital, term loans for expansion,
commercial mortgages, lines of credit and business credit cards. 

JPMorgan is among the large financial institutions that have already repaid
government funds. In the second quarter of 2009, the company repaid the full $25
billion in preferred capital received as part of the Troubled Asset Relief
Program (TARP). In fact, this has partly enabled it to take the recent decision
to lift the salary freeze. 

However, for many other firms, like Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) and Bank of America
Corporation (NYSE: BAC), the full repayment of TARP money is uncertain at this
point as they are facing a difficult situation.

BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today reported earnings for the fiscal year
and fourth quarter ended October 3, 2009. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for
the year was $1.76, compared to $2.28 in the prior year. EPS for the current and
prior year include certain items that are discussed below. Excluding these
items, EPS for the year was $1.82, down 20% from $2.28 in the prior year. 

EPS for the current year included a non-cash gain in connection with the merger
of Lifetime Entertainment Services (Lifetime) and A Television Networks (A),
a gain on the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin
America, and restructuring and impairment charges, which collectively had a net
adverse impact of $0.06. EPS for the prior year included an accounting gain
related to the acquisition of the Disney Stores North America, a gain on the
sale of movies.com, the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters, a
bad debt charge for a receivable from Lehman Brothers, and an impairment charge,
which collectively had no net impact on EPS. 

For the quarter, diluted EPS was $0.47 compared to $0.40 in the prior-year
quarter. EPS for the current quarter included the gain related to the
Lifetime/A transaction and restructuring and impairment charges, which
together resulted in a net benefit of $0.01, while EPS for the prior-year
quarter included the Lehman Brothers bad debt charge and an impairment charge,
which together had a net adverse impact of $0.04. Excluding these items, EPS for
the quarter increased 5% to $0.46 compared to $0.44 in the prior-year quarter. 

"Although last year was a difficult one due in part to the weak global economy,
I`m pleased with the way our businesses have responded to the downturn," said
President and CEO Robert A. Iger. "We`ve stayed focused on our long-term
strategy, efficiently managed costs, and continued to invest in initiatives to
deliver future growth. We also have adapted our organization to respond to and
take advantage of the changes taking place in our businesses and will continue
to do so as we position Disney to thrive for years to come." 

Fiscal 2009 results for the full year and fourth quarter include the benefit
from one additional week of operations compared to the prior-year periods due to
our fiscal period end. The following table summarizes the full year and fourth
quarter results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 (in millions, except per share

Cable Networks

Operating income at Cable Networks increased $121 million to $4.3 billion for
the year due to growth at ESPN and at ABC Family, partially offset by the impact
associated with the transition of Jetix to Disney-branded channels. The growth
at ESPN was driven by higher affiliate revenue primarily due to contractual rate
increases and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the additional week of
operations and subscriber growth, partially offset by decreased advertising
revenue and higher programming costs. The decrease in advertising revenues was
due to a decrease in units sold, partially offset by higher rates. Higher
programming costs reflected contractual rate increases for key rights contracts
and the cost of new and renewed rights agreements for college and international
sports programming. 

Operating income growth at ABC Family reflected higher advertising and affiliate
revenue. Increased advertising revenue at ABC Family was primarily due to higher
units sold and higher rates while increased affiliate revenue was driven by
higher rates. At the worldwide Disney Channel, increased affiliate revenue due
to subscriber growth and contractual rate increase was largely offset by lower
DVD sales. 

For the quarter, operating income at Cable Networks increased 19% to $1.5
billion primarily due to an increase at ESPN and, to a lesser extent, the
worldwide Disney Channels. The growth at ESPN was driven by higher affiliate
revenue, partially offset by higher programming costs. Higher affiliate revenue
reflected increased recognition of previously deferred revenues related to
annual programming commitments, the impact of the additional week of operations
and contractual rate increases. During the quarter, ESPN recognized $128 million
more in net deferred revenues related to programming commitments than in the
prior-year quarter. Programming cost increases at ESPN for the quarter reflected
similar impacts as discussed above for the year. Growth at the worldwide Disney
Channels was driven by higher affiliate revenues due to international subscriber
growth, partially offset by lower DVD sales. 

Broadcasting

Operating income at Broadcasting decreased $337 million to $505 million for the
year primarily due to lower advertising sales at the ABC Television Network and
owned television stations, higher programming and production costs and a bad
debt charge related to a syndication customer. These decreases were partially
offset by increased international and domestic sales of ABC Studios productions,
led by Grey`s Anatomy, Desperate Housewives and According to Jim. Decreased
advertising revenues at the ABC Television Network reflected lower primetime
ratings. The increase in programming and production costs was driven by higher
primetime programming costs due to more hours of original scripted programming
and higher production cost amortization related to sales of ABC Studios
productions. 

For the quarter, operating results at Broadcasting increased $73 million to $2
million, driven by increased domestic and international sales of ABC Studios
productions, led by Grey`s Anatomy and According to Jim, partially offset by an
increase in the related production cost amortization. 

At the ABC Television Network, results were comparable to the prior-year quarter
as lower pilot costs and the benefit of an additional week of advertising
revenues were offset by the impact of lower ratings and advertising rates and
higher programming costs for more hours of original scripted programming. Lower
pilot costs reflected the timing of pick up decisions, which generally occurred
in the third quarter this year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year
due to delays resulting from the Writers Guild of America work stoppage in
fiscal 2008. 

Parks and Resorts

Parks and Resorts revenues for the year decreased 7% to $10.7 billion and
segment operating income decreased 25% to $1.4 billion. For the quarter,
revenues decreased 4% to $2.8 billion and segment operating income decreased 17%
to $344 million. Results for the year and quarter reflected decreases at our
domestic operations and at Disneyland Paris. 

For the year, lower operating income at our domestic operations was driven by
decreased guest spending, principally at our domestic parks and resorts, and
lower gains on securitized sales of ownership interests at Disney Vacation Club,
partially offset by lower costs at Walt Disney World Resort. Decreased guest
spending at the domestic parks and resorts was due to lower average ticket
prices, lower average daily hotel room rates and decreased merchandise spending.
Lower costs at Walt Disney World Resort reflected savings from cost mitigation
activities, partially offset by labor and other cost inflation. 

The decrease at Disneyland Paris was due to decreased guest spending and lower
hotel occupancy, partially offset by lower costs. Decreased guest spending
reflected lower average ticket prices, decreased merchandise spending and lower
average daily hotel room rates. Lower costs were driven by savings from cost
mitigation activities, partially offset by labor and other cost inflation. 

For the quarter, lower operating income at our domestic operations reflected
decreased guest spending and increased costs, partially offset by higher
attendance, which was driven by the benefit of the additional week of
operations, and increased revenue recognition at Disney Vacation Club in
connection with the completion of vacation club properties. Decreased guest
spending was due to lower average ticket prices, decreased merchandise, food and
beverage spending and lower average daily hotel room rates. Higher costs
reflected the additional week of operations in the current quarter and labor and
other cost inflation, partially offset by cost mitigation activities. 

Lower operating income at Disneyland Paris reflected decreased guest spending
due to lower average ticket prices and lower average daily hotel room rates,
partially offset by lower costs driven by cost mitigation activities and a
favorable claim settlement. 

Studio Entertainment

Studio Entertainment revenues for the year decreased 16% to $6.1 billion and
segment operating income decreased 84% to $175 million. For the quarter,
revenues increased 3% to $1.5 billion and segment operating income decreased
$111 million to a loss of $13 million. 

Lower operating income for the year was primarily due to decreases in worldwide
home entertainment, worldwide theatrical distribution and worldwide television
distribution. 

The decline in worldwide home entertainment was driven by lower unit sales and
net effective pricing, partially offset by lower production cost amortization
and marketing costs. Decreased unit sales reflect the overall decline in the DVD
market and the strength of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World`s End in the prior
year. Significant other titles included WALL-E and The Chronicles of Narnia:
Prince Caspian in the current year while the prior year included Ratatouille,
Enchanted and National Treasure: Book of Secrets.

Lower results in worldwide theatrical distribution were primarily due to a
weaker performing slate of titles in the current year and higher film cost
write-downs. Successful current year titles included UP and The Proposal while
the prior year included National Treasure: Book of Secrets and WALL-E. The
decrease in worldwide television distribution was driven by fewer significant
titles in the current period. 

Lower operating results for the quarter were primarily due to higher film cost
write-downs in domestic theatrical distribution and a decline in music
distribution reflecting the strong performance of the Jonas Brothers and Miley
Cyrus titles in the prior-year quarter. 

Consumer Products

Consumer Products revenues for the year were essentially flat at $2.4 billion,
and segment operating income decreased 22% to $609 million. For the quarter,
revenues decreased 12% to $646 million, and segment operating income decreased
28% to $151 million. 

Lower operating income for the year and quarter reflected the effect of the
difficult global retail environment across our licensing, retail and publishing
businesses as well as the strength of Hannah Montana and High School Musical
propertiesin the prior year. Our retail operations reflected the adverse impact
of a full year of company-owned operations at the Disney Stores North America in
fiscal 2009 whereas the prior year included five months of company-owned
operations and seven months of licensed operations. 

Interactive Media

Interactive Media revenues for the year decreased 1% to $712 million and segment
operating results decreased 14% to a loss of $295 million. For the quarter,
revenues increased 8% to $157 million and segment operating results improved 5%
to a loss of $114 million. 

Lower operating results for the year were due to a decrease at Disney
Interactive Studios, partially offset by an increase at Disney Online. Lower
results at Disney Interactive Studios were driven by decreased net effective
pricing and unit sales of self-published video games, decreased licensing
revenue and higher unit cost of sales, which included the cost of bundled
accessories and music royalties for current year titles. Significant
self-published video games in the current year included High School Musical 3
and Sing It while the prior year included High School Musical, Turok and Pure.
Improved results at Disney Online reflected lower marketing costs and higher
Club Penguin subscription revenues. 

For the quarter, the improved operating results were primarily due to lower
marketing and product development costs as well as increased Club Penguin
subscription revenue at Disney Online, partially offset by higher cost of sales
at Disney Interactive Studios. 

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses decreased from $460 million to $398
million for the year and from $147 million to $130 million for the quarter. For
both the year and quarter, the decrease was driven by savings from cost
mitigation activities and an increase in allocation of costs to the business
segments. 

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

During the fourth quarter, the Company recorded charges totaling $166 million
which included impairment charges of $73 million and restructuring costs of $93
million. For the year, the Company recorded charges totaling $492 million which
included impairment charges of $279 million and restructuring costs of $213
million. The most significant of the impairment charges was $142 million related
to radio FCC licenses, of which $34 million was recorded in the fourth quarter.
The restructuring charges included severance and other related costs as a result
of various organizational and cost structure initiatives across our businesses.
Restructuring and impairment charges for the prior year consisted of an
impairment charge of $39 million related to radio FCC licenses which was
recorded in the fourth quarter.

        Free cash flow is not a financial measure defined by GAAP. See the 
        discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows below.

The decrease in free cash flow was driven by lower segment operating results,
higher contributions to our pension plans and an increase in capital
expenditures, partially offset by lower income tax payments and a decreased net
investment in working capital. The increase in capital expenditures reflected
spending on the Disney`s California Adventure expansion and construction
progress payments on two new cruise ships.

        Net borrowings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the discussion of 
        non-GAAP financial measures that follows.

The total borrowings shown above include $2,868 million and $3,706 million
attributable to Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland as of October 3, 2009 and
September 27, 2008, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents attributable to Euro
Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland totaled $606 million and $693 million as of
October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding certain items, net
borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income, all of which
are important financial measures for the Company but are not financial measures
defined by GAAP. 

These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP
financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of earnings per
share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with
GAAP. Earnings per share excluding certain items, net borrowings, free cash
flow, and aggregate segment operating income as we have calculated them may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

Earnings per share excluding certain items - The Company uses earnings per share
excluding certain items to evaluate the performance of the Company`s operations
exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period
to period. In the current year, these items included a non-cash gain in
connection with the merger of Lifetime and A, a gain on the sale of our
investment in two pay television services in Latin America and restructuring and
impairment charges. In the prior year, these items included gains related to the
acquisition of the Disney Stores North America and the sale of movies.com, the
favorable resolution of certain income tax matters, a bad debt charge for a
receivable from Lehman Brothers and an impairment charge. The Company believes
that information about earnings per share exclusive of these impacts is useful
to investors, particularly where the impact of the excluded items is significant
in relation to reported earnings, because the measure allows for comparability
between periods of the operating performance of the Company`s business and
allows investors to evaluate the impact of these items separately from the
impact of the operations of the business. The following table reconciles
reported earnings per share to earnings per share excluding certain items:

        The amount in the prior year and prior-year quarter consists of an 
        impairment charge for radio FCC licenses which was previously reported 
        in Media Networks operating income in the fiscal 2008 financial 
        statements. For the fiscal 2009 financial statements, this amount has 
        been reclassified to &#8220;Restructuring and Impairment Charges&#8221; in the 
        consolidated statement of income to conform to the fiscal 2009 
        presentation.

        Other (income)/expense for the current year consists of a non-cash 
        gain in connection with the merger of Lifetime and A ($228 million 
        pre-tax) in the fourth quarter and a gain on the sale of our 
        investment in two pay television services in Latin America ($114 
        million pre-tax) in the first quarter. Other (income)/expense for the 
        prior year consists of an accounting gain related to the acquisition 
        of the Disney Stores North America ($18 million pre-tax) and a gain on 
        the sale of movies.com ($14 million pre-tax) in the third quarter and 
        a bad debt charge for a receivable from Lehman Brothers ($91 million 
        pre-tax) in the fourth quarter.

Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net borrowings
provides investors with a useful perspective on our financial condition. Net
borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total
borrowings. Since we earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a
portion of the interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be
used as a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness when
the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. However, we may not
immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the reduction of debt, nor do we
expect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repay
debt in the ordinary course of business. 

Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by operations
less investments in parks, resorts and other property), among other measures, to
evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for
purposes other than capital expenditures. Management believes that information
about free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the
cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and
pay dividends or repurchase shares. 

Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses
aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating
businesses separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that
information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by
allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company`s
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net
income, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other
factors that affect reported results. 

A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows (in
millions):

BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today reported earnings for the fiscal year
and fourth quarter ended October 3, 2009. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for
the year was $1.76, compared to $2.28 in the prior year. EPS for the current and
prior year include certain items that are discussed below. Excluding these
items, EPS for the year was $1.82, down 20% from $2.28 in the prior year. 

EPS for the current year included a non-cash gain in connection with the merger
of Lifetime Entertainment Services (Lifetime) and A Television Networks (A),
a gain on the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin
America, and restructuring and impairment charges, which collectively had a net
adverse impact of $0.06. EPS for the prior year included an accounting gain
related to the acquisition of the Disney Stores North America, a gain on the
sale of movies.com, the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters, a
bad debt charge for a receivable from Lehman Brothers, and an impairment charge,
which collectively had no net impact on EPS. 

For the quarter, diluted EPS was $0.47 compared to $0.40 in the prior-year
quarter. EPS for the current quarter included the gain related to the
Lifetime/A transaction and restructuring and impairment charges, which
together resulted in a net benefit of $0.01, while EPS for the prior-year
quarter included the Lehman Brothers bad debt charge and an impairment charge,
which together had a net adverse impact of $0.04. Excluding these items, EPS for
the quarter increased 5% to $0.46 compared to $0.44 in the prior-year quarter. 

"Although last year was a difficult one due in part to the weak global economy,
I`m pleased with the way our businesses have responded to the downturn," said
President and CEO Robert A. Iger. "We`ve stayed focused on our long-term
strategy, efficiently managed costs, and continued to invest in initiatives to
deliver future growth. We also have adapted our organization to respond to and
take advantage of the changes taking place in our businesses and will continue
to do so as we position Disney to thrive for years to come." 

Fiscal 2009 results for the full year and fourth quarter include the benefit
from one additional week of operations compared to the prior-year periods due to
our fiscal period end. The following table summarizes the full year and fourth
quarter results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 (in millions, except per share

Cable Networks

Operating income at Cable Networks increased $121 million to $4.3 billion for
the year due to growth at ESPN and at ABC Family, partially offset by the impact
associated with the transition of Jetix to Disney-branded channels. The growth
at ESPN was driven by higher affiliate revenue primarily due to contractual rate
increases and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the additional week of
operations and subscriber growth, partially offset by decreased advertising
revenue and higher programming costs. The decrease in advertising revenues was
due to a decrease in units sold, partially offset by higher rates. Higher
programming costs reflected contractual rate increases for key rights contracts
and the cost of new and renewed rights agreements for college and international
sports programming. 

Operating income growth at ABC Family reflected higher advertising and affiliate
revenue. Increased advertising revenue at ABC Family was primarily due to higher
units sold and higher rates while increased affiliate revenue was driven by
higher rates. At the worldwide Disney Channel, increased affiliate revenue due
to subscriber growth and contractual rate increase was largely offset by lower
DVD sales. 

For the quarter, operating income at Cable Networks increased 19% to $1.5
billion primarily due to an increase at ESPN and, to a lesser extent, the
worldwide Disney Channels. The growth at ESPN was driven by higher affiliate
revenue, partially offset by higher programming costs. Higher affiliate revenue
reflected increased recognition of previously deferred revenues related to
annual programming commitments, the impact of the additional week of operations
and contractual rate increases. During the quarter, ESPN recognized $128 million
more in net deferred revenues related to programming commitments than in the
prior-year quarter. Programming cost increases at ESPN for the quarter reflected
similar impacts as discussed above for the year. Growth at the worldwide Disney
Channels was driven by higher affiliate revenues due to international subscriber
growth, partially offset by lower DVD sales. 

Broadcasting

Operating income at Broadcasting decreased $337 million to $505 million for the
year primarily due to lower advertising sales at the ABC Television Network and
owned television stations, higher programming and production costs and a bad
debt charge related to a syndication customer. These decreases were partially
offset by increased international and domestic sales of ABC Studios productions,
led by Grey`s Anatomy, Desperate Housewives and According to Jim. Decreased
advertising revenues at the ABC Television Network reflected lower primetime
ratings. The increase in programming and production costs was driven by higher
primetime programming costs due to more hours of original scripted programming
and higher production cost amortization related to sales of ABC Studios
productions. 

For the quarter, operating results at Broadcasting increased $73 million to $2
million, driven by increased domestic and international sales of ABC Studios
productions, led by Grey`s Anatomy and According to Jim, partially offset by an
increase in the related production cost amortization. 

At the ABC Television Network, results were comparable to the prior-year quarter
as lower pilot costs and the benefit of an additional week of advertising
revenues were offset by the impact of lower ratings and advertising rates and
higher programming costs for more hours of original scripted programming. Lower
pilot costs reflected the timing of pick up decisions, which generally occurred
in the third quarter this year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year
due to delays resulting from the Writers Guild of America work stoppage in
fiscal 2008. 

Parks and Resorts

Parks and Resorts revenues for the year decreased 7% to $10.7 billion and
segment operating income decreased 25% to $1.4 billion. For the quarter,
revenues decreased 4% to $2.8 billion and segment operating income decreased 17%
to $344 million. Results for the year and quarter reflected decreases at our
domestic operations and at Disneyland Paris. 

For the year, lower operating income at our domestic operations was driven by
decreased guest spending, principally at our domestic parks and resorts, and
lower gains on securitized sales of ownership interests at Disney Vacation Club,
partially offset by lower costs at Walt Disney World Resort. Decreased guest
spending at the domestic parks and resorts was due to lower average ticket
prices, lower average daily hotel room rates and decreased merchandise spending.
Lower costs at Walt Disney World Resort reflected savings from cost mitigation
activities, partially offset by labor and other cost inflation. 

The decrease at Disneyland Paris was due to decreased guest spending and lower
hotel occupancy, partially offset by lower costs. Decreased guest spending
reflected lower average ticket prices, decreased merchandise spending and lower
average daily hotel room rates. Lower costs were driven by savings from cost
mitigation activities, partially offset by labor and other cost inflation. 

For the quarter, lower operating income at our domestic operations reflected
decreased guest spending and increased costs, partially offset by higher
attendance, which was driven by the benefit of the additional week of
operations, and increased revenue recognition at Disney Vacation Club in
connection with the completion of vacation club properties. Decreased guest
spending was due to lower average ticket prices, decreased merchandise, food and
beverage spending and lower average daily hotel room rates. Higher costs
reflected the additional week of operations in the current quarter and labor and
other cost inflation, partially offset by cost mitigation activities. 

Lower operating income at Disneyland Paris reflected decreased guest spending
due to lower average ticket prices and lower average daily hotel room rates,
partially offset by lower costs driven by cost mitigation activities and a
favorable claim settlement. 

Studio Entertainment

Studio Entertainment revenues for the year decreased 16% to $6.1 billion and
segment operating income decreased 84% to $175 million. For the quarter,
revenues increased 3% to $1.5 billion and segment operating income decreased
$111 million to a loss of $13 million. 

Lower operating income for the year was primarily due to decreases in worldwide
home entertainment, worldwide theatrical distribution and worldwide television
distribution. 

The decline in worldwide home entertainment was driven by lower unit sales and
net effective pricing, partially offset by lower production cost amortization
and marketing costs. Decreased unit sales reflect the overall decline in the DVD
market and the strength of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World`s End in the prior
year. Significant other titles included WALL-E and The Chronicles of Narnia:
Prince Caspian in the current year while the prior year included Ratatouille,
Enchanted and National Treasure: Book of Secrets.

Lower results in worldwide theatrical distribution were primarily due to a
weaker performing slate of titles in the current year and higher film cost
write-downs. Successful current year titles included UP and The Proposal while
the prior year included National Treasure: Book of Secrets and WALL-E. The
decrease in worldwide television distribution was driven by fewer significant
titles in the current period. 

Lower operating results for the quarter were primarily due to higher film cost
write-downs in domestic theatrical distribution and a decline in music
distribution reflecting the strong performance of the Jonas Brothers and Miley
Cyrus titles in the prior-year quarter. 

Consumer Products

Consumer Products revenues for the year were essentially flat at $2.4 billion,
and segment operating income decreased 22% to $609 million. For the quarter,
revenues decreased 12% to $646 million, and segment operating income decreased
28% to $151 million. 

Lower operating income for the year and quarter reflected the effect of the
difficult global retail environment across our licensing, retail and publishing
businesses as well as the strength of Hannah Montana and High School Musical
propertiesin the prior year. Our retail operations reflected the adverse impact
of a full year of company-owned operations at the Disney Stores North America in
fiscal 2009 whereas the prior year included five months of company-owned
operations and seven months of licensed operations. 

Interactive Media

Interactive Media revenues for the year decreased 1% to $712 million and segment
operating results decreased 14% to a loss of $295 million. For the quarter,
revenues increased 8% to $157 million and segment operating results improved 5%
to a loss of $114 million. 

Lower operating results for the year were due to a decrease at Disney
Interactive Studios, partially offset by an increase at Disney Online. Lower
results at Disney Interactive Studios were driven by decreased net effective
pricing and unit sales of self-published video games, decreased licensing
revenue and higher unit cost of sales, which included the cost of bundled
accessories and music royalties for current year titles. Significant
self-published video games in the current year included High School Musical 3
and Sing It while the prior year included High School Musical, Turok and Pure.
Improved results at Disney Online reflected lower marketing costs and higher
Club Penguin subscription revenues. 

For the quarter, the improved operating results were primarily due to lower
marketing and product development costs as well as increased Club Penguin
subscription revenue at Disney Online, partially offset by higher cost of sales
at Disney Interactive Studios. 

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses decreased from $460 million to $398
million for the year and from $147 million to $130 million for the quarter. For
both the year and quarter, the decrease was driven by savings from cost
mitigation activities and an increase in allocation of costs to the business
segments. 

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

During the fourth quarter, the Company recorded charges totaling $166 million
which included impairment charges of $73 million and restructuring costs of $93
million. For the year, the Company recorded charges totaling $492 million which
included impairment charges of $279 million and restructuring costs of $213
million. The most significant of the impairment charges was $142 million related
to radio FCC licenses, of which $34 million was recorded in the fourth quarter.
The restructuring charges included severance and other related costs as a result
of various organizational and cost structure initiatives across our businesses.
Restructuring and impairment charges for the prior year consisted of an
impairment charge of $39 million related to radio FCC licenses which was
recorded in the fourth quarter.

        Free cash flow is not a financial measure defined by GAAP. See the 
        discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows below.

The decrease in free cash flow was driven by lower segment operating results,
higher contributions to our pension plans and an increase in capital
expenditures, partially offset by lower income tax payments and a decreased net
investment in working capital. The increase in capital expenditures reflected
spending on the Disney`s California Adventure expansion and construction
progress payments on two new cruise ships.

        Net borrowings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the discussion of 
        non-GAAP financial measures that follows.

The total borrowings shown above include $2,868 million and $3,706 million
attributable to Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland as of October 3, 2009 and
September 27, 2008, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents attributable to Euro
Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland totaled $606 million and $693 million as of
October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding certain items, net
borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income, all of which
are important financial measures for the Company but are not financial measures
defined by GAAP. 

These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP
financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of earnings per
share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with
GAAP. Earnings per share excluding certain items, net borrowings, free cash
flow, and aggregate segment operating income as we have calculated them may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

Earnings per share excluding certain items - The Company uses earnings per share
excluding certain items to evaluate the performance of the Company`s operations
exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period
to period. In the current year, these items included a non-cash gain in
connection with the merger of Lifetime and A, a gain on the sale of our
investment in two pay television services in Latin America and restructuring and
impairment charges. In the prior year, these items included gains related to the
acquisition of the Disney Stores North America and the sale of movies.com, the
favorable resolution of certain income tax matters, a bad debt charge for a
receivable from Lehman Brothers and an impairment charge. The Company believes
that information about earnings per share exclusive of these impacts is useful
to investors, particularly where the impact of the excluded items is significant
in relation to reported earnings, because the measure allows for comparability
between periods of the operating performance of the Company`s business and
allows investors to evaluate the impact of these items separately from the
impact of the operations of the business. The following table reconciles
reported earnings per share to earnings per share excluding certain items:

        The amount in the prior year and prior-year quarter consists of an 
        impairment charge for radio FCC licenses which was previously reported 
        in Media Networks operating income in the fiscal 2008 financial 
        statements. For the fiscal 2009 financial statements, this amount has 
        been reclassified to &#8220;Restructuring and Impairment Charges&#8221; in the 
        consolidated statement of income to conform to the fiscal 2009 
        presentation.

        Other (income)/expense for the current year consists of a non-cash 
        gain in connection with the merger of Lifetime and A ($228 million 
        pre-tax) in the fourth quarter and a gain on the sale of our 
        investment in two pay television services in Latin America ($114 
        million pre-tax) in the first quarter. Other (income)/expense for the 
        prior year consists of an accounting gain related to the acquisition 
        of the Disney Stores North America ($18 million pre-tax) and a gain on 
        the sale of movies.com ($14 million pre-tax) in the third quarter and 
        a bad debt charge for a receivable from Lehman Brothers ($91 million 
        pre-tax) in the fourth quarter.

Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net borrowings
provides investors with a useful perspective on our financial condition. Net
borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total
borrowings. Since we earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a
portion of the interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be
used as a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness when
the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. However, we may not
immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the reduction of debt, nor do we
expect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repay
debt in the ordinary course of business. 

Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by operations
less investments in parks, resorts and other property), among other measures, to
evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for
purposes other than capital expenditures. Management believes that information
about free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the
cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and
pay dividends or repurchase shares. 

Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses
aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating
businesses separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that
information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by
allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company`s
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net
income, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other
factors that affect reported results. 

A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows (in
millions):

&lt;p&gt; (Adds bottling venture, FEMSA's beer business)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Nov 12 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Mexico President
Brian Smith said on Thursday the company is not interested in
participating in the beer business of its partner FEMSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. drinks giant has a venture in Mexico with FEMSA
(FMSAUBD.MX)(FMX.N) called Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOFL.MX)(KOF.N). It
is the leading bottler of Coke in Mexico and accounts for about
10 percent of Coca-Cola's global sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FEMSA said in October it is in talks regarding its beer
business, FEMSA Cerveza, fueling speculation Mexico could be
the next country to be enveloped in the wave of beer industry
consolidation of recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts had mentioned it could make sense for Coca-
Cola to tap the beer market in Mexico and merge their
distribution platforms to cut costs and expand Coke's beverages
portfolio.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has banned as many as one million users who hacked their Xbox 360 consoles to play pirated games from the company's Xbox Live service in a bid to counter piracy. The move triggered an avalanche of cheap "chipped" Xbox 360 consoles for sale on Craigslist and a public outcry from users is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ban from the Xbox Live service is reported to affect anywhere between 600,000 to one million Xbox 360 users who altered their console in order to play games downloaded illegally from the Internet. Microsoft says that this violates the Xbox Live terms of use, and consequently access to the service has been cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of the widely expected Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 game for the Xbox 360 probably is what triggered Microsoft's move. Illegal copies of the game have reportedly showed up on various download sites, days before its official release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says the Xbox Live online gaming service serves more than 20 million users worldwide. The Redmond giant added that modifying the Xbox 360 console to play pirated discs violates the Xbox Live terms of use, hence voiding the warranty and resulting in a ban from the online gaming service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also reassured those who purchased a genuine copy of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 game and played the game on an unmodified Xbox 360 that no action will be taken against them. But many are out of luck, as one Xbox 360 gamer explains his ordeal of being cut off from the Xbox Live service in a BBC report. He also explains how he saved almost $1,000 by playing illegal games on his hacked console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A banned Xbox 360 console from the Xbox Live service does not render the console useless though. Users can play games, but the online multiplayer service will not be available to them. The only way to get back using the service is to purchase a new Xbox 360 console, without any modifications to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this ban, a large number of modded Xbox 360 consoles are being put up for sale on sites such as Craigslist. The average price for such a console is now around $90, much under the normal market price of around $200. Precaution when buying such a console is advised, as Microsoft warned that anyone who accidentally purchased a modded Xbox 360 console would not receive any help or compensation from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is yet to be seen whether the mass of banned Xbox 360 owners will migrate to competing gaming consoles, such as Sony's PlayStation 3. If you were banned from the Xbox Live service, please share your experience in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/182010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas O. Staggs to Become Chairman, Disney Parks and Resorts

James A. Rasulo to Become Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In line with The Walt Disney Company`s (NYSE:DIS) goals of advancing its global
businesses and brands while providing new opportunities and challenges to
executives, Disney President and Chief Executive Officer Robert A. Iger
announced today that two of the company`s most senior leaders would assume new
roles at the end of the year. 

Thomas O. Staggs, Senior Executive Vice President and Disney`s Chief Financial
Officer and 20 year Disney veteran, will become Chairman, Walt Disney Parks and
Resorts. In his new position, Staggs will preside over the company`s vacation
businesses, which span three continents and include five-world class
destinations, a top rated cruise line and the most popular resort locations in
North America, Europe and Asia. 

James A. Rasulo, Chairman of Disney Parks and Resorts and a 23-year Disney
veteran, will become Senior Executive Vice President and Disney`s Chief
Financial Officer. In his new role, Rasulo will oversee the company`s worldwide
finance organization, corporate strategy and development, brand management,
corporate alliances, investor relations, treasury and risk management
activities, controller functions, information systems, corporate responsibility,
real estate and taxes. 

Both will remain members of the senior management group reporting to Iger. 

"Jay and Tom are both dynamic and versatile executives, who have done a great
job over the last several years and have helped me to shape Disney`s strategic
direction," Iger said. "By giving them exciting new challenges that build on
both their strengths at a time when each of their respective areas are on the
right strategic track, the change is good for them and good for the company." 

As CFO, Staggs has helped guide Disney through one of its most important periods
of expansion and financial success while steering it effectively through two
sudden global economic downturns in 2001 and 2008. Throughout, he`s been praised
by Wall Street for his financial and communication skills and has consistently
been voted the country`s top entertainment industry CFO by analysts polled by
Institutional Investor magazine. 

Working closely with Iger, Staggs has played a critical role in a wide variety
of Disney`s strategic and operating initiatives, including the acquisitions of
Capital Cities/ABC, Pixar and the pending acquisition of Marvel Entertainment.
As CFO, he spearheaded Disney`s realignment of its performance goals toward a
combination of profit growth and strong long term capital returns and free cash
flow. He has also led company efforts to drive greater cost and capital
efficiency throughout the organization and to put in place well-received
company-wide environmental and healthy food policies. 

"For over a decade, I`ve had a unique opportunity to build our business by
collaborating with a group of great executives running a wide range of media and
travel businesses," said Staggs. "Taking the operational reins of one of our
biggest and most complex businesses during the period of rapid global expansion
launched by Jay is tremendously exciting and a challenge I`m really looking
forward to." 

Under Rasulo`s leadership, Parks and Resorts has built on its traditional
strengths as the world`s preeminent theme park operator to create a range of
businesses that have made Disney a global leader in the family vacation
industry. 

As part of this growth strategy, Rasulo has overseen a major expansion of
Disney`s California Adventure at Disneyland Resort, which culminates with the
opening of Cars Land in 2012, and of Hong Kong Disneyland, where work is
underway on the creation of three original new lands. He has also led
negotiations with the Chinese government to begin development of a new theme
park in Shanghai. 

In addition to park expansion, Rasulo has been the principal architect of the
growth of the award-winning Disney Cruise Line, which is currently adding two
new ships, Disney Vacation Club and Adventures by Disney. Prior to becoming head
of Disney Parks and Resorts in 2002, Rasulo greatly improved the operating
performance of Disneyland Paris, now the number one tourist destination in
Europe. 

By emphasizing innovative marketing, strategic investment and financial
discipline, Rasulo has also deftly managed the Parks and Resorts businesses
through difficult periods, first as the unit`s President after tourism plummeted
globally in the wake of 9/11 and later as Chairman during the 2008-09 economic
downturn. Throughout, he`s been an important advocate for the tourism industry,
serving as Chairman of the Travel Industry Association of America in 2006 and
2007. Rasulo was inducted into the Travel Industry Hall of Leaders in 2008. 

"It`s been a tremendous honor to lead the almost 100,000 Cast Members, Crew
Members and Imagineers during a period of unprecedented investment at Disney
Parks and Resorts ," said Rasulo. "I look forward to building on Tom`s success
as CFO by working with Bob to advance Disney`s growth strategy, while continuing
to strengthen our balance sheet and create shareholder value." 

Both Rasulo and Staggs are longtime Disney executives and both serve on the
board of Euro Disney S.C.A., the French parent company of Disneyland Paris. 

Rasulo joined Disney in 1986 as Director, Strategic Planning and Development,
advancing to more senior positions there, and later became Senior Vice
President, Corporate Alliances. He then led Disney Regional Entertainment before
moving to Paris as President, Euro Disney before eventually becoming its
Chairman and CEO in 2000. A native New Yorker, Rasulo has a degree in economics
from Columbia University and both an MA in economics and an MBA from the
University of Chicago. Before joining Disney, he held positions with Chase
Manhattan Bank and the Marriott Corp. 

Staggs joined Disney in 1990 as Manager of Strategic Planning and soon advanced
through a series of positions of increased responsibility, becoming Senior Vice
President of Strategic Planning and Development in 1995 before becoming CFO and
Executive Vice President in 1998. Born in Illinois, Staggs received a BS in
business from University of Minnesota and an MBA from Stanford University. He
worked in investment banking at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. before joining Disney.

&lt;p&gt;Thomas O. Staggs to Become Chairman, Disney Parks and Resorts

James A. Rasulo to Become Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In line with The Walt Disney Company`s (NYSE:DIS) goals of advancing its global
businesses and brands while providing new opportunities and challenges to
executives, Disney President and Chief Executive Officer Robert A. Iger
announced today that two of the company`s most senior leaders would assume new
roles at the end of the year. 

Thomas O. Staggs, Senior Executive Vice President and Disney`s Chief Financial
Officer and 20 year Disney veteran, will become Chairman, Walt Disney Parks and
Resorts. In his new position, Staggs will preside over the company`s vacation
businesses, which span three continents and include five-world class
destinations, a top rated cruise line and the most popular resort locations in
North America, Europe and Asia. 

James A. Rasulo, Chairman of Disney Parks and Resorts and a 23-year Disney
veteran, will become Senior Executive Vice President and Disney`s Chief
Financial Officer. In his new role, Rasulo will oversee the company`s worldwide
finance organization, corporate strategy and development, brand management,
corporate alliances, investor relations, treasury and risk management
activities, controller functions, information systems, corporate responsibility,
real estate and taxes. 

Both will remain members of the senior management group reporting to Iger. 

"Jay and Tom are both dynamic and versatile executives, who have done a great
job over the last several years and have helped me to shape Disney`s strategic
direction," Iger said. "By giving them exciting new challenges that build on
both their strengths at a time when each of their respective areas are on the
right strategic track, the change is good for them and good for the company." 

As CFO, Staggs has helped guide Disney through one of its most important periods
of expansion and financial success while steering it effectively through two
sudden global economic downturns in 2001 and 2008. Throughout, he`s been praised
by Wall Street for his financial and communication skills and has consistently
been voted the country`s top entertainment industry CFO by analysts polled by
Institutional Investor magazine. 

Working closely with Iger, Staggs has played a critical role in a wide variety
of Disney`s strategic and operating initiatives, including the acquisitions of
Capital Cities/ABC, Pixar and the pending acquisition of Marvel Entertainment.
As CFO, he spearheaded Disney`s realignment of its performance goals toward a
combination of profit growth and strong long term capital returns and free cash
flow. He has also led company efforts to drive greater cost and capital
efficiency throughout the organization and to put in place well-received
company-wide environmental and healthy food policies. 

"For over a decade, I`ve had a unique opportunity to build our business by
collaborating with a group of great executives running a wide range of media and
travel businesses," said Staggs. "Taking the operational reins of one of our
biggest and most complex businesses during the period of rapid global expansion
launched by Jay is tremendously exciting and a challenge I`m really looking
forward to." 

Under Rasulo`s leadership, Parks and Resorts has built on its traditional
strengths as the world`s preeminent theme park operator to create a range of
businesses that have made Disney a global leader in the family vacation
industry. 

As part of this growth strategy, Rasulo has overseen a major expansion of
Disney`s California Adventure at Disneyland Resort, which culminates with the
opening of Cars Land in 2012, and of Hong Kong Disneyland, where work is
underway on the creation of three original new lands. He has also led
negotiations with the Chinese government to begin development of a new theme
park in Shanghai. 

In addition to park expansion, Rasulo has been the principal architect of the
growth of the award-winning Disney Cruise Line, which is currently adding two
new ships, Disney Vacation Club and Adventures by Disney. Prior to becoming head
of Disney Parks and Resorts in 2002, Rasulo greatly improved the operating
performance of Disneyland Paris, now the number one tourist destination in
Europe. 

By emphasizing innovative marketing, strategic investment and financial
discipline, Rasulo has also deftly managed the Parks and Resorts businesses
through difficult periods, first as the unit`s President after tourism plummeted
globally in the wake of 9/11 and later as Chairman during the 2008-09 economic
downturn. Throughout, he`s been an important advocate for the tourism industry,
serving as Chairman of the Travel Industry Association of America in 2006 and
2007. Rasulo was inducted into the Travel Industry Hall of Leaders in 2008. 

"It`s been a tremendous honor to lead the almost 100,000 Cast Members, Crew
Members and Imagineers during a period of unprecedented investment at Disney
Parks and Resorts ," said Rasulo. "I look forward to building on Tom`s success
as CFO by working with Bob to advance Disney`s growth strategy, while continuing
to strengthen our balance sheet and create shareholder value." 

Both Rasulo and Staggs are longtime Disney executives and both serve on the
board of Euro Disney S.C.A., the French parent company of Disneyland Paris. 

Rasulo joined Disney in 1986 as Director, Strategic Planning and Development,
advancing to more senior positions there, and later became Senior Vice
President, Corporate Alliances. He then led Disney Regional Entertainment before
moving to Paris as President, Euro Disney before eventually becoming its
Chairman and CEO in 2000. A native New Yorker, Rasulo has a degree in economics
from Columbia University and both an MA in economics and an MBA from the
University of Chicago. Before joining Disney, he held positions with Chase
Manhattan Bank and the Marriott Corp. 

Staggs joined Disney in 1990 as Manager of Strategic Planning and soon advanced
through a series of positions of increased responsibility, becoming Senior Vice
President of Strategic Planning and Development in 1995 before becoming CFO and
Executive Vice President in 1998. Born in Illinois, Staggs received a BS in
business from University of Minnesota and an MBA from Stanford University. He
worked in investment banking at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. before joining Disney.

&lt;p&gt;While companies are starting to seriously look at the hosted applications from Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. -- and Google Apps is winning converts among schools and small firms -- Microsoft's incumbent status gives it a leg up, according to CIOs interviewed at the Society for Information Management (SIM) conference in Seattle this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mueller Water Products Inc., for instance, is piloting Microsoft's Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS), which includes Microsoft-hosted versions of Exchange, SharePoint and other apps introduced a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had Google in to look at their apps," said Bob Keefe, Mueller's CIO. The Atlanta manufacturer has 5,300 employees, of which 2,200 use PCs with Windows XP and Microsoft Office. "We're really trying to keep budgets slim. To change out the whole company [to Google Apps] in this economic environment would require a lot of retraining, and that would be very costly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retraining costs also dissuaded the United States Tennis Association (USTA) from moving to Google Apps, according to CIO Larry Bonfante. The USTA "looked very seriously" at Google Apps last year, but ultimately stayed with the known quantity, Microsoft Office. More than half of the USTA's 750 employees and volunteers are located outside of its White Plains, N.Y. headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That hasn't stopped the USTA from shifting many of its back-end applications online, including its Exchange e-mail system, which is run by Web hosting firm USA.net, Bonfante said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oregon State University has a strong relationship with Google, which has donated more than $1 million to OSU's open-source lab. But OSU also recently upgraded to Exchange 2007 for its e-mail. And it remains firmly on Microsoft Office, said CIO Curt Pederson, because of Microsoft's deep educational discounts and the preference of OSU faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation is different at Sunoco Inc. The gasoline retailer is looking carefully at both Microsoft's BPOS and Google Apps for its 1,000 office workers, CIO Peter Whatnell said. The company only recently upgraded to Office 2003 at the beginning of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance firm Chubb Corp. has not started to test either Google or Microsoft's hosted offerings (the latter also includes the coming Web version of Office 2010 .) But group CIO Jim Knight says "the whole concept appeals to me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eighty percent of our employees are using 10% of the functionality of Office," he said. "So I could seriously consider Google Apps for 80% of my users, with the other 20% getting the full Office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yesterday disowned a company executive who said his company's Windows 7 was inspired by Apple's Mac operating system, calling his comments "uninformed" and "inaccurate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview published Tuesday, Simon Aldous, partner group manager at Microsoft, acknowledged that the company had used Mac OS X as its muse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the things that people say an awful lot about the Apple Mac is that the OS is fantastic, that it's very graphical and easy to use," Aldous told PCR from a partner conference in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we've tried to do with Windows 7 -- whether its traditional format or in a touch format -- is create a Mac look and feel in terms of graphics," Aldous added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aldous' comments caught the attention of blogs and enthusiast sites, such as Gizmodo and AppleInsider , which made much of the admission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as he granted that Apple's user interface was well-liked by users, however, Aldous couldn't resist taking a shot at Microsoft's rival. "We've significantly improved the graphical user interface, but it's built on that very stable core Vista technology, which is far more stable than the current Mac platform," Aldous said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late Wednesday, Microsoft repudiated Aldous. "Unfortunately, this came from a Microsoft employee who was not involved in any aspect of designing Windows 7," said Brandon LeBlanc, a company spokesman who authors most of the Windows 7 blog posts . "I hate to say this about one of our own, but his comments were inaccurate and uninformed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparisons between Microsoft's and Apple's operating systems, common because of the short gap between their releases, have often noted Windows 7's resemblance to Mac OS X 10.6, particularly the similarities between the revamped task bar of the former and the dock of the latter. Computerworld 's Preston Gralla, for example, highlighted Windows 7's taskbar, calling it better at displaying thumbnails of an application's open windows. Gralla, however, gave Snow Leopard the edge in the user interface match, saying in a head-to-head comparison that, "No one beats Apple when it comes to design."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Windows 7 and Snow Leopard have sold well since their debuts. Two weeks after the Aug. 28 launch of Mac OS X 10.6, retail research firm NPD Group estimated that Apple had sold twice as many copies of Snow Leopard than it had of its predecessor, Leopard. Microsoft, meanwhile, sold three times more copies of Windows 7 in the week surrounding its Oct. 22 release than it did Vista in the opening days of Vista sales in early 2007, NPD said last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEEDHAM, MA, Nov 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Sonian, Inc., the trusted cloud-powered universal data management
company, today announced email archiving and ediscovery support for
Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 beginning immediately. The Sonian Archive
Service provides Microsoft Exchange 2010 customers of all sizes with an
affordable, scalable, reliable, secure and feature-rich hosted email
archiving and ediscovery service.

    As the first platform-agnostic, Cloud-based email archiving service,
Sonian ensures that its Sonian platform incorporates technology updates
from its messaging partners as they occur. In the case of Microsoft
Exchange Server 2010, Sonian leverages its hosted services to establish
an organizational archive that complements Exchange 2010's personal
archive functionality for the long-term storage and retention management
of email and historical PST content without an impact to the production
email environment.

    "Among all enterprise mail platforms, the Microsoft Exchange provides an
easily configurable archiving option," said George Nichols, CEO of Sonian.
"Sonian supports all the configuration options within Microsoft Exchange.
Whether an organization chooses to write the archived messages to a local
folder or mailbox or stream them to an external address, Sonian allows you
to be up and running with your Microsoft Exchange archiving within an
hour."

    An on-demand hosted service, Sonian Archive enables Exchange users to get
up and running quickly without investing in any additional hardware or
software infrastructure. The service also satisfies all governance, risk
and compliance requirements; and provides litigation support and
ediscovery, storage resource management, business continuity and best
business practices. With the Sonian Archive Service, Microsoft Exchange
customers receive:


--  Compliant archiving: Sonian locks down mailboxes and/or post offices
    and prevents users from removing messages from their Trash until they have
    been successfully captured by the Sonian collection service in a compliant
    and secure way. It also archives File System and SharePoint content.
--  Unlimited, cost-effective storage: Sonian Archive takes advantage of
    unlimited and low-cost Cloud storage to archive enterprise emails and other
    user-generated content for an affordable monthly fee usually between $3.00
    and $5.00/month.
--  Millisecond search and analysis of dark data: Unlike other hosted
    archive offerings that reduce costs by migrating older data to offline or
    near-line storage systems, Sonian Archive keeps all data online and
    immediately accessible from any internet connection 24 hours a day. Its
    powerful search engine delivers rapid search results on all historic data.
--  Self-training UIs: Sonian user interfaces are intuitive for all skill
    set levels, and extensive self-service online training videos guide users
    through all tasks.
--  Improved Microsoft Exchange performance: Without the need to retain
    large Exchange databases, timeframes for backup and restoration windows
    shorten and upgrading to new service packs and versions of Exchange becomes
    much, much easier.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of
Buckle Inc (BKE.N) with a "sell" rating, as it sees few
sustainable drivers to the teen apparel retailer's earnings
growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "There is limited store opening potential from here and the
company is operating at peak margins. Thus, earnings growth is
dependent on inflection points in execution or trend cycle,
which we view as a negative," the brokerage said in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said Buckle's periods of outperformance are
typically limited to 3-4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said during the company's past down-cycles
shares sold off sharply in response to negative comparable
sales and Goldman expects shares to fall further as comparable
sales are still in the positive mid-single digit range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's 6-month price target for the company is $27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Buckle closed at $30.29 Wednesday on the New York

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, Nov 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (NASDAQ: CRAY) today announced the
reinvention of the workstation for the next era of technical computing
with the launch of the Cray CX1-iWS(TM) system, which combines a powerful
Microsoft Windows 7 workstation with a fully integrated high-performance
computing (HPC) cluster running Microsoft Windows HPC Server 2008. With a
list price beginning at under $40,000 and sold exclusively through Dell,
the Cray CX1-iWS product meets a market need for a new generation of
workstation.

    The Cray CX1-iWS system -- the "iWS" stands for "integrated workstation"
-- combines the interactivity of a workstation with the scale-out
performance of a cluster conveniently packaged in a deskside form factor.
Users can enjoy a highly responsive and interactive workstation
environment (with eight cores of Intel(R) Xeon(R) processors) while
initiating distributed jobs leveraging the integrated cluster resource
with an additional 24 cores of Intel Xeon processing power. In total, 32
cores are available to the user or workgroup. The Cray CX1-iWS product
aims to substantially boost productivity for engineers, scientists and
researchers continually challenged with complex problems and little time
to solve them.

    "The Cray CX1-iWS puts the 'work' back in workstation by delivering a
powerhouse of functionality to the workstation user or workgroup. The
integration of workstation and cluster in one unit, with shared storage
between them, means that users can easily move their jobs from the
workstation to the cluster side of the box without moving their data or
leaving the familiar Microsoft operating system environment," said Ian
Miller, senior vice president of the productivity solutions group and
marketing at Cray. "With this new product, Cray expects to provide HPC
capability to a wide new audience that includes R groups in small and
medium-size businesses, organizations needing to solve problems beyond the
limits of traditional workstations, and people wanting to implement
distributed HPC in the enterprise."

    "Combining Windows 7 and Windows HPC Server 2008 in a single, integrated
workstation experience will deliver HPC capabilities to a new customer
base that sees value in the ease-of-use of the Windows 7 operating system
paired with the compute capability of a powerful cluster resource," said
Vince Mendillo, senior director of high performance computing at
Microsoft. "The Cray CX1-iWS system is one of the most powerful Windows
workstations ever, and a must-have for those looking to realize the
benefits of HPC."

    "This solution will help bring HPC to an even wider community of
scientists and researchers outside the walls of marquee labs and
universities," said Frank Muehleman, vice president and manager of Dell's
North American public-sector business. "Working with partners like
Microsoft and Cray, we continue to enable customers to tackle some of
society's biggest challenges using industry-standard technologies."

    Each Cray CX1-iWS system comes with one dual-socket visualization
workstation, a three node compute cluster, storage and a 16-port Gigabit
Ethernet switch. The workstation node features an NVIDIA(R) Quadro(R)
graphics card that can support two high-definition monitors for
visualization. It will ship exclusively with Windows 7 and Windows HPC
Server 2008.

    Three standard Cray CX1-iWS system configurations are available, all based
on the Intel Xeon Processor 5500 series. The midrange and advanced
configurations add more cluster nodes, memory and storage. The advanced
configuration includes eight 2.93 GHz Intel Xeon Series 5500 processors
with 24GB of memory (6x 4GB DIMMS) per node, 160GB of disk per node, 4TB
of storage, the 16-port Gigabit Ethernet switch and an NVIDIA Quadro FX
5800 graphics card.

    The CRAY CX1-iWS system is the newest entry in the Cray CX(TM) product
series and joins the Cray CX1-LC(TM) product, which was launched in July
2009. Introduced in September 2008, the successful Cray CX1(TM) deskside
supercomputer is designed from the ground up to provide superior
performance, functionality and cost for individuals and departmental
workgroups who want to harness an HPC cluster. Equipped with
state-of-the-art visualization and storage capabilities, the Cray CX1
supercomputer delivers performance leadership across a broad range of
applications, all in a compact, deskside system.

&lt;p&gt;    * Expects little change to R budget from $9 bln in 2009 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Sees opportunities in healthcare, education, energy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Expects good "uptake" rate on Microsoft Office 2010 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   (Adds more comments) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Harry Suhartono &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SINGAPORE, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), the world's largest software company, does not big changes to its research and development budget for next year from more than $9 billion it committed this year, a senior executive said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Craig Mundie, Microsoft's chief research and strategy officer told Reuters in an interview the company sees some greenfield opportunities in healthcare, education, and energy, where information technologies could help address problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The company remains very committed with R I think it will be nominally the same, I'm not expecting any big changes," Mundie said on Thursday in Microsoft's office in Singapore, overlooking the Marina Bay business district. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have been putting, incrementalling more research and development money into some of these completely new business, not just the extension of the old businesses," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Research and development spending in the global technology sector, a critical component in an industry where innovation is king, is expected to hold up well this year despite slumping sales and deep cost-cuts, analysts say. [nN05472728] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For Intel Corp (INTC.O), Microsoft, Oracle Corp ORCL.O, Texas Instruments TXN.N and other technology heavyweights grappling with sliding revenue, R expense is making up a larger percentage of sales than last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Technology companies are choosing to slash spending on areas such as marketing or staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mundie, a 17-year Microsoft veteran, was one of two people who filled the role of Bill Gates when Microsoft's co-founder left the company to concentrate on philanthropy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mundie focuses on the long-range technological direction of Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He said he expects the company's upcoming Microsoft Office 2010 application to have a "good" take up rate once the firm introduces it next year to replace the 2007 version. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "If you have no interest in communication and collaboration, if you have no interest in mobile or doing anything different than the documents you have always wrote and read in the past, you might say there doesn't seem to be compelling change." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "But in the world we living in today all of these things appear to be in high demand and since it did not exist in the prior version then I expect there will be pretty substantial uptake of them," Mundie said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Anshuman Daga) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((harry.suhartono@thomsonreuters.com; +65 6403 5658; Reuters  Messaging: harry.suhartono.reuters.com@reuters.net)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((If you have a query or comment on this story, send an email to news.feedback.asia@thomsonreuters.com)) Keywords: MICROSOFT MUNDIE/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - American Justin Leonard shot an eight-under-par 64 to grab a two-stroke lead over Justin Rose and George McNeill after the second round of the Walt Disney Classic at Lake Buena Vista, Florida on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonard, playing the Palm Course, followed up his first round 68 to reach the halfway stage at 12-under-par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Briton Rose, who led by a shot overnight, could manage only a three under-par 69 and was joined in second spot by McNeill, who fired a 66. Both Rose and McNeil played the Magnolia Course at the Disney venue near Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leonard, who has not led a PGA Tour event after two rounds since 2005, might have led by more but tarnished his round with three bogeys in the gusty conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Playing in wind like this, sometimes it's hard to judge and I misjudged today a couple of cross-winds and subsequently I had a couple of 40 or 50 footers that I wasn't able to get, wasn't able to two-putt," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But on the flip side of that I came back and birdied the next hole each time and hit a lot of great shots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those missing the cut in the final of the five autumn events on the PGA Tour, was Australian Matt Jones, who shot a smart 66 after his disastrous opening round of 78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Mark Calcavecchia and South Korean Charlie Wi also missed the cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Julian Linden)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today announced that it would sell Windows 7 desktop real estate to advertisers and launched a pilot program that includes Coke, Infiniti and Porsche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Windows 7 themes -- collections of backgrounds, borders and audio elements -- advertisers will be able to brand the desktop, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft pitched the pilot as a way for international advertisers to connect to consumers. "The new Windows Theme Experience and Windows Personalization Gallery in Windows 7 allow consumers to customize their technology to reflect the things in life they are most passionate about," said Darren Huston, corporate vice president of the company's consumer and online group, in a statement Friday. "These are great examples of Microsoft innovation and technology coming together to enable top global brands to reach audiences in new and interesting ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desktop space selling is a first for Microsoft, although in the past it has let companies customize the Internet Explorer (IE) browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft main rival in the operating system space, Apple, does not sell desktop space to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several companies are participating in the pilot program, which will run through October 2010, including luxury automobile makers like Ferrari, Infiniti and Porsche; soft drink sellers Coke and Pepsi; and Italian motorcycle maker Ducati. Microsoft's joined in with themes for some of its own brands, such as Bing, Xbox and Zune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twentieth Century Fox, another pilot participant, is promoting Avatar , the James Cameron-directed movie slated for a Dec. 16 release, in a desktop theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advertisers will also be allowed to create desktop gadget and add-ons to drive Windows 7 users to their own Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analyst downplayed the desktop-space selling. "This is interesting, but it will come down to execution," said Allan Krans, of Technology Business Research. "If the themes are innovative enough, neat enough, I can see some people using them. But I can't imagine it's going to have a huge impact in terms of revenue. I don't think a sizable portion of users will bother."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether the program would trigger a backlash, Krans replied, "I can't see a huge backlash, unless they really push this on, say, netbooks, to offset some of the lower pricing for Windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most netbooks come with Windows 7 Starter, a stripped-down version available only to computer makers. Although Microsoft doesn't disclose its price list for OEM copies of Windows, analysts assume that the company is charging much less for Starter than for Home Premium as part of its campaign to scrub the eight-year-old Windows XP from the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This points out one thing," Krans added. "They're seeking every way to add all incremental income," he said, referring to Microsoft's bottom line, which has been hammered for the last several quarters by the decline in PC sales worldwide and the increase in netbook sales, which lowers the company's profit margin as the percentage of higher-priced "premium" editions falls. During the quarter that ended Sept. 30, for example, Microsoft's revenue was down 14% , while revenue from sales of Windows to OEMs was off 6% compared to the same period the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every little bit helps," Krans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The themes can be downloaded from the Personalization Gallery on Microsoft's Web site. The company made a point to stress that the themes were "opt-in," and thus would not appear automatically when a user launches Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIRMINGHAM, Alabama (Reuters) - Alabama's Jefferson County sued JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Chase and Co on Friday, alleging fraud related to the accumulation of its massive sewer bond debt, a senior county official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said the county's suit was "meritless."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county sued for compensatory and punitive damages, seeking a jury trial over what it says were fraudulent transactions tied to interest rate and bond swaps earlier this decade as it sought to upgrade its sewer system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are suing for fraud because they conspired to profit with interest rate swaps to the detriment of the county," said Assistant County Attorney Charles Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They caused us to spend more money and enter into ill-advised bond swaps for unjust enrichment of themselves. They suppressed material facts and fraudulently charged the money back to the county," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County is struggling to stave off what would be the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history over a multibillion dollar sewer debt accumulated in part because of the transactions, which have  triggered multiple lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the claims are meritless and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. Meanwhile, we continue to work to achieve a responsible restructuring of Jefferson County's financial affairs," said JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county also sued former Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford, lobbyist Al LaPierre and investment banker William Blount, as well as 50 unnamed parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month fined JPMorgan Securities $75 million and the bank agreed to forfeit $647 million in fees it was going to charge the county over the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the SEC brought charges against two former JPMorgan Securities officials, Charles LeCroy and Douglas MacFaddin, who conducted bank business with the county over the transactions. Those officials are named in the county suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county said its suit stemmed from other legal action relating to the bond swap transactions, including the SEC complaint and the conviction in federal court of Langford last month on 60 counts, including fraud and bribery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the potential financial implications of the county's suit, it could have value in helping to restore the county's tattered reputation by holding others accountable for the accumulation of the debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County's five commissioners face re-election next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The county did not know and could not reasonably have known about the bribes, kickbacks and payoffs involved in these financial transactions," said the lawsuit, filed in Jefferson County circuit court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Had the county had knowledge of the schemes it would not have entertained the plan to restructure the county's fixed-rate debt," the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Matthew Bigg, editing by Jim Loney and Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

Although Microsoft doesn't disclose its price list for OEM copies of Windows, analysts assume that the company is charging much less for Starter than for Home Premium as part of its campaign to scrub the eight-year-old Windows XP from the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This points out one thing," Krans added. "They're seeking every way to add all incremental income," he said, referring to Microsoft's bottom line, which has been hammered for the last several quarters by the decline in PC sales worldwide and the increase in netbook sales, which lowers the company's profit margin as the percentage of higher-priced "premium" editions falls. During the quarter that ended Sept. 30, for example, Microsoft's revenue was down 14% , while revenue from sales of Windows to OEMs was off 6% compared to the same period the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every little bit helps," Krans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The themes can be downloaded from the Personalization Gallery on Microsoft's Web site. The company made a point to stress that the themes were "opt-in," and thus would not appear automatically when a user launches Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds details, quotes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov 13 (Reuters) - Alabama's Jefferson
County sued JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Chase and Co
(JPM.N) on Friday, alleging fraud related to the accumulation
of its massive sewer bond debt, a senior county official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The county sued for compensatory and punitive damages over
what it says were fraudulent transactions tied to interest rate
and bond swaps earlier this decade as it sought to upgrade its
sewer system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are suing for fraud because they conspired to profit
with interest rate swaps to the detriment of the county," said
Assistant County Attorney Charles Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They caused us to spend more money and enter in to
ill-advised bond swaps for unjust enrichment of themselves.
They suppressed material facts and fraudulently charged the
money back to the county," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said late on Friday the county's suit was
"meritless."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the claims are meritless and intend to defend
ourselves vigorously. Meanwhile, we continue to work to achieve
a responsible restructuring of Jefferson County's financial
affairs," said JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The county said it was also suing two former officials from
JPMorgan as well as former Birmingham mayor Larry Langford,
lobbyist Al LaPierre and investment banker William Blount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this
month fined JPMorgan Securities and brought charges against two
of its former officials over the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferson County is struggling to stave off bankruptcy over
a multibillion-dollar sewer debt accumulated in part because of
the transactions.

&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2010, TRD-built NASCAR Engines Will Benefit From Mobil 1 Racing Oil
Technology
PHOENIX--(Business Wire)--
Underscoring the performance benefits high-quality motor oil technology can
deliver, ExxonMobil and Toyota Racing Development (TRD) unveiled a new
technological partnership in which ExxonMobil will provide its Mobil 1 racing
oil technology and products to TRD-supported NASCAR teams. 

Kicking off at the start of the 2010 NASCAR season, TRD-supplied NASCAR engines
will be filled with specially modified motor oil based on the same technology
available to consumers in Mobil 1 Racing oils, which were unveiled in April. The
TRD-specific motor oils will deliver outstanding power via unique low-friction
synthetic lubricant technology combined with boosted levels of anti-wear
additives to protect and extend the life of engine hardware. 

Formally announced before the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Checker O'Reilly Auto
Parts 500 at Phoenix International Raceway, the collaboration will pair Mobil 1,
the "Official Motor Oil of NASCAR," with one of NASCAR`s top engine
manufacturers. With this new partnership, ExxonMobil`s racing oil technology
will now provide performance and protection for the TRD-supported Red Bull
Racing and Michael Waltrip Racing NASCAR teams. 

"We are excited to partner with such well known and respected racing technology
like Mobil 1 motor oil," said Lee White, president and general manager, TRD,
U.S.A. "Mobil 1 technology advisors, utilizing the resources of one of the
world`s leading racing oil suppliers, will help ensure that our team`s engines
are running at peak performance, ultimately helping us win more races." 

The racing oils designed for TRD represent the latest in synthetic racing oil
technology and are intended to help deliver maximum horsepower over a wide range
of race engine applications. 

"Partnering with such expert engine builders like TRD gives us another excellent
platform to fully demonstrate the technological benefits of our products," said
Kendall S. MacGibbon, sales director, Strategic Global Alliances, ExxonMobil
Lubricants &amp; Specialties. "This agreement with TRD showcases the engine
performance and protection that Mobil 1 racing oil technology delivers for
NASCAR drivers and other competitive motorsports drivers."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings takes various rating actions on all rated classes of J.P. Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., Series 2005-LDP2. A detailed list of
rating actions follows at the end of this press release. 

The downgrades are the result of loss expectations and reflect Fitch's
prospective views regarding commercial real estate market value and cash flow
declines. Fitch forecasts potential losses of 4.9% for this transaction, should
market conditions not recover. Today's rating actions are based on losses of
4.5%, including 100% of the losses associated with term defaults and any losses
associated with maturities within the next five years. Fitch's actions only
account for 25% of the losses associated with maturities beyond five years. The
bonds with Negative Outlooks indicate classes that may be downgraded in the
future should full potential losses be realized. 

To determine potential defaults for each loan Fitch assumed cash flow would
decline by 10% from year-end 2008. This is consistent with the analysis used in
its review of recent vintage transactions whereby cash flow was assumed to
decline 15% from year-end 2007 projected over a three-year period. If the
stressed cash flow would cause the loan to fall below 0.95 times (x), Fitch
assumed the loan would default during the term. To determine losses, Fitch used
the above stressed cash flow and applied a market cap rate by property type,
ranging between 7.5% and 9.5%, to derive a value. If the loan balance at default
is less than the stressed cash flow the loan would realize that loss. These loss
estimates were reviewed in more detail for loans representing 43.4% of the pool
and, in certain cases, revised based on additional information and/or property
characteristics. 

Approximately 90% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as follows:
10.3% in 2010, 0.2% in 2011 and 19.9% in 2012, 3.1% in 2013, and 56.4% in 2015.
Fitch identified 53 Loans of Concern (12.4%) within the pool, 11 of which (3.2%)
are specially serviced. Of the specially serviced loans, two (0.5%) are current.


Losses are expected on five (8.7%) of the loans within the Top 15: three (4%) of
these loans are expected to default during the term, while losses on the
remaining two loans (4.7%) are expected at maturity. Loss severities associated
with these loans range from 3% to 36%. The largest contributors to loss are as
follows: Cross Creek Shopping Center (1.6%), Bently Green/Sandpiper - Milestone
(1.6%), and Ashwood-Southfield Portfolio (1.3%). 

Cross Creek Shopping Center is secured by a 363,333 square foot (sf) anchored
retail center in Memphis, TN, approximately 20 miles southeast of downtown
Memphis. The property is represented by a strong national tenant base, including
Home Depot (rated 'BBB+' by Fitch) (28.3%), Kroger (rated 'BBB') (17.6%), Babies
R Us (11.6%), and Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (9.6%). These tenants have leases that
expire in 2017, 2016, 2012, and 2010, respectively. Property occupancy has
declined to 90% as of second quarter-2009 (2Q'09) from 100% at origination,
which has resulted in a decline of the DSCR from 1.24x at year-end 2008 to 1.09x
as of 2Q'09. In addition, approximately 13.5% and 8.5% of the NRA will expire in
2011 and 2012, respectively. Fitch expects that the loan has a higher
probability of defaulting during the term due to the decline in occupancy from
origination, location within a market which continues to feel the systemic
effects of the weak economy, and cash flow that would be unable to service the
debt should continued declines to income occur. 

Bentley Green/Sandpiper - Milestone consists of an 820-unit apartment complex in
Jacksonville, FL. Property performance in 2007 and 2008 decreased from issuance
as a result of the poor economy and its effect on rental demand in the
Jacksonville region. The Jacksonville multifamily market as of 2Q'09 reported a
vacancy of 16.9% and an average asking rent of $761/unit. The subject's average
in-place rent of $770/unit is in line with the market rates. The sponsor has
been successful in improving occupancy throughout 2009. Occupancy as of 2Q'09
increased to 92%, from 85% at year-end 2008. Fitch expects that the loan may
default at maturity as cash flow is not expected to increase to a level that
would meet Fitch's refinance criteria. 

Ashwood-Southfield Portfolio consists of a 334,086 sf, two-property office
portfolio, located in Atlanta, GA, and Southfield, MI. Both markets have been
particularly hard hit by the recession. Atlanta and Detroit have experienced a
significant increase in overall office vacancies and an erosion of market rents.
The portfolio's Atlanta property is in the North Atlanta submarket, which is
reporting a vacancy of 27% and asking rents of $17.30 psf as of 2Q'09. The
Detroit property is located in the Farmington Hills submarket, which is
reporting a vacancy of 18% and asking rents of $16.59 psf. The portfolio was 91%
occupied as of 2Q'09 with an average in-place rent of $16.37 psf. Fitch expects
the loan has a higher probability of defaulting during the term due to the poor
market fundamentals the portfolio is subjected to, in addition to future tenant
rollover. 

Fitch has downgraded, removed from Rating Watch Negative, and assigned Loss
Severity (LS) Ratings and Outlooks to the following classes as indicated: 

--$216 million class A-J to 'AA/LS3' from 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$18.6 million class B to 'AA/LS5' from 'AA+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$41 million class C to 'A/LS5' from 'AA'; Outlook Negative;

setting up a second straight week of gains, as upbeat retail
news reinforced hopes for strong sales in the key holiday
season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) shares supported the Dow industrials
after the media giant posted late on Thursday profit and
revenue that beat analysts' expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retailer shares rose as department store operator JC Penney
Co Inc (JCP.N) said earnings for the holiday quarter could beat
estimates, while clothing retailer Abercrombie  Fitch Co
(ANF.N) posted better-than-expected results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer discretionary shares led the way even as the
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary November Surveys of
Consumers showed U.S. consumer confidence fell to its weakest
level in three months amid grim expectations for job and income
prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think people were paying more attention to JC Penney and
Abercrombie  Fitch as indicative examples of people's
sentiment toward retail," said Michael James, senior trader at
Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JC Penney rose 7.2 percent to $31.50 and Abercrombie 
Fitch climbed 9.4 percent to $40.21. For more news on these
companies, see [ID:nN13462737] and [ID:nN13328098]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 84.49 points,
or 0.83 percent, to 10,281.96. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index

Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC gained 18.68 points, or 0.87
percent, to 2,167.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wedbush Morgan's James also pointed to a slide in the U.S.
dollar as supporting a rise in stocks, as investors take
advantage of the greenback's weakness to invest in commodities
and equities. The energy .GSPE and materials .GSPM sectors
of the SP 500 outperformed the benchmark index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar weakened as the U.S. trade deficit widened in
September by an unexpectedly large 18.2 percent, the most in
more than 10 years.  For a story on the U.S. economy, see
[ID:nN13463684]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares rose 4.3 percent to $30.29 after it posted a
larger-than-expected rise in both quarterly profit and revenue,
as strong results from its cable business helped it overcome a
disappointing stretch for its film studio. [ID:nN12432390].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(Disney) is a big name that is very easy for large
portfolio managers to continue to buy on good results, and I
think you're seeing the fruits of that today," James said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brokerage upgrades lifted shares of Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O)
and Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N). Juniper shot up 6 percent to
$26.18 and chipmaker Qualcomm rose 2.3 percent to $45.89 and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has placed the following two classes of J.P. Morgan Chase
Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2001-A, on Rating Watch Negative: 

--$3.4 million class E 'AAA'; 

--$5.1 million class F 'AA'. 

The placement on Rating Watch Negative is the result of recurring interest
shortfalls hitting class F and the potential of class E to also incur
shortfalls. Fitch does not expect the shortfalls incurred by class F to be
recovered due to the high concentration of loans (64% of the remaining pool) in
special servicing. 

Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch status as information on the specially
serviced loans is received.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon called the idea that any bank is too big to fail "ethically bankrupt" and said regulators should have the power to wind down even the largest lenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If some unforeseen circumstance should put this firm at risk of collapse, I believe we should be allowed to fail," Dimon wrote on Friday in The Washington Post. "Global economic growth requires the services of big financial firms. It also requires that big financial firms be allowed to fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets and is considered by many the healthiest of the country's four largest traditional commercial banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, many analysts have viewed JPMorgan, American International Group Inc, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and others as too large to be allowed to fail, fearing the impact on markets and economies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon argued against caps on banks' size, saying increased scale can benefit customers, shareholders and the economy by permitting better products to be delivered fast and cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He advocated a regulatory system that would ensure that even the biggest banks could fail "in a way that does not put taxpayers or the broader economy at risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said regulators deserve authority to manage failures of large financial institutions, including the ability to replace management, sell assets, and wipe out shareholders and even unsecured creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International cooperation is also necessary, he said, because of the global impact of a major failure. He pointed to the many multinational companies, not just in banking, that operate around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "too big to fail" idea is "politically, economically and ethically bankrupt," Dimon wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner recently put it, 'No financial system can operate efficiently if financial institutions and investors assume that government will protect them from the consequences of failure,'" Dimon went on. "The term 'too big to fail' must be excised from our vocabulary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said Friday it
restarted earlier this week a vacuum distillation unit (VDU) at its 238,600
barrel-per-day refinery in Joliet, Illinois, after maintenance work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The work is complete and the unit was restarted earlier this week. All
operations are normal," Kevin Allexon, a spokesman for the oil major, said
in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allexon said the work on the unit was scheduled maintenance, adding
that earlier reports and market talk that the Oct. 21 shutdown was
unplanned are not accurate.

operate around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "too big to fail" idea is "politically, economically
and ethically bankrupt," Dimon wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner recently put it,
'No financial system can operate efficiently if financial
institutions and investors assume that government will protect
them from the consequences of failure,'" Dimon went on. "The
term 'too big to fail' must be excised from our vocabulary."

&lt;p&gt;  ANN ARBOR, MI, Nov 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Adeona Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMEX: AEN) announced today the publication
in the journal Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism of results of a 160-patient,
six-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial using
the company's oral dnaJP1 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
The results of the study were originally presented at the 2008 American
College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting. The study was sponsored by the
National Institutes of Health (NIH).

    Oral dnaJP1 is an orally active epitope-specific immunotherapeutic
molecule derived from a family of heat shock proteins that contribute to
autoimmune inflammation in RA patients.

    The publication entitled, "Epitope-specific immunotherapy of rheumatoid
arthritis: Clinical responsiveness occurs with immune deviation and relies
on the expression of a cluster of molecules associated with T cell
tolerance in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot phase II trial,"
can be found in the current issue of Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism, Vol. 60(11),
pages 3207-3216, with related editorial at page A21.

    The Clinical Trial:

    The clinical trial was an 11 center, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial of daily oral dnaJP1 (25mg capsule) versus
placebo in 160 rheumatoid arthritis patients with active disease, disease
onset of less than 5 years and that also demonstrated reactivity to the
dnaJP1 peptide by in vitro analysis.

    Results of the published study showed the following:

    1. dnaJP1 appeared to be safe and well-tolerated;

    2. There was a significant reduction in the percentage of T cells
producing the porinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-alpha) (p &lt; 0.0007);

    3. The primary efficacy end point (meeting the American College of
Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria at least once on day 112, 140, or
168) showed a difference between treatment groups (p=0.09) that became
significant in post hoc analysis using generalized estimating equations
(p=0.04).

    4. Differences in clinical responses were also found between treatment
groups on day 140 and at follow up, indicative a durable response
following discontinuation of therapy.

    5. Post hoc analysis showed that the combination of dnaJP1 and the
commercially available RA agent, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), was superior to
the combination of HCQ and placebo, demonstrating potential synergistic of
dnaJP1 with HCQ.

    Max Lyon, Adeona's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We
are pleased that this important study is receiving the scientific
attention it deserves and believe that dnaJP1 has significant potential
to improve the course of treatment for RA patients. We are currently
engaged in a variety of activities required to support further clinical
trials of dnaJP1 while simultaneously actively seeking U.S. and
international licensing and corporate partnerships for this potentially
important new therapy for RA."

    Business Development Opportunity

    Adeona is actively seeking U.S. and international corporate partners
interested in assisting in the further development and commercialization
of this novel and potentially important new therapeutic approach for RA.
Interested parties should contact Max Lyon, Chief Executive Officer and
President at (734) 332-7800 x 36 or by email at mlyon@adeonapharma.com.

    About Rheumatoid Arthritis

    Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to
pain, stiffness, swelling and limitation in the motion and function of
multiple joints. If left untreated, RA may produce serious destruction of
joints that frequently leads to permanent disability. Although the joints
are the principal body part affected by RA, inflammation may develop in
other organs as well. The disease currently affects over two million
Americans, almost one percent of the population, and is two to three times
more prevalent in women. Onset can occur at any point in life but is most
frequently manifested in the fourth and fifth decades of life, with most
patients developing the disease between the ages of 35 and 50. Over 20
million people suffer from rheumatoid arthritis worldwide, and the global
market is estimated at over $6.3 billion. DMARDs, including biologics such
as Enbrel(R), Humira(R), Cimzia(R), and Remicade(R), accounted for nearly
$5.0 billion of that figure. The global market for RA therapies has been
estimated at $13 billion.

    About Oral dnaJP1

    Oral dnaJP1 is an epitope-specific immunotherapy for RA patients. Oral
dnaJP1 is a heat shock protein (hsp)-derived peptide which was previously
identified as a contributor of T-cell-mediated inflammation in RA Immune
responses to hsp and are often found at sites of inflammation and have an
initially amplifying effect that needs to be down-regulated to prevent
tissue damage. The mechanisms for this regulation involve T-cells with
regulatory functions that are specific for hsp-derived antigens. This
regulatory function is one of the key components of a "molecular dimmer"
whose physiologic function is to modulate inflammation independently from
its trigger. This function is impaired in autoimmunity and could be
restored for therapeutic purposes.

    The mechanistic hypothesis is that mucosal tolerization to oral dnaJP1
could determine immune tolerization primarily of T-cells and secondarily
of APC. The effects of immune tolerance are initially peptide-specific but
affect secondarily non-epitope specific pathways. Immune tolerance could
translate into clinical benefit.

    About Adeona Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

    Adeona Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMEX: AEN) is a specialty pharmaceutical
company dedicated to the awareness, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of
zinc deficiency and chronic copper toxicity in the mature population.
Adeona believes that these conditions may contribute to the progression of
debilitating degenerative diseases, including, Dry Age-Related Macular
Degeneration (Dry AMD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) in susceptible persons. Using Adeona's proprietary,
modified oral zinc delivery technologies, Adeona is preparing to initiate
the first clinical trial of oral zinc therapy for the once-a-day dietary
management of AD and MCI. Adeona is also developing a number of late-stage
clinical drug candidates for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and
multiple sclerosis. Adeona recently launched its Copperproof(TM) Test
Panel through its HartLab subsidiary, which is intended to provide
accurate and timely information to physicians regarding the copper and
zinc metabolic status of their Alzheimer's disease and cognitive
impairment patients. For further information, please visit

modest revenues and its future success will likely depend upon its
ability to successfully introduce and market new specialty diagnostic
assays to generate additional revenues. Important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in
Adeona's forward-looking statements include, among others, a failure of
Adeona's product candidates to be demonstrably safe and effective, a
failure to obtain regulatory approval for the company's products or to
comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, regulatory limitations
relating to the company's ability to promote or commercialize its
products for awareness, prevention, diagnosis or treatment of zinc
deficiency and chronic copper toxicity, a lack of acceptance of Adeona's
product candidates in the marketplace, a failure of the company to become
or remain profitable, that we will continue to meet the continued listing
requirements of the American Stock Exchange (which, unlike other
exchanges, does not require us to maintain any minimum bid price with
respect our stock but does require us to maintain a minimum of $4 million
in stockholders' equity during the current year, for example), our
inability to obtain the capital necessary to fund the company's research
and development activities, a loss of any of the company's key scientists
or management personnel, and other factors described in Adeona's report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, Forms 10-Q for quarters
ending in 2009 and any other filings with the SEC. No forward-looking

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) sees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;winter heating demand having a limited effect in reducing a global fuel inventory glut, adding there needs to be a pick-up in industrial and transport demand to bring stocks back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Inventories are at record highs around the globe. There is a lot of supply that has to come off the water, get into the system and be consumed," said Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson in an interview with Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of Pacific Rim political leaders who warned an economic recovery was fragile, said a recovery in demand for passenger, freight and power generation fuels -- all of which were linked to an economic rebound -- was critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to have to be demand-driven. That's what it's going to take to pull that inventory level back into a more normal balance," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Quite frankly, looking at the winter season in the northern hemisphere, even if we have a relatively normal winter, we would still have a fair amount of supply."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil prices are holding near $80 a barrel, having doubled in a rally from under $40 at the end of last year after plunging during the financial crisis, but bulging inventories are keeping gains in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diesel and heating fuel in floating storage have increased this year to unprecedented levels as the global recession decimated demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But demand for oil products in Asia Pacific will grow steadily, Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Asia Pacific is going to see the highest level of demand growth over the next 20-25 years from a fuel products standpoint. This region is going to grow about 1.8 percent annually, significantly above the rest of the world, and it's reflective of the economic growth that will go on for the next two decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, current supply to the Asian region is adequate, he added. "In fact, refinery supply today is a little bit long, not just here, but also globally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GHANA INTEREST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson would not drawn on whether $80 a barrel for oil was too high or low, and he said price levels did not have a bearing on Exxon's long-term investment spending targets. Last month Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company with a market value of about $345 billion, posted a 68 percent slump in quarterly net profit to $4.73 billion, or 98 cents per share, missing Wall Street estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of acquisitions, Tillerson said Exxon was in discussions to buy a stake in two large offshore blocks in West Africa's Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We confirm that we are engaged in those discussions," he said, but declined to provide further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said the firm was in the process of completing "definitive agreements" for Iraq's prized West Qurna field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, an Exxon-led consortium including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) beat rival French, Russian and Chinese groups to secure initial rights to develop West Qurna, which has reserves of 8.7 billion barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHIFT IN THE CLIMATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, skeptical in the past about green energy and having supported research that questioned climate change, is now facing regulation from a controversial U.S. climate change bill that cleared its first hurdle in the U.S. Senate last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said it would have a "dramatic" effect on U.S. oil refiners. According to research studies, about 10-15 percent of refining capacity would have to be shut down, leading to imbalances in U.S. refined product supplies, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, carbon trading was not a workable solution, due to its high price volatility and the huge amount of red tape involved in overseeing the system, Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're advocating a revenue-neutral carbon tax, where the revenues from the tax is channeled back in the economy through decreases in payroll taxes, which would protect jobs," he said, adding that this would offer a more transparent price signal to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On clean energy alternatives, Tillerson said that algae as a biofuel held the greatest promise. But its $600 million research investment, conducted in partnership with a genome company, would only yield results in more than a decade, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments will meet in Copenhagen next month to try to agree a broad and inclusive pact to fight climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Neil Chatterjee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a full schedule on tap, the 2009 Microsoft PDC (Professional Developers Conference) next week will tout efforts ranging from the company's Windows Azure cloud platform to plans for programming languages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Session descriptions for the Los Angeles event reveal topics such as "Architecting and Developing for Windows Azure," "Future Directions for C# and Visual Basic" and "Software + Services Identity Roadmap Update."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Check out InfoWorld's coverage of Microsoft's SharePoint 2009 conference. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduced at last year's PDC, Azure remains a hot topic for the company, based on this year's PDC schedule. One session, entitled "Bridging the Gap from On-Premises to the Cloud," invites attendees to hear " how Microsoft views the future of cloud computing and how it is starting to deliver this vision in the Windows Azure platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Learn how applications can be written to preserve much of the investment in code, programming models, and tools, yet adapt to the scale-out, distributed, and virtualized environment of the cloud," the session description reads. Migrating applications to Azure also will be covered at PDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to hearing C# and Visual Basic plans, attendees interested in programming languages can learn about Axum, which provides a .Net language for &#160;"safe and scalable" concurrency, the PDC Web site states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axum is a project from Microsoft's Parallel Computing Platform. "It's a language that builds on the principles of isolation, agents, and message-passing to increase application safety, responsiveness, scalability and developer productivity," according to the PDC site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A roadmap for the Silverlight rich Internet application platform will be detailed at PDC. Microsoft's M data and modeling language will be covered as well. "Explore the future of M, where DSL, schema, and lots of other great ideas come together as a single Web-centric data processing language," the PDC Web site states. XAML futures for .Net Framework, Silverlight, and tools will be covered in a separate session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft "Velocity" project, featuring distributed in-memory caching, is to be detailed at PDC. Velocity "will change how you think about scaling your Microsoft .Net-connected applications," a session description reads. Also on the roster of sessions is one entitled, "InferNet: Building Software with Intelligence." Infer.Net is a machine-learning framework for building .Net software that can adapt to a user, learn from examples or work with uncertain information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at PDC, Microsoft will discuss its SQL Server Modeling technology, formerly known as the Oslo modeling platform, Microsoft's Douglas Purdy, a software architect, revealed this week in a blog. But the transformation of Oslo has not sat well with some Microsoft observers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oslo seems to have gone from a potential new enterprise architect modeling platform to just a modeling tool and DSL stack for SQL Server. This ignores all those large enterprise IT departments with heterogeneous data platforms," said one person commenting in the blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A community technology preview featuring SQL Server Modeling technologies is set for release at PDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conference attendees can hear about two concurrency tools in Microsoft Research: Cuzz, for "Concurrency Fuzzing," which improves concurrency coverage, and FeatherLite, for data-rate detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a &#160;panel session is planned on Microsoft perspectives on the future of programming, featuring persons such as Don Box, a Microsoft Distinguished Engineer working on declarative languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft ASP.Net futures will be discussed, covering changes coming with ASP.Net 4. A session entitled "The Future of Garbage Collection" is planned, featuring the creator of the Microsoft Common Language Runtime, Patrick Dussud. "Hear how the [garbage collection] evolved and what the future looks like for the top-of-the-line memory management infrastructure of .NET," the PDC Web site states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic binding in C#4 will be covered at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the heritage of C# is as a static programming language, many objects in the world are more dynamic, whether originating from COM, JavaScript, Python, or other places. Interacting with that world from C# used to be painful and error prone, but C# 4 provides deep integration of dynamic binding into the language," according to the PDC sessions page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft at PDC will cover its application server technology plans. "Hear how Microsoft is evolving its application server technologies to address the challenges of building, deploying, and managing composite applications in Windows Server and Windows Azure," according to a description of a session entitled, "Microsoft Application Server Technologies: Present and Future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company previously has discussed its "Dublin" technology as application server extensions for Windows. Also on tap at PDC is discussion on how the Microsoft BizTalk system integration platform aligns with application server plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Visual Studio 2010 platform also will be covered in several sessions at PDC. Microsoft SQL Server 2008 StreamInsight, a platform for rich data processing over real-time event streams, will be covered as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft developer technologies take center stage at PDC," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Britain's Justin Rose and Sweden's Mathias Gronberg shared the third round lead with Americans Justin Leonard and George McNeill at the Disney Classic at Lake Buena Vista in Florida on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quartet head into Sunday's final round on 13 under-par at 203 but the competition is wide open with a total of 13 players within three shots of the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the leading four it was Gronberg who delivered the most impressive round on Saturday with a six under 66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was nice. I played pretty good the front nine. I didn't make a couple of possible birdie putts that I had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But the back nine was great. I just kept my head down and focused on the pack of trying to make some birdies and catch some players," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gronberg shared the best score of the day with American Will MacKenzie who pushed himself into contention two shots off the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose is searching for his first victory on the PGA Tour in his 149th start and it is over two years since he went into the final day on the tour with the lead or a share of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is about not thinking that you're leading because I certainly don't see any pressure out there tomorrow," said Rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't feel like I'm leading the tournament because there's so many guys in and around the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm just one of those guys, so for me to put a number on it that much difference right now with how many guys are in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically my mindset on Sunday will be just to go out, be confident and play good. Hopefully it all clicks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Swede, Carl Pettersson is a shot behind the lead while Canada's Stephen Ames is in the chasing pack of six players at 10 under-par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Simon Evans in Miami; Editing by Greg Stutchbury)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft late on Friday confirmed that an unpatched vulnerability exists in Windows 7, but downplayed the problem, saying most users would be protected from attack by blocking two ports at the firewall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a security advisory , Microsoft acknowledged that a bug in SMB (Server Message Block), a Microsoft-made network file- and print-sharing protocol, could be used by attackers to cripple Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zero-day vulnerability was first reported by Canadian researcher Laurent Gaffie last Wednesday, when he revealed the bug and posted proof-of-concept attack code to the Full Disclosure security mailing list and his blog. According to Gaffie, exploiting the flaw crashes Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 systems so thoroughly that the only recourse is to manually power off the computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Microsoft only said it was investigating Gaffie's reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then on Friday, it took the next step and issued the advisory. "Microsoft is aware of public, detailed exploit code that would cause a system to stop functioning or become unreliable," Dave Forstrom, a spokesman for Microsoft security group, said in an e-mail. "The company is not aware of attacks to exploit the reported vulnerability at this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forstrom echoed Gaffie's comments earlier in the week that while an exploit could incapacitate a PC, the vulnerability could not be used by hackers to install malicious code on a Windows 7 system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both SMBv1 and its successor, SMBv2, contain the bug. "Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows 2000 are not affected," assured Forstrom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attacks could be aimed at any browser, not just Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft warned. After tricking users into visiting a malicious site or a previously-compromised domain, hackers could feed them specially-crafted URIs (uniform resource identifier), and then crash their PCs with malformed SMB packets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it may patch the problem, but didn't spell out a timetable or commit to an out-of-cycle update before the next regularly-scheduled Patch Tuesday of Dec. 8. Instead, the company suggested users block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. Doing so, however, would disable browsers as well as a host of critical services, including network file-sharing and IT group policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaffie's vulnerability was the first zero-day reported and confirmed by Microsoft in Windows 7 since the new operating system went on sale Oct. 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greene Reunites with Co-Star from Classic 1979 Ad
PITTSBURGH--(Business Wire)--
"Mean" Joe Greene, star defensive tackle for the Pittsburgh Steelers during the
team`s first four Super Bowl championships, was honored before the
Steelers-Bengals game on Nov. 15 for some of his most celebrated work OFF the
field. 

This year marks the 30th anniversary of the iconic "Mean Joe" TV ad for
Coca-Cola, which featured the feared lineman limping down a tunnel to the locker
room, followed closely by then-nine-year-old Tommy Okon, who offered a battered
Greene his ice-cold bottle of Coca-Cola. As a gesture of thanks, Greene tossed
his coveted jersey to the boy, who stood in amazement after encountering his
hero. 

For his role in the commercial, Greene earned the prestigious Clio award in
1980, recognizing creative excellence in advertising. However, he wasn`t
available to accept the award at the time and never received the hardware during
the ensuing 30 years. Coca-Cola recently secured the trophy and joined Steelers
President Art Rooney II in presenting it to Greene in a special pre-game
ceremony at Heinz Field. As part of the event, Greene and Okon, the former child
actor who co-starred in the commercial, reunited for the first time in years. 

"It was a special moment when we were able to finally present this Clio award to
Joe," said Bea Perez, senior vice president of integrated marketing, Coca-Cola
North America. "His work in our 1979 commercial tugged at people`s heartstrings
and created tremendous affection for both Joe and Coca-Cola. His accolades are
well-deserved and long-overdue, and we`re proud to help get the award in the
hands of its rightful owner." 

"The Coca-Cola commercial was a defining point in my life," said Greene.
"Before, football fans knew who I was and talked about my performance on the
field. Afterward, all of America seemed to know who I was and people still talk
to me about it nearly every day. It was a great experience, and finally
receiving the Clio is the icing on the cake." 

Since its original airing, the ad has been universally lauded. TV Guide named it
one of the best commercials of all time, and it was listed among the most
innovative, creative and effective commercials by the American Association of
Advertising Agencies. Tens of thousands of people sent letters to The Coca-Cola
Company in response to the ad, leading Coca-Cola to launch a promotion called
"Win the Shirt Off My Back" which gave replica jerseys to fans by the thousands.
Hollywood producers also capitalized on its popularity and developed a
made-for-TV-movie called "The Steeler and the Pittsburgh Kid." In it, Greene and
his fictional football team adopt a nine-year-old boy who dreams of one day
becoming quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. 

In fact, the ad struck such a chord with fans in the United States, Coca-Cola
repeated the concept with sports standouts in nations around the world,
including Italy, Thailand, Argentina and Brazil. In January 2009, Coke Zero took
a new twist on the beloved spot, creating an ad featuring current Steelers great
Troy Polamalu which debuted during the Super Bowl. 

"Mean" Joe Greene

Greene, who made up one quarter of the vaunted Steel Curtain in the 1970s, has
six championship rings with the Pittsburgh Steelers - four as a player and two
as a special assistant for player personnel. Following his Hall of Fame playing
career, Greene spent 16 years as an assistant coach for the Steelers, Dolphins
and Cardinals.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Canadian Stephen Ames won the Disney Classic on Sunday after triumphing in a three-way sudden death playoff with George McNeill and Justin Leonard at Lake Buena Vista, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonard was close to winning the tournament on the final hole. He needed a birdie to clinch the victory but his 16-foot birdie putt spun out of the cup to send the event into a playoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although McNeill found the rough with his drive on the first playoff hole, the par four 18th, he recovered thanks to an excellent chip with his third stroke and it was Leonard who was eliminated with his bogey after missing a 12-foot putt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That left Ames and McNeill to go head-to-head on the par three 15th. When the American failed from four feet with the ball spinning out of the cup, Ames kept his cool for a winning par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victory for the Trinidad-born Ames is his second in this event in three years and his fourth PGA Tour triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Simon Evans in Miami; Editing by John Mehaffey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Los productos DASANI y Coca-Cola debutan en la primera generaci&#243;n de PET
pl&#225;sticos fabricados parcialmente a partir de plantas
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company anunci&#243; hoy que las bebidas gaseosas en sus innovadores
envases PlantBottle est&#225;n comenzando a verse en los estantes de las tiendas en
mercados selectos de todo el mundo abriendo paso al camino de la compa&#241;&#237;a hacia
el objetivo de producir 2 mil millones de botellas especiales PET pl&#225;sticas para
fines de 2010. 

Las botellas pl&#225;sticas PET PlantBottle est&#225;n fabricadas parcialmente a partir de
plantas, lo que reduce para la compa&#241;&#237;a la dependencia de recursos no renovables
como el petr&#243;leo. Otro beneficio es que la botella es completamente reciclable,
y la investigaci&#243;n preliminar indica que desde el cultivo de los materiales
vegetales hasta la producci&#243;n de la resina, la huella de carbono del envase
PlantBottle es mucho menor que la de las botellas fabricadas con PET
tradicional. 

"Hoy, estamos dando un paso trascendental en nuestro camino hacia el envasado
sostenible; The Coca-Cola Company es la primera empresa en llegar al mercado con
botellas pl&#225;sticas PET reciclables, fabricadas parcialmente a partir de
plantas", coment&#243; Muhtar Kent, presidente y director ejecutivo de The Coca-Cola
Company. "Desde las marcas de Coca Cola en Copenhague hasta el agua DASANI en el
oeste de los Estados Unidos, estamos comenzando a implementar la primera
generaci&#243;n de botellas del futuro". 

En todo Dinamarca, las botellas de Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light y Coca-Cola Zero
de 500 ml y de 2 litros est&#225;n actualmente disponibles en los envases
PlantBottle. Una variedad de productos, entre ellos Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fresca y
DASANI estar&#225;n disponibles en el oeste de Canad&#225; en formato PlantBottle a partir
de diciembre y para los Juegos Ol&#237;mpicos de Invierno de Vancouver 2010. En
cuanto a los mercados selectos del oeste de los Estados Unidos, incluidos
Seattle, San Francisco y Los &#193;ngeles, el envase PlantBottle se utilizar&#225; para
marcas de bebidas con gas y DASANI en varios tama&#241;os a partir de enero. Se han
comenzado a planificar lanzamientos futuros en otros mercados, entre ellos
Brasil, Jap&#243;n y M&#233;xico y en la Expo Mundial 2010 en Shangh&#225;i, China. 

Tambi&#233;n se presentar&#225;n muestras de PlantBottle en el evento para inversores de
la compa&#241;&#237;a: "A Growing World of Refreshment, a 2020 Vision", (El creciente
mundo de las bebidas gaseosas; una visi&#243;n para el 2020) que comienza hoy en
Atlanta. 

"PlantBottle es precisamente el tipo de innovaci&#243;n que demuestra c&#243;mo las
empresas pueden ayudar a abordar el cambio clim&#225;tico y a reducir el estr&#233;s
causado sobre nuestros recursos naturales preciosos", coment&#243; Kate Krebs,
directora de recursos sostenibles para el grupo The Climate Group. "Si bien
Coca-Cola reci&#233;n est&#225; comenzando a introducir su PET pl&#225;stica a base de plantas,
esta es una soluci&#243;n revolucionaria que tiene un potencial de beneficios
significativos a largo plazo". 

El envase PlantBottle se fabrica actualmente a trav&#233;s de un proceso que
convierte a la ca&#241;a de az&#250;car y a la melaza, un subproducto de la producci&#243;n de
az&#250;car, en un componente clave para el PET pl&#225;stico. La ca&#241;a de az&#250;car utilizada
proviene de cosechas predominantemente de agricultura de lluvia que fueron
procesadas para la obtenci&#243;n de etanol, y no de az&#250;car refinada. Finalmente, el
objetivo de la compa&#241;&#237;a es utilizar desechos no alimenticios de origen vegetal,
como trozos de madera o tallos de ma&#237;z, para producir botellas pl&#225;sticas PET
reciclables. 

"Coca-Cola actualmente obtiene la materia prima para su PlantBottle de
proveedores de Brasil, donde terceros partes han verificado que se lleven a cabo
las mejores pr&#225;cticas agr&#237;colas", coment&#243; el Dr. Jason Clay, vicepresidente
s&#233;nior de transformaci&#243;n de mercados del Fondo Mundial para la Naturaleza (World
Wildlife Fund, WWF). "Preservar los recursos naturales a trav&#233;s de la
agricultura sostenible es esencial para empresas como Coca-Cola a medida que
buscan formas de aliviar los desaf&#237;os ambientales". 

Si bien el componente de base biol&#243;gica representa aproximadamente hasta un 30%
del pl&#225;stico PET resultante en los envases PlantBottle, el porcentaje var&#237;a para
las botellas que adem&#225;s contienen PET reciclado. Por ejemplo, Dinamarca utiliza
contenido reciclado en sus envases PlantBottle. La combinaci&#243;n de contenido
reciclado y de origen vegetal compone el 65% del material, con un 50%
proveniente de material reciclado y 15% de material de origen vegetal. 

En cuanto a los envases PlantBottle en los Estados Unidos y Canad&#225;, hasta un 30%
del contenido en los pl&#225;sticos PET proviene de plantas. 

"Si bien la introducci&#243;n de PlantBottle y su lanzamiento al mercado colocan a
The Coca-Cola Company a la vanguardia en cuanto a innovaci&#243;n en bioenvases,
continuamos esforz&#225;ndonos para crear una botella a&#250;n mejor", coment&#243; Scott
Vitters, director de envases sostenibles de The Coca-Cola Company. "Nuestra
visi&#243;n es continuar con la innovaci&#243;n hasta alcanzar una botella que est&#233;
fabricada completamente a partir de material de desechos vegetales y a la vez
sea completamente reciclable".

&lt;p&gt;The deck headline and the third sentence of the ninth paragraph of the Computerworld (US) story, "Microsoft confirms first Windows 7 zero-day bug," which posted to the newswire Saturday, have been corrected to reflect that a workaround to the bug disables some services and not browsers. The deck and the ninth paragraph now read, respectively: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urges users to block ports until a patch is ready, but workaround cripples services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it may patch the problem, but didn't spell out a timetable or commit to an out-of-cycle update before the next regularly-scheduled Patch Tuesday of Dec. 8. Instead, the company suggested users block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. Doing so, however, would disable a host of critical services, including network file-sharing and IT group policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Spokesman says Allen won't change role at Vulcan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Allen survived previous cancer bout
 (Adds Vulcan spokesman comment, details on Allen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Nov 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
co-founder Paul Allen has been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma and has begun treatment, a spokesman for his
investment company said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Employees of Vulcan Inc, which Allen formed in 1986 to
manage his business dealings and philanthropic activity, were
informed of Allen's illness in a company e-mail on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He's feeling pretty good, he's remaining very active at
Vulcan and his other holdings and interests and he has no plans
to cut back on any of that," said Vulcan spokesman David
Postman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Postman said Allen's diagnosis was recent and that
treatment has already begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allen, the 32nd richest person in the world according to
Forbes magazine, co-founded Microsoft in 1975 with Bill Gates
and resigned as an executive in 1983. He was diagnosed with
Hodgkin's disease in 1983 but his cancer was successfully
treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that originates
in the lymphatic system, which is the body's disease-fighting
network. It is a far more common disease than the related but
distinct Hodgkin's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2009 there were nearly 66,000 new cases of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma and 19,500 deaths, according to the National Cancer
Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through Vulcan, Allen has been a high-profile investor in
his home town of Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He owns the Seattle Seahawks American football team and is
a minority owner of the Seattle Sounders soccer team. He
created the Experience Music Project pop museum in the city and
is leading the development of a run-down area near Seattle's
Lake Union into a center for biotech research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allen is also chairman of cable company Charter
Communications Inc CHTRQ.PK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Gabriel Madway and Bill Rigby; Editing

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced on Monday the release and open-sourcing of its .Net Micro Framework 4.0, which provides a .Net-based development and execution environment for small devices. But the TCP/IP stack and cryptography stack were omitted &#160;from the open source effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 4.0 is available under an Apache 2.0 license. Microsoft still intends to remain actively involved in development of the framework, said Microsoft's Peter Galli, senior open source community manager, in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Recently, the Microsoft-backed CodePlex Foundation for open source projects outlined project submission guidelines. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the license will allow customers to take the code and make specialized versions to fit their needs, customers told us they&#160;wanted Microsoft to stay involved to avoid any possible&#160;fragmentation of the platform," Galli said. The Net Micro Framework 4.0 effort was revealed at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the open source move, developers get access to source code for almost all of the product, including base class libraries and CLR (Common Language Runtime) code. The libraries contain implementations of primary functionality that managed applications call into for communications, system functions like threading, UI and more, according to Microsoft's Colin Miller, program manager for .Net Micro Framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However,&#160;both the TCP/IP stack&#160;and cryptography libraries are not included in the source code," Galli said. "Program Manager Colin Miller told me this was because&#160;the TCP/IP stack is&#160;third-party software that Microsoft licenses from EBSNet, so we&#160;do not have the rights to distribute that source code. If someone&#160;needs to access the source code for the TCP/IP stack, they can contact EBSNet directly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As for the cryptography libraries, they are not included in source code because they are used outside of the scope of the .Net Micro Framework. Customers who need to have access to the code in the cryptography functions will find that these libraries can be replaced," Galli quoted&#160; Miller as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analyst applauded the open source move but cited the TCP/IP omission as a drawback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an interesting decision on Microsoft's part and one that seems to acknowledge the benefits of open source in terms of visibility and distribution," said analyst Stephen O'Grady, of RedMonk. "That said, the lack of an included TCP/IP library is likely to throttle interest, because even the "resource-constrained devices" that are the [framework's] targets must function in a network context."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to establish a core technology team for the framework made up of Microsoft and non-Microsoft contributors. A community also is being formed to help shape direction of the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft open-sources .Net Micro development framework," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted the Office 2010 Beta to its developer and IT subscription sites today, another clue that it will soon offer the preview to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network) and TechNet sites now host the Office 2010 Beta in 32- and 64-bit editions, which can be downloaded by the developers and IT professionals who have subscriptions to those services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TechNet, for example, has posted the downloads here (Windows Live ID login required), while the MSDN site sports a message saying that the beta is now available. The TechNet downloads are for Office Professional Plus 2010, an edition that will be available only to enterprises and organizations that purchase licenses in volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other builds of the Office 2010 Beta, which have already leaked to the Internet , can be found on numerous file-sharing sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is expected to open the beta to all users sometime this week. It has already prepped a revamped version of its Office.com site -- still in beta as of Monday -- to offer three different editions , including the consumer-oriented Home and Business 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has also posted additional information about the beta, including the hardware requirements necessary to run its newest suite, on its Web properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will provide previews of three of the five editions it intends to ship in the first half of 2010: Home and Business, Professional and Professional Plus. The first two will be available at retail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft shut down its earlier test, dubbed "Technical Preview," and told users running that version to expect news of the public beta this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft kicks off its annual Professional Developers Conference (PDC) in Los Angeles today, and is expected to use that forum to unveil the public beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) unveiled goals on Monday that call for the revenue generated by the company and its bottlers to double to roughly $200 billion by 2020, with profit margins increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke also said it hopes to more than double the number of soft drink servings it sells to more than 3 billion per day by the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest soft drink maker discussed its targets for the next 10 years at a two-day investor meeting in Atlanta, its first such gathering in its hometown in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said the annual revenue growth rate implied by the 2020 goal is a little higher than the top end of Coke's standard long-term growth target, but he sought to assure investors and analysts that it is "definitely achievable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to take a lot of work. It's going to take some fantastic marketing and a lot of synergies to be powered back into marketing," Kent said. "But we believe our system has the capacity to achieve that trajectory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent said there were several worldwide trends that supported the accelerated growth in the medium- to long-term -- rising economic power of developing countries, increasing urbanization and a growing middle class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Chinese consumers drink an average of 8 servings of Coca-Cola per year, compared with 214 in the United States and 387 in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its trademark cola brand, Coca-Cola has 12 other brands that currently generate over $1 billion in retail sales, including Sprite, Fanta, Dasani water, Powerade sports drink and Georgia coffee. By 2020, Coke said it should have about 30 brands with sales of $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOCUS ON MARKETING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke derives more than three-quarters of its revenue from international markets, and is therefore able to offset falling sales in the United States with strong growth in emerging markets like India, China and Brazil. The company said last week it was ramping up investment in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrywide sales of carbonated soft drinks had been falling in the United States even before the recession slammed the brakes on consumer spending. Some consumers, taking heed of growing awareness of nutritional health, have opted for drinks such as bottled water, juice and tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition in the sagging U.S. market is about to heat up, since No. 2 soft drink maker PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) recently agreed to buy Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N and PepsiAmericas Inc PAS.N, its largest bottlers, in a bid to cut costs, after a decade of operating as separate companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke has staunchly defended its franchise business model in which it sells drink concentrate to separate bottlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company on Monday said strong brands, targeted marketing campaigns and new packages and price points would help drive growth. It also highlighted a marketing campaign it is planning for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company does not provide specific earnings forecasts, but has repeatedly said its long-term growth targets call for annual sales volume to increase 3 percent to 4 percent, revenue to increase 5 percent to 6 percent and earnings per share to increase at a high single-digit percentage rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The long term growth rates are appropriate (moving into 2010), but we're not content with them," said Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that if the company and bottlers achieve the 2020 goals, they would generate cumulative cash flow of $130 billion to $150 billion and would reinvest $32 billion to $37 billion in capital expenditures, with "quite a bit of cash available for other things, such as dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Coke reported lower-than-expected third-quarter revenue, hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar and said a weak economy would keep consumers under pressure next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares closed 0.5 percent higher at $56.74 on Monday. The shares have gained roughly 25 percent this year, outperforming a 14 percent increase for PepsiCo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing Bernard Orr and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

falling in the United States even before the recession slammed
the brakes on consumer spending. Some consumers, taking heed of
growing awareness of nutritional health, have opted for drinks
such as bottled water, juice and tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Competition in the sagging U.S. market is about to heat up,
since No. 2 soft drink maker PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) recently
agreed to buy Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N and
PepsiAmericas Inc PAS.N, its largest bottlers, in a bid to
cut costs, after a decade of operating as separate companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke has staunchly defended its franchise business model in
which it sells drink concentrate to separate bottlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company on Monday said strong brands, targeted
marketing campaigns and new packages and price points would
help drive growth. It also highlighted a marketing campaign it
is planning for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company does not provide specific earnings forecasts,
but has repeatedly said its long-term growth targets call for
annual sales volume to increase 3 percent to 4 percent, revenue
to increase 5 percent to 6 percent and earnings per share to
increase at a high single-digit percentage rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The long term growth rates are appropriate (moving into
2010), but we're not content with them," said Chief Financial
Officer Gary Fayard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that if the company and bottlers achieve the 2020
goals, they would generate cumulative cash flow of $130 billion
to $150 billion and would reinvest $32 billion to $37 billion
in capital expenditures, with "quite a bit of cash available
for other things, such as dividends, acquisitions and share
repurchases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Coke reported lower-than-expected third-quarter
revenue, hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar and said a weak
economy would keep consumers under pressure next year.
[ID:nN20380392]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke shares closed 0.5 percent higher at $56.74 on Monday.
The shares have gained roughly 25 percent this year,
outperforming a 14 percent increase for PepsiCo.

&lt;p&gt;Disney's A Christmas Carol Continues Strong Performance During Second Weekend in
IMAX(R) Theatres

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 16, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMAX Corporation IMAX Corporation
(Nasdaq:IMAX) (TSX:IMX) and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures today announced
that Disney's A Christmas Carol, the spectacular Disney Digital 3D(TM) holiday
release from director Robert Zemeckis and starring Jim Carrey, grossed $2.9
million from 182 IMAX(R) theatres domestically during its second weekend from
November 13th through November 15, 2009. The IMAX release registered 13% of the
film's total domestic second-weekend gross of $22.3 million on approximately 3%
of the screens. The film's domestic IMAX total is now at $8.7 million.

Internationally, the film's second-weekend IMAX gross was $635,000, up 16% over
its opening weekend, due in part to the addition of six more IMAX screens,
bringing the film's IMAX global cume to $10.2 million. There are 21 more
international IMAX locations scheduled to open the film in the weeks ahead.

Commenting on the announcement, Chuck Viane, president, Walt Disney Studios
Motion Pictures Distribution, said, "This is a great second-weekend result,
indicating that people are getting into the holiday mood. The IMAX release is
continuing to demonstrate a strong presence, and with the holidays just around
the corner, we anticipate the momentum to continue."

"The sustained second-weekend performance bodes well for the legs of the IMAX
release, especially when you consider our successful history with Robert
Zemeckis and our great partnership with Disney," said IMAX CEO Richard L.
Gelfond.

"The premium IMAX(R) 3D Experience really shows off Robert Zemeckis's unique
vision and we're pleased with these strong second-weekend results," added Greg
Foster, Chairman and President of IMAX Filmed Entertainment. "Disney is
continuing to do a great job of calling out IMAX in its global marketing
campaign, and we believe the momentum will continue to build through
Thanksgiving weekend."

Disney's A Christmas Carol: An IMAX 3D Experience has been digitally re-mastered
into the unparalleled image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience(R) with
proprietary IMAX DMR(R) (Digital Re-mastering) technology.

Robert Zemeckis takes the art of performance capture to the next level with
Disney's A Christmas Carol. This multi-sensory 3D motion picture captures the
fantastical essence of the classic Dickens tale in a groundbreaking motion
picture event. Ebeneezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) begins the Christmas holiday with
his usual miserly contempt, barking at his faithful clerk (Gary Oldman), and his
cheery nephew (Colin Firth). But when the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and
Yet to Come (all played by Carrey) take him on an eye-opening journey revealing
truths Old Scrooge is reluctant to face, he must open his heart to undo years of
ill will before it's too late.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) on Monday revealed new investments in Nestle AG (NESN.VX) (NSRGY.PK) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and that it has nearly doubled its investment in Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing reporting U.S.-listed equity holdings as of September 30, Berkshire said it held 3.4 million American depositary receipts of Nestle, the world's largest foodmaker, worth $144.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reported owning 1.28 million shares of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest oil company, valued at $87.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire also boosted its stake in Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, 90 percent from three months earlier, to 37.8 million shares worth $1.86 billion from 19.9 million shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the companies are all household names, their shares have lagged the broader U.S. stock market since the market bottomed in March. Buffett favors undervalued stocks, and regularly buys even when economic conditions are weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The general market has rocketed higher, but it may be that these businesses haven't participated as well," said Justin Fuller, an analyst at Midway Capital Research  Management in Chicago and author of the Buffettologist.com blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire also reported new investments of $96.3 million in trash hauler Republic Services Inc (RSG.N), and $1.35 million in insurer Travelers Cos (TRV.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett, the world's second-richest person, does not publicly discuss what he is buying and selling, or ordinarily explain purchases and sales revealed in quarterly SEC filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday's SEC filing includes investments made by Berkshire subsidiaries, including a portfolio at the car insurer Geico Corp overseen by Lou Simpson. Buffett has said investors should not assume all the reported investment decisions are his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate SEC filing revealed that Berkshire had begun amassing its Exxon stake by the second quarter. The SEC occasionally lets Buffett delay disclosing investment activity so investors cannot copy him while he is buying and selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soros Asset Management, overseen by billionaire George Soros, in a separate SEC filing revealed a stake in Berkshire itself and increased stakes in many blue-chip companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHITHER KRAFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuller said the Nestle stake appears surprising given Berkshire's reported $3.63 billion stake in Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N, which last week launched a hostile bid for Britain's Cadbury Plc CBRY.L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet he said Nestle could help Berkshire "diversify away from Kraft. It is the classic Berkshire-type business in that it is easy to understand, and which has many good brands that people like to buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said the added Wal-Mart stake "makes more sense at a time consumers are more price-conscious," while the Exxon stake could be "indicative of Berkshire's large bet in energy. If you believe as Buffett does that more inflation is on the horizon, then it makes sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire this month agreed to buy the 77.4 percent of railroad operator Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp BNI.N it did not already own for $26.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Berkshire on Sept 30 still owned shares of railroad operators Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) and Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N), Buffett has said he has sold these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of Berkshire's disclosed portfolio of U.S.-listed equities grew 16 percent from the second quarter to $56.55 billion from $48.95 billion. Berkshire bought a net $1.45 billion of equities in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire also reported increased stakes in Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) and lowered stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips (COP.N), credit rater Moody's Corp (MCO.N), NRG Energy Inc (NRG.N), SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) and health insurer WellPoint Inc (WLP.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reported no stake in Eaton Corp (ETN.N), after holding 2 million shares of the manufacturer of hydraulics and electrical control systems three months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett has transformed Berkshire since 1965 into a roughly $160 billion conglomerate with close to 80 companies selling such things as candy, car insurance, ice cream and underwear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Monday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up $945 at $103,000, and its Class B shares rose $20.50 to $3,431.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's weather report for the Internet: increasing cloudiness with a chance of strong winds (of change). IBM and ATT both announced new services to compete for a share of the projected $46.4 billion market--a market predicted to grow to over $150 billion over the next 4 years--in the progressively crowded arena of cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Amazon should be very flattered. Amazon has more or less defined the market and has a relatively successful model for offering server capacity and storage space from the cloud. Both IBM and ATT are closely following the Amazon blueprints to duplicate that success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is rolling out the Smart Analytics Cloud service which leverages the petabytes of accumulated business data IBM has archived over the years. IBM is eating its own proverbial dog food, already adopting the service internally under the name Blue Insight. The Smart Analytics Cloud will enable customers to analyze information from their own data storage combined with data from the IBM archives to extract valuable business insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ATT cloud service, dubbed ATT Synaptic Computer Services, delivers on-demand computing-as-a-service (CaaS). The ATT cloud is built on the Sun Open Cloud Platform and utilizes Sun Cloud API's in conjunction with a VMware virtual environment. The ATT cloud is much more similar to the Amazon offering a self-service portal that enables customers to add computing power or storage space on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new services from IBM and ATT add to the list of major technology companies already on the cloud computing bandwagon. With names like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in the fray there are two things you can be sure of: 1) cloud computing is here to stay and the market will continue to expand and evolve, and 2) any company that jumps into cloud computing better be ready for a fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although cloud computing is a growing market and is gaining acceptance, the industry still faces some challenges. Issues like the recent Sidekick data debacle or Google's Gmail outages shake customer confidence and make companies and individuals think twice about relying on third-party cloud-based services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is debatable whether either of those instances is a reflection of the stability or security of cloud computing services in general, but perception is reality and companies like IBM and ATT still have to address those concerns. As the nascent market matures, it needs to clearly define what cloud computing is and isn't to avoid confusion or cloud computing backlash when isolated instances occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do have one suggestion for IBM and ATT though--work on the name. From a branding standpoint Azure sounds pleasant and inviting, and EC2 is at least catchy and easy to remember. Smart Analytics Cloud and Synaptic Computer Service sound ominous and invoke images of starting World War III by playing thermonuclear war with WOPR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bradley tweets as @PCSecurityNews, and can be contacted at his Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Nordstrom Ups Guidance, Post-Beat

High-end retailer Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWN) has reported strong third quarter
2009 results with net income of $83 million or 38 cents per share compared to
$71 million or 33 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The earnings
marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. 

The year-over-year increase in earnings was primarily due to an improvement in
same-store sales in each month of the quarter through prudent inventory
management policies that focused on sales trends. Quarter-end inventory per
square foot declined 10.7% versus the year-ago period. Overall gross profit of
the company (as a percentage of sales) increased approximately 90 bps during the
quarter compared to the year-earlier quarter. 

By segment, same-store sales decreased 4.2% during the quarter in Full-line
stores, increased 16.4% in Nordstrom Direct and 3.0% in Nordstrom Rack. During
the quarter, the company reported a $10 million increase in retail selling,
general and administrative expenses due to an increase in operating costs
related to the opening of new stores, along with an increase in variable
expenses. 

Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Earnings Dip

Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. (NYSE: ANF), a leading international specialty retailer,
reported relatively weak third quarter 2009 results with a net income of $38.8
million or 44 cents per share, compared to a net income of $63.9 million or 72
cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. 

The year-over-year decline in results was primarily due to the continued
economic downturn plaguing the industry that has resulted in reduced consumer
discretionary income and cuts in non-essential spending. 

Overall net sales of the company during the quarter decreased 15% to $765.4
million from $896.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Total company
direct-to-consumer net sales increased 11% year-over-year to $63.9 million,
while overall comparable-store sales decreased 22%. 

Disney`s Revenue Climbs

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) recently reported fourth-quarter 2009
results, posting mid-single digit growth in both top and bottom lines. Total
revenue for the quarter climbed 4% year-on-year to $9,867 million. 

The quarterly earnings of 46 cents a share outdid the Zacks Consensus Estimate
of 41 cents and jumped 5% from 44 cents delivered in the prior-year quarter. The
better-than-expected results followed strong results from its Media Networks
segment and effective cost management. 

On a reported basis, including one-time items, quarterly earnings came in at 47
cents a share, up 18% from 40 cents posted in the year-ago quarter. 

New Rules for Bank Overdraft Fees

According to the new regulations, consumers must be given a notice explaining a
financial institution's overdraft services, including an explanation of the fees
associated with the services. 

The Federal Reserve took this decision primarily based on its investigation
which showed that banking customers only want overdraft services if they know
the details of what is required. However, some consumers do want overdraft
protection services to make sure that some time-sensitive payments like rent and
bills are covered, as long as they know the charges. 

The Fed's rules appear mostly in line with the new trend that some of the banks
have already begun moving toward. In September, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:
WFC) said that it will not charge fees from customers if they overdraw their
accounts by $5 or less. Following that, in October, Bank of America Corporation
(NYSE: BAC) announced that it will eliminate fees if a customer`s account is
overdrawn by less than $10 in a single day.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Apple Opens New Store in New York

Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) will open its newest retail store with an 8,500 square
feet retail space in New York tomorrow. The store will help Apple deliver more
Macs, iPods and iPhones, taking advantage of the coming holiday season. The new
store is the fourth in Manhattan and fifteenth in New York. 

To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products, in which service
and education are emphasized, the company has expanded and improved its
distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and
internationally. 

The company operates a network of 280 retail stores in 10 countries across the
world, including the U.S., U.K., Italy, Australia, Canada, Japan, China,
Switzerland, Germany and France to drive the demand for its other products.
Further, Apple is soon to open two new stores in Shanghai as well as London and
Paris. 

The company further plans to open 40 to 50 new larger retail stores next year,
about half of which are expected to be outside the U.S. Apple had earlier
estimated that it would open 25 to 50 new stores. 

Retail sales increased 4.0% to $6.57 billion (averaging $26.0 million per store
annually). Store traffic grew to around 170 million in fiscal 2009. The company
has extended its footprint in international retail markets. Growing its presence
in the international retail market, Apple opened its first store in Sydney and
Beijing and opened stores in Switzerland, France and Germany during the calendar
year 2008. 

Apple's business strategy leverages its ability, through the design and
development of its own operating system, hardware and many software applications
and technologies, to provide its customers around the world with compelling new
products and solutions, superior ease-of-use, seamless integration and
innovative industrial design. 

To attract customers during the holiday season, the company plans to offer
gift-wrapping of any iPod or portable Mac for just $5. It will also allow
customers to set aside a gift and pick it up at their local Apple store for free
from Dec. 15 to Christmas Eve. 

Apple`s stores hosted 42.7 million visitors during the last quarter, an increase
of 7% from the year-ago period. The stores posted revenue of $1.87 billion ($7.6
million per store) in the quarter, the highest level ever and up 15% from the
year-ago period. 

Last month, Microsoft Corp (Nasdaq: MSFT) announced the opening of its own first
retail store in Arizona. But we do not expect Microsoft to catch up anytime. 

Quality Systems Barely Beats

Quality Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: QSII) reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of
41 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and the year-ago
earnings by 4 cents. 

Total revenues for the quarter increased 21.5% to $71.69 million from $58.98
million. The company`s NextGen Healthcare Information Systems division posted
revenue of $67.4 million for the reported quarter, representing a 23% increase
from the previous year. 

Category-wise, System sales, including software, hardware and supplies,
increased 5.9% to $26.24 million from $24.78 million. Revenues from maintenance,
electronic data interchange (EDI), revenue cycle management (RCM) and other
services grew 32.9% to $45.46 million from $34.19 million in the year-ago
period. 

The total cost of system sales, including software, hardware and supplies
increased 16.8% to $7 million. Total cost of maintenance, EDI, RCM and other
services for the quarter were $21.27 million as against $15.2 million in the
year-ago quarter, up 39.9%. Consequently, total cost of revenues for the quarter
increased 33.4% to $28.3 million. The company reported a gross profit of $43.4
million for the quarter opposed to $37.8 million in the year-ago period, up
14.8%. 

Research &amp; development spend for the quarter increased 30% to $4.34 million for
the quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the reported
quarter increased 11.7% to $20.4 million. 

Quality Systems exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $75.4
million opposed to cash and cash equivalents of $70.2 million at the end of
fiscal 2009. 

Quality Systems, headquartered in Irvine, California, develops and markets
healthcare information systems that automate certain aspects of medical and
dental practices, networks of practices such as physician hospital organizations
and management service organizations, ambulatory care centers, community health
centers, and medical and dental schools. The company competes with players like
Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (Nasdaq: MDRX) and Cerner Corp.
(Nasdaq: CERN).

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) unveiled goals on Monday that call for the revenue generated by the company and its bottlers to double to roughly $200 billion by 2020, with profit margins increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke also said it hopes to more than double the number of soft drink servings it sells to over 3 billion per day by the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest soft drink maker discussed its targets for the next ten years at a two-day investor meeting in Atlanta, its first such gathering in its hometown in over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said there were several worldwide trends that supported the company's growth in the medium- to long-term -- including a shift in the economic power of developing countries and growing urbanization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke derives more than three-quarters of its revenue from international markets, and is therefore able to offset falling sales in the United States with strong growth in emerging markets like India, China and Brazil. The company said last week that it planned to ramp up investment in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrywide sales of carbonated soft drinks had been falling in the United States even before the recession slammed the brakes on consumer spending. Some consumers, taking heed of growing awareness of nutritional health, opted for drinks such as bottled water, juice and tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke has repeatedly said its long-term growth targets call for annual sales volume to increase 3 percent to 4 percent, revenue to increase 5 percent to 6 percent and earnings per share to increase at a high single-digit percentage rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The long term growth rates are appropriate (moving into 2010), but we're not content with them," said Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard. "The fundamentals of our business remain strong as we continue to gain market share globally and in key markets, expand our margins, and generate tremendous cash flows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Coke reported lower-than-expected third-quarter revenue, hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar and said a weak economy would keep consumers under pressure next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares closed 0.5 percent higher at $56.74 on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Prevnar 13 study misses on three strains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * FDA to ask advisory panel about efficacy results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer says overall data show vaccine effective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; Adds company, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) next-
generation Prevnar vaccine missed some of the main goals in a
study testing its ability to protect against bacteria that
cause ear infections, pneumonia and other diseases, U.S.
reviewers said in documents released on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said the overall data showed the experimental
Prevnar 13 shot was effective against a wider range of illness
than the original vaccine and the company would make that case
to an advisory panel that meets on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new version is designed for immunizing infants and
toddlers against 13 forms of a bacterium called streptococcus
pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, that cause an array of illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The vaccine was the most important product in the pipeline
of Wyeth, which Pfizer recently acquired. The Food and Drug
Administration is weighing whether to approve Prevnar 13 for
sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The original Prevnar was introduced in 2000 and has annual
sales around $3 billion. It fights seven pneumococcal types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth studied whether levels of antibodies that fight
infection were equivalent, or "non-inferior," between Prevnar
and Prevnar 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For three of the types, "the non-inferiority criterion was
not met" for some people in the study, FDA reviewers said in an
analysis prepared for an outside advisory committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reviewers said they would ask the advisory panel about
the clinical trial findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, in a separate summary also released by the FDA,
said overall results showed Prevnar 13 provided "a real and
substantial benefit given its demonstrated ability to elicit
immune responses" to each of the 13 types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also said the vaccine was "well tolerated and
as safe as Prevnar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr. Emilio Emini, Pfizer's chief scientific officer for
vaccine research, said World Health Organization guidelines for
testing pneumococcal vaccines state that reaching all of the
non-inferiority goals is not a requirement if other measures
are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger expected the advisory
panel to recommend approval for Prevnar 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Risinger said in a research note he thought the panel would
be swayed in part by data showing the newer vaccine protected
against a strain known as 19A, currently the most common cause
of pneumococcal infections in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emini said the data under FDA review was the same that was
scrutinized by the European Medicines Agency, which recommended
approval of the vaccine in Europe. A final decision from the
European Commission is still pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth had been due to receive a decision in the United
States in September, but the company announced in August the
review was extended by three months to Dec. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prevnar 13 also is being studied for potential use in
adults, a new indication that could accelerate already booming
sales of the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth expects to seek regulatory approvals in 2010 to
market Prevnar 13 to adults. Pneumonia caused by the
pneumococcal organism is one of the biggest causes of death in
older individuals and its incidence begins to increase when one
is about 50 years old and increases rapidly thereafter as the
immune system weakens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) has a rival vaccine, called
Synflorix, that is active against 10 strains. Synflorix is
approved in Europe and some other markets, but not the United
States.

&lt;p&gt; * Aims to more than double servings to over 3 bln/day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says long-term growth targets are appropriate
(Adds details on long-term goals, byline; changes headline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Martinne Geller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ATLANTA, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) unveiled
goals on Monday that call for the revenue generated by the
company and its bottlers to double to roughly $200 billion by
2020, with profit margins increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke also said it hopes to more than double the number of
soft drink servings it sells to over 3 billion per day by the
end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest soft drink maker discussed its targets
for the next ten years at a two-day investor meeting in
Atlanta, its first such gathering in its hometown in over a
decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said there were several
worldwide trends that supported the company's growth in the
medium- to long-term -- including a shift in the economic power
of developing countries and growing urbanization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke derives more than three-quarters of its revenue from
international markets, and is therefore able to offset falling
sales in the United States with strong growth in emerging
markets like India, China and Brazil. The company said last
week that it planned to ramp up investment in
Brazil.[ID:nN12295033]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industrywide sales of carbonated soft drinks had been
falling in the United States even before the recession slammed
the brakes on consumer spending. Some consumers, taking heed of
growing awareness of nutritional health, opted for drinks such
as bottled water, juice and tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke has repeatedly said its long-term growth targets call
for annual sales volume to increase 3 percent to 4 percent,
revenue to increase 5 percent to 6 percent and earnings per
share to increase at a high single-digit percentage rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The long term growth rates are appropriate (moving into
2010), but we're not content with them," said Chief Financial
Officer Gary Fayard. "The fundamentals of our business remain
strong as we continue to gain market share globally and in key
markets, expand our margins, and generate tremendous cash
flows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Coke reported lower-than-expected third-quarter
revenue, hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar and said a weak
economy would keep consumers under pressure next
year.[ID:nN20380392]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke shares closed 0.5 percent higher at $56.74 on Monday.

&lt;p&gt;Donation to Los Angeles Universal Preschool Aims to Raise Interest in Science
and Math Among Hispanic Children
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
IBM has donated 50 children`s educational computer learning centers with
bilingual software to Los Angeles Universal Preschool (LAUP) with the intent of
improving access to technology for hundreds of at-risk Latino students at LAUP
preschools throughout Los Angeles County. 

The "Young Explorer Learning Center" computers are part of IBM`s KidSmart Early
Learning Program and the total grant is valued at $100,000. They integrate
interactive teaching and learning activities in English and Spanish using the
latest technology into the pre-kindergarten curriculum. The computer learning
stations will be installed at 50 LAUP preschools countywide. 

IBM launched the KidSmart program initiative as part of its commitment to
generate interest in math and science among students and to ultimately increase
the number of students entering into science, math and technology careers. The
emphasis on Latino children is based on projections that in America, the
Hispanic community is expected to comprise 25 percent of the overall population
by 2050, making the U.S. home to the largest Hispanic population in the world. 

Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district includes the Van
Nuys Civic Child Development Center, where a demonstration of the computer
learning centers took place Nov. 16, said the computer learning centers will
enhance the educational experience of the young children. 

"IBM`s early learning computers can help inspire kids to create and learn
because they incorporate an element of play, engaging their minds and
imaginations in a truly unique way as nothing else can," he said. 

Today, the number of Hispanic students pursuing careers in science, math and
technology is extremely low, said Don Jue, IBM's senior executive in Los Angeles
County. "We know that early childhood education through terrific organizations
like LAUP can prepare children to learn so that math and science skills are
within their grasp, and one day may lead to more Hispanic scientists and
engineers," Jue said. 

Latinos accounted for only 4.2 percent of engineering degrees awarded in 2005
and a scant 1.5 percent doctorate degrees, according to the National Action
Council for Minorities in Engineering. Furthermore, Hispanic students are
dropping out of high school at an alarming 24 percent national rate, which is
higher than any other ethnic population. 

Gary Mangiofico, CEO of LAUP, said the KidSmart Program will help teach young
children concepts in math, science and language as well as the skills needed to
be successful in the classroom. 

"All students deserve access to the same resources," he said. "Some populations
face a disparity, however, especially where English may be a second language.
We`re excited to be part of this initiative and deliver high-quality teaching
resources to all of our children participating in this program." 

IBM developed the KidSmart program more than a decade ago to help reduce the
digital divide, especially in urban areas, where it was becoming apparent that
children from less affluent backgrounds could benefit from access to specialized
technology tools and educational materials to better prepare them to enter
school. 

The Young Explorer computers are housed in brightly-colored, kid-friendly Little
Tikes  furniture and are equipped with award-winning educational software to
help children learn and explore concepts in math, science and language. The
computer centers can also help children learn important socialization skills
such as how to work together and sharing. 

The KidSmart Early Learning Program has benefited students in 60 countries
worldwide, serving more than 10 million children and 100,000 teachers. 

Los Angeles Universal Preschool (LAUP) is a non-profit organization established
to provide high-quality preschool education to the children in Los Angeles
County. Since 2005, its creative model that focuses on high-quality has touched
the lives of more than 30,000 preschool-aged children through enriching
curricula and nurturing environments aimed to best prepare four-year-olds to
succeed in kindergarten and beyond.LAUP is primarily funded by First 5 LA, and
is lauded as a premier organization by the California Council for Excellence.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, DASANI Products Debut in First Generation of PET Plastic Made
Partially from Plants
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company announced today that beverages in its innovative
PlantBottle packaging are beginning to arrive on store shelves in select markets
throughout the world, initiating the Company`s journey toward a goal of
producing 2 billion of the special PET plastic bottles by the end of 2010. 

PlantBottle PET plastic bottles are made partially from plants, which reduces
the Company`s dependence on a non-renewable resource - petroleum. Other benefits
are that it is 100 percent recyclable, and preliminary research indicates that
from the growing of the plant materials through to the production of the resin,
the carbon footprint for the PlantBottle packaging is smaller than for bottles
made with traditional PET. 

"Today, we are taking a major step along our sustainable packaging journey as
The Coca-Cola Company becomes the first-to-market with a recyclable PET plastic
bottle made partially from plants," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO, The
Coca-Cola Company. "From Coke brands in Copenhagen to DASANI water in the
Western United States, we are starting to roll out the first generation of the
bottle of the future." 

Throughout Denmark, Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light and Coca-Cola Zero in 500mL and
2L sizes are now available in the PlantBottle packaging. A variety of products,
including Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fresca and DASANI will be in Western Canada in the
PlantBottle beginning in December and for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic
Games. And for select markets in the Western United States, including Seattle,
San Francisco and Los Angeles, PlantBottle packaging will be used for sparkling
brands and DASANI in several sizes, starting in January. Future launches are
being planned in other markets, including Brazil, Japan and Mexico and for
China`s Shanghai Expo in 2010. 

PlantBottle samples also will be featured at the Company`s investor event, "A
Growing World of Refreshment, a 2020 Vision," which begins later today in
Atlanta. 

"The PlantBottle is precisely the kind of innovation that demonstrates how
businesses can help address climate change and reduce stress on our precious
natural resources," said Kate Krebs, Director of Sustainable Resources for The
Climate Group. "While Coca-Cola is just beginning to bring its plant-based PET
plastic into the mix, this is a revolutionary solution that has the potential
for long-term, meaningful benefits." 

PlantBottle packaging is currently made through a process that turns sugar cane
and molasses, a by-product of sugar production, into a key component for PET
plastic. The sugar cane being used comes from predominantly rain-fed crops that
were processed into ethanol, not refined sugar. Ultimately, the Company`s goal
is to use non-food, plant-based waste, such as wood chips or wheat stalks, to
produce recyclable PET plastic bottles. 

"Coca-Cola is currently sourcing raw materials for its PlantBottle from
suppliers in Brazil, where third parties have verified that best-in-class
agricultural practices are the norm," said Dr. Jason Clay, Senior Vice President
of Market Transformation for WWF. "Preserving natural resources through
sustainable agriculture is essential for businesses like Coca-Cola as they
search for ways to alleviate environmental challenges." 

While the bio-based component can account for up to 30 percent of the resulting
PET plastic in PlantBottle packaging, the percentage varies for bottles that
also contain recycled PET. For example, Denmark uses recycled content in its
PlantBottle packaging. The combined plant-based and recycled content makes up 65
percent of the material, with 50 percent coming from recycled material and 15
percent from plant-based material. 

For the PlantBottle packaging in the United States and Canada, up to 30 percent
of the content in the PET plastic comes from plants. 

"While the PlantBottle introduction and market launch put The Coca-Cola Company
on the forefront of bio-based packaging innovation, we are continuing to strive
to make an even better bottle," said Scott Vitters, Director of Sustainable
Packaging, The Coca-Cola Company. "Our vision is to continue innovating to
achieve a bottle that is made with 100 percent plant-waste material while
remaining completely recyclable." 

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is the world`s largest beverage company,
refreshing consumers with nearly 500 sparkling and still brands. Along with
Coca-Cola, recognized as the world`s most valuable brand, the Company`s
portfolio includes 12 other billion dollar brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta,
Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, Powerade, Minute Maid and Georgia Coffee.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's next- generation Prevnar vaccine missed some key goals in a study of its effectiveness, U.S. reviewers said in documents released on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prevnar 13 vaccine is designed to protect against 13 forms of a bacterium called streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, that can cause an array of diseases ranging from ear infections to pneumonia and meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three of the types, "the non-inferiority criterion was not met" for a proportion of subjects, Food and Drug Administration reviewers said in an analysis prepared for an outside advisory committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviewers said they would ask the panel at a meeting on Wednesday about the clinical trial findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevnar 13 is a successor to the currently marketed Prevnar, which protects against seven types of pneumococcus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advance Auto Parts, Bancolombia and Nu Skin Recognized for Improving Market
Basket Analysis, Combating Money Laundering and Reducing Churn
CHICAGO, Ill.--(Business Wire)--
SPSS, an IBM Company and the leading global provider of predictive analytics
software and solutions, today announced the recipients of its annual Insight
Awards presented at the 2009 Directions User Conference in Las Vegas. 

Advance Auto Parts, Bancolombia and Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. were recognized for
their innovative use of IBM&#174; SPSS&#174; predictive analytics software to improve
market basket analysis and supply chain optimization, monitor and identify
suspicious money laundering activities and increase marketing campaigns to
reduce churn, respectively. These organizations join commercial, government and
academic customers worldwide that are deploying predictive analytics to acquire,
grow and retain customers, while mitigating risk and reducing fraud. 

Established in 2004, the Insight Awards recognize customers that have
successfully delivered exceptional business value and gained significant return
on investment (ROI) - in quantitative results or objective observations. The
Insight Awards honor customers for the compelling and pioneering use of
predictive analytics contributing to their organizations` successes. 

Deepak Advani, now responsible for the recently acquired SPSS business, and vice
president of predictive analytics at IBM, said, "Smart and strategic companies
worldwide recognize the value of applying IBM SPSS predictive analytics software
to gain insight from the wealth of data for better, faster decisions and
actions, optimized processes, and more predictable outcomes. We are excited to
shine the spotlight on these deserving companies and showcase the impressive
results gained through using IBM SPSS predictive analytics software." 

Advance Auto Parts Increases Loyalty, Improves Sales

Advance Auto Parts, the second-largest retailer of automotive parts in the
United States, uses IBM SPSS predictive analytics software for market basket
analysis and supply chain optimization to accurately manage inventory at
warehouses and individual stores. The organization chose IBM SPSS predictive
analytics to quickly and easily leverage all data assets to produce, evaluate
and deploy analytical models on SKU association modeling, market basket and
cluster analysis when processing sales transaction data. 

Using IBM SPSS predictive analytics software, Advance Auto Parts analyzes and
better understands merchandise affinities to identify customer preferences,
improve cross-selling and optimize products. This has led to improved
availability, overall profitability, higher propensity to move SKUs at stores,
and, most importantly, increased customer loyalty and satisfaction. 

Bancolombia Combats Money Laundering

Bancolombia, the largest commercial bank in Colombia and one of the largest in
Latin America, uses IBM SPSS predictive analytics software to monitor the
transactional patterns of its customers. Bancolombia is committed to prevent
money laundering activities in its organization, implementing pattern
recognition, anomaly detection, risk analysis and predictive modeling
capabilities that IBM predictive analytics software offers. Employing this
technology, the bank reduced the number of suspicious operations that required
auditing by more than 90 percent. The bank also increased accuracy in
identifying positive cases of money laundering, helping investigators to easily
adapt models to the changing tactics of those engaged in this criminal activity.


Additionally, Bancolombia improved the efficiency of its auditing process as it
increased the number of investigations that finally ended in reports to the
authorities from less than 25 percent to more than 60 percent. Bancolombia
slashed the administrative costs of the investigations of suspicious operations
by 60 percent after implementing IBM SPSS predictive analytics software,
allowing it to change from a distributed investigation process to a centralized
one. 

Nu Skin Enhances Marketing Campaigns, Reduces Churn

Nu Skin Enterprises Inc., a $1 billion global direct selling company, markets
premium anti-aging personal care and nutrition products through a global network
of more than 750,000 active independent distributors. The organization selected
IBM SPSS predictive analytics software to quickly build, validate and deploy
predictive models to improve its marketing campaigns and segmentation and, most
importantly, improve distributor retention. 

Using IBM SPSS predictive analytics software, Nu Skin's business development
department built highly effective propensity models that allowed the company to
identify customer and distributor segments to significantly improve retention in
a key market by 40 percent. With these models, Nu Skin was able to understand
customer and distributor trends, and then successfully re-engage distributors -
on an individual basis - with event-based marketing activities.

Facebook users empowered to direct corporate giving effort with more than
500,000 community organizations eligible for grants
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
For the first time ever, Facebook users will be able to choose from more than
500,000 small and local charities to decide which community organizations they
want to receive donations totaling millions of dollars from a corporate
philanthropy fund. Chase and Facebook today announced the launch of Chase
Community Giving: You Decide What Matters, a grassroots campaign to inspire a
new way of corporate philanthropy. 

Chase is enlisting Facebook users, now totaling more than 300 million, to vote
for which small and local non profits will receive donations totaling $5
million. The eligible charity receiving the most votes will be awarded $1
million, the top five runners-up will receive $100,000 each and the 100
finalists, including the top winners, will be awarded $25,000 each.
Additionally, a special Advisory Board featuring members who are active in
philanthropy, including actress Eva Longoria, Do Something founder Nancy Lublin
and NBA Hall of Famer David Robinson, will allocate a total of $1 million to the
nominated charities of its choice. 

"Every year, our company donates more than $100 million to non-profit
organizations in local communities, nationally and abroad, and our employees
dedicate countless hours of their own time to helping those in need," said Jamie
Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. "The grassroots nature of
Facebook will allow us to hear directly which local charities matter most to our
communities, hopefully creating an even bigger impact." 

"Facebook has become a global platform people use for all types of philanthropic
causes from medical research and human rights, to disaster assistance and
children`s rights," said Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook. "Chase's creative
approach -- crowdsourcing for charity -- puts the power of corporate giving
directly in the hands of Facebook users. Thanks to the Chase Community Giving
program, millions of Americans will be able to join together to have an
unprecedented philanthropic impact on communities across the nation." 

This $5 million Facebook effort is in addition to the bank`s traditional
philanthropic giving, and if successful, the bank hopes to commit more of its
annual philanthropy funds using this innovative method of giving. 

"Chase Community Giving could not come at a more crucial time. Community
organizations in San Antonio and across the country are facing increasing
challenges. Chase`s innovative program with Facebook will incite a new level of
engagement with and support for community giving," said David Robinson, founder
of The Carver Academy. He continued, "I am confident that Chase`s continuing
efforts have the power to redefine corporate philanthropy." 

"Chase Community Giving is going to allow Facebook users to vote for local
charities that are closest to their hearts- from human rights to education,"
said Eva Longoria, founder of Eva`s Heroes. "These smaller organizations are
working hard for their communities every day, but don`t always get the
recognition they deserve. This new way of corporate giving will bring these non
profits into the spotlight where they can shine." 

"This innovative program unleashes the charitable passions of our neighbors,
friends and colleagues to rally around the issues and organizations that are
most meaningful to them," said Kimberly Davis, President of the JPMorgan Chase
Foundation. "Facebook users can literally `vote their conscience` while helping
to celebrate and reward the charities that are doing so much great work across
our nation. We look forward to applying the learning from this program to future
philanthropic endeavors." 

In Round One of the Chase Community Giving program, Facebook users will vote for
non-profit organizations they think should receive a portion of Chase`s
philanthropy funds. To reinforce the local focus of this program, 501(c)(3) non
profits with an operating budget of $10 million or less will be eligible.
Facebook users will be able to nominate non profits that serve the general
public in the following areas: education, healthcare, housing, the environment,
combating hunger, arts and culture, human services and animal welfare. The Chase
Community Giving Advisory Board will review the top vote-getters to help ensure
compliance with the program`s rules. On December 15, the top 100 qualified
vote-getters will be announced to receive $25,000 each, and will move on to the
next round. 

In Round Two, the top 100 organizations will have the option to submit a Million
Dollar Grant proposal to Facebook users, detailing the difference they would
make in their local community with the significant extra resources. Facebook
users will vote starting January 15, and on February 1, the qualified
organization receiving the most votes will be announced as the winner of a
Million Dollar Grant from Chase. The next five organizations with the most votes
will receive $100,000 each. Additionally, the Advisory Board will donate $1
million to the nominated charities of its choice. 

Chase Community Giving Advisory Board Members include:

* Kim Davis, President of the JPMorgan Chase Foundation 
* Eva Longoria, actress and philanthropist 
* Nancy Lublin, CEO of Do Something
* David Robinson, NBA Hall of Famer and philanthropist 
* Elliot Schrage, Vice President of Global Communications and Public Policy at
Facebook

In addition to the donations made through the program, Chase will provide a
$25,000 honorarium to each Board member who does not work for Chase or Facebook,
to donate to the charity of their personal choice. Chase and the Advisory Board
will reserve the right to eliminate any organization not meeting the program
rules.

Fans Choose Three Young People to Represent Coca-Cola on Unprecedented, 275,000-Mile Journey around the World</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;Selected Through Global Online Vote, Trio Will Visit 206 Countries in 365 Days
to Seek Out What Makes People Happy

Adventure to Play Out Online at www.expedition206.com with "Happiness
Ambassadors" Facebooking, Twittering, Youtubing and Flickring Their Way Around
The Globe


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Three young people have landed one of the coolest jobs in the world. As part of
Coca-Cola`s Expedition 206, the team will attempt to visit 206 countries and
territories where Coca-Cola is sold, covering more than 275,000 miles in just
365 days, all on a mission to find out what makes people happy. 

Following a worldwide online vote to determine the team of happiness
ambassadors, the three winners - Tony Martin, 29, a Washington, D.C., native now
teaching kindergarten in Munich; Kelly Ferris, 23, a university student from
Brussels; and Antonio Santiago, 24, a university student from Mexico City - were
introduced today at a global investor event at the World of Coca-Cola in
Atlanta. 

Martin, Ferris and Santiago will embark on one of the most ambitious travel
adventures ever during 2010, bringing Coca-Cola`s "Open Happiness" campaign to
life as they visit people from different cultures, document their experiences
and share stories of happiness with the world. 

People can follow the entire journey as it plays out in real-time on the
expedition`s online headquarters at www.Expedition206.com, as well as on
Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr and other social networking sites. Fans also
will serve as "virtual travel agents," helping the team decide where they go,
what they do and who they visit in each destination. 

"Our goal is to bring fans along for the ride, using social media platforms to
make them an integral part of the adventure," said Clyde Tuggle, senior vice
president, Global Public Affairs and Communications, The Coca-Cola Company. "The
magic of Expedition 206 is in its potential to bring people together in a global
conversation, highlighting the stories of happiness and optimism people
everywhere are eager to share." 

Beginning in Madrid on Jan. 1, 2010, and concluding in Atlanta on Dec. 31, 2010,
the expedition will make stops in cities big and small, visiting with people and
attending marquee global events, such as the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games
in Canada, the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, and the World Expo 2010 in
Shanghai, China. Along the way, Coca-Cola will identify people to act as a
"Happiness Host" in each destination to welcome the team and help guide them on
their exploration. 

"Tony, Antonio and I have been given an amazing opportunity and we`re eager to
hit the road to meet thousands of people around the world," said Ferris, who was
born in South Africa and grew up in Belgium. "It`s an ambitious task, but I
can`t think of a better way to spend a year than exploring what makes people
happy." 

"I still can`t believe that I`ve landed this chance of a lifetime," added Tony
Martin, who now resides in Munich, Germany. "If we stick to our itinerary we`ll
set a new world record for the number of countries visited in one year. I`ve
already started packing my bags." 

"I already spend a lot of time connecting with my friends and new people
online," said Antonio Santiago of Mexico City. "This expedition will give me a
chance to share my experiences with a truly global audience through blog posts,
photos and videos." 

During their first day on the job, the team kicked off "Happiness Ambassador
Training Camp," a mix of fun and educational sessions designed to prepare them
for the year-long trip of a lifetime. Among other activities, the team was
coached by Marcus Shapiro, an adventure travel fitness specialist from
Atlanta-based Fit For Trips, who led them through an exercise routine and
provided tips on staying mentally and physically healthy on the road. After a
crash course in the art of speed-packing, Chef Brian Whitcomb, distinguished
alumni of The International School of the Culinary Arts at the Art Institute of
Atlanta, presented a tasting of exotic foods to prepare their palates. The
travelers also learned some key phrases - including "What makes you happy?" - in
several of the world`s most widely spoken languages, courtesy of Marc de
Foucault from the Language Institute of Atlanta. Preparations will continue over
the next several weeks leading up to the team`s departure.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) is close to buying out British stockbroker Cazenove in a deal likely to be worth almost 1 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) and trigger windfalls for dozens of London's top dealmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talks are continuing between the two sides, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, and it appeared likely the U.S. investment bank would seal a deal shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan Cazenove was set up as a joint venture five years ago, whereby the U.S. investment bank took 50 percent ownership. Both sides have the right to trigger a full takeover by J.P.Morgan in February, under put and call options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan is in advanced talks to pay 500-525 pence per share for the remaining stake, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazenove declined to comment, while J.P. Morgan was not available for comment. J.P. Morgan has in the past declined to comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported last month the U.S. bank was keen to decide on whether to buy out its partner before bonuses are set for staff around the turn of the year, citing industry sources. One source said then that a deal at about 500 pence per share would be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 500 pence per share Cazenove would be valued at just under 1 billion pounds, and the joint venture at double that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazenove shares do not trade on an open market, but can be bought or sold on an "internal market" during narrow windows twice a year. They last traded at about 260 pence in March, up from 240 pence at the start of the year but down from 350 pence at the end of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European bank shares .SX7P have almost doubled since March as financial markets have revived, and JPMorgan Cazenove has advised on most of the biggest capital markets deals of the year, including rights issues by HSBC (HSBA.L), Xstrata XTA.L, and the ongoing record cashcall by Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint venture has proved successful in spite of d+.oubts at the time about the marriage of the Queen's stockbroker with a U.S. investment bank. In reality, it has provided Cazenove with access to J.P. Morgan's huge balance sheet at an essential time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazenove's origins date back to the early Huguenot financiers, and Philip Cazenove set up the beginnings of the firm in London in 1823.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stockbroker prides itself on its deep and strong ties across the City of London, and many of its bankers have been at the firm for decades and stand to reap a windfall from a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Mayhew, the chairman who joined Cazenove in 1969, is in line for an 18 million pound payday, based on his ownership of 3.6 million ordinary shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top dealmakers such as Ian Hannam, head of corporate finance, and Alan Carruthers, head of equities, are also in line for millions of pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just under half of Cazenove's shares are owned by current staff, about 9 percent is owned by institutions and the rest are owned by former partners. There were 188 million ordinary shares in issue, according to its 2008 annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Cazenove made a pretax profit of 134.5 million pounds in 2008, down 15 percent from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Cazenove is broker to 36 FTSE 100 companies and 94 FTSE 250 clients, well ahead of its nearest rivals UBS (UBSN.VX) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Slater; editing by Simon Jessop)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; -- John Kemp is a Reuters columnist. The views expressed are
his own --&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By John Kemp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 16 (Reuters) - Both Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) reduced the size of their commodity
trading books during the third quarter, according to their
latest filings on Form Y-9C ("Consolidated Financial Statements
for Bank Holding Companies"):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *
here
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the gross fair value of physical commodity inventories
held on their balance sheets rose -- sharply in Goldman's case
-- the gross fair value of the commodity contracts was down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the shrinkage came from smaller positions in
exchange-traded futures contracts, as well as a reduction in
over-the-counter (OTC) options. OTC swap positions also fell.
But the gross notional value of forwards was little changed.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola-, DASANI-Produkte kommen erstmals in teilweise aus Pflanzen
hergestelltem PET der ersten Generation auf den Markt
ATLANTA, USA--(Business Wire)--
Die Coca-Cola Company gab heute bekannt, dass an ausgew&#228;hlten M&#228;rkten weltweit
ab sofort Getr&#228;nke in der PlantBottle-Verpackung in den Regalen der Gesch&#228;fte zu
finden sein werden. Dies steht am Anfang der Erreichung des Unternehmensziels,
bis Ende 2010 zwei Milliarden der speziellen PET-Kunststoffflaschen zu
produzieren. 

Die PlantBottle-PET-Kunststoffflaschen werden teilweise aus Pflanzen
hergestellt, wodurch die Abh&#228;ngigkeit des Unternehmens von einer nicht
erneuerbaren Ressource - Erd&#246;l - reduziert wird. Weitere Vorteile sind, dass sie
zu 100 Prozent recycelbar sind, und Forschungsergebnisse zeigen, dass die
CO2-Bilanz der PlantBottle-Verpackung von der Zucht der Pflanzenmaterialien bis
hin zur Produktion des Granulats niedriger ausf&#228;llt, als bei aus herk&#246;mmlichem
PET hergestellten Flaschen. 

&#8222;Wir gehen heute einen gro&#223;en Schritt voran auf unserem Weg hin zu nachhaltiger
Verpackung, indem die Coca-Cola Company das erste Unternehmen ist, das eine
recycelbare teilweise aus Pflanzen hergestellte PET-Kunststoffflasche am Markt
einf&#252;hrt", sagte Muhtar Kent, Chairman und CEO der Coca-Cola Company. &#8222;Von den
Coke-Marken in Kopenhagen bis hin zum DASANI-Wasser im Westen der Vereinigten
Staaten beginnen wir mit der Einf&#252;hrung der ersten Generation der Flasche der
Zukunft." 

&#220;berall in D&#228;nemark sind ab sofort Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light und Coca-Cola Zero
in den Gr&#246;&#223;en 500 ml und 2 l in der PlantBottle-Verpackung erh&#228;ltlich. Eine
Vielzahl von Produkten, darunter Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fresca und DASANI werden ab
Dezember und f&#252;r die Olympischen Winterspiele 2010 in Vancouver in Westkanada in
der PlantBottle erh&#228;ltlich sein. Und in ausgew&#228;hlten M&#228;rkten im Westen der
Vereinigten Staaten, wie in Seattle, San Francisco und Los Angeles, wird die
PlantBottle-Verpackung ab Januar f&#252;r kohlens&#228;urehaltige Marken und DASANI in
verschiedenen Gr&#246;&#223;en verwendet werden. F&#252;r die Zukunft ist die Einf&#252;hrung an
weiteren M&#228;rkten, darunter in Brasilien, Japan und Mexiko sowie f&#252;r die
Schanghai Expo in China im Jahr 2010 geplant. 

Muster der PlantBottle gibt es dar&#252;ber hinaus auf der Anlegerveranstaltung des
Unternehmens, &#8222;A Growing World of Refreshment, a 2020 Vision", die noch heute in
Atlanta beginnt. 

&#8222;Die PlantBottle ist genau die Art von Innovation, die zeigt, wie Unternehmen
zur Hilfe gegen den Klimawandel beitragen und die Beanspruchung unserer
wertvollen nat&#252;rlichen Ressourcen mindern k&#246;nnen", sagte Kate Krebs, Director
des Bereichs Sustainable Resources von The Climate Group. &#8222;Auch wenn Coca-Cola
mit der Einf&#252;hrung seines pflanzlichen PET-Kunststoffs gerade erst am Anfang
steht, handelt es sich um eine revolution&#228;re L&#246;sung, die das Potenzial f&#252;r
langfristigen, bedeutenden Nutzen in sich tr&#228;gt." 

Die PlantBottle-Verpackung wird derzeit durch ein Verfahren hergestellt, bei dem
Zuckerrohr und Melasse, ein Nebenprodukt der Zuckerherstellung, in einen
Schl&#252;sselbestandteil f&#252;r PET-Kunststoff umgewandelt werden. Das verwendete
Zuckerrohr kommt haupts&#228;chlich von Pflanzen aus dem Regenfeldbau, die zu Ethanol
und nicht zu raffiniertem Zucker verarbeitet wurden. Letztendlich ist es das
Ziel des Unternehmens, nicht essbare, pflanzliche Abf&#228;lle, wie Holzsp&#228;ne oder
Weizenhalme f&#252;r die Produktion recycelbarer PET-Kunststoffflaschen zu verwenden.


&#8222;Coca-Cola beschafft die Rohmaterialien f&#252;r seine PlantBottle derzeit von
Lieferanten in Brasilien, wo Dritte sich davon &#252;berzeugt haben, dass
branchenf&#252;hrende landwirtschaftliche Praxis die Norm ist", sagte Dr. Jason Clay,
Senior Vice President des Bereichs Market Transformation des WWF. &#8222;Der Erhalt
nat&#252;rlicher Ressourcen durch nachhaltige Landwirtschaft ist entscheidend f&#252;r
Unternehmen wie Coca-Cola auf ihrer Suche nach M&#246;glichkeiten zur Minderung der
Umweltprobleme." 

W&#228;hrend biologische Bestandteile bis zu 30 Prozent des entstehenden
PET-Kunststoffes in der PlantBottle-Verpackung ausmachen, variiert der
Prozentsatz bei Flaschen, die auch recyceltes PET enthalten. Zum Beispiel
verwendet D&#228;nemark recycelte Bestandteile in seiner PlantBottle-Verpackung.
Insgesamt machen die pflanzlichen und recycelten Bestandteile 65 Prozent des
Materials aus, wobei 50 Prozent auf das recycelte Material und 15 Prozent auf
pflanzliches Material entfallen. 

Bei der PlantBottle-Verpackung in den Vereinigten Staaten und Kanada haben bis
zu 30 Prozent des PET-Kunststoffs pflanzlichen Ursprung. 

&#8222;W&#228;hrend die Vorstellung und Markteinf&#252;hrung der PlantBottle die Coca-Cola
Company bei den Innovationen hinsichtlich biologischer Verpackungen in die
vorderste Reihe gebracht hat, streben wir weiterhin danach, eine noch bessere
Flasche herzustellen", sagte Scott Vitters, Director des Bereichs Sustainable
Packaging der Coca-Cola Company. &#8222;Unsere Vision ist es, weitere
Entwicklungsarbeit zu leisten, um eine Flasche zu erhalten, die zu 100 Prozent
aus pflanzlichen Abfallstoffen gemacht ist und gleichzeitig vollst&#228;ndig
recycelbar ist." 

Die Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) ist das gr&#246;&#223;te Getr&#228;nkeunternehmen der Welt und
versorgt die Verbraucher mit fast 500 sprudelnden und stillen
Erfrischungsgetr&#228;nkemarken. Neben Coca-Cola, der weltweit als am wertvollsten

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Helping Drive Higher Performance, Lower Costs and Greater Efficiency
in Computing
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
The OpenFabrics Alliance (OFA), an industry consortium that develops, tests,
licenses and distributes cross-platform, open-source software for
high-performance computing, today announced that Microsoft has joined the OFA.
Microsoft is joining at the promoter level, which is OFA`s highest membership
level and gives Microsoft a seat on the OFA board, full voting rights,
membership in all working groups, and the opportunity to influence the long-term
evolution of the most widely adopted middleware for high-performance computing,
networking and storage. 

"I am excited to announce Microsoft as our newest member," said Jim Ryan,
chairman of the OpenFabrics Alliance. "OFA`s momentum is at an all-time high and
OpenFabrics Software is receiving tremendous acceptance in the HPC community as
evidenced by the fact that six out of every ten new HPC clusters are installed
running OpenFabrics. Microsoft customers who combine OpenFabrics Software with
Windows HPC Server in InfiniBand or Ethernet environments can benefit from
unsurpassed performance and massive scalability for their Windows applications."


"This move represents a further step in our ongoing commitment to parallel
computing and high-performance applications," said Kyril Faenov, Microsoft`s
General Manager of High Performance Computing. "We have been contributing to the
OpenFabrics open-source Windows distribution (WinOF) for some time and are now
joining the OFA to collaborate even more closely to accelerate WinOF`s adoption
and the use of RDMA networking in general. Our customers require increased
computing efficiency and shorter time-to-insight, and the use of WinOF drivers
with Windows HPC Server`s NetworkDirect RDMA interface is instrumental in
meeting those needs." 

The addition of Microsoft has been welcomed by the entire OFA membership. Ian
Miller, senior vice president of the productivity solutions group and marketing
at Cray (Nasdaq GM: CRAY), said, "We see Windows HPC Server becoming an
increasingly important force in high productivity computing. Microsoft`s
commitment to enhancing it with the highest-speed interconnects and open-source
middleware is an example of Microsoft`s dedication to optimizing application
performance and enhancing the competitiveness of its customers. At Cray, we are
finding HPC computing paradigms to be increasingly popular across a broad range
of market sectors, including aerospace, automotive, digital media, energy,
financial services, life sciences, and government and academia." 

At SC09, Microsoft will demonstrate the stability and performance of WinOF
drivers for quad data rate (40Gb/s) InfiniBand in its booth (#1135).

&lt;p&gt;U.S. EPA Recognizes ExxonMobil for Reducing Methane Emissions Through Technology
Advances and Operational Excellence
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company received a 2009 Continuing Excellence award from
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under its Natural Gas STAR
Program.

The Natural Gas Star Program recognizes companies that apply cost-effective
technologies and management practices to improve operational efficiency and
reduce methane emissions. The Continuing Excellence Award is presented to
companies that annually self report to the EPA and continually demonstrate a
high level of performance in reducing emissions, implementing a variety of
technologies and practices, and supporting the program's activities,
initiatives, and outreach. 

Neil Ryan, regulatory manager for ExxonMobil's U.S. production operations,
accepted the award on October 20 in San Antonio, TX. 

ExxonMobil joined the EPA's Star Award program in 1995. Since then, ExxonMobil

21 billion cubic feet - the equivalent of removing more than 1.5 million
passenger cars from the road. 

Over the past five years, ExxonMobil has invested more than $1.5 billion in
activities that improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Globally, the company pursues initiatives to increase its own energy efficiency
in the short term; advance proven emissions-reducing technologies in the medium
term; and develop breakthrough, game-changing technologies for the long term.
These initiatives will reduce emissions generated by both ExxonMobil operations
and consumers.

&lt;p&gt;Prolifics to Resell RAVEN Visual Analyzer for IBM Rational Requirements Composer
EMERYVILLE, Calif. &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Ravenflow, the leader in visual requirements definition software, and Prolifics,
the world`s largest end-to-end systems integrator specializing in IBM
technologies, today announced the immediate availability of RAVEN Visual
Analyzer for IBM Rational Requirements Composer, a seamless embedded plug-in for
IBM Rational Requirements Composer (RRC) that improves the way stakeholders
elicit, specify, and validate business requirements. By visualizing and
validating requirements before developing, organizations can dramatically cut
implementation time and delivery cost. 

"Prolifics has been recognized and was recently named as an IBM Rational Award
winner for setting the standard for business excellence by delivering innovative
solutions enabled by IBM Rational software. RAVEN Visual Analyzer for Rational
Requirements Composer will definitely increase our customers` development
success rate by identifying missing or ambiguous requirements with their
stakeholders in the early phases of project discovery," said Nicolas Jabbour,
Chief Executive Officer of Prolifics. 

"Prolifics is 100% authorized as an IBM Software Reseller and 5 Star Partner
focused on delivering SOA and Portal applications using IBM Rational, WebSphere,
Tivoli, Lotus and Information Management. There is a good fit within many of the
diverse companies that Prolifics services for improving speed and clarity for
the business analyst with our RAVEN solution," said Susan Boers, President and
Chief Executive Officer of Ravenflow. 

IBM Rational Requirements Composer enables visual and textual requirements
definition in a collaborative environment,enabling business and IT stakeholders
to work more closely together as they capture business objectives and define
high quality software requirements. RAVEN Visual Analyzer allows users to
perform the following key functions directly within RRC:

* Automatically generate and insert business-friendly Activity Diagrams into any
of RRC`s requirements editors. 
* Analyze use case narratives, correct any errors, and insert the resulting
Activity Diagram in RRC. 
* Extend RAVEN-generated terms to the Enterprise Glossary that comes with RRC
for better consistency. 
* Highlight errors in process or use case text to help identify missing or
ambiguous requirements. 
* Preview RAVEN Activity Diagrams in a separate window then drag and drop them
into any RRC editor.

RAVEN users report a dramatic reduction in the total time it takes to define and
confirm business requirements with key stakeholders. Instead of weeks and
months, business requirements can be defined in just a number of days,
accelerating project schedules while increasing stakeholder confidence that the
application will be delivered as desired. RAVEN also helps produce higher
quality requirements, thereby reducing development costs by minimizing the
amount of rework required downstream. 

As part of the product launch Prolifics and Ravenflow are offering a series of
live webcasts that highlight the new capabilities. Registration for this webinar
series is open at www.ravenflow.com.

&lt;p&gt;East Coast Processing Center Configured to Handle Future of Digital Commerce
with Greater Capacity, Reliability and Security; Enhanced with New Operating
System
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a global payments technology company, today announced the
opening of a new global data processing center in North America. Concurrently,
Visa implemented several IT enhancements, chief among them the implementation of
a new operating system that underpins VisaNet, its global transaction processing
network. 

Together, these technology investments further enhance the flexibility,
reliability and scale of VisaNet, and increase Visa`s ability to process the
ever-growing number of increasingly complex electronic payments around the
world, which now account for 33 percent of global consumer spending. 1

* Greater reliability, capacity - The opening of the new center is a key
milestone in Visa`s multi-year technology upgrade, that results in Visa now
having two synchronized, secure and reliable data centers in North America, each
capable of carrying Visa`s entire global payments volume in the event of a
natural disaster or systems outage. Instant fail-over technology between Visa
data centers around the globe ensures the 5-nine level of uninterrupted service
that cardholders, merchants, governments and financial institutions have come to
expect from Visa. 
* New operating system - Developed in partnership with IBM, the system, known as
z Transaction Processing Facility (z/TPF), is a 64-bit operating system that
allows more information to be manipulated at once and perform more complex
processing functions in milliseconds. Importantly, this paves the way for Visa
to deliver new, information-intensive applications such as advanced fraud
analysis, and mobile payments and services. 
* Enhanced security - This centralized processing structure, combined with the
new operating system, provides Visa with a comprehensive view into the global
payment system, leading to high levels of intelligence around spending patterns,
enabling Visa to provide a broad range of information-based services, and
improving the company`s ability to detect and prevent fraud in near real-time.

"Visa`s commitment to continuous technology upgrades differentiates us from
competitors and helps Visa play a key role in facilitating the migration to
electronic payments. Few people recognize the critical role VisaNet plays in
supporting our extensive brand acceptance, securing our products and
facilitating payment innovation," said Mike Dreyer, Chief Information Officer,
Visa Inc. "As we activate our second new data center in four years and complete
a transition to the latest information technology, we are laying the foundation
for the future of Visa payments and related services." 

Data Center Expands Global Capacity, Flexibility

Located in the Eastern United States, Visa`s new data center is a 370,000 square
foot, state-of-art facility architected to support multiple authorization
engines and process hundreds of millions of transactions each day. With more
than 140,000 square feet of raised floor space the center houses some of the
payments industry`s most advanced payment processing services and is capable of
handling more than 10,000 transaction messages per second. 

Visa`s new processing center completes a global network of four data centers on
three continents connecting more than 16,000 financial institutions, and
millions of merchants and processing partners through more than 1,600 network
endpoints around the world. For the four quarters ended June 30, 2009, Visa`s
total volume was nearly $4.3 trillion dollars. With the growing worldwide
migration away from cash and checks and towards electronic payments being fueled
by new merchant acceptance locations, new products like mobile payments and
prepaid, and new services like money transfer, and mobile alerts and
notifications, the volume and complexity of Visa transactions are expected to
grow. 

New Operating System Boosts Visa`s Processing Power

Beyond its new data center, Visa has also recently implemented a new operating
system to enhance the processing capabilities of its authorization platform, the
Visa Integrated Payment platform (VIP). Visa selected the new IBM System z
Transaction Processing Facility (z/TPF), one of the most advanced operating
systems in the world for handling transaction-based computing tasks. The system
is specifically designed for ultra high capacity and high-availability, and for
systems designed for rapid expansion needed to handle high peak periods or
spikes of transaction activity. 

Visa partnered with IBM on the implementation of z/TPF and provided input on key
operating system features to ensure seamless integration with Visa`s payment
processing applications. Visa is the first large company to implement z/TPF. 

"The ability to provide a business platform that delivers a predictable and
dynamic environment for increased transaction volume is crucial to success in
commerce today," said Mark Anzani, IBM VP and chief technology officer for
System Z. "Visa has raised the standard for future transactions processing by
tapping the reliability and security of the new Z10 mainframe and the power of
the new z/TPF software to connect an ever-increasing number of merchants, banks
and consumers. " 

Annual VisaNet Stress Test Sets New Record

The new data center began processing transactions immediately following Visa`s
annual "stress testing" of its network. The testing is designed to simulate
extremely heavy transaction loads, well beyond those expected at the height of
the holiday shopping season, which is Visa`s busiest. 2

The stress test, conducted in an IBM facility configured to match an operational
Visa data center, confirmed that as currently configured, VisaNet has more than
sufficient capacity and processing power to support the busiest hour of the
busiest day projected for the year, even if an entire data center was to go
offline. 

Annual Software Update

In October, as part of its semiannual software update, Visa completed the
upgrade of its global payment platform, as well as introducing a number of
advanced processing capabilities. For this latest update, Visa programmers,
engineers and testers have invested more than 85,000 labor hours to create and
incorporate upgrades to VisaNet. That includes the addition of several new
currencies to the 175 for which Visa already processes transactions. 

As with past updates, these significant system changes and improvements were
made while VisaNet remained fully operational, ensuring that cardholders,
merchants and financial institutions could continue to rely on Visa to process
their transactions. 

Visa`s software updates improve the network in crucial areas such as security
while continually adding the technology to support the growth and complexity of
electronic payments. These include the development of information-based services
that help financial institutions provide more value to their cardholders and
increase loyalty; provide ways for businesses to use Visa to maintain greater
control and transparency over card spending; and help governments deliver
benefits with more efficiency and accountability. 

About Visa

businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries
and territories to fast, secure and reliable digital currency. Underpinning
digital currency is the world`s most advanced processing network-VisaNet-that is
capable of handling more than 10,000 transactions a second, with fraud

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, DASANI Products Debut in First Generation of PET Plastic Made
Partially from Plants
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company announced today that beverages in its innovative
PlantBottle packaging are beginning to arrive on store shelves in select markets
throughout the world, initiating the Company`s journey toward a goal of
producing 2 billion of the special PET plastic bottles by the end of 2010. 

PlantBottle PET plastic bottles are made partially from plants, which reduces
the Company`s dependence on a non-renewable resource - petroleum. Other benefits
are that it is 100 percent recyclable, and preliminary research indicates that
from the growing of the plant materials through to the production of the resin,
the carbon footprint for the PlantBottle packaging is smaller than for bottles
made with traditional PET. 

"Today, we are taking a major step along our sustainable packaging journey as
The Coca-Cola Company becomes the first-to-market with a recyclable PET plastic
bottle made partially from plants," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO, The
Coca-Cola Company. "From Coke brands in Copenhagen to DASANI water in the
Western United States, we are starting to roll out the first generation of the
bottle of the future." 

Throughout Denmark, Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light and Coca-Cola Zero in 500mL and
2L sizes are now available in the PlantBottle packaging. A variety of products,
including Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fresca and DASANI will be in Western Canada in the
PlantBottle beginning in December and for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic
Games. And for select markets in the Western United States, including Seattle,
San Francisco and Los Angeles, PlantBottle packaging will be used for sparkling
brands and DASANI in several sizes, starting in January. Future launches are
being planned in other markets, including Brazil, Japan and Mexico and for
China`s Shanghai Expo in 2010. 

PlantBottle samples also will be featured at the Company`s investor event, "A
Growing World of Refreshment, a 2020 Vision," which begins later today in
Atlanta. 

"The PlantBottle is precisely the kind of innovation that demonstrates how
businesses can help address climate change and reduce stress on our precious
natural resources," said Kate Krebs, Director of Sustainable Resources for The
Climate Group. "While Coca-Cola is just beginning to bring its plant-based PET
plastic into the mix, this is a revolutionary solution that has the potential
for long-term, meaningful benefits." 

PlantBottle packaging is currently made through a process that turns sugar cane
and molasses, a by-product of sugar production, into a key component for PET
plastic. The sugar cane being used comes from predominantly rain-fed crops that
were processed into ethanol, not refined sugar. Ultimately, the Company`s goal
is to use non-food, plant-based waste, such as wood chips or wheat stalks, to
produce recyclable PET plastic bottles. 

"Coca-Cola is currently sourcing raw materials for its PlantBottle from
suppliers in Brazil, where third parties have verified that best-in-class
agricultural practices are the norm," said Dr. Jason Clay, Senior Vice President
of Market Transformation for WWF. "Preserving natural resources through
sustainable agriculture is essential for businesses like Coca-Cola as they
search for ways to alleviate environmental challenges." 

While the bio-based component can account for up to 30 percent of the resulting
PET plastic in PlantBottle packaging, the percentage varies for bottles that
also contain recycled PET. For example, Denmark uses recycled content in its
PlantBottle packaging. The combined plant-based and recycled content makes up 65
percent of the material, with 50 percent coming from recycled material and 15
percent from plant-based material. 

For the PlantBottle packaging in the United States and Canada, up to 30 percent
of the content in the PET plastic comes from plants. 

"While the PlantBottle introduction and market launch put The Coca-Cola Company
on the forefront of bio-based packaging innovation, we are continuing to strive
to make an even better bottle," said Scott Vitters, Director of Sustainable
Packaging, The Coca-Cola Company. "Our vision is to continue innovating to
achieve a bottle that is made with 100 percent plant-waste material while
remaining completely recyclable." 

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is the world`s largest beverage company,
refreshing consumers with nearly 500 sparkling and still brands. Along with
Coca-Cola, recognized as the world`s most valuable brand, the Company`s
portfolio includes 12 other billion dollar brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta,
Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, Powerade, Minute Maid and Georgia Coffee.
Globally, we are the No. 1 provider of sparkling beverages, juices and juice
drinks and ready-to-drink teas and coffees. Through the world`s largest beverage
distribution system, consumers in more than 200 countries enjoy the Company`s
beverages at a rate of nearly 1.6 billion servings a day. With an enduring
commitment to building sustainable communities, our Company is focused on
initiatives that protect the environment, conserve resources and enhance the
economic development of the communities where we operate. For more information

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM launched a new cloud computing service on Monday, aiming to take on companies such as Amazon.com Inc, Google Inc, Microsoft Corp and Salesforce.com Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing allows companies to run software and store information in remote, large-scale data centers that can be accessed over the Internet. That means users can cut back on hardware, as well as space and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said it was launching a service called "Smart Analytics Cloud," its biggest cloud computing service yet and that it would first be adopted internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world's biggest technology services company, has lagged behind younger companies in rolling out cloud services. But it is still early days for the cloud industry, which Gartner Research estimates will ring up sales of about $3.4 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business interest in cloud computing has picked up since Amazon started offering storage and computing services over the Web about three years ago. Google and Salesforce are the other early leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando and Jim Finkle; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contactless PIN Pad Deployed with Major French Retailers
PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Cartes &amp; IDentification 2009 - Hypercom Corporation (NYSE: HYC) today announced
that its Wymix PIN Pad has received Visa payWave certification. The Wymix with
built-in contactless antenna can be used to process payments made by contactless
cards as well as NFC-enabled mobile handsets. The contactless Wymix PIN Pad is
deployed with major French retailers. 

Contactless payments provide key benefits to retailers and consumers in high
transaction volume environments where speed is of the essence, including
hypermarkets, quick-service restaurants and gas stations. The processing time
for contactless transactions is considerably shorter than for contact card
transactions, and the added convenience and efficiency this provides is
beneficial to both cardholders and merchants. Additionally, the speed provided
by contactless technology is projected to help drive the increased use of
loyalty and other value-add applications. 

Interest in contactless cards and mobile payment programs is increasing in many
European countries and various pilots are in progress throughout the region,
organized by banks, mobile phone and public transport operators. In France,
several major retailers have chosen to upgrade their systems using the Wymix PIN
pad in preparation for the upcoming roll out of contactless cards and NFC mobile
payment pilots. 

"Many of the top retailers in Europe are committed to deploying the most
innovative and cost effective electronic transaction solutions in their stores.
The speed, security and convenience of contactless payments coupled with
Hypercom`s Wynid Server and Wymix PIN Pad offer the retailer the state of the
art in card payment solutions and their customers faster check-out times and an
improved payment experience," said Kazem Aminaee, Managing Director, Southern
EMEA, Hypercom Corporation. 

Hypercom`s Wymix has already received several other international certifications
including MasterCard PayPass, PCI PED, and EMV Level 1 &amp; 2. For information on

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 16 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) launched a new
cloud computing service on Monday, aiming to take on companies
such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Google Inc (GOOG.O), Microsoft
Corp (MSFT.O) and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cloud computing allows companies to run software and store
information in remote, large-scale data centers that can be
accessed over the Internet. That means users can cut back on
hardware, as well as space and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp said it was launching
a service called "Smart Analytics Cloud," its biggest cloud
computing service yet and that it would first be adopted
internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM, the world's biggest technology services company, has
lagged behind younger companies in rolling out cloud services.
But it is still early days for the cloud industry, which
Gartner Research estimates will ring up sales of about $3.4
billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Business interest in cloud computing has picked up since
Amazon started offering storage and computing services over the
Web about three years ago. Google and Salesforce are the other
early leaders.

&lt;p&gt;The billboard ads may be telling you it's time to "Go Google" with your productivity apps, but most enterprises still use Microsoft Office, and are planning to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent survey of 2,000 IT decision-makers by research firm Forrester shows that 80 percent of companies surveyed support some version of Microsoft Office, and 78 percent have no plans for implementing an alternative to Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet this stronghold puts Microsoft in the driver's seat when it comes to negotiating Office licenses. As one product manager said in a new Forrester report that outlines best practices for enterprises working on a Microsoft Office strategy, "They [Microsoft] come across knowing they're in the catbird seat, so there are not a lot of concessions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system -- including hands-on reviews, video tutorials and advice on enterprise rollouts -- see CIO.com's Windows 7 Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Forrester report, author and analyst Sheri McLeish has some bits of advice for enterprises that want to improve worker efficiency using Office tools and become more confident at the negotiating table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how enterprises invest in Microsoft Office and utilize e-mail, word processing, spreadsheets, calendars and presentations, Forrester interviewed more than 20 IT professionals responsible for Microsoft Office strategy and contract negotiations in various industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrester then came up the following three best practices for getting the most out of Office investments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Categorize Workers by What They Need&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though most enterprises equip their workers with Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint, actual use of these tools varies, says Forrester. Some workers review content but don't create it and therefore dont need a full-featured word processor; some rarely use Excel or PowerPoint; some use e-mail and calendaring hourly, while others just a few times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Report author McLeish recommends segmenting your workforce based on their Office needs and usage to "build a case for everything from moving to cloud-based e-mail to re-evaluating enterprise licensing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fully comprehend Office wants and needs, enterprises should: Survey their workforce to find out what workers do with Office, where they use the tools (laptops? mobile devices?), and what other employees they work with; analyze survey results to gauge workers' attitudes and how they use Office tools and collaborate with each other; and tie survey data back to the business by figuring out such things as what percentage of your workforce does not need full Office functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Worker Data to Negotiate with Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how your workers use Microsoft Office will put enterprises in a better position to negotiate with Microsoft, or possibly even move to a Web-based or Open Office alternative, writes McLeish in the Forrester report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises may indeed decide to move off Office to something like Google Apps, but doing so before knowing if it will meet the needs of your workforce is reckless, writes McLeish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The economic downturn has spurred some companies to speed up their efforts to move off Office to save money," she writes. "But without knowledge of the workforce, IT pros find it difficult to develop a coherent Plan B to realistically move workers off of Office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you understand the needs of your workforce, you can demonstrate to Microsoft that you are truly planning for alternatives to Office. An example is deploying Office Standard or Agile -- instead of the more expensive Office Professional Plus -- and then using Google Apps for workers who mostly need e-mail and calendaring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forrester report stresses that IT decision-makers need to know the nuances of Microsoft's different license programs and should not underestimate their own negotiating power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft really wants your firm's business," writes McLeish. "Work with purchasing to make Microsoft prove why Office is a must-have for all of your workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrate Office Tools with other Business Apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've invested in Microsoft Office tools, Forrester recommends integrating it as much as possible with Sharepoint and whenever possible with business apps from SAP and Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forrester report claims that more training is needed on how to use Office tools, particularly how to integrate Office with collaboration software, Sharepoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's more opportunity than ever to improve collaboration with Office and Sharepoint, from publishing Excel files as Web pages to synchronizing calendars and contacts from Outlook," writes McLeish in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrester notes that to make the most of your Office investment, enterprises should remember that Office is more than just a set of productivity apps; it can also be a front end to business applications from SAP and Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A prime example is Duet," writes McLeish. "It's a joint product offered by Microsoft and SAP that allows workers to access numerous SAP functions directly from Office interfaces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) venture into cloud computing will be successful if most people don't even know it is there, the executive in charge of the initiative said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software company's new Windows Azure service, set to be launched on January 1, will run customers' applications on its servers and provide capacity through its massive datacenters, helping websites stay up through spikes in demand which might otherwise paralyze them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For consumers, the best result of cloud computing is that they don't notice it," Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's chief software architect, said in an interview at the company's annual developers conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Companies that are not in IT -- like retailers and manufacturing companies -- still deal with their customers on the web," said Ozzie. "Azure allows us to do the hard work of figuring out how to build those really high-scale systems that deal with all the consumers, and it lets businesses focus on what they are good at."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monday after Thanksgiving -- often the busiest Internet shopping day of the year -- is an example of when a company may suddenly need more servers to deal with purchases on its website, but can't afford to maintain those servers all year round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a consumer's perspective, when they hit the shopping cart online, they'll be able to complete the transaction," said Ozzie. "They won't lose that shopping cart and they won't have to hit that back button, and wonder 'Did the transaction go through?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health scares or disasters could be other times when website operators suddenly need more capacity to deal with demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What this cloud computing allows IT departments to do, is to just buy computing as you need it," said Ozzie. "If you have an application that you'd like to run and just try it a little, you only end up paying a little , and if your demand gets greater and greater, then we just turn up the dial and we give you more and more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW DIRECTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new approach -- giving developers a platform to write online applications, and renting out space in datacenters -- sounds like a radical departure for Microsoft, which has relied on selling packaged software for customers to install on their own machines for much of its growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ozzie says the focus on software, not how it is delivered, is the connecting strand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What made Microsoft what it is today is software," said Ozzie. "I don't think that there's some dramatic shift here in terms of value. Software at its core is what we are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie, 53, took over the chief software architect role in June 2006, when Chairman Bill Gates stepped back from day-to-day involvement in the company he co-founded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creator of the Lotus Notes e-mail application, regarded as one of the software industry's pantheon of pioneers, Ozzie has been the central force pushing Microsoft in the direction of cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His employees understand the need to change, but change itself has not been easy, said Ozzie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Change management is tough, always, in any industry, when you go from one generation of capabilities to another," said Ozzie. "The great thing about this transformation is that because we all use the web, we all use the Internet at home, people can understand it, pretty much every employee can understand why things are different now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was not always the case, said Ozzie, who remembers the days when it was not obvious that computing devices would become so central to communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course there's risk," in the shift to new technology models, said Ozzie, but the change won't be abrupt or wholesale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Customers are very pragmatic, they figure out the right way to connect the old with the new," he said. "For every given application, a camera, a phone, there's some good combination of software in the device and in the cloud. Making them work together is what we are trying to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. said on Tuesday that its upcoming Windows Azure cloud computing platform will come with marketplaces for both online apps built to run on Azure as well as datasets that companies can use to build their own apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PinPoint.com will host business-oriented apps developed by Microsoft partners, chief software architect Ray Ozzie said during a keynote speech at Microsoft's Professional Developers Conference 2009 (PDC09) in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PinPoint will compete with Salesforce.com Inc.'s 4-year-old AppExchange online marketplace and other more recently-emerging app stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azure will also host "an open catalog and marketplace for public and commercial data" codenamed Dallas , Ozzie said. Developers can use the data to build their own services and mashups. Dallas is now in Commercial Technical Preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also bolstering Azure with management tools for developers running .Net apps on-premises and with Azure that are less sexy, but arguably more essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Azure, meanwhile, will officially go into production on January 1, but customers won't be billed until February 1, Ozzie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azure will be hosted at three pairs of data centers: Chicago and San Antonio for North America, Dublin and Amsterdam for Europe, and Singapore and Hong Kong for Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azure will compete with Salesforce, Amazon.com and many other cloud platform providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key difference is that Azure, rather than dumping the desktop entirely for the Web, keeps the Windows operating system in the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vision of "three screens and the cloud" will allow developers to build apps that can be reused and delivered via the cloud (Windows Azure), on-premises server (Windows Server) or desktop (Windows 7), depending on what is most convenient or offers the best performance, Ozzie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to the cloud, bet on Windows," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate how far Windows Azure has come, Microsoft enlisted the aid of some traditional antagonists: Silicon Valley startups and the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Automattic Inc. is using Azure to host parts of its popular Wordpress blogging platform, said founder Matt Mullenweg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another San Franciso startup, Seesmic, is building a Twitter app running on Windows using Microsoft's Silverlight rich media player, said CEO Loic LeMeur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA is releasing 3D imagery from the Mars rover vehicle for free to the general public via the Dallas data feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal CIO Vivek Kundra said the government plans to accelerate the release of more data to the public. He likened the potential "explosion" of apps to the one that followed after the U.S. government liberalized the availability of GPS data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate that Azure can scale to needs, Microsoft's president of its Server  Tools Division, Bob Muglia, cited its Bing search app, which runs on more than 100,000 servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muglia also announced Project Sydney, which will allow companies to connect their own servers to Azure-based services. Sydney will go into beta next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Muglia announced a beta of an application server for Windows Server called AppFabric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AppFabric will help developers manage both on-premises servers and Azure cloud-based services. It includes features from the Dublin app server and the Velocity caching technology. AppFabric will go into beta next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil Giant`s Attempts to Evade Justice in Ecuadorian Rainforest Criticized Before
Congressional Ways &amp; Means Hearing
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
U.S. Congresswoman Linda Sanchez of California today urged Congress to reject
Chevron`s attempts to co-opt US foreign trade policy and programs so that the
company could gain an advantage in private litigation and to focus on the merits
of renewing trade preferences in testimony before the House Ways &amp; Means Trade
Subcommittee. 

Chevron has been aggressively lobbying Congress and the U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR) to punish Ecuador`s government, by eliminating trade
benefits the country receives under the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA), for
refusing to intervene in a private lawsuit between the company and more than
30,000 individuals living in communities where the company drilled for oil from
1964-1990. Chevron potentially faces $27.3 billion in damages for the
devastation that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Texaco, caused in Ecuador`s Amazon
rainforest to an area larger than the State of Rhode Island. 

"Instead of settling with the plaintiffs, embarking on clean-up efforts, or even
seeking mediation, Chevron has engaged in a lobbying effort that looks like
little more than extortion," Sanchez said in her testimony. "Apparently, if it
can`t get the outcome it wants from the Ecuadorian court system, Chevron will
use the US government to deny trade benefits until Ecuador cries uncle." 

In a Nov. 16th Politico article, Chevron spokesperson Kent Robertson admitted
that Chevron was extorting Ecuador, said Karen Hinton. Robertson said, "If we
were able to call a timeout and make the lawsuit disappear, then this entire
issue disappears." 

Sanchez noted that Chevron`s arguments run completely counter to the core
purpose of laws like the ATPA. Trade preferences should be used "as a hand up to
provide needed help to the families of developing nations, not a paddle to
punish governments who refuse to succumb to the demands of multi-billion dollar
corporations." 

Sanchez also made clear that, in the process of reforming America`s trade laws,
the criteria by which preferences are awarded ought to be modified to make
consideration of private litigation impermissible. "I hope that we also consider
whether to add environmental standards and to reform investor protection
provisions and examine which criteria, like private lawsuits, we should avoid.
We must examine our trade preferences with a focus on shared prosperity," she
said. 

Chevron is the largest company in Rep. Sanchez`s home state of California, and
the third largest company in America. It has formally admitted in the course of
litigation that Texaco dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic "produced
water" while it operated in Ecuador. An independent, court-appointed expert
found that the company abandoned at least 916 unlined, toxic waste pits covering
a region of almost 2,000 square miles, and that at least 1,401 people have died
from excess cancer deaths related to the contamination. The oil giant is on
track to spend more than $25 million on lobbying in 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Windows users running 64-bit versions of the operating system are less likely to get infected by attack code, Microsoft's security team said yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean they won't, countered an outside security researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"64-bit Windows has some of the lowest reported malware infection rates in the first half of 2009," said Joe Faulhaber of the Microsoft Malware Protection Center in a post to the group's blog yesterday. "64-bit malware is still exceedingly rare in the wild."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faulhaber cited statistics gleaned from Microsoft's Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRC), a free malware detection and deletion utility the company updates and pushes to users monthly. According to Microsoft's data, the 64-bit version of Windows XP was 48% less likely to be infected than the 32-bit edition during the first half of 2009; PCs running Vista 64-bit, meanwhile, were 35% less likely to be infected than Vista 32-bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7, which was not included in the data for the first half of this year because it had not been released in final form, also is available in both 32- and 64-bit editions. Faulhaber noted that Windows 7 64-bit is the dominant flavor of that new OS as he touted its security. "Most PCs shipping with Windows 7 come with the 64-bit versions of Windows," he observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 64-bit is safer to run, he argued, in large part because malware, which is written for the much more widely used 32-bit versions of Windows, is "confused by 64-bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not necessarily true, said Alfred Huger, formerly with Symantec and currently vice president of engineering at security start-up Immunet . "There's a lot of 64-bit malware," said Huger. "They can run their code in compatibility mode, or they can compile it for 64-bit. The reason they're not is that there's still not a lot of 64-bit deployment. There's 64-bit malware out there, just like there's Mac OS malware out there. But right now, [64-bit] is just not as opportune a target as 32-bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's relatively simple for criminals to customize their attacks against 64-bit systems, Huger maintained. "We almost never see just one [piece of malware] on a machine. It's almost always eight or ten or a dozen," he said. "Most malware gets on your system because you put it there, and one of the things most attacks do is download a bootstrapper that then downloads other malware. It's easy for attackers to have their bootstrapper check whether the OS is 64-bit, then grab 64-bit malware to download onto the PC."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, said Huger, there just isn't a "compelling reason" for hackers to bother with 64-bit, but there's nothing inherently more secure about a 64-bit operating system. "Malware is just software," he observed. "It can execute on 64-bit just like other software."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faulhaber argued that 64-bit Windows was safer by design than the less-powerful 32-bit version, ticking off such measures as PatchGuard, which makes it more difficult for malware to tamper with the operating system's kernel. PatchGuard is included in the 64-bit versions of XP, Vista and Windows 7. He also mentioned WOW64 (Windows On Windows 64), the lightweight emulation mode that lets 64-bit versions run 32-bit code. "The additional protections built into 64-bit Windows will make it harder for malware to make the 64-bit jump," Faulhaber said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Faulhaber trumpeted 64-bit XP's and Vista's -- and by extension, Windows 7's -- ability to sidestep more malware, the bi-annual Microsoft Security Intelligence Report he cited said that some of the lower infection rates might have nothing to do with the OS, and everything to do with the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infection rates for the 64-bit versions of Windows XP and Windows Vista are lower than for the corresponding 32-bit versions of those platforms, a difference that might be attributable to a higher level of technical expertise on the part of people who run 64-bit operating systems," the report concluded. "This difference may be expected to decrease as 64-bit computing continues to make inroads among mainstream users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor did Faulhaber go so far as to claim that 64-bit Windows, even Windows 7, was stout enough to do without security software. "64-bit Windows needs 64-bit anti-malware software like Microsoft Security Essentials to protect the whole computer," he acknowledged, touting his company's free security suite, which shipped in late September .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM announced Tuesday that its free Lotus Symphony office productivity suite is now available on Keepods -- thin USB devices made by the Italian company NSEC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Blue's Symphony suite is based on OpenOffice.org and includes word processing, spreadsheets and presentation creation. The new Keepod version, available through the Keepod store, employs VMware's ThinApp virtualization software, which wraps applications into an executable file that is isolated from a computer's operating system, mitigating compatibility and security concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keepods are roughly the size of a credit card and hold up to 16GB of data. Prices start at &#8364;19.90 (US$29.78) for a 2GB "Base" version. A 2GB Secure edition, which includes 256-bit AES hardware encryption, is priced at &#8364;69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a USB deployment option could make Symphony attractive to more users, Microsoft retains an iron grip on the office productivity market. Eighty percent of respondents polled for a Forrester Research report earlier this year said their companies were using some form of Office, and 78.4 percent had no plans to deploy any alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM does not formally track Symphony installs but estimates about 10 million people are using the software, said product manager Jeanette Barlow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many companies are still in the tire-kicking stage, running pilot programs or deploying the software on a departmental level, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Keepod announcement comes in response to "a huge push from enterprise customers for supporting mobile workers," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM expects interest in Symphony to jump significantly next year, when a new version based on the OpenOffice 3 codebase is released, according to Barlow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is set to move its Windows Azure cloud platform to a production environment stage, Ray Ozzie, Microsoft chief software architect, said on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On January 1, for the first time, Windows Azure will switch to a production service for paying customers," Ozzie said at the Microsoft PDC (Professional Developers Conference) in Los Angeles. Microsoft will execute its production systems and billing systems for Azure, Ozzie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Recently, a Unisys executive let slip that cloud computing can generate cost savings by cutting U.S.-based jobs. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual charges, however, will not accrue until February. Azure, introduced at the PDC in October 2008, has been in a community technology preview phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tens of thousands of developers have participated in the CTP and you've made a tremendous -- a tremendous -- impact on the product," Ozzie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He touched on ambitions for Azure, including the ability to run Java applications via the Apache Tomcat server and introduced an Azure subsystem codenamed Dallas, which features an marketplace for public and commercial data. "Dallas makes the whole world of data better than the sum of its parts by creating a uniform discovery mechanism for data," said Ozzie.&#160; Dallas, which Ozzie described as "data as a service," now heads to a CTP phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The magic of Dallas is about taking friction out of the process of discovery, exploring, and using data so you can create applications and experiences," said Dave Campbell, Microsoft technical fellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas data feeds will be discovered via a new service called Microsoft Pinpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wordpress was introduced as a user of Azure, as was Cheezburger Network, which will host its oddlyspecific.com Web site, pertaining to strange signage, on Azure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also introduced a beta release of Windows Server AppFabric, providing application services for developers to more easily deploy and manage applications spanning the server and the cloud. AppFabric combines hosting and caching technologies formerly codenamed Dublin and Velocity with the Windows Azure AppFabric Service Bus and AppFabric Access Control, formerly known as .Net Services.&#160; AppFabric technologies will be featured in Azure and Windows Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft sets Windows Azure production date," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has settled a lawsuit with a former employee that it once charged with fraud, misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither party has admitted to any wrongdoing and they will not reveal the details of the settlement, according to the former employee, Miki Mullor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal closes an unusual case in which Microsoft said that Mullor continued on as CEO of a company called Ancora while working at Microsoft. While Mullor was employed at Microsoft, Ancora accused several computer makers including Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba of infringing on a patent. The PC makers asked Microsoft to defend them since the technology was provided by Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancora said that the PC makers infringed on its patent in the way that they allowed customers to bypass the Windows activation process if they had bought computers that came with Windows preloaded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mullor said that before he took the job at Microsoft, he had pitched the activation bypass technology to the company during several meetings with a Microsoft lawyer and members of the company's antipiracy team. They said they weren't interested, he said. When he later took the job at Microsoft, Mullor claimed that he told Microsoft in writing about Ancora and the patent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft alleged that Mullor didn&#8217;t disclose his continued involvement with Ancora and thus breached his contract with the software giant. The company accused him of stealing confidential documents and failing to disclose his intentions about the patent infringement suit. It also said that it was entitled to a royalty-free license for Ancora&#8217;s patent because Mullor didn&#8217;t tell Microsoft that he knew about the patent, even though he knew Microsoft was working on similar technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial patent case filed by Ancora against the PC makers was transferred to Seattle and consolidated with the employment case. The settlement resolves all claims between all parties, Mullor said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mullor was chairman and founder of Ancora. A biography for him that was once on the company Web site said that he once served in the Israeli Military Intelligence and has a law degree from an Israeli university. He is not currently listed on the company Web site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it did not have any comment about the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Bank Failures Rise to 123

The failed banks were -- Century Bank, FSB of Sarasota, Florida with $728
million in assets and $631 million in deposits, Orion Bank of Naples, Florida
with about $2.7 billion in assets and $2.1 billion in deposits and Pacific Coast
National Bank of San Clemente, California with $134.4 million in assets and
$130.9 million in deposits. 

These bank failures represent another sizable impact on the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation`s (FDIC) fund for protecting customer accounts, as it has
been appointed receiver for these banks. The failure of Century Bank is expected
to cost the deposit insurance fund about $344 million, Orion Bank`s failure will
cost about $615 million and the failure of Pacific Coast National Bank is
expected to cost about $27.4 million. 

The FDIC insures deposits at 8,195 institutions with roughly $13.5 trillion in
assets. When a bank fails, it reimburses customers for deposits of up to
$250,000 per account. The outbreak of bank failures has significantly stretched
the regulator`s deposit insurance fund. At Jun 30, 2009, the fund corpus fell to
$10.4 billion, the lowest since 1993, from $13.0 billion in the prior quarter. 

IberiaBank, based in Lafayette, Louisiana will assume both Florida-based banks'
$2.731 billion in deposits. IberiaBank also entered into a loss-share agreement
with the FDIC on $656 million of Century Bank's assets and on $1.9 billion of
Orion Bank's assets. 

Tustin, California-based Sunwest Bank will assume all of Pacific Coast National
Bank's deposits and essentially all of its assets. 

In the second quarter of 2009, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 416 from 305 in the first quarter. This is the highest
since the savings and loan crisis in 1994. Increasing loan losses on commercial
real estate are expected to cause hundreds more bank failures in the next few
years. The FDIC anticipates the bank failures to cost about $100 billion over
the next four years. 

In order to replenish the declining fund, the FDIC board recently mandated the
U.S. banks to pay fees for three years in advance. Also, the regulators are
considering requesting the healthy banks to bail out the government soon as it
is necessary to replenish the deposit insurance fund, which has slipped to 0.22%
of insured deposits, below the mandated minimum of 1.15%. The FDIC also has
access to the Treasury Department credit line of up to $500 billion. 

The failure of Washington Mutual last year was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq:
FITB), Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq: ZION), SunTrust Banks (NYSE: STI) and PNC
Financial (NYSE: PNC).

Goldman Sachs People to Volunteer Skills to Small Business Owners
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) today announced the launch of 10,000
Small Businesses -- a $500 million initiative that will unlock the growth and
job-creation potential of 10,000 small businesses across the United States
through greater access to business education, mentors and networks, and
financial capital. It is based on the broadly held view of leading experts that
a combination of education, capital and support services best addresses the
barriers to growth for small businesses. Program highlights include:

* Business and Management Education: Small business owners will receive
practical business education delivered through partnerships between local
community colleges, universities and other institutions. 10,000 Small Businesses
will contribute $200 million to these partners to provide scholarships
predominantly to underserved small business owners and build educational
capacity. 
* Mentoring and Networking: Advice, technical assistance, and networking will be
offered to participating small business owners through partnerships with
national and local business organizations, as well as the people of Goldman
Sachs. 
* Access to Capital: Goldman Sachs will invest $300 million through a
combination of lending and philanthropic support to Community Development
Financial Institutions (CDFIs). The investment will increase the amount of
growth capital available to small businesses in underserved communities and
expand the capacity of the CDFIs to deliver enhanced technical assistance to
small businesses. 10,000 Small Businesses will provide technical assistance to
graduates of the program to help them access other sources of capital. 
* Advisory Council:10,000 Small Businesses will be guided by an Advisory Council
co-chaired by CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, Warren Buffett, and Dr. Michael Porter of
Harvard Business School. The Advisory Council will assist in the development,
execution and evaluation of the program.

In addition to the co-chairs, founding Council members include:

* George Boggs, President and CEO, American Association of Community Colleges 
* Dan Danner, President and CEO, National Federation of Independent Business 
* Glenn Hubbard, Dean, Columbia Business School 
* Robert Litan, Vice President for Research and Policy, Kauffman Foundation and
Senior Fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution 
* Marc H. Morial, President and CEO, National Urban League 
* Javier Palomarez, President and CEO, United States Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce (USHCC) 
* Hilary Pennington, Director of Education, Postsecondary Success and Special
Initiatives, Gates Foundation 
* Thomas S. Robertson, Dean, The Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania 
* Leonard Schlesinger, President, Babson College 
* Ellen Seidman, Vice President, National Policy and Partnership Development,
ShoreBank Corp. 
* David J. Skorton, President, Cornell University 
* Margaret Spellings, Former Secretary of Education 
* Thomas Tierney, Chairman and Co-Founder, The Bridgespan Group

"Small businesses play a vital role in creating jobs and growth in America`s
economy," said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs."We are
pleased to work with our partners in this initiative to support small business
owners, particularly those in underserved communities."

"Our recovery is dependent on hard working small business owners across America
who will create the jobs that America needs," said Warren Buffett, CEO of
Berkshire Hathaway. "I`m proud to be a part of this innovative program which
provides greater access to know-how and capital - two ingredients critical to
success."

"More than a decade of Inner City 100 winners demonstrate conclusively that
growing urban businesses can generate jobs and revitalize disadvantaged
communities," said Dr. Michael Porter, Founder and CEO, Initiative for a
Competitive Inner City; and Bishop William Lawrence University Professor,
Harvard Business School."The 10,000 Small Businesses program will meet a vital
need in disadvantaged communities, which is to provide the training, tools, and
relationships to help local entrepreneurs and their businesses grow and create a
self reinforcing cycle of economic opportunity."

"The $300 million this program is investing in CDFIs will make a significant
impact on CDFI financing for small businesses, particularly now," said Mark
Pinsky, President and CEO of the Opportunity Finance Network, the nation`s
leading network of CDFIs."This is the largest single-source pool of capital
dedicated to CDFI small business financing."

The first community college to participate will be LaGuardia Community College
in Queens, New York, which houses a Small Business Development Center. Classes
will begin in the spring of 2010. The first CDFI who will be receiving financing
from Goldman Sachs will be Seedco Financial Services, Inc., based in New York
City. Loans to underserved businesses in the New York area are expected to
commence in early 2010. 

10,000 Small Businesses, which has been in development for nearly a year,is a
five-year program modeled on the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women initiative, which
creates partnerships between academic institutions and non-profit entities to
provide a business and management education to women around the world. 10,000
Women is currently operating in 18 countries, where it is helping women
entrepreneurs create jobs and growth in their communities.

&lt;p&gt;Aussteller k&#246;nnen Visa-Kartenbesitzern mit dem Dienst mehr Kontrolle und
Gelassenheit verleihen - Verbraucher k&#246;nnen ihre Konten und Ausgaben besser
&#252;berwachen
SAN FRANCISCO &amp; PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Visa (NYSE: V), das f&#252;hrende Unternehmen f&#252;r globale Zahlungstechnologie, hat
heute die Einf&#252;hrung von Transaktionsbenachrichtigungen in Nordamerika bekannt
gegeben, wodurch Aussteller ihren Visa-Kunden in den USA und Kanada einen
Benachrichtigungsdienst praktisch in Echtzeit1 anbieten k&#246;nnen. Durch diesen
Dienst k&#246;nnen die Verbraucher ihre Ausgaben besser &#252;berwachen und verfolgen und
erhalten gleichzeitig ein Fr&#252;hwarnsystem bei potenziell missbr&#228;uchlichen
Aktivit&#228;ten. 

Die Benachrichtigungen im Namen der beteiligten Aussteller werden normalerweise
innerhalb von Sekunden nach Erfolgen einer Transaktion direkt &#252;ber VisaNet, das
globale Verarbeitungsnetzwerk von Visa, versendet. Die Benachrichtigungen werden
ausgel&#246;st, wenn eine Transaktion bestimmte vom Kontoinhaber ausgew&#228;hlte
Kriterien erf&#252;llt, und per E-Mail, SMS oder &#252;ber die Visa-Mobile-Anwendung
direkt an den Kontoinhaber versendet. Durch die Transaktionsbenachrichtigungen
von Visa k&#246;nnen Verbraucher ungew&#246;hnliche Aktivit&#228;ten auf ihren Konten
feststellen und sofort reagieren, wenn ihrer Meinung nach eine potenziell
missbr&#228;uchliche Transaktion vor sich geht. 

&#8222;Visa bef&#228;higt die Karteninhaber dazu, bei der Verwaltung und Sicherung ihres
Visa-Kontos eine aktive Rolle einzunehmen", sagte Elizabeth Buse, Leiterin
Produkte bei Visa Inc. &#8222;Visa bietet Finanzinstituten bei Transaktionen bereits
Risikobewertungen in Echtzeit, und nun bieten wir auch Karteninhabern
Transaktionsbenachrichtigungen beinahe in Echtzeit. Beteiligte
Visa-Karteninhaber erhalten im Normalfall eine Benachrichtigung, bevor sie das
Gesch&#228;ft verlassen, und nicht erst Stunden oder gar Tage sp&#228;ter." 

Laut einer k&#252;rzlich durchgef&#252;hrten Umfrage von Javelin Strategy &amp; Research
halten zwei von drei amerikanischen Konsumenten solche Benachrichtigungen f&#252;r
eine n&#252;tzliche und wertvolle Idee, und bis 2014 d&#252;rften 41 Prozent der Haushalte
mit Internetanschluss - das sind 62 Millionen - solche Finanz-Alerts erhalten.2

&#8222;Die Amerikaner sehnen sich nach Benachrichtigungen, die ihnen Vertrauen in die
Sicherheit ihres Geldes geben", sagte Mark Schwanhausser, Forschungsanalyst f&#252;r
mehrkanalige Finanzdienstleistungen bei Javelin Strategy &amp; Research. &#8222;Die beste
M&#246;glichkeit daf&#252;r ist die Bereitstellung von Informationen in Echtzeit, dank
derer die Verbraucher verd&#228;chtige Transaktionen rasch erkennen und darauf
reagieren k&#246;nnen - egal wo sie sich gerade befinden und wie sp&#228;t es ist. Banken
k&#246;nnen so das Selbstvertrauen ihrer Kunden aufbauen und auch das Vertrauen in
ihre Organisation festigen, indem sie f&#252;r Benachrichtigungen sorgen, die
zeitnah, einfach einzurichten und leicht zu verwalten sind." 

Benachrichtigungen w&#228;hrend laufender Transaktion erstellt

Die Benachrichtigung an die Kontoinhaber enth&#228;lt den Betrag, die Uhrzeit und das
Datum der Transaktion sowie Informationen zum H&#228;ndler, wie beispielsweise Name
und Ort. Wenn eine Transaktion offenbar irregul&#228;r ist, kann sich der
Kontoinhaber sofort an den Aussteller wenden, um weitere Transaktionen &#252;ber
dieses Konto zu blockieren. Transaktionsbenachrichtigungen sind dazu gedacht,
Betrugsf&#228;lle zu reduzieren und in Grenzen zu halten, indem die Verbraucher
beinahe in Echtzeit &#252;ber Belastungen ihres Kontos in Kenntnis gesetzt werden.
Indem sie potenziell missbr&#228;uchliche Transaktionen dadurch fr&#252;her erkennen,
k&#246;nnen Verbraucher und Finanzinstitute finanzielle Verluste vermeiden. 

Verbraucher k&#246;nnen sich &#252;ber beteiligte Aussteller f&#252;r diesen Dienst anmelden
und sich dabei entscheiden, f&#252;r welche Arten von Transaktionen sie eine
Benachrichtigung erhalten m&#246;chten. Zu den m&#246;glichen Transaktionskriterien f&#252;r
Visa-Karteninhaber geh&#246;rt Folgendes:

* Transaktionen &#252;ber der vom Karteninhaber angegebenen Ausgabelimits 
* Transaktionen aus dem Ausland 
* Transaktionen bei nicht vorliegender Karte, wie beispielsweise bei Eink&#228;ufen
im Internet oder per Telefon 
* Bargeldentnahmen von Geldautomaten 
* Abgelehnte Transaktionen 
* Benzintransaktionen

Karteninhaber begr&#252;&#223;en Verf&#252;gbarkeit und erh&#246;hten Schutz

In den vergangenen zw&#246;lf Monaten hat Visa solche Transaktionsbenachrichtigungen
zusammen mit acht f&#252;hrenden Finanzinstituten in Nordamerika und &#252;ber 2000
Teilnehmern getestet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Kundenzufriedenheit bei
denjenigen Banken, die Konten&#252;berwachungsfunktionen und Betrugsschutz &#252;ber
Mobilger&#228;te anboten, massiv zunahm. Im Anschluss an eine erfolgreiche Testphase
k&#252;ndigte Visa zudem vor Kurzem den Start einer erweiterten Visa-Mobile-Anwendung
in Zusammenarbeit mit der U.S. Bank an. Die Anwendung, die ausgew&#228;hlten Inhabern
von Debitkarten der U.S. Bank zur Verf&#252;gung steht, kann auf Mobilger&#228;te herunter
geladen werden und bietet Kontoinhabern Transaktionsbenachrichtigungen in
Echtzeit sowie bessere Funktionalit&#228;t und eine erweiterte Liste mit Angeboten
der U.S. Bank. 

&#220;ber Visa Inc.: Visa Inc. betreibt das weltweit gr&#246;&#223;te Netzwerk f&#252;r
elektronische Zahlungen aus dem Einzelhandel und bietet dabei
Verarbeitungsdienstleistungen und Zahlungsproduktplattformen an. Dazu z&#228;hlen

die &#252;ber die Marken Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink und PLUS angeboten werden.

SAN FRANCISCO et PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Visa (NYSE : V), la plus importante soci&#233;t&#233; internationale de technologies de
paiements, a annonc&#233; aujourd`hui le lancement nord-am&#233;ricain d`alertes de
transaction, gr&#226;ce auxquelles les &#233;metteurs peuvent envoyer des alertes en temps
quasi r&#233;el1 aux titulaires de compte Visa dans tous les &#201;tats-Unis et le Canada.
Ce service permet aux consommateurs de mieux g&#233;rer et suivre leurs d&#233;penses tout
en leur offrant un syst&#232;me d`avertissements anticip&#233;s d`&#233;ventuelles activit&#233;s
frauduleuses. 

Les alertes sont envoy&#233;es pour le compte des &#233;metteurs participant au service
directement &#224; partir de VisaNet, le r&#233;seau de traitement mondial de Visa, en
r&#232;gle g&#233;n&#233;rale dans les secondes suivant une transaction. Celles-ci sont
d&#233;clench&#233;es lorsqu`une transaction r&#233;pond &#224; certains crit&#232;res que le titulaire
du compte a choisis, et lui sont envoy&#233;es directement via e-mail, SMS ou
l`application Visa mobile. Gr&#226;ce aux alertes de transaction de Visa, les
consommateurs sont en mesure de surveiller leurs comptes pour v&#233;rifier qu`il n`y
a pas d`activit&#233;s inhabituelles et de prendre des mesures imm&#233;diates s`ils
croient qu`une transaction potentiellement frauduleuse a lieu. 

&#171; Visa donne la possibilit&#233; aux titulaires de cartes de jouer un r&#244;le actif dans
la gestion et la protection de leurs comptes Visa &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Elizabeth Buse,
responsable produit chez Visa Inc. &#171; Visa g&#233;n&#232;re d&#233;j&#224; des scores de risque de
transaction en temps r&#233;el aux institutions financi&#232;res, et nous offrons
d&#233;sormais aux titulaires de cartes des alertes de transaction en temps quasi
r&#233;el. Les titulaires de carte Visa participant au service peuvent en g&#233;n&#233;ral
recevoir des alertes avant de quitter le magasin, au lieu de quelques heures,
voire plusieurs jours apr&#232;s. &#187; 

Une &#233;tude r&#233;cente men&#233;e par Javelin Strategy &amp; Research a trouv&#233; que deux
Am&#233;ricains sur trois croient que les alertes financi&#232;res sont utiles et
pr&#233;cieuses, et que d`ici &#224; 2014, 41 % des foyers connect&#233;s &#224; Internet, soit 62
millions, recevront des alertes financi&#232;res.2

&#171; Les Am&#233;ricains ont soif d`alertes pouvant leur donner l`assurance que leur
argent est en s&#233;curit&#233; &#187;, a quant &#224; lui confi&#233; Mark Schwanhausser, analyste de
recherche, services financiers multicanaux chez Javelin Strategy &amp; Research. &#171;
La meilleure fa&#231;on d`y parvenir est d`envoyer des informations en temps r&#233;el
permettant aux consommateurs de rapidement analyser les transactions suspectes
et d`agir en cons&#233;quence, quels que soient l`heure et l`endroit o&#249; ils se
trouvent. Les banques peuvent rassurer leurs clients et gagner leur confiance en
leur fournissant des alertes sans d&#233;lai, qui sont simples &#224; configurer et
faciles &#224; g&#233;rer. &#187; 

Alertes g&#233;n&#233;r&#233;es lorsque la transaction est en cours

Le message d`alerte envoy&#233; aux titulaires de compte contient le montant, l`heure
et la date de la transaction, ainsi que des informations relatives au vendeur,
telles que le nom et l`adresse. Si la transaction para&#238;t irr&#233;guli&#232;re, le
titulaire du compte peut imm&#233;diatement contacter sa banque &#233;mettrice pour aider
&#224; stopper d`autres transactions sur son compte. Les alertes de transaction ont
pour but de contribuer &#224; r&#233;duire et att&#233;nuer la fraude en tenant les
consommateurs inform&#233;s des charges port&#233;es &#224; leurs comptes en temps quasi r&#233;el.
En identifiant les transactions potentiellement frauduleuses plus t&#244;t, les
consommateurs et les institutions financi&#232;res peuvent &#233;viter des pertes
financi&#232;res. 

Les consommateurs pourront s`abonner au service par l`interm&#233;diaire de leur
banque &#233;mettrice participante et choisir les types de transactions pour
lesquelles ils souhaitent recevoir des alertes. Les crit&#232;res d`alertes de
transaction que les porteurs de carte Visa peuvent choisir comprennent :

* Transactions d&#233;passant le seuil d`achat choisi par le porteur de carte 
* Transactions ayant comme origine un pays &#233;tranger 
* Transactions en absence de carte (les achats effectu&#233;s en ligne ou par
t&#233;l&#233;phone, par ex.) 
* Retraits d`argent aux distributeurs automatiques 
* Transactions refus&#233;es 
* Achats de carburant

Les porteurs de carte appr&#233;cient la disponibilit&#233; et la plus grande protection

Au cours des 12 derniers mois, Visa a fait des essais d`alertes de transaction
aupr&#232;s de huit institutions financi&#232;res nord-am&#233;ricaines de premier plan et plus
de 2 000 participants. Les r&#233;sultats ont montr&#233; que la satisfaction des
consommateurs avait consid&#233;rablement augment&#233; dans le cas de banques offrant des
capacit&#233;s de surveillance de compte et protection contre la fraude via des
appareils mobiles. Visa a r&#233;cemment annonc&#233; le lancement d`une application
optimis&#233;e Visa mobile aupr&#232;s de banques am&#233;ricaines suite au succ&#232;s remport&#233; par
le programme mobile pilote. L`application, qui est propos&#233;e aux porteurs de
carte bancaire de certaines banques am&#233;ricaines, est t&#233;l&#233;chargeable sur des
appareils mobiles et fournit aux titulaires de compte des alertes de transaction
en temps r&#233;el, une fonctionnalit&#233; encore plus grande et une liste plus longue
d`offres de banques am&#233;ricaines. 

&#192; propos de Visa Inc. : Visa Inc. exploite le plus vaste r&#233;seau au monde de

plateformes de paiement. Ceci comprend le cr&#233;dit &#224; la consommation, les

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM launched a new cloud computing service on Monday, aiming to take on companies such as Amazon.com Inc, Google Inc, Microsoft Corp and Salesforce.com Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing allows companies to run software and store information in remote, large-scale data centers that can be accessed over the Internet. That means users can cut back on hardware, as well as space and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said it was launching a service called "Smart Analytics Cloud," its biggest cloud computing service yet and that it would first be adopted internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world's biggest technology services company, has lagged behind younger companies in rolling out cloud services. But it is still early days for the cloud industry, which Gartner Research estimates will ring up sales of about $3.4 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business interest in cloud computing has picked up since Amazon started offering storage and computing services over the Web about three years ago. Google and Salesforce are the other early leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando and Jim Finkle; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cleantech Open says big partners needed for success&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * A "garage-to-Google" clean tech company deemed unlikely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron's $240 mln VC arm says portfolio doing well&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The venture capital arm
of Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has teamed up with a group promoting
clean technology that believes success for new ideas is far
more likely if established partners are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. oil company said it wants early
access to renewable energy technology through its partnership
with nonprofit group Cleantech Open, set up in 2006 to support
start-ups focused on energy, environmental and economic
challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group feels partners such as Chevron can offer both
advice and potential markets to entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cleantech Open Executive Director Rex Northen pointed out
that "clean tech isn't high tech" and therefore it was very
unlikely that renewable energy and energy efficiency players
would grow to a global scale by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't expect to see quite the same kind of growth from
a garage into Google," Northen said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Technology Ventures, the company's $240 million
venture capital division, dedicates a third of its capital to
renewables, with stakes in Southwest Windpower, solar company
BrightSource and biofuel companies Codexis, LS9 and Solazyme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trond Unneland, the VC arm's managing executive, said most
of the 34 companies in its portfolio were doing very well
despite a hostile economic environment and he had seen no
slowdown in its deal log.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A corporate venture capital team is even more attractive
in downturns because of the knowledge and link to a potential
customer," said Unneland, who could not comment on its returns
but noted his fund was in the top quartile among those tracked
by the National Venture Capital Association.

&lt;p&gt;World`s #1 Juice and Juice Drinks Company Unveils First Ever Uniform Packaging
Design for Core Juice Brands Including Minute Maid, Del Valle, Andina and Cappy


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today unveiled a new visual identity for key brands in the
Company`s extensive family of juice beverages. The uniform packaging design, to
be implemented across multiple brands and products worldwide, is part of the
Company`s comprehensive, strategic effort to expand its global leadership
position in the juice category. 

With more than 100 juice and juice drink brands available in 145 countries
worldwide, the Company`s share of this highly fragmented growth category has
nearly doubled over the past 10 years and its global juice volume is now twice
the size of its nearest competitor. The Coca-Cola Company has grown its
ready-to-drink juice and juice drinks business in the 10 years from 1998 to 2008
at an annual growth rate of 11 percent. The Company is the largest buyer of
fruit for juice consumption; buying one in six of all oranges processed for
juice. 

Based on extensive consumer research, the new visual identity was created to
enhance brand preference, improve shelf stand out, drive cost efficiencies and
create consistency across a world-leading family of juice brands and products. 

"The scale and magnitude of this worldwide rebranding effort is significant for
our juice business," said Guy Wollaert, General Manager, Global Juice Center,
The Coca-Cola Company. "Our new, uniform packaging design system unites key
brands in our juice portfolio, including Minute Maid, Del Valle, Andina and
Cappy, under a single, iconic brand identity." 

Reflecting the historic logo and color scheme of Minute Maid, the leading brand
in the Company`s juice portfolio, the redesigned packaging brings a cohesive,
unified look and feel to the Company`s global juice brand lineup. The modernized
design builds on elements of the Minute Maid visual identity, including the
black rectangle and white logotype lettering while adding a green horizon mark,
refreshing fruit photography and natural imagery to underscore the juice brands
as a source of delicious fruit. 

The new design also creates a coherent look on shelf when packages are placed
side-by-side to showcase the fruit. This further communicates the nutritional
goodness inherent in the juice and evokes the imagery of whole fruit as it might
be displayed in a produce aisle or farmers market. 

Creation of the new flexible and streamlined packaging system was led by the
in-house design group at Coca-Cola. "We started this process working closely
with the global juice team to understand the objectives and the strategy of
growing our juice business," said David Butler, VP of Design, The Coca-Cola
Company. "This scalable, common identity was created to address a business
challenge, not to simply update a package. This is truly designing on purpose." 

By uniting the juice brand portfolio under one scalable framework, new packaging
can be introduced quickly and efficiently, ensuring a consistent global design
that builds brand value while minimizing operating costs and increasing
productivity for local businesses worldwide. 

Beginning this month, consumers in the United States will be the first to
experience the dynamic changes in Minute Maid packaging, while consumers of
other juice brands in The Coca-Cola Company`s family of juice beverages, such as
Del Valle, Andina and Cappy, will experience the new designs in their local
markets through 2010. 

The new-look packaging graphics are the first in a series of important
milestones in a business strategy that will continue to strengthen the Company`s
position as the global leader in juice. In coming months, Coca-Cola will
implement new initiatives that will benefit local businesses and consumers
globally, including product innovations, sustainability efforts, strategic
partnerships and the debut of successful juice products in additional markets.

Coca-Cola Press Center at www.thecoca-colacompany.com. To learn more about the
Minute Maid brand, visit www.minutemaid.com.

refreshing consumers with nearly 500 sparkling and still brands. Along with
Coca-Cola, recognized as the world`s most valuable brand, the Company`s
portfolio includes 12 other billion dollar brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta,
Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, Powerade, Minute Maid and Georgia Coffee.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) on Monday revealed new investments in Nestle AG (NESN.VX) (NSRGY.PK) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and that it has nearly doubled its investment in Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing reporting U.S.-listed equity holdings as of September 30, Berkshire said it held 3.4 million American depositary receipts of Nestle, the world's largest foodmaker, worth $144.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reported owning 1.28 million shares of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest oil company, valued at $87.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire also boosted its stake in Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, 90 percent from three months earlier, to 37.8 million shares worth $1.86 billion from 19.9 million shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the companies are all household names, their shares have lagged the broader U.S. stock market since the market bottomed in March. Buffett favors undervalued stocks, and regularly buys even when economic conditions are weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The general market has rocketed higher, but it may be that these businesses haven't participated as well," said Justin Fuller, an analyst at Midway Capital Research  Management in Chicago and author of the Buffettologist.com blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire also reported new investments of $96.3 million in trash hauler Republic Services Inc (RSG.N), and $1.35 million in insurer Travelers Cos (TRV.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett, the world's second-richest person, does not publicly discuss what he is buying and selling, or ordinarily explain purchases and sales revealed in quarterly SEC filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday's SEC filing includes investments made by Berkshire subsidiaries, including a portfolio at the car insurer Geico Corp overseen by Lou Simpson. Buffett has said investors should not assume all the reported investment decisions are his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate SEC filing revealed that Berkshire had begun amassing its Exxon stake by the second quarter. The SEC occasionally lets Buffett delay disclosing investment activity so investors cannot copy him while he is buying and selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soros Asset Management, overseen by billionaire George Soros, in a separate SEC filing revealed a stake in Berkshire itself and increased stakes in many blue-chip companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHITHER KRAFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuller said the Nestle stake appears surprising given Berkshire's reported $3.63 billion stake in Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N, which last week launched a hostile bid for Britain's Cadbury Plc CBRY.L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet he said Nestle could help Berkshire "diversify away from Kraft. It is the classic Berkshire-type business in that it is easy to understand, and which has many good brands that people like to buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said the added Wal-Mart stake "makes more sense at a time consumers are more price-conscious," while the Exxon stake could be "indicative of Berkshire's large bet in energy. If you believe as Buffett does that more inflation is on the horizon, then it makes sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire this month agreed to buy the 77.4 percent of railroad operator Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp BNI.N it did not already own for $26.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Berkshire on Sept 30 still owned shares of railroad operators Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) and Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N), Buffett has said he has sold these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of Berkshire's disclosed portfolio of U.S.-listed equities grew 16 percent from the second quarter to $56.55 billion from $48.95 billion. Berkshire bought a net $1.45 billion of equities in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire also reported increased stakes in Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) and lowered stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips (COP.N), credit rater Moody's Corp (MCO.N), NRG Energy Inc (NRG.N), SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) and health insurer WellPoint Inc (WLP.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reported no stake in Eaton Corp (ETN.N), after holding 2 million shares of the manufacturer of hydraulics and electrical control systems three months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett has transformed Berkshire since 1965 into a roughly $160 billion conglomerate with close to 80 companies selling such things as candy, car insurance, ice cream and underwear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Monday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up $945 at $103,000, and its Class B shares rose $20.50 to $3,431.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Helping achieve the company`s founding vision of making networked computing
accessible to all, DisplayLink USB virtual graphics technology is enabling the
world`s first 10 seat thin client multi-user computing solution. By eliminating
the need for additional graphics hardware and simplifying setup to a quick USB
connection, it will be more affordable than ever for schools to allow multiple
people to access the computing resources of a single computer. 

DisplayLink`s industry-leading USB virtual graphics innovations allow a computer
to drive up to 10 monitors without additional video hardware in the host by
providing simple software in the host and USB virtual graphics technology in the
client. With Windows MultiPoint Server 2010, a host computer can drive an
individual desktop experience to each of the monitors. And there is no need for
a system administrator to be devoted to installation. 

"Up to 10 people can work and browse the Web at the same time," said Dennis
Crespo executive vice president of marketing and business development for
DisplayLink. "Thanks to the unsurpassed simplicity of our virtual graphics
technology and USB 2.0, we can offer a true multi-person plug-and-play solution
that`s easy to set up, manage and use in minutes." 

The ultra-convenient solution makes thin client computing more efficient and
faster to set up, while also potentially saving thousands of dollars compared to
traditional thin client solutions. It is ideal for education, emerging markets
and large multi-seat installations, where a complete PC for every person isn`t
affordable or practical. 

The DisplayLink USB virtual graphics technology for multi-user computing is
available through one of the world`s leading computer OEMs. It offers a true
zero client experience that eliminates the need for a full PC at the systems`
end points - and just requires peripherals, a thin client device, and a familiar
standard USB 2.0 cable instead of any proprietary connection technology. 

"We are pleased to support DisplayLink`s announcement to help extend the reach
of technology in learning environments like classrooms, labs and libraries by
allowing multiple users to leverage the resources of a single computer," said
Ira Snyder, general manager, Windows MultiPoint Server at Microsoft Corp. 

DisplayLink`s simple yet sophisticated hardware embedded in the client helps the
device deliver high performance at a low cost.

* By using familiar USB connectivity, DisplayLink eliminates the need for
running cables and installing multiple graphics cards in the host, therefore
allowing client computing to be powered by a host computer and sold at a
fraction of the cost of server architectures. 
* The low-power design helps the thin client device to operate on the bus power
of the USB instead of requiring an external power supply. 
* DisplayLink`s technology also helps ensure servers can support well over the
five seats typically supported by competing video-card-based multi-user
solutions.

Microsoft Windows MultiPoint Server 2010 is available through OEM computer
providers and will be available in Academic Volume Licensing in the first half
of 2010. More information about DisplayLink USB virtual graphics technology can
be found at www.displaylink.com/thin_client.html.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The criminal prosecution of Sergey Aleynikov, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc programer charged this past summer with stealing some of the computer code for the firm's high-frequency trading program, appears headed to a rather anti-climatic conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a court filing on Monday, federal prosecutors revealed that Aleynikov's attorney plans to seek a resolution of the case that could culminate in either a deferred prosecution agreement, or a plea to a reduced charge of a misdemeanor. Prosecutors say they intend to "evaluate'' the request for a deferred prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the anticipated request from Aleynikov's lawyer, Assistant US Attorney Joseph Facciponti asked a U.S. magistrate judge to extend the time that prosecutors must act to begin trying Aleynikov on the theft of trade secrets charge until December 16. Aleynikov was originally arrested and arraigned on the theft charge over the July 4th weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, in a deferred prosecution, a prosecutor will agree to dismiss all charges against a defendant if they fulfill certain requirements. Deferred prosecutions are often used in cases involving corporate frauds and sometimes for dealing with first offenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's arrest shined a spotlight on high-frequency trading and galvanized attention on this rapid-fire trading strategy, which is entirely dependent on sophisticated algorithm formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his arrest, prosecutors raised the possibility that Aleynikov might look to personally profit by either selling the allegedly pilfered trading code, or taking it with him to his new employer -- a high-frequency trading startup firm called Teza Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the apparent willingness of prosecutors to consider a deferred prosecution may be an indication that law enforcement has found no evidence that Aleynikov intended to sell the information he allegedly stole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matthew Goldstein; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

About Align Technology, Inc.

Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary
method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign
corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable
appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does
not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign
significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with
braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align
Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market
Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign,
Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.

&lt;p&gt;A Beijing court has ruled that Microsoft violated a Chinese company's intellectual property rights in a case over fonts used in past Windows operating systems, state media said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court this week ordered Microsoft to stop selling versions of Windows that use the Chinese fonts, state broadcaster CCTV said. Microsoft plans to appeal the case, a company representative said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling comes as Barack Obama visits China for his first time as U.S. president. The visit has brought renewed focus on tensions over piracy and the trade of high-tech products between the countries. A U.S. business association this week appealed to Obama for further efforts to protect intellectual property rights in China, where pirated copies of DVDs and computer software including Windows are widely sold on streets and in bazaars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft originally licensed Zhongyi's intellectual property more than a decade ago for use in the Chinese version of Windows 95, according to Zhongyi. Zhongyi argues that agreement applied only to Windows 95, but that Microsoft continued to use the intellectual property from Windows 98 to Windows XP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court reportedly also ruled that Microsoft's use of a Chinese input system from Zhongyi did not violate any licensing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft agrees with the court that the key in the two cases is a dispute over the scope of licensing agreements, the Microsoft representative said. But it disagrees with the ruling on the coverage of the agreements, which it believes also include its use of the fonts, the representative said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows XP is the most widely used OS in Chinese offices and homes, but countless users run pirated copies. Pirated versions of Windows 7 were on sale in one Beijing bazaar weeks before the software officially went on sale last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft offers Windows 7 in China for a lower price than in developed markets, and often labels its software "legal" to differentiate it from the pirated versions common in the country. Windows 7 Home Premium costs 699 yuan (US$103) in China, compared to $199.99 in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Rothesay Life, the Goldman Sachs-owned insurer, said it would insure pension benefits worth 370 million pounds for private equity firm CDC Group, boosting a long-stagnant pensions derisking market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, British corporates have sought to de-risk their pension schemes through pension buyouts, whereby insurers take assets and liabilities off a company's books and commit to pay future pensions for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy-in deals like this do much the same but keep pensioners tied to their existing scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the buy-in arrangement, CDC's assets will be retained by the scheme as collateral and invested in a portfolio of corporate bonds which will provide returns to Rothesay Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The returns will cover the cost of pension benefits as they arise, Rothesay said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, such transactions have been few and far between during 2009 as volatile markets have deterred trustees from striking deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The arrangement meets our objectives of removing the key risks of investment and longevity, insuring our liabilities... and obtaining collateral," said Nicholas Selbie, chairman of the trustees of the CDC Pensions Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC Group Plc is the British government-owned fund of funds investing in private equity funds focused on the emerging markets of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Rothesay Life completed the largest pension buy-in so far with a 1.9 billion pound transaction with the British pension schemes of RSA Insurance Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Raji Menon; editing by Simon Jessop)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Nov 17 (Reuters) - The European Union on Tuesday prolonged a freeze on visa restrictions for top officials from Belarus, but opted not to lift the sanctions entirely due to a lack of progress on political reform. The European Union imposed visa bans on Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and dozens of other officials after he was accused of rigging his 2006 re-election. The bans were suspended in October 2008 in order to encourage reforms. A statement approved by EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels said the suspension would be extended until October 2010 to encourage further democratic advances. A freeze on Belarus government assets in the European Union remains in place, as do visa restrictions on four officials linked to the disappearance of political activists, and on the head of the country's election commission. The EU statement said the recent release of political prisoners had raised the possibility of further cooperation between the EU and Belarus, which is a key transit route for Russian energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc. But the threat of sanctions will not be scrapped entirely given Belarus's lack of progress on democracy. The EU wants to see electoral reform and movement on human rights, including an end to crackdowns on political activity and the media. The EU statement said the sanctions would be reviewed by the Council of EU member states in October, and added: The Council may decide to reapply or lift travel restrictions at any time, in the light of actions by the Belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights. Lukashenko said in September he would not be forced into reforms by the European Union. He said he saw no need to change the country's electoral law and that he may run for a fourth term at presidential elections due in early 2011.

&lt;p&gt;Les produits Coca-Cola et DASANI font leur d&#233;but dans la premi&#232;re g&#233;n&#233;ration de
plastique PET d`origine partiellement v&#233;g&#233;tale
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company a annonc&#233; aujourd`hui que les boissons pr&#233;sent&#233;es dans son
emballage innovant PlantBottle commencent &#224; arriver en rayon dans certains
march&#233;s du monde, marquant le d&#233;but de l`effort de la compagnie vers un objectif
de production de 2 milliards de bouteilles en plastique de PET sp&#233;cial d`ici la
fin 2010. 

Les bouteilles en plastique PET PlantBottle sont en partie d`origine v&#233;g&#233;tale et
diminuent de ce fait la d&#233;pendance de la compagnie envers une ressource non
renouvelable, le p&#233;trole. Autre avantage, elle est 100 % recyclable, et les
premi&#232;res recherches indiquent que de la culture de la plante &#224; la production de
la r&#233;sine, l`empreinte carbone de l`emballage PlantBottle est inf&#233;rieure &#224; celle
des bouteilles en PET traditionnel. 

&#171; Nous accomplissons aujourd`hui un grand pas sur la voie de l`emballage
durable, The Coca-Cola Company &#233;tant la premi&#232;re &#224; commercialiser une bouteille
en plastique PET recyclable en partie d`origine v&#233;g&#233;tale &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Muhtar
Kent, pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral de The Coca-Cola Company. &#171; &#192; partir des
marques Coke &#224; Copenhague et de l`eau DASANI dans l`Ouest des &#201;tats-Unis, nous
commen&#231;ons le d&#233;ploiement de la premi&#232;re g&#233;n&#233;ration de la bouteille du futur. &#187; 

Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light et Coca-Cola Zero en format 500 ml et 2 l sont
d&#233;sormais disponibles dans tout le Danemark en emballage PlantBottle. Une gamme
de produits, dont Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fresca et DASANI, sera disponible dans
l`Ouest du Canada en PlantBottle &#224; partir de d&#233;cembre et aux Jeux olympiques
d`hiver 2010 de Vancouver. Et dans certains march&#233;s d&#233;termin&#233;s de l`Ouest des
&#201;tats-Unis, notamment Seattle, San Francisco et Los Angeles, l`emballage
PlantBottle sera utilis&#233; &#224; partir de janvier pour les marques de boisson gazeuse
et DASANI en plusieurs formats. Les lancements &#224; venir sont programm&#233;s sur
d`autres march&#233;s, notamment le Br&#233;sil, le Japon et le Mexique, ainsi qu`&#224;
l`occasion de l`Expo 2010 de Shanghai en Chine. 

Des &#233;chantillons de PlantBottle seront &#233;galement pr&#233;sent&#233;s &#224; l`occasion de la
r&#233;union avec les investisseurs de la compagnie, &#171; A Growing World of
Refreshment, a 2020 Vision &#187; (un monde de rafra&#238;chissement en croissance, une
vision pour 2020), qui d&#233;butera plus tard aujourd`hui &#224; Atlanta. 

&#171; La PlantBottle est le type m&#234;me d`innovation qui montre que les acteurs
&#233;conomiques peuvent contribuer &#224; r&#233;pondre au changement climatique et &#224; r&#233;duire
la sollicitation de nos pr&#233;cieuses ressources naturelles &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Kate
Krebs, directrice Sustainable Resources pour The Climate Group. &#171; Si Coca-Cola
commence &#224; peine &#224; ajouter son plastique PET &#224; base v&#233;g&#233;tale dans le m&#233;lange, il
s`agit bien d`une solution r&#233;volutionnaire qui offre un potentiel d`avantages
notables &#224; long terme. &#187; 

L`emballage PlantBottle est actuellement issu d`un processus de transformation
de la canne &#224; sucre et de m&#233;lasse, un d&#233;riv&#233; du sucre, en un constituant cl&#233; du
plastique de PET. La canne &#224; sucre utilis&#233;e &#224; cet effet provient de cultures
essentiellement arros&#233;es par la pluie qui sont transform&#233;es en &#233;thanol, et non
en sucre raffin&#233;. Au final, l`objectif de la compagnie est de faire appel &#224; des
d&#233;chets v&#233;g&#233;taux non alimentaires comme les copeaux de bois ou la paille de bl&#233;
pour produire des bouteilles en plastique PET recyclable. 

&#171; Coca-Cola s`approvisionne actuellement en mati&#232;re premi&#232;re destin&#233;e &#224; sa
PlantBottle aupr&#232;s de fournisseurs br&#233;siliens dont des organismes tiers ont
v&#233;rifi&#233; qu`ils appliquent des pratiques agricoles de premier ordre &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233;
Dr Jason Clay, le vice-pr&#233;sident directeur Transformation du march&#233; au WWF. &#171; La
pr&#233;servation des ressources naturelles par une agriculture durable est
indispensable pour des entreprises comme Coca-Cola d&#233;sireuses de trouver des
moyens d`att&#233;nuer les d&#233;fis environnementaux. &#187; 

Si le constituant d`origine biologique peut repr&#233;senter jusqu`&#224; 30 % du
plastique de PET r&#233;sultant dans l`emballage PlantBottle, le taux varie pour des
bouteilles qui contiennent aussi du PET recycl&#233;. Le Danemark utilise ainsi du
contenu recycl&#233; dans l`emballage PlantBottle. L`ensemble contenu d`origine
v&#233;g&#233;tale et recycl&#233; repr&#233;sente jusqu`&#224; 65 % du mat&#233;riau, dont 50 % est issu de
mat&#233;riau recycl&#233; et 15 % de mati&#232;re d`origine v&#233;g&#233;tale. 

Dans le cas de l`emballage PlantBottle aux &#201;tats-Unis et au Canada, jusqu`&#224; 30 %
du contenu du plastique de PET est d`origine v&#233;g&#233;tale. 

&#171; Tandis que l`introduction de la PlantBottle et son lancement sur le march&#233;
placent The Coca-Cola Company &#224; la pointe de l`emballage innovant d`origine
biologique, nous n`en continuons pas moins &#224; &#233;tudier une bouteille encore
meilleure &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Scott Vitters, directeur Sustainable Packaging de The
Coca-Cola Company. &#171; Notre vision consiste &#224; poursuivre dans l`innovation pour
produire une bouteille qui soit issue &#224; 100 % de d&#233;chets v&#233;g&#233;taux tout en
restant totalement recyclable. &#187;

&lt;p&gt;Service Enables Issuers to Provide Greater Control and Peace of Mind to Visa
Cardholders; Consumers Able to More Closely Monitor Accounts and Track Spending
SAN FRANCISCO &amp; PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Visa (NYSE:V), the leading global payments technology company, today announced
the North American rollout of transaction alerts, which allow issuers to provide
near real-time1 alerts to Visa account holders throughout the U.S. and Canada.
The service enables consumers to better manage and track their spending while
providing them with an early warning system for potential fraudulent activities.


Alerts are sent on behalf of participating issuers directly from VisaNet, Visa`s
global processing network, typically within seconds of a transaction occurring.
Alerts are triggered when the transaction meets certain criteria the account
holder has selected and are delivered directly to the account holder via email,
SMS text message or the Visa Mobile application. Visa`s transaction alerts let
consumers monitor their accounts for unusual activity and take immediate action
if they believe a potentially fraudulent transaction is taking place. 

"Visa is empowering cardholders to take an active role in managing and
protecting their Visa account," said Elizabeth Buse, head of product at Visa
Inc. "Visa already delivers real-time transaction risk scores to financial
institutions, and we are now providing cardholders with near real-time
transaction alerts. Participating Visa cardholders can typically receive alerts
before they walk out of the store, rather than hours or even days later." 

A recent study by Javelin Strategy &amp; Research found that two out of three
American consumers believe that financial alerts are useful and valuable, and
that by 2014, 41% of online households - or 62 million - will receive financial
alerts.2

"Americans hunger for alerts that give them confidence that their money is
safe," said Mark Schwanhausser, research analyst, multichannel financial
services at Javelin Strategy &amp; Research. "The best way to do that is by
delivering real-time information that enables consumers to quickly analyze
suspicious transactions and take action - no matter the time of day or where
they are. Banks can build their customers` confidence and earn their trust by
serving up alerts that are timely, simple to set up and easy to manage." 

Alerts generated while transaction is "in flight"

The alert message sent to account holders contains the amount, time and date of
the transaction, as well as information relating to the merchant, such as name
and location. If the transaction appears to be irregular, the account holder can
immediately contact their issuer to help stop further transactions on the
account. Transaction alerts are designed to help reduce and mitigate fraud by
making consumers aware of charges to their accounts in near real-time. By
identifying potentially fraudulent transactions earlier, consumers and financial
institutions can avoid financial losses. 

Consumers will be able to subscribe to the service through their participating
issuers and "opt in" to choose the kinds of transactions for which they wish to
receive alerts. Criteria for transaction alerts that Visa cardholders may choose
include:

* Transactions that exceed the purchase threshold chosen by the cardholder 
* Transactions initiated internationally 
* Card-not-present transactions, such as purchases made online or by telephone 
* Cash withdrawals from an ATM machine 
* Declined transactions 
* Gasoline transactions

Cardholders embrace availability, increased protection

Over the last 12 months, Visa trialed transaction alerts with eight leading
North American financial institutions and more than 2,000 participants. Results
showed that consumer satisfaction increased dramatically with banks that offered
account monitoring capabilities and fraud protection via mobile devices. Visa
recently announced the launch of an enhanced Visa Mobile application with U.S.
Bank following a successful mobile pilot program. The application, which is
available to select U.S. Bank debit cardholders, can be downloaded to mobile
devices and provides account holders real-time transaction alerts, even greater
functionality and an expanded list of U.S. Bank offers.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen has been diagnosed with lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 56-year-old Allen was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma earlier this month, according to a letter sent by his sister, Jody Allen, to employees of his investment company Vulcan. It is a non-Hodgkin's form of the disease. Allen left Microsoft in 1983 after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is tough news for Paul and the family. But for those who know Paul's story, you know he beat Hodgkin's a little more than 25 years ago and he is optimistic he can beat this, too," Jody Allen said in the e-mail, sent Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He continues to work and he has no plans to change his role at Vulcan," she added. Vulcan spokesman David Postman confirmed Jody Allen sent the e-mail on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Microsoft, Allen founded Vulcan and subsequently invested in DreamWorks SKG, Oxygen Media and cable provider Charter Communications. He owns the National Football League's Seattle Seahawks and the Portland Trail Blazers, a National Basketball Association team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jody Allen is president and CEO of Vulcan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The e-mail, which was first reported by Seattle's TechFlash blog, reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To employees of Vulcan and affiliates:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to let you know that Paul was recently diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He received the diagnosis early this month and has begun chemotherapy. Doctors say he has diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a relatively common form of lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is tough news for Paul and the family. But for those who know Paul's story, you know he beat Hodgkin's a little more than 25 years ago and he is optimistic he can beat this, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul is feeling OK and remains upbeat. He continues to work and he has no plans to change his role at Vulcan. His health comes first, though, and we'll be sure that nothing intrudes on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would ask you to respect Paul's privacy and not discuss this outside of the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please ask your EC member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for what I know will be all your good thoughts for Paul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jody&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Produtos Coca-Cola e DASANI utilizam a primeira gera&#231;&#227;o de pl&#225;stico PET de
origem parcialmente vegetal
ATLANTA, Ge&#243;rgia--(Business Wire)--
A Coca-Cola Company anunciou hoje que bebidas em sua inovadora embalagem
PlantBottle est&#227;o come&#231;ando a chegar &#224;s prateleiras em mercados selecionados de
todo o mundo. Isso marca o in&#237;cio da jornada da empresa rumo &#224; meta de produzir
dois bilh&#245;es de garrafas pl&#225;sticas tipo PET especiais at&#233; o final de 2010. 

As garrafas pl&#225;sticas tipo PET PlantBottle t&#234;m origem parcialmente vegetal, o
que reduz a depend&#234;ncia da empresa em rela&#231;&#227;o a um recurso n&#227;o-renov&#225;vel: o
petr&#243;leo. Outro benef&#237;cio &#233; o fato de se tratar de garrafas pl&#225;sticas 100%
recicl&#225;veis, e pesquisas preliminares indicam que, do cultivo das
mat&#233;rias-primas vegetais at&#233; a produ&#231;&#227;o da resina, a pegada de carbono da
PlantBottle &#233; menor que a pegada das garrafas PET convencionais. 

"Hoje estamos dando um grande passo em nossa jornada rumo &#224;s embalagens
sustent&#225;veis, e a The Coca-Cola Company &#233; a primeira empresa a introduzir no
mercado uma garrafa pl&#225;stica tipo PET de origem parcialmente vegetal", disse
Muhtar Kent, presidente do conselho e diretor executivo da The Coca-Cola

gasosas e a marca DASANI em diversos tamanhos. Futuros lan&#231;amentos est&#227;o sendo
planejados, em mercados como Brasil, Jap&#227;o, M&#233;xico e China, para a Expo Xangai,
que acontecer&#225; em 2010. 

Amostras da PlantBottle ser&#227;o apresentadas no evento da empresa para
investidores intitulado "A Growing World of Refreshment, a 2020 Vision" ("Um
mundo mais fresco: uma vis&#227;o para 2020"), que tem in&#237;cio hoje, em Atlanta. 

"A PlantBottle &#233; exatamente o tipo de inova&#231;&#227;o que demonstra como as empresas
podem ajudar a enfrentar as mudan&#231;as clim&#225;ticas e reduzir o estresse sobre os
nossos preciosos recursos naturais", afirmou Kate Krebs, diretora de recursos
sustent&#225;veis para o Grupo do Clima. "Embora a Coca-Cola esteja apenas come&#231;ando
a introduzir a garrafa pl&#225;stica tipo PET com origem vegetal em seu mix de
produtos, trata-se de uma solu&#231;&#227;o revolucion&#225;ria, que poder&#225; produzir benef&#237;cios
significativos a longo prazo." 

As embalagens PlantBottle s&#227;o fabricadas atualmente por um processo de
transforma&#231;&#227;o da cana-de-a&#231;&#250;car e do mela&#231;o, subproduto do a&#231;&#250;car, em um
componente essencial do pl&#225;stico tipo PET. A cana de a&#231;&#250;car utilizada na
fabrica&#231;&#227;o vem, predominantemente, de colheitas utilizadas no processamento do
etanol, n&#227;o de a&#231;&#250;car refinado. O objetivo final da empresa &#233; usar rejeitos de
origem vegetal n&#227;o-aliment&#237;cios, como cavacos de madeira ou talos de trigo, para
produzir garrafas pl&#225;sticas tipo PET recicl&#225;veis. 

"A Coca-Cola atualmente adquire mat&#233;rias-primas para a produ&#231;&#227;o da PlantBottle
de fornecedores brasileiros com as melhores pr&#225;ticas agr&#237;colas da categoria,
segundo inspe&#231;&#245;es realizadas por especialistas independentes", disse Jason Clay,
vice-presidente s&#234;nior de transforma&#231;&#227;o do mercado da WWF. "Preservar os
recursos naturais por meio da agricultura sustent&#225;vel &#233; fundamental para
empresas como a Coca-Cola, que est&#225; tentando amenizar os desafios ambientais." 

Embora o componente de origem biol&#243;gica possa representar at&#233; 30% no pl&#225;stico
tipo PET utilizado na embalagem PlantBlottle, esse &#237;ndice varia em garrafas que
j&#225; cont&#234;m PET reciclado. A Dinamarca, por exemplo, usa materiais reciclados em
suas embalagens PlantBottle. A combina&#231;&#227;o de materiais de origem vegetal e
reciclados chega a 65% da composi&#231;&#227;o das garrafas, na qual 50% vem de
recicl&#225;veis e 15% de material vegetal. 

Nos Estados Unidos e Canad&#225;, at&#233; 30% da composi&#231;&#227;o do pl&#225;stico tipo PET tem
origem vegetal. 

"Embora a introdu&#231;&#227;o e o lan&#231;amento da PlantBottle coloquem a The Coca-Cola
Company na vanguarda da inova&#231;&#227;o de embalagens com base em componentes
biol&#243;gicos, vamos continuar a nos esfor&#231;ar por fazer uma garrafa ainda melhor",
disse Scott Vitters, diretor de embalagens sustent&#225;veis da The Coca-Cola
Company. "Nossa vis&#227;o &#233; continuar inovando, para obter uma garrafa 100% composta
de rejeitos vegetais que se mantenha totalmente recicl&#225;vel."

Fans w&#228;hlen drei junge Menschen, die Coca-Cola auf beispielloser Reise 440.000 Kilometer rund um die Welt vertreten werden</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;Durch weltweite Online-Wahl gew&#228;hltes Trio wird 206 L&#228;nder in 365 Tagen
besuchen, um herauszufinden, was die Menschen gl&#252;cklich macht

ATLANTA, Georgia (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Drei junge Menschen haben einen der coolsten Jobs der Welt ergattert. Im Rahmen
der Expedition 206 von Coca-Cola wird das Team versuchen, 206 L&#228;nder und
Territorien, in denen Coca-Cola verkauft wird, zu besuchen und dabei mehr als
440.000 Kilometer in nur 365 Tagen zur&#252;ckzulegen. All dies geschieht mit der
Mission, herauszufinden, was Menschen gl&#252;cklich macht. 

Nach einer weltweiten Online-Abstimmung &#252;ber das Team der Gl&#252;cksbotschafter
wurden die drei Gewinner - Tony Martin, 29, geb&#252;rtig aus Washington, D.C., und
derzeit Kinderg&#228;rtner in M&#252;nchen, Kelly Ferris, 23, eine Universit&#228;tsstudentin
aus Br&#252;ssel, und Antonio Santiago, 24, ein Universit&#228;tsstudent aus Mexiko-City -
heute auf einer globalen Anlegerveranstaltung in der World of Coca-Cola in
Atlanta vorgestellt. 

Martin, Ferris und Santiago werden sich 2010 auf eins der ambitioniertesten
Reiseabenteuer aller Zeiten begeben und die &#8222;Open Happiness"-Kampagne von
Coca-Cola bei ihrem Besuch von Menschen verschiedener Kulturen zum Leben
erwecken, ihre Erfahrungen dokumentieren und Gl&#252;cksgeschichten mit der Welt
teilen. 

Die gesamte Reise kann online in Echtzeit &#252;ber den zentralen Anlaufpunkt der
Expedition, www.Expedition206.com, sowie auf Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr
und anderen sozialen Netzwerkseiten verfolgt werden. Die Fans werden dar&#252;ber
hinaus als &#8222;virtuelles Reiseb&#252;ro" agieren und dem Team helfen zu entscheiden,
wohin sie gehen, was sie tun und wen sie an jedem Zielort besuchen sollen. 

&#8222;Unser Ziel ist es, die Fans mit auf die Reise zu nehmen, indem wir soziale
Medienplattformen nutzen und sie so zu einem festen Bestandteil des Abenteuers
machen", sagte Clyde Tuggle, Senior Vice President Global Public Affairs and
Communications der Coca-Cola Company. &#8222;Die Magie von Expedition 206 liegt in
ihrem Potenzial, Menschen zu globalen Gespr&#228;chen zusammenzubringen und damit die
Geschichten des Gl&#252;cks und des Optimismus zu unterstreichen, die die Menschen
&#252;berall unbedingt erz&#228;hlen wollen." 

Die Expedition wird am 1. Januar 2010 in Madrid starten und am 31. Dezember 2010
in Atlanta enden. Sie wird in gro&#223;en und kleinen St&#228;dten Station machen,
Menschen und globale Gro&#223;ereignisse, wie die Olympischen Winterspiele 2010 in
Vancouver, Kanada, die FIFA Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft in S&#252;dafrika und die
Weltausstellung 2010 in Schanghai, China, besuchen. Auf dem Weg wird Coca-Cola
Menschen ausw&#228;hlen, die an den jeweiligen Destinationen als &#8222;Happiness Host"
(&#8222;Gl&#252;cksgastgeber") agieren, um das Team zu begr&#252;&#223;en und es bei seinen
Erkundungen zu leiten. 

&#8222;Tony, Antonio und ich haben eine wunderbare M&#246;glichkeit erhalten, und wir
freuen uns sehr darauf, endlich aufzubrechen, um Tausende von Menschen rund um
die Welt zu treffen", sagte Ferris, der in S&#252;dafrika geboren wurde und in
Belgien aufwuchs. &#8222;Es ist eine ambitionierte Aufgabe, aber ich kann mir keine
bessere M&#246;glichkeit vorstellen, ein Jahr zu verbringen, als damit,
herauszufinden, was Menschen gl&#252;cklich macht." 

&#8222;Ich kann noch immer nicht glauben, dass ich diese Chance meines Lebens erhalten
habe", f&#252;gte Tony Martin hinzu, der derzeit in M&#252;nchen lebt. &#8222;Wenn wir uns an
unseren Reiseverlauf halten, werden wir mit der Anzahl der L&#228;nder, die wir in
einem Jahr besuchen, einen neuen Weltrekord aufstellen. Ich habe schon
angefangen, meine Sachen zu packen." 

&#8222;Ich habe schon viel Zeit damit verbracht, mit meinen Freunden und anderen
Leuten online Kontakt aufzunehmen", sagte Antonio Santiago aus Mexiko-City.
&#8222;Diese Expedition wird mir die M&#246;glichkeit geben, meine Erfahrungen durch
Blog-Eintr&#228;ge, Fotos und Videos mit einem wahrhaft globalen Publikum zu teilen."


Im Rahmen seines ersten Arbeitstages gab das Team den Startschuss f&#252;r das
&#8222;Happiness Ambassador Training Camp", einer Mischung aus Spa&#223; und Schulungen,
die dazu da sind, die Teammitglieder auf die ein Jahr lang dauernde Reise ihres
Lebens vorzubereiten. Unter anderem wurde das Team von Marcus Shapiro, einem
Fitnessspezialisten f&#252;r Abenteuerreisen der in Atlanta ans&#228;ssigen Firma Fit For
Trips gecoacht. Er ging mit den Teammitgliedern eine &#220;bungsroutine durch und
lieferte Tipps, wie man w&#228;hrend der Reise mental und k&#246;rperlich gesund bleiben
kann. Nach einem Crash-Kurs zur Kunst des Speed-Packens pr&#228;sentierte der
Chefkoch Brian Whitcomb, ein distinguierter Absolvent der International School
of the Culinary Arts am Art Institute of Atlanta, eine Verkostung exotischer
Lebensmittel, um ihre Gaumen vorzubereiten. Die reisenden lernten dar&#252;ber hinaus
einige Schl&#252;ssels&#228;tze - einschlie&#223;lich &#8222;Was macht dich gl&#252;cklich?" - in einigen
der weltweit am h&#228;ufigsten gesprochenen Sprachen. Darum k&#252;mmerte sich
freundlicherweise Marc de Foucault vom Language Institute of Atlanta. Die
Vorbereitungen werden in n&#228;chsten Wochen bis hin zum Aufbruch des Teams
weitergehen.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft revealed on Wednesday ambitious plans for the next version of its Silverlight browser plug-in technology for rich Internet applications, including faster startup times and software development improvements as well as more capabilities for running applications outside of a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubbed Silverlight 4, a beta release of the upgrade was made available for download on Wednesday. A final release is due in the first half of next year. Silverlight 4 was discussed at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC) in Los Angeles. Company officials Wednesday also discussed Windows 7 and revealed the beta releases of Office 2010 and SharePoint Server 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ See InfoWorld's report on the July release of Silverlight 3. | For all the latest news from the Professional Developers Conference, check out InfoWorld's PDC page. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silverlight 4 features a 30-percent faster startup time and new profiling support, said Scott Guthrie, corporate vice president of the Microsoft .Net Developer Platform. Version 4 will support the same OSes and browsers as in previous releases as well as the Google Chrome browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're improving startup by more than 30 percent for common scenarios, sometimes up to 80 percent," Gutrhie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTML hosting capabilities are included in Silverlight 4. "You can actually now host HTML as a control within your applications," Guthire said. The upgrade also features other new controls and extends controls based on user requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Silverlight 4 and .Net Framework, an assembly can be compiled once and run on both technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out-of-browser improvements for Silverlight 4 include Windows APIs and notification popup support. Trusted applications can be run outside the Silverlight 4 sandbox on Windows and Mac systems, with a user consent dialog featured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other capabilities in Silverlight 4 include data-binding improvements, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and multicast support. REST enhancements are featured along with improvements pertaining to Windows Communication Foundation and rich Internet applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accompanying Silverlight 4 will be design improvements in the upcoming Visual Studio 2010 software development platform release, including a full WYSIWIG design surface as well as XAML and Intellisense capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better enable development of business applications, version 4 features support for programmatic printing, right-click support, and rich text editing as well as programmatic access to the clipboard and built-in mouse wheel support for Silverlight capabilities. Custom print dialogs are enabled also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're also adding features like implicit styling support so you can consistently style all the controls within your app," Guthrie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silverlight 4 offers access to microphones, Webcams, audio and video input and multicast streaming. Digital rights management is featured as well. Microsoft, Guthrie said, has been on "very fast release cadence" with Silverlight, offering the first three releases in the space of 22 months. Silverlight 4 continues this pattern, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installed on a reported 33 percent of interconnected devices worldwide, Silverlight is perhaps the most-formidable rival to the more-established Adobe Flash platform. Silverlight has been used for streaming of events such as the Winter Olympics and Sunday Night Football. "This provides one of the most immersive and engaging experiences on the Web," Guthrie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also showed a demonstration of Silverlight being used to read a product bar code, providing pricing information via a link to a Web service. Special effects were shown with Silverlight enabling picture distortions similar to a carnival funhouse mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its Silverlight efforts, Microsoft is offering its Internet Information Services (IIS) Media Services for "smooth streaming." The next version will enable streams to devices that do not support browser plug-ins, such as the Apple iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unusual expression of generosity Wednesday, Microsoft at the PDC in Los Angeles said it would give away PCs, specifically an Acer Aspire 1420P Convertible Tablet PC running Windows 7, to all paid attendees. Microsoft would not disclose the number of paid attendees or provide an estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other developments during the Wednesday morning keynote:&lt;/p&gt;

Microsoft announced release of public beta versions of the 2010 releases of Office, SharePoint Server, Visio, Project, Office Mobile and Office Web Apps. Features in the betas include Office Web Connector, providing social networking feeds into Outlook. An SDK for Outlook Social Connector is available as of Wednesday, Microsoft said
Microsoft said it would deliver Duet Enterprise for Microsoft SharePoint ad SAP, offering interoperability between the SharePoint and SAP. The package will be available in the second half of next year &lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft shows off Silverlight 4's feature list at PDC," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;As expected, Microsoft today launched its first public beta of Office 2010, posting the preview for download on its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a keynote presentation at its annual Professionals Developer Conference (PDC) in Los Angeles, Kurt DelBene, Microsoft's senior vice president of the Office business productivity group, announced the immediate availability of the Office 2010 Beta. "In the last few minutes, we have made available the public beta of Office 2010," said DelBene during his time on stage at PDC shortly after 1 p.m. ET. "It's now available on the Web, and we hope you all download it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft added a download link for the beta to its Web site Wednesday. Computerworld immediately began downloading the preview. Although the beta had not finished downloading as this story was filed and posted, Computerworld encountered no problem reaching the site, retrieving a product key or initiating the download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The download is for Office Professional Plus 2010, a feature-laden edition that will be available only to enterprises and organizations that purchase licenses in volume when the final suite ships next year. Office Professional Plus includes Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, OneNote, Access, Publisher, InfoPath, SharePoint Workspace -- formerly called Groove -- and Communicator. The 32-bit version of the English-language suite runs 685MB, while the 64-bit edition tips the scales at 750MB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who download Office 2010 Beta are provided with a 25-character product key to activate the preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Microsoft made the beta available to developers and IT professionals who subscribe to the MSDN (Microsoft Developers Network) and TechNet services, hinting that the public version's launch was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also launched a public beta of Office Web Apps, its entry into the online Web applications market. Two months ago, Microsoft cranked up an invitiation-only preview of the online editions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint, but delivered bare-bones versions. Word Web App, for instance, allowed testers only to view Word documents online, not edit them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who download Office 2010 Beta can try out the public preview of Office Web Apps by using a Windows Live account to create, edit, store and retrieve documents online. Office Web Apps require Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) or later on Windows; Firefox 3.5 or later on Windows, Mac and Linux; or Safari 4.0 or later on the Mac. Microsoft today launched a public beta of Office Mobile 2010 as well. That suite, which runs on Windows Mobile 6.5-based phones, includes scaled-back versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and new SharePoint Workspace Mobile 2010. It can be downloaded from the Windows Marketplace for Mobile , DelBene said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DelBene did not set a timetable for the release of Office 2010, keeping to the company line that the suite will ship in the first half of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;


		
        </body></entry><entry author="None" date="2009-11-19T00:17:40+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/idgSmallBusiness/idUS155561150520091119"><headline>Microsoft Office 2010: An Intriguing Beta</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;With the release of the Office 2010 beta, the general public finally gets to check out how Microsoft plans to deliver on its promises for the next edition of its flagship productivity suite--namely, close integration with lightweight Web versions of core apps (Excel and PowerPoint Web are the first to debut for consumers via Windows Live, with Word and OneNote available only in the business-oriented SharePoint 2010 server beta), better multimedia support, a subtle interface refresh, and a slew of features designed to make document creation and sharing easier. But there's some news too, most notably support within Outlook for tracking feeds from social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suitewide, the most immediately apparent change is the departure of the round Office button that brought up commands for saving and printing documents as well as for changing application-specific settings. Instead, Microsoft returns to a familiar menu convention: a File tab that brings up a full screen of commands and information. Microsoft calls this screen the Backstage View.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The left navigation bar in Backstage View holds many of the commands, but most of the real estate is devoted to big panes filled with document-specific items such as editing permissions, links to autosaved versions, file size, and even a thumbnail. (Businesses can customize Backstage View to integrate their workflow processes.) It's a nice idea in many ways--the ability to return to previous unsaved versions is especially good--but it can also be a bit disconcerting since you completely lose sight of the original document (except for the tiny thumbnail).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the cooler suitewide tweaks affects a simple task that most people perform every day: cutting and pasting text. Having observed that in many instances users immediately undo their paste, Microsoft engineers have added a paste-preview feature that lets you see the results before you commit (similar to the mouse-over previews of font changes and other edits available in the ribbon). You even get to choose between previews that apply different formatting options, either maintaining source formatting, merging with destination formatting, or removing all formatting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved picture-editing tools allow you to preview and apply cropping (and many new adjustments and effects) on the fly as you insert images into Office documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ribbon interface introduced in the key Office 2007 apps goes suitewide in Office 2010, with more contextual changes. Application icons are chunkier and restricted to one letter, which invites confusion in the case of PowerPoint and Publisher, and bemusement in the case of Outlook and OneNote (the latter's icon is the letter N, one leg of which looks like a 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other interface changes include a new color scheme, with classy muted grays that make the sky blues of past editions seem almost boisterous, and an orange logo instead of the multicolored one of years past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web Applications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office Web Apps collection, Microsoft's eagerly awaited answer to Google Docs, Zoho, and other Web-based productivity tools, is still a work in progress--not surprising since the current apps are prominently labeled as technical previews. Microsoft says that all of them will be finalized and available--to consumers via SkyDrive (Microsoft's free online file storage service) and to businesses via SharePoint 2010 server software--when Office 2010 ships in the first half of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, judging from the preview versions I tried through a SharePoint site that Microsoft set up for reviewers (and through the technical beta program on SkyDrive), they're no match for the competition. For example, Excel can't create charts, Word has no support for revision mode, and the slide-creation tools in PowerPoint pale next to the wealth of choices in Zoho Show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint's interface for document sharing isn't particularly intuitive: You can't create new documents on the Web (although Microsoft says eventually you'll be able to)--instead you must upload them from desktop apps. And regardless of location (SharePoint or Windows Live), Office Web Apps will work only with documents in Microsoft's XML file formats (.docx, .xlsx, and so on). But in my tests, at least, Office Web Apps generally delivered on fidelity, meaning that what you see online is what you get on the desktop and vice versa, which isn't always the case with other Web apps that support the Office formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though all Windows Live users will have access to Office Web Apps, the offerings' lack of features suggests that Microsoft isn't trying to create a Web-based productivity ecosystem so much as it is attempting to give customers a Microsoft option for basic editing when they don't have access to the desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starter Edition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other news relates to how Office 2010 will be delivered on new PCs. Instead of the free limited-period trial commonly available now, Microsoft will make a free, ad-supported Office Starter Edition available to PC manufacturers (this will replace Microsoft's low-end Works suite, too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's a stripped-down freebie, consisting of basic versions of Word and Excel that each lack three of the seven tabbed main-menu items in the full versions. In Starter, Word won't have the Reference, Review, and View tabs; Excel will omit Reference, Review, and Data. Both apps will have a taskbar on the right side containing a small ad toward the bottom for the full versions of Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More annoyingly, because the Starter apps don't support revision mode, you won't be able to accept, reject, or even delete revisions in documents created in the full versions of Office, which renders Starter Edition useless for any sort of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available Packages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is offering the 64-bit version of Office alongside the 32-bit version; you can make your choice during installation. The additional addressable memory that 64-bit PCs and apps support will primarily benefit people who work with huge spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally we liked the innovations of Office 2007 (although many other people did not). In this new version, Microsoft has made a lot of usability and design improvements that individually may not bowl anyone over, but as a package--especially as the Web apps mature--are solid and welcome. No pricing has been revealed for the editions announced earlier this year: Office Home and Student (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote), Office Home and Business (which adds Outlook), Office Professional (which adds Access and Publisher on top of the rest), and the two volume-licensing editions, Office Standard (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and Publisher) and Office Professional Plus (which builds on Standard by adding Business Contact Manager CRM features to Outlook, as well as Access, InfoPath, Communicator, SharePoint Workspace, and other enterprise-specific extras).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft doesn't make the cost of upgrading from 2007 prohibitive, I'd be inclined to move up to this new Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the venerable word processor, OpenType typography takes the spotlight in an Advanced font pane that supports new font-manipulation options, such as the ability to add ligatures and to choose from several style sets. For more-adventurous designers, a new Text Effects pane lets you apply artistic effects (fills, outlines, and the like) to any text--and still edit the text afterward, which you can't do with the Word Art in previous versions. (These features also appear in Publisher 2010.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching documents becomes easier with an upgraded Navigation bar that appears on the left when you initiate a search. Results from keyword searches appear highlighted in the main screen (a nicer experience than clicking Next to jump from location to location).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excel 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft continues to expand and refine the visualization tools in its popular spreadsheet application. The biggest innovation is a feature called Sparklines that lets you create miniature charts within a single cell, a way to instantly show multiple trends across several contiguous data sets. For sophisticated users, PivotTables and PivotCharts allow you to create highly customizable tables and charts from existing data sets with a few mouse clicks. While PivotCharts aren't new to Excel, the ability to create filters on the fly is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerPoint 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're giving a presentation to an army of laptop users, wouldn't it be nice if your presentation could appear--while still under your control--on the laptop displays of your audience (or, perhaps, on desktops in the room)? PowerPoint Broadcast Service, one of the more impressive PowerPoint innovations, lets you accomplish this with a minimum of fuss and nothing to install. Simply click on the Broadcast Slide Show button in the Slide Show ribbon, and PowerPoint uploads your presentation to Microsoft's free service and creates a link for distribution (via e-mail or copying) to your audience members. They then click on the link and see in their browser the same slideshow view that you do--with you driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embedding video in a presentation requires only a click or two, whether you're drawing from your own library or a site such as YouTube. Presentations using a Web video will warn you about the necessity of a live Internet connection; if you use your own video, PowerPoint permits you to edit it down to a desired length, add fade-ins and fade-outs, and otherwise perform minor editing tasks before packing it up with the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, PowerPoint jocks also get assorted new transitions to play with. My faves include Ferris Wheel, Shred, and Vortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OneNote 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OneNote, Microsoft's note-taking application, has acquired new powers in Office 2010, primarily through the addition of conduits that relay data from (or otherwise link it to) other applications. Among other things, you can send documents to OneNote using Office's print function, which presents OneNote as an alternative to hardware printers, PDF creators, and the like. If you choose that option, a dialog box appears showing your OneNote file structure, so you can place the content in the right location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also take notes in OneNote while working in Word, in PowerPoint, or on the Web. Clicking Linked Notes associates what you've written in OneNote to the location in the source document. Internet Explorer 8 has a similar feature, OneNote Linked Notes, under Tools (near the option to e-mail a page to OneNote).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's personal information manager receives a ribbon that fans of that type of interface will like and detractors won't. Several additional tweaks (support for transcription of voicemail, for example) depend on use of Microsoft Exchange and/or Communicator, but everyone can benefit from other new features such as a calendar preview (to check for conflicts when receiving invitations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More-dramatic changes are in Business Contact Manager, with assorted features designed to manage not only customers but also projects. Potentially the biggest news is Outlook Social Connector, a feature that's supposed to let you follow status updates from third-party social networks that create feeds using Microsoft APIs. The feeds will appear on the e-mail reading screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft continues to fight the good fight to make its database app more, well, accessible. In addition to new templates to help you get started, Access now offers Application Parts and Quick Start features to help you create database forms by picking and choosing the fields and features you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while it isn't listed with other Office Web Apps, Access now lets you create a Web database, either from scratch or by importing an existing one. This feature, however, depends on SharePoint support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/182393&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Nov 19 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's
largest drugmaker, plans to begin selling generic drugs in Japan
as early as 2011, the Nikkei business daily reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. company aims to have a line-up of more than 100
generic drugs in Japan, including 70 of its own patent-expired
drugs, the Nikkei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is considering manufacturing the products in India and
elsewhere, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Japanese market for generic drugs is estimated to be
worth around 400 billion yen ($4.5 billion) this year, the
business daily said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generics account for just one fifth of overall drug sales in
volume terms in Japan, compared with more than 50 percent in the
U.S. and European markets, the Nikkei said.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today claimed that its next browser, Internet Explorer 9 (IE9), has nearly closed the JavaScript performance gap between itself and rivals made by Mozilla and Google, even though the browser has been in development only a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft's president of Windows and Windows Live, acknowledged that Microsoft had catching up to do. "We know we have a lot of work to do in some areas of performance," Sinofsky said today at the Professional Developers Conference (PDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On SunSpider, we're on par with IE9," Sinofsky said, showing a chart that displayed scores from the popular JavaScript benchmarking suite. Although IE9's scores were still slightly higher -- and thus slower -- than the newest browsers from competitors, its numbers were significantly better than IE8, Microsoft's current production edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're getting very close to the other browsers," said Sinofsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news came as no surprise to Asa Dotzler, Mozilla's director of community development, who predicted Tuesday that Microsoft would tout performance gains in its next iteration of IE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft will demo an early build of IE9 that will feature an all new and super-fast JavaScript engine," Dotzler said in a blog post yesterday. "Microsoft dug a huge hole when it mostly abandoned IE6 and the Web from 2001 until 2006. Their early efforts at ramping back up with IE7 were a big disappointment to most Web developers and while their efforts with IE8 were much better, they're still at least a full generation behind the modern browsers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's IE8, and to an even greater extent, IE7 and the older-but-still-widely-used IE6, have been left in the dust on JavaScript performance by rivals, particularly Mozilla's Firefox, Google's Chrome and Apple's Safari. The latter two are built atop the open-source WebKit rendering engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the most recent SunSpider tests by Computerworld , for example, Chrome raced through the benchmarks about 10 times faster than IE8 , while Firefox was nearly four times faster. In the past, Microsoft has pooh-poohed JavaScript benchmarks, calling them nothing more than a "browser drag race" that doesn't accurately portray real-world use. Instead, Microsoft has used download tests of the 25 most popular Web destinations to claim IE8 is actually faster than Firefox or Chrome where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Sinofsky seemed to be dumping that stance, and instead bragged not only how much faster IE9 would be, but also that its Acid3 score had improved. "We need to do a better job on Acid3," Sinofsky admitted. "We have made some improvements in IE9, which now scores 32 out of 100." IE8, he said, scored 24 out of a possible 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Acid3 benchmark checks how closely a browser follows certain standards, particularly specifications for Web 2.0 applications, as well as standards related to DOM (Document Object Model), CSS2 (Cascading Style Sheets) and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other browsers, however, have long been able to max out on the Acid3 test. Current builds of Chrome, Safari and Opera all score 100, while Firefox 3.6, which is still in beta, makes it to 92 out of 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky did not talk about a release schedule for IE9, or when a public preview would be available -- killing rumors that had circulated earlier this week that Microsoft might issue an early build to PDC attendees -- saying that the new browser had been in development only for the "last three weeks, since we released Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking a released build, it was impossible to confirm Sinofsky's claims of IE9's JavaScript and Acid3 improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * FDA panel: Pfizer's Prevnar 13 safe, effective&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * FDA decision due by late December&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer shares gain 1.4 pct
 (Recasts; Adds panel member quotes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BETHESDA, Md., Nov 18 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) won a
key endorsement on Wednesday for a new version of a blockbuster
vaccine that fights pneumonia, meningitis and other diseases
caused by pneumococcus bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted
10-1 the Prevnar 13 vaccine was safe and effective for infants
and toddlers. The vaccine is the most important experimental
product the company acquired in its recent purchase of Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDA usually approves products that win support from
advisory panels. A decision on Prevnar 13 is due by Dec. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The vaccine is designed to fight 13 forms of a bacterium
called streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The original Prevnar, which targets seven strains, was
introduced in 2000 and has annual sales around $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's recent $67-billion purchase of Wyeth helped the
the world's largest drugmaker diversify in the areas of
vaccines and injectable biotechnology medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Company officials who argued in favor of Prevnar 13 to the
FDA panel said the incidence of pneumococcal disease in
children under five had dropped sharply after the introduction
of the original vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They estimated the added protection from Prevnar 13 could
reduce deaths from pneumococcus by an extra 9,800 over 10
years. The new vaccine targets a strain called 19A that has
emerged as the most common cause of pneumococcal infection in
the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're very gratified to have achieved a positive
recommendation," Dr. Emilio Emini, Pfizer's chief scientific
officer for vaccine research, said after the panel ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FDA reviewers said some measurements used in a Pfizer study
failed to show the vaccine was equivalent to the original
Prevnar for three of the strains. Panel members said they felt
confident Prevnar 13 would be effective based on levels of
infection-fighting antibodies that were seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pamela McInnes, a researcher at the National Institutes of
Health, said there were "quite compelling data in terms of
functional antibodies. I'm very persuaded by that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Potential side effects were similar with Prevnar 13 and the
original shot and included tenderness at the injection site and
irritability. Both vaccines require a total of four injections
given at two, four, six and 12 to 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vicky Debold, the panel's consumer representative and sole
vote against Prevnar 13, questioned if the risks were fully
understood as potential side effects were compared with the
original Prevnar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm having a really hard time understanding how we can
understand safety comparing Prevnar 13 to Prevnar," said
Debold, director of patient safety at the National Vaccine
Information Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prevnar 13 also is being studied for potential use in
adults, a new use that could accelerate already booming sales
of the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pneumonia caused by the pneumococcal organism is one of the
biggest causes of death in older people and its incidence
begins to increase after age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) has a rival vaccine, called
Synflorix, that is active against 10 strains. Synflorix is
approved in Europe and some other markets, but not the United
States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merck (MRK.N) also sells the Pneumovax 23 vaccine, which
fights 23 types of pneumococcus and is the only vaccine of its
type that is FDA-approved for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares gained 1.4 percent to close at $18.19 on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) acquisition of Washington Mutual Inc's WAMUQ.PK assets last year could still cause some headaches for Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, according to bank analyst Paul Miller at FBR Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Jamie's going to have some problems with the WaMu acquisition," Miller said at the Reuters Global Finance Summit in New York on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan earlier this month finished converting WaMu accounts to its systems but Miller questioned the success of this conversion, particularly regarding the failed Seattle thrift's mortgage servicing unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've been told it's one system or platform but I doubt that's really true," he said. "The servicing side is a big operational risk," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soaring losses from mortgages and home equity loans felled WaMu last September. JPMorgan snapped up its banking operations from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in a $1.9 billion deal that immediately boosted the New York bank's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Miller voiced skepticism about the benefits of the deal. "Managing the overall risk of the business relationships of WaMu is probably also going to cause trouble," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of people think Jamie got WaMu for free but I think when the day is done -- and that's going to be years, not tomorrow ... there's going to be some discussion about (whether he should) have done WaMu and how much money did he lose at WaMu," Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for JPMorgan declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

Mixed News for Credit Card Issuers

U.S. credit card issuers have reported a drop in the default rate for October,
though delinquencies are rising as a result of continuing stress on consumers.
While a decrease in the default rate reflects a decline in late payments in the
first half of the year, the increase in delinquencies is bad news for the sector
as it implies that the companies could experience more charge-offs in the coming
quarters. 

Consumers remain under stress as a result of the weakness in the housing market,
combined with job losses. Recently, Fitch has also expressed its concern about
the credit card issuers in the U.S. Fitch expects U.S. credit card issuers`
earnings to remain challenged over the near term as a result of soaring
unemployment, bankruptcies and losses. 

The default rate (or charge-off rate) has improved in October from the prior
month. For American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) it was down 60 basis points (bps) to
7.8%, while for Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) the rate dropped 103 bps to
13.22% in October. The situation was the same for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:
JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) and Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF).
JPMorgan`s default rate declined 10 bps to 8.02%, Citigroup`s defaults fell 136
bps to 8.79% and Capital One's charge-off rate decreased 73 bps to 9.04%. 

However, we are concerned about the rise in delinquencies which increased 34
basis points to 5.72% in October at Capital One, 26 bps to 4.95% at JPMorgan and
6 bps to 7.59% at Bank of America. However, delinquencies remain unchanged at
American Express.

BofA Continues CEO Hunt

Recently, William Demchak of the PNC Financial Services (NYSE: PNC) was offered
the position of the next CEO of the Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). However, the
offer was turned down by Demchak. 

We suspect Demchak declined the offer as the pay package is likely to be among
the least competitive in the industry, especially since the Obama
administration's pay czar took the axe to seven institutions' pay plans,
chopping the average high-end salary by 50%. Moreover, the bank is also
operating under a memorandum of understanding with regulators, who are
scrutinizing the top gun's every decision. 

The present CEO of the Bank of America, Mr. Ken Lewis, is set to leave the
position, stepping down at the end of the year. It may be noted that he
succumbed to the pressure to resign after his company`s Merrill Lynch
acquisition. 

Earlier this month, Robert Kelly of the Bank of New York Mellon Corp (NYSE: BK)
was offered the role of CEO by the bank. Former Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz
is among those reportedly approached who turned down the CEO job offer, as did
MasterCard (NYSE: MA) President Ajay Banga. Others may include Moffett and
Charlie Scharf, who runs JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE: JPM) retail operations, among
others.

&lt;p&gt;See the Bottle-Capping Video on youtube.com
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
It was literally a refreshing day in July as cranes from ALL Crane Rental of
Georgia, Inc. hoisted the entire top, complete with red cap, onto the new,
interactive, 49-foot-tall Coca-Cola bottle above left field at the Atlanta
Braves` Turner Field. The Austell, Georgia-based crane company is a member of
the ALL Family of Companies. 

Because of the size of the bottle sections and the layout of Turner Field, two
hydraulic truck cranes were required to make the challenging lifts. First, a
75-ton Link-Belt HTC-8675 situated outside the courtyard at Turner Field picked
up the sections from the staging area on the street and moved them into
position. Then a 90-ton Link-Belt HTC-8690 set the sections in place,
successfully overcoming the fact that the lifts were "blind"-that is, the
operator could not see the landing spot over the stadium structure. With the
assistance of a flagger, the operator was able to finesse the final picks. 

The tight layout of the job could have been a problem, but ALL had the right
cranes for the job and expert rigging. "It`s another example of our `No Job Too
Tough` philosophy," says ALL Georgia sales representative Jesse Irwin. 

The new, three-dimensional polycarbonate bottle replaces the original 42-foot
Coca-Cola Sky Field bottle that graced the ballpark for 12 years and was retired
in July 2009. Now it features a fully programmable, high-resolution screen in
the area where the label would be. The bottle`s framework incorporates 3,000
light-emitting diodes that can create 16 million colors, and the excitement
continues as fireworks pour out of the top after each Braves home run and
winning game.

&lt;p&gt;First Program That Bundles Alerts, Offers and Locator Service to U.S. Bank Visa
Cardholders
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
U.S. Bank, lead bank of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) and Visa (NYSE:V), a global
leader in payments, announced that Visa Mobile is now available to select U.S.
Bank debit card holders. Visa Mobile is the first application to bundle alerts,
offers, and a locator service. The alerts provide an added layer of security
plus enable cardholders to manage their U.S. Bank Visa accounts with near-real
time updates. The application can be downloaded to mobile devices powered by
Android, the Open Handset Alliance`s open source platform for mobile devices. 

"We view the launch of Visa Mobile for U.S. Bank Visa cardholders as an
excellent opportunity to enhance the consumer payment experience," said Dominic
Venturo, chief innovation officer for retail payment solutions at U.S. Bank.
"Visa Mobile empowers our customers to actively monitor their spending and
manage their accounts through near-real time alerts, and to take advantage of
merchant offers that are uniquely targeted to match their lifestyle." 

The Visa Mobile application, which made its debut in the fall of 2008, has been
enhanced for the launch with U.S. Bank, providing account holders with even
greater functionality, more information about their Visa accounts, and greater
choice in the type of merchant offers they can take advantage of.

* Alerts - Visa account holders are able to choose from an expanded list of
preferences for when they would like to be notified of account activity. Those
preferences include transaction amount, international transactions, gasoline
purchases, declined transactions and card not present transactions such as
ecommerce purchases. Cardholders are notified in near-real time of account
activity, typically within seconds of completing a purchase. 
* Offers - Account holders can choose from an expanded list of merchant
categories they would like to receive offers from, including electronics,
convenience stores, entertainment, flowers and gifts, gas stations, travel,
health and beauty. A number of merchants are already making offers available to
Visa Mobile users such as Club TeeTime, FragranceNet.com, Omaha Steaks, Papa
John`s Pizza, and Planet Hollywood. 
* Locator - Locating merchants where Visa Mobile users can redeem offers or
filtering down to find near-by U.S. Bank ATMs is aided through the use of
location-based services. Merchant offers can be embedded with a link to Google
Maps and directions to the nearest retail location where Visa account holders
can redeem that offer.

"More and more consumers around the globe rely on their mobile device as an
everyday financial tool," said Tim Attinger, head of product innovation at Visa
Inc. "We are pleased to offer Visa Mobile through Android-enabled devices and
bring an added layer of security and convenience to everyday Visa transactions."


The Federal Reserve projects that by 2015, mobile financial services will
overtake the online channel as the primary means of interaction between banks
and customers. Additionally, a recent survey of more than 1,000 U.S. consumers
conducted by Visa and strategy consulting firm Mercatus LLC found that mobile
capabilities is currently second only to ATM availability as the most
influential delivery channel when selecting a bank`s offer. 

The latest enhancements to Visa Mobile further underscore Visa`s commitment to
extending the reach of its global network to deliver payment products and
services to the more than four billion mobile devices in market around the
globe. Visa will continue to work in collaboration with financial institutions,
wireless operators, handset manufacturers and technology providers to develop
and test innovative mobile payment solutions in four key areas - Payments, Money
Transfer, Alerts, and Marketing. For more information about Visa Mobile, please

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has been ordered by a Chinese court to stop selling versions of its Windows operating systems that include fonts designed by a local company, citing a violation of licensing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruling, issued by Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court on Monday, may signal a new challenge for international and domestic software makers struggling with piracy in China -- newly assertive local firms ready to take their own IP claims to court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(Chinese firms) are going to think of China as a place to have their own litigation strategy, I think that's a trend that's coming," said Michael Vella, head of China litigation and intellectual property rights at Morrison  Foerster LLP, who predicts more lawsuits by local companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We saw it in Taiwan. At first, Taiwanese companies were always on the defensive, and in recent years we have seen them initiating litigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its ruling, the court said Microsoft violated the scope of licensing agreements between it and a Chinese technology company, Zhongyi Electronic, which designs Chinese character fonts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will have to stop selling the Chinese versions of its Windows 98, 2000, 2003 and Windows XP, according to the court. It is unclear when the ruling will take effect or how many copies are affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will appeal the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft respects intellectual property rights. We use third party IPs only when we have a legitimate right to do so," the firm said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the ruling is unlikely to affect Microsoft's long-term business outlook as only a small percentage of its total revenue comes from business in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The majority of operating systems in the market today are illegal copies, and the ones that are Zhongyi-related have an even smaller share of the market," said Edward Yu, chief executive of a China-focused technology research firm Analysys International. "So I don't think it will have much impact on Microsoft's business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANGING ROLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has long been the target for foreign firms seeking to protect their intellectual property. And China, under pressure from the U.S. government and the European Union, has increased enforcement of intellectual property laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has faced its own issues at the hands of Chinese software pirates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, a Chinese court jailed four people for spreading their bootleg "Tomato Garden" version of Microsoft's Windows XP program, in what the Xinhua news agency called the nation's biggest software piracy case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even before the highly anticipated launch of the software maker's Windows 7 operating system last month, Chinese bootleggers were already selling copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But roles are fast reversing as Chinese firms mature and become more aggressive in protecting their own designs from foreign firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By winning this case against an internationally well-known company like Microsoft, it shows that China, although still a developing country, is taking positive steps to protect intellectual property rights," said Ling Xin Yu, the lawyer for Zhongyi, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhongyi Electronic said in a statement on its website that the agreements signed with Microsoft only permitted the company to use Zhongyi's intellectual property in Windows 95, but that the U.S. tech giant used it in subsequent versions of its Chinese Windows operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research firm IDC estimates about 80 percent of software sold in China was pirated last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Don Durfee and Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widespread Use of SolidDB in Other Vendors` Products Broadens Scope of DoS
Vulnerability
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Core Security Technologies, provider of the CORE IMPACT family of comprehensive
enterprise security testing solutions, today issued an advisory disclosing a
vulnerability that could affect large numbers of organizations using IBM`s
SolidDB relational database management system, as well as those organizations
using the many third party products in which the IBM technology has been
integrated. 

A vulnerability researcher working in CoreLabs, the research arm of Core
Security Technologies, found that by sending certain packets of information to
systems using SolidDB it is possible to trigger a non-recoverable error in the
program and thus terminate related server processes, creating the potential for
remote denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. As a result, many other products that
utilize SolidDB are also vulnerable to the same type of compromise. 

IBM issued a SolidDB update that addresses the vulnerability (SolidDB/Universal
Cache 6.3 Fix Pack 3) on Nov. 13, 2009. The vendor claims that there are
currently over 3 million deployments of SolidDB in various telecommunications
networks, enterprise applications, and embedded software and systems, including
use in products made by Cisco, HP, Alcatel, and Nokia Siemens. 

In a related announcement, HP issued a security advisory addressing a
vulnerability in the database server core component of its OpenView Network Node
Manager. CoreLabs researchers first discovered the involved HP NNM vulnerability
and reported it to the vendor as well. 

CoreLabs researcher Damian Frizza is credited with discovering the SolidDB
vulnerability. 

"One of the important issues highlighted by this discovery is how
vulnerabilities resident in these types of technologies that are widely used in
other products can have a chain reaction in exposing large numbers of
organizations to potential attacks," said Ivan Arce, CTO of Core Security
Technologies. "This is one of the main reasons why it is so important for
technology partners to have dedicated vulnerability and security response
processes in place when they license each others` products - to ensure that all
affected end users can be advised of any problems as soon as possible when the
issues are discovered to help protect themselves." 

Vulnerability Specifics

CoreLabs initially discovered the vulnerability in IBM SolidDB as part of its
ongoing research efforts into security issues found in other products that
utilize the in-memory caching software, namely HP OpenView NNM. The DoS flaw
specifically affects IBM SolidDB Server versions 6.30.0.29 and 6.30.0.33. Other
versions may also be vulnerable but were not tested by Core. 

The IBM SolidDB product family consists of relational, in-memory database
technology that promises to accelerate the speed and performance of database
applications via the use of SQL coding. 

In addition to use in third party technologies, the in-memory database is also
leveraged as core component of IBM's SolidDB Universal Cache, a performance
improvement application for relational databases such as IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL
Server, Oracle and Informix products. 

CoreLabs researchers discovered a remotely exploitable vulnerability in the
database server core component of SolidDB. Exploitation of the bug does not
require authentication and will lead to a remotely triggered denial-of-service
of the database service. 

Specifically, IBM SolidDB server listens and accepts remote connections on port
2315/tcp. The service is implemented by 'solid.exe' which is started
automatically on boot of the program. For certain transactions, upon receiving a
packet from the network the service will attempt to determine and display an
error code string based on a error code number specified in the packet. 

By sending a specially crafted packet with an invalid error code number it is
possible to trigger an exception that forces abnormal termination of the
involved SolidDB service. 

Based on CoreLabs` research it appears unlikely that the vulnerability could be
exploited for anything other than remote DoS attacks. 

IBM`s SolidDB/Universal Cache 6.3 Fix Pack 3 which addresses the DoS problem is
available at:

&lt;p&gt;  MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, Nov 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Ribbit and Microsoft today announced the immediate availability of
Ribbit's .NET Software Development Kit (SDK) and ready-to-use Microsoft
Silverlight controls for communications-enabling Web pages and
applications. The SDKs and programming tools, which were developed by
Ribbit and Microsoft Corp., give Microsoft's global community of
1,000,000+ developers easy access to Ribbit's cloud-based platform for
programmable telephony.

    Now, Silverlight and .NET Platform developers can integrate voice,
messaging, and rich communications functionality directly into Web pages,
applications, social networks, online campaigns, or Web-to-mobile
interactions -- without any knowledge of telephony or expensive capital
outlays. This breakthrough platform for communications innovation now
supports Silverlight and the Microsoft .NET Platform -- making
programmable communications available to a total of more than 1,000,000+
Microsoft developers and designers worldwide.

    Although developers can also access the Ribbit Platform through REST HTTP
calls, the new Silverlight controls provide a ready-to-use interface for
quickly and easily building voice- and messaging-enabled applications.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. plans to make its Business Process Management (BPM) software, BizTalk Server, work very closely with the just-announced AppFabric .Net application server within several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in beta next year, AppFabric will let developers deploy and manage their .Net applications, whether they're running on-site in Windows Server boxes or in the cloud on Redmond's coming Windows Azure cloud platform. That technology was formerly code-named "Dublin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AppFabric also provides a cache for accelerating performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features all differ from BizTalk Server, which lets companies integrate their .Net apps with non-.Net applications and data streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AppFabric "is not a full integration server, a la BizTalk," Mark Berman, a director of product planning for Windows Server AppFabric, said in an interview during the Professional Developers Conference 2009 (PDC09) in Los Angeles on Tuesday. The details of how BizTalk will eventually work together with AppFabric "are to be determined," Berman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft plans to release a minor upgrade to BizTalk Server next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BizTalk Server 2009 R2 will include interface and back-end improvements to make it easier for .Net programmers to connect their apps to other platforms. These include improvements to the graphical process mapper, the ability to manage performance parameters, out-of-box support for event filtering and delivery and the ability to use PowerShell to access management tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released the first version of BizTalk Server 2009 this spring. BizTalk Server is now used by 10,000 companies, said Anil Nori, a distinguished engineer at Microsoft, including 80% of the Global 1000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft in the past talked about BizTalk Server and technology codenamed "Oslo" in the same breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oslo has mostly been deconstructed in the past two years, with features dispersed to other Microsoft products, said Burley Kawasaki, director of product management at Microsoft. It remains a software modeling platform that was renamed SQL Server Modeling earlier this month and offered in Community Technology Preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc could have suffered dramatic losses if the federal government had not intervened to prop up American International Group Inc, according to a government report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report by the special inspector general for the government bailout program raises doubts about Goldman's previous claims that it was hedged against potential AIG losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, as the financial services industry stood on the brink of collapse, the government stepped in with an unprecedented effort to rescue the system. AIG was among the companies that received billions of dollars from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If AIG had collapsed, it would have made it difficult for Goldman to liquidate its trading positions with AIG, even at discounts, the report said. It also would have put pressure on other counterparties that "might have made it difficult for Goldman Sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an AIG default."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the report said, an AIG default would have forced Goldman Sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateralized debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman called the risks discussed in the report a "moot point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs has consistently said its exposure with AIG was collateralized and hedged and therefore we had no direct credit exposure," Goldman Spokesman Michael DuVally said. "Given the hedges, collateral, and government backing as a result of the bailout, the additional risks of declining market values in the event of an AIG default are a moot point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG has received pledges of up to $180 billion in taxpayer aid since last fall to help save it from collapse. It was revealed in March that Goldman received $12.9 billion in payments and collateral from AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, in March told reporters that the Wall Street bank did nothing wrong when it accepted payments to close out trades with AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full report can be viewed at: here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yesterday reduced the price of Office 2008 for Mac by as much as $50 for its annual holiday sale, although some online retailers cut prices even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the promotion , which kicked off Tuesday and runs through Jan. 5, 2010, Microsoft dropped the suggested list price of the Home and Student edition, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Entourage, by $20 to $129.95, a reduction of 12.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price for Business Edition, which adds support for Microsoft's Exchange and SharePoint server software, dropped $50 to $349.95, a 13% savings. Microsoft also cut the price of the upgrade to Business Edition by $40 to $209.95, a 16% reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has cut prices of its Mac suite in the past near the end of the year. In 2008, for example, the company dropped the price of the now-discontinued Special Media Edition by 50% from its usual $499.95 list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, some retailers posted even more aggressive deals for Office 2008 for Mac. Amazon.com , for example, posted Home and Student at $109.99, or 27% under suggested list price, while MacMall.com had the same edition at $109.94 and Mac. Amazon was selling the Business version for $319.99, an $80 savings, and the upgrade to Business Edition for $189.99, while ClubMac listed the same software at $299.99 and $169.99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, Microsoft pared the number of Office for Mac editions from three to two, dropping Special Media Edition and renaming the standard version as "Business Edition." Around the same time, Microsoft announced that it would replace the often-hated Entourage e-mail client in its Mac suite with a version of Outlook, and ship the next version of the bundle in time for 2010's holiday sales season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

 (Updates to add Goldman comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
could have suffered dramatic losses if the federal government
had not intervened to prop up American International Group Inc
(AIG.N), according to a government report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report by the special inspector general for the
government bailout program raises doubts about Goldman's
previous claims that it was hedged against potential AIG
losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last fall, as the financial services industry stood on the
brink of collapse, the government stepped in with an
unprecedented effort to rescue the system. AIG was among the
companies that received billions of dollars from the U.S.
Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If AIG had collapsed, it would have made it difficult for
Goldman to liquidate its trading positions with AIG, even at
discounts, the report said. It also would have put pressure on
other counterparties that "might have made it difficult for
Goldman Sachs to collect on the credit protection it had
purchased against an AIG default."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the report said, an AIG default would have forced
Goldman Sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of
billions of dollars in collateralized debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman called the risks discussed in the
report a "moot point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman Sachs has consistently said its exposure with AIG
was collateralized and hedged and therefore we had no direct
credit exposure," Goldman Spokesman Michael DuVally said.
"Given the hedges, collateral, and government backing as a
result of the bailout, the additional risks of declining market
values in the event of an AIG default are a moot point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG has received pledges of up to $180 billion in taxpayer
aid since last fall to help save it from collapse. It was
revealed in March that Goldman received $12.9 billion in
payments and collateral from AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, in March
told reporters that the Wall Street bank did nothing wrong when
it accepted payments to close out trades with AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The full report can be viewed at:

&lt;p&gt;Providing a way to quickly and effectively relate an incoming email to any CRM
object and associated enterprise data, and take the appropriate action
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
InvisibleCRM today announced general availability of its ContextBridge offering
for SalesDesktop users. The smart tool extends Microsoft Outlook / Lotus Notes
by adding content-centric information from a corporate system in a sidebar next
to each email. 

ContextBridgeempowers users with actual data when they most need it - in the
immediate context of customer interaction. ContextBridge intelligently parses
content of email in Microsoft Outlook and Lotus Notes and provides access to
referenced data from enterprise systems. It recognizes pieces of information in
the e-mail, such as contacts, accounts, leads, opportunities, order numbers,
etc., tags and highlights them and suggests appropriate actions to take in SaaS
based, enterprise or in-house built systems. ContextBridge consolidates and
displays relevant search results from a corporate system in a pane right near
the email content and enables users to immediately react - update information,
share it with colleagues, log a call, schedule a meeting or whatever action is
required. 

"ContextBridge really revolutionizes the way business users work with their
inboxes and corporate knowledge," says Vlad Voskresensky, CEO of InvisibleCRM.
"Time which was normally spent on searching for relevant information is now
saved." 

"The ability to instantly access enterprise data relating to an email without
having to search for it is a serious productivity advantage," explained Jeff
Krider, COO, InvisibleCRM. "Our capability allows users to not only quickly find
the information that is pertinent, but also take immediate action. After
announcing ContextBridge technology, we have seen huge interest in its
capabilities and decided to make it available for all of our users. We`ll be
offering ContextBridge on all of our supported CRM platforms for both Outlook
and Lotus Notes uses." ContextBridgewill be generally available in January 2010.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Hyper-V and DataCore Software`s Storage Virtualization Are Winning New
Customers Together by Successfully Powering Virtual Infrastructures
ALBANY, N.Y. &amp; FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
DataCore Software, a leading provider of storage virtualization, business
continuity and disaster recovery software solutions, today announced its
SANmelody storage virtualization solution has been deployed along with Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V at the law firm McNamee, Lochner, Titus &amp; Williams.
"McNamee/Lochner" is one of the largest law firms in Albany, New York. "The
combination of DataCore with Microsoft Windows Server 2008 for Hyper-V allowed
us a lot of flexibility to deploy the best solution possible at McNamee/Lochner
with the available hardware," stated Kelly M. Knowles, Network Engineer, P
Computers, Inc. 

Hardware Independence - Optimized by Virtualization

McNamee/Lochner had reached a point where the firm needed to increase its
storage capacity. "Our storage was growing at a much faster rate than it had in
the past," noted Jack Weisberg, IT director, McNamee, Lochner, Titus and
Williams. "Moreover, the hardware that we were running on was out of warranty -
so we were looking to get something new." Since 2004, the firm had been using a
clustered SAN - an HP MSA 1000. Initially, a key requirement in a new system was
something that had a solid approach to redundancy, as well as one that offered
ease of expansion. 

Whereas LeftHand Networks was an early front-runner, since it seemed a logical
replacement to the MSA SAN, P Computers presented DataCore SANmelody to the
firm as well. "In comparing both systems, we found both to be strong in terms of
their capability of avoiding single points of failure," noted Weisberg. "But I
really like not being tied to specific hardware - something DataCore enables. It
was very important for us not to get locked into older platforms, when there is
newer hardware available on the market that we could use with DataCore
SANmelody." 

With DataCore, P was able to their preferred hardware of choice - in this case
enterprise-class disks 6 GB SAS drives. Knowles praised the ability of DataCore
to enable administrators to add a couple of 10 GB NICs in these servers for a
very low cost as "tremendous." 

P Computers - Trusted Solution Providers

DataCore partner P Computers, Inc., a data storage and IT service provider,
sees the DataCore and Microsoft Hyper-V combination to be not only a good fit -
but a great opportunity for both resellers and users alike. It also showcases
P Computers` ability to be one of the first to implement the latest Windows
Server 2008 R2 technology, which was released to the manufacturer (RTM) in July
and was just released publicly in October 2009. 

P Computers is engaged in several accounts where they are deploying DataCore
storage virtualization, Windows Server 2008 and Hyper-V in joint configurations.
What the partner saw in the new R2 release of Windows Server 2008 release was an
opportunity for McNamee/Lochner to take some of the complexity out of its
existing environment. What was imperative to making this possible was the
release of Windows Server 2008 R2 and the live migration functionality - which
was not in Hyper-V prior to R2. 

A Virtual Infrastructure - Combining Servers and Storage to Support
Mission-Critical Applications

DataCore SANmelody is now deployed in conjunction with a clustered Hyper-V
system. Moreover, with a Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V cluster McNamee/Lochner
now has the ability to "live migrate" the virtual machines (VMs). Both cluster
nodes have read/write access to the disk, at the same time. Running on this
infrastructure, there are four (4) VMs that can "live migrate" between the two
hosts. Currently, the second node at McNamee/Lochner is located onsite, albeit
in a separate rack. "What this DataCore-Hyper-V set-up does is to minimize or
even eliminate downtime, when we need to make system changes," noted Weisberg.
"So far this system is working very nicely. Plus, everything is redundant. We
have redundant storage with DataCore. And we have redundancy built into the VM
system." 

The multi-Terabyte data pool at McNamee/Lochner and the system is currently
supporting 130 users. A third node - running Microsoft Data Protection Manager -
is deployed for back-up. The applications McNamee/Lochner uses run on HP DL 380
G6s (dual processor, quad core with Nahalim). The 24 GB of memory can be
expanded to 144 GB, if need be. "All the bread and butter applications for
running McNamee/Lochner`s business will run on this by year-end," noted Knowles.


The next phase of the migration will entail moving what was clustered on Windows
2003 on the old SAN into the virtual environment as well. Space is allocated and
P Computers just needs to schedule a date to do the cut-over. 

Value Protection That Meets Business Objectives

In embracing a virtualized approach, McNamee/Lochner is looking three or four
years down the road. Therefore DataCore`s "Carry Forward Value Protection
Program" - which translates to "Buy - Upgrade - And only pay the difference" -
is for McNamee/Lochner a real insurance policy, whereby they might look at new
hardware and still keep the same software. "I love this policy that DataCore
offers," commented Weisberg. "I am entitled to upgrade the hardware I use with
DataCore storage virtualization software. Rather than be forced to scrap my MSA
1000 SAN when it is at its end-of-life, with DataCore I can just buy new
hardware and I can continue to use the software - on any new environment I
choose. I really think this is awesome." 

"We were looking for something redundant, reliable, flexible and expandable,"
summarized Weisberg. "The DataCore-Hyper-V combination really fit our needs. I
certainly like the virtual environment. I also really like having redundant
storage. And having seamless failover was key for us as well."

dashboard solution; Extended Outlook gives us immediate access to our dashboards

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc and Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) have signed an
agreement that is designed to facilitate advancements in the battle against
human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and Chagas
disease, which afflict vulnerable populations in the developing world. Under the
agreement, DNDi will have access to the Pfizer library of novel chemical
entities, in order to screen it for compounds that have the potential to be
developed into new treatments. 

"Despite considerable progress made in recent years, these three diseases
continue to take a terrible human toll and represent a significant social burden
for developing countries," said Dr. Manos Perros, vice president and chief
scientific officer of antivirals research, Pfizer Global Research &amp; Development.
"We are expanding our commitment to the fight against tropical diseases by
joining forces with DNDi by sharing our collection of chemical compounds and the
knowledge and expertise associated with these chemical entities." 

Under the agreement, scientists in institutes affiliated with DNDi will test at
least 150,000 compounds in the Pfizer library against Trypanosoma brucei,
Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasites that cause HAT, VL and
Chagas Disease, respectively. 

In a process called screening, researchers will seek compounds that show initial
activity against the various parasites, and thus might form the basis for novel
drug discovery programs to treat the diseases. The screening will be undertaken
at the Eskitis Institute for Cell and Molecular Therapies, Griffith University
in Brisbane, Australia for HAT and the Institut Pasteur Korea, for VL and Chagas
disease. 

This collaboration will maximize the chances of identifying attractive starting
points for a drug discovery program. "We are confident that the significant
resources and expertise that public-private partnerships such as this one bring
together, will accelerate and significantly increase the chances of success in
the search for effective new drugs against serious infections that
disproportionately affect the poor," said Dr. Sam Azoulay, senior vice president
of medical &amp; development, Pfizer Emerging Markets Business Unit. 

"This agreement provides us access to a compound library of novel chemical
entities that has never been explored for kinetoplastid diseases. This marks an
important step towards DNDi`s objective of building a robust portfolio and to
feed the research and development pipeline with new promising compounds," said
Dr. Shing Chang, R director at DNDi. 

About Neglected Diseases

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a potentially fatal disease if left untreated, is
present in 62 countries, with 200 million people at risk and 500,000 new cases
and 51,000 deaths1 each year. Current therapeutic options for VL are limited as
there are significant drawbacks, including method of administration, toxicity,
lengthy treatment period, and cost. 

Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, also known as sleeping sickness), is a fatal
disease which, if not treated, threatens more than 50 million people in 36
countries and has limited treatment options. Every year 50,000 to 70,000 people
are infected2 and 48,000 die.3 There is a need for an effective oral drug to
treat stage two of the disease when parasites have penetrated the central
nervous system. 

Chagas disease kills more people in the region every year than any other
parasite-born disease, including malaria. Over eight million people are infected
with an average of 14,000 deaths per year, and 100 million at risk in 21
countries across Central and South America. Drugs are needed to treat both acute
and chronic phases of Chagas disease, as are safer and more effective drugs
adapted to patient needs.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Target Corp
(TGT.N) to "neutral" from "buy," and removed the retailer from
its Americas conviction buy list, saying aggressive promotional
activity and pricing competition from rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc
(WMT.N) could hamper margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Gross margin upside could be tempered, given a more
aggressive Wal-Mart, expenses are coming in above our prior
expectations, and credit delinquencies are likely to tick
higher, given current delinquency trends," Goldman Sachs
analyst Adrianne Shapira wrote in a note dated Nov. 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether or not Wal-Mart's Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday
promotional efforts prove successful, they are likely to
pressure competitors' sales and margins, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect intensified price competition from Wal-Mart
beginning in the fourth-quarter and into fiscal 2010," Shapira
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shapira said there is also less fourth-quarter upside
opportunity for Target, as the company laps excessive labor
expense cuts last year, which it does not expect to repeat this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs added Cheesecake Factory Inc (CAKE.O) to its
Americas conviction buy list, replacing Target within the
consumer retail business space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Target were down 2 percent, while Cheesecake
shares rose more than 3 percent in premarket trade on
Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt;Acadis Readiness Suite to Provide Automation of Legally Defensible Training
Records for ICE Agents
BLOOMINGTON, Ind.--(Business Wire)--
Envisage Technologies announced today that U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, awarded
the company a five-year, $3.5 million contract (total base plus options).
Envisage will utilize its Acadis&#174; Readiness Suite software as the foundation for
ICE`s Training Management Support System (TMSS). 

ICE will upgrade its legacy system with Envisage`s secure enterprise platform
and consolidate ICE`s critical, high-liability training into a unified system.
The TMSS will simplify complex tasks, ensure agent compliance and increase
training throughput by automating key aspects of ICE training operations. This
will result in comprehensive and legally defensible training records. 

ICE will utilize several Acadis software modules, including: the training
management system, automated scheduling, automated testing,
qualification/certification management and portal to meet its rigorous training
management requirements and modernize key aspects of its law enforcement
training operations. Acadis will be utilized at ICE training facilities in
Glynco, Ga.; Dallas, Tx.; Charleston, S.C.; Washington D.C.; and field offices
throughout the United States. 

"ICE has undergone a significant transformation over the last five years. The
Office of Training Development has been very successful at developing a
consolidated vision for lifelong learning," said Ari Vidali, Envisage chief
executive officer. "ICE has a fundamental understanding of the challenges and
requirements surrounding high-risk training, and we are honored to have been
chosen to play a significant role in implementing that vision." 

The Acadis Readiness Suite is an enterprise software application that automates
the management of complex, high-risk training environments for law enforcement,
public safety, homeland security and the military. The modular system
architecture allows training organizations to customize the software by
implementing modules as needed, including automated scheduling, registration
management, housing/barracks management, certification compliance tracking,
automated testing, and document management. The optional Acadis Portal Framework
allows secure, decentralized access to in-service training reporting, class
registration and instructor availability.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Elastra Corporation, the leading provider of application infrastructure
automation software, today announced its plans for enabling enterprises seeking
to leverage the on-demand capabilities of Microsoft`s Windows Azure Platform by
allowing them to design, deploy, and manage systems spanning both their data
center and the public cloud provided by Microsoft. 

"Our approach has been one of facilitating seamless integration of internal
resources with the publically available infrastructure," said Kirill Sheynkman,
President &amp; CEO of Elastra Corporation. "Our customers will be able to integrate
in-house systems built on either .NET or Java platforms running on HyperV,
VMware, and XEN with public clouds from Amazon and Microsoft. Where and how a
system is deployed becomes a matter of policy and corporate governance." 

Elastra, a Microsoft partner, and a participant in early reviews of Azure
technology, followed a declarative model for describing infrastructure
capabilities and system requirements, as has Microsoft. Azure`s capabilities
will become part of Elastra's Elastic Modeling Languages, and enable the Elastra
Cloud Server to match Microsoft`s software components to the resources provided
by the Microsoft platform in the customer`s own data center as well as in the
public, Microsoft-based cloud. 

"The fusion of the Windows Azure Platform with the Elastic Cloud Server enables
architects to describe and automate the constraints and configuration
dependencies between different data centers and application technologies, such
as .NET, Java EE, or scripting languages like PHP," says Stuart Charlton, CTO of
Elastra. "The Elastic Modeling technology shifts the tennis match between
development and IT operations into a new collaborative conversation." 

Elastra for the Windows Azure Platform is planned as a free release in Q1 2010.
Integration with Elastra Cloud Server, now generally available for VMware and
Amazon Web Services, is slated for the same timeframe. 

"Our Enterprise customers have extensive investments in Microsoft
infrastructure. So it`s a natural fit for us to expand our support for Microsoft
technologies and enable IT to save valuable time and money automating their
Microsoft infrastructure and applications using the Elastra Cloud Server," said
Peter Chiu, Director of Product Management at Elastra. 

"We are thrilled that the cloud computing capabilities readily being adopted by
the non-Microsoft IT groups will be delivered to the Microsoft-based `silent
majority`," added Sheynkman. 

About Elastra

Elastra develops software that enables enterprises to automate modeling,
deployment and policy enforcement of their application infrastructure. Our
products work in conjunction with provisioning and virtualization solutions to
orchestrate the intelligent delivery of IT infrastructure required to run
complex applications. Elastra solutions enable enterprise IT organizations to
accelerate the delivery of new applications, effectively utilizing internal and
virtualized IT resources to help enterprise IT groups deploy applications
faster, increase resource utilization, and improve IT governance effectiveness.

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, Del.--(Business Wire)--
The Bancorp Bank Payment Solutions Group, a division of The Bancorp Bank
("Bancorp"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: TBBK),
today announced that The Bancorp, in collaboration with InsurCard, has joined
with Franklin Mutual Insurance in New Jersey to offer a program which gives
Franklin Mutual home insurance policyholders quick access to insurance claims
funds. InsurCard is a payment vehicle designed specifically for the distribution
of insurance payments. 

The InsurCard Visa Prepaid Card is distributed at the scene so policyholders no
longer have to wait to cash a check. The program offers policyholders immediate
access to insurance claims funds and can be used to make purchases wherever Visa
debit cards are accepted. Policyholders can obtain account balance and
transaction information 24-hours a day as well as access to thousands of ATMs
worldwide. 

InsurCard was developed by J. Robert Mendte of Lansdale, Pa. - a seasoned
professional with more than 30 years experience as an insurance operations
executive and management consultant. "After seeing the challenges faced by
people in these very difficult situations, it was clear that there had to be a
better way. By using InsurCard, insurers can provide immediate relief to their
customers and continue to load payments as necessary with the press of a
button," offered Mendte. 

Franklin Mutual Insurance is the first insurance carrier to introduce InsurCard
in New Jersey. "We believe an insurance carrier should always try to find new
and innovative ways to provide better, quicker and more efficient claims service
to their policyholders. Franklin Mutual Insurance is convinced that InsurCard
will be a big improvement over the current payment method in catastrophe
situations," explained Dale Martin, Co-Vice President of Claims for Franklin
Mutual Insurance. 

Field adjusters will carry a supply of payment cards as they assess damage.
These cards are inactive and have no value until authorized by the insurer. Upon
arrival, adjusters will make an initial claim evaluation and the cards will be
loaded with the appropriate value by the adjuster either by phone or an internet
connection. Once activated, InsurCard enables access to critical needs such as
food, shelter and emergency repairs. As the recovery process continues, the card
can be reloaded to pay for additional living expenses and permanent repairs. 

John Barbella, Senior Vice President for The Bancorp Bank states, "We believe
that prepaid cards will revolutionize the way insurers make payments as insurers
look for ways to control payments and drive cost savings while providing
enhanced customer care. We are very excited about the Franklin Mutual program
and we are anticipating rapid growth in this space."

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron says interested in key Turkmen gas deposit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. urges Turkmenistan to let foreigners invest onshore &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Marat Gurt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASHGABAT, Nov 18 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) is in talks with Turkmenistan over its possible
participation in developing the giant South Iolotan gas field,
the company's country head said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington has urged the Caspian nation to allow U.S.
companies to invest in its lucrative onshore projects but
Turkmenistan has so far admitted only China's CNPC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turkmenistan, an isolated country north of Iran, is at the
heart of a geopolitical struggle between the United States,
Russia and China for access to its resources, notably its
abundant gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; South Iolotan contains between 4 trillion and 14 trillion
cubic metres of gas, according to Britain's Gaffney, Cline and
Associates, making it one of the world's five largest deposits.
Douglas Uchikura, head of Chevron Nebitgaz B.V.
Turkmenistan, told Reuters on the sidelines of an annual energy
conference that he was in talks with Turkmen officials on the
project.
"Yes, we are interested," he said. "We are making proposals
and we are in discussions".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking to Reuters on the eve of the conference, U.S.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Krol said Washington
wanted Turkmenistan to allow its companies to invest in onshore
deposits such as South Iolotan. [ID:nLH368174]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Irritating other regional players, Turkmenistan has allowed
only China's state-owned major China National Petroleum Corp
(CNPC) to invest onshore in a gas project linked to a
Turkmenistan-China gas pipeline due to open next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pushing into thinly populated Central Asia to feed China's 
energy needs, CNPC won a licence to develop the onshore
Bagtyyarlyk deposit two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; South Iolotan, another key onshore project, is seen as a
potential gas suppliers for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline
designed to ease Europe's dependence on Russian gas by
connecting Caspian gas with Western markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turkmen officials could not be reached for comment on
Chevron talks or whether they were holding similar discussions
with other companies.

&lt;p&gt;Empresa l&#237;der mundial em sucos e bebidas &#224; base de suco divulga o design da
primeira embalagem uniformizada para as mais importantes marcas de suco, como
Minute Maid, Del Valle, Andina e Cappy
ATLANTA, Georgia--(Business Wire)--
A The Coca-Cola Company revelou hoje uma nova identidade visual para importantes
marcas de sua extensa fam&#237;lia de sucos de frutas. A embalagem uniforme, a ser
implementada em v&#225;rias marcas e produtos em todo o mundo, &#233; parte de um esfor&#231;o
estrat&#233;gico abrangente para fortalecer a posi&#231;&#227;o de lideran&#231;a global da empresa
na categoria de sucos. 

Com mais de cem marcas de sucos e bebidas &#224; base de suco em cento e quarenta e
cinco pa&#237;ses de todas as regi&#245;es do mundo, a The Coca-Cola Company quase dobrou
sua participa&#231;&#227;o nesse segmento altamente pulverizado nos &#250;ltimos dez anos. Seu
volume global de sucos corresponde hoje ao dobro do volume do concorrente mais
pr&#243;ximo. O neg&#243;cio de sucos e de sucos prontos para consumo da The Coca-Cola
Company registrou taxa de crescimento anual de 11% no per&#237;odo de dez anos, de
1998 a 2008. A empresa &#233; a maior compradora de frutas para sucos, adquirindo um
sexto de todas as laranjas processadas para produ&#231;&#227;o de suco. 

Baseada em pesquisas extensas com consumidores, a nova identidade visual foi
criada para intensificar a prefer&#234;ncia de marca, melhorar a exposi&#231;&#227;o nas
g&#244;ndolas, aumentar as efici&#234;ncias de custo e criar consist&#234;ncia em uma extensa
fam&#237;lia de marcas e produtos de suco que &#233; l&#237;der mundial. 

"A escala e a magnitude desse reposicionamento global de marca &#233; significativo
para o nosso neg&#243;cio", disse Guy Wollaert, gerente geral do centro global de
sucos da The Coca-Cola Company. "O novo design uniforme da nossa embalagem re&#250;ne
marcas fundamentais da nossa linha de sucos, entre elas Minute Maid, Del Valle,
Andina e Cappy, sob uma &#250;nica e ic&#244;nica identidade de marca." 

Refletindo o logotipo hist&#243;rico e o esquema de cores do Minute Maid, que &#233; a
principal marca da linha de sucos da empresa, a embalagem redesenhada oferece um
visual e uma sensa&#231;&#227;o geral de coes&#227;o e unifica&#231;&#227;o na oferta global de sucos da
empresa. O design, modernizado, aproveita elementos da identidade visual da
Minute Maid, como o ret&#226;ngulo preto e as letras em branco do logotipo,
acrescentando-lhe uma linha do horizonte verde, modernizando as fotografias das
frutas e as imagens naturais para enfatizar as marcas de suco como fontes de
frutas deliciosas. 

O novo design tamb&#233;m cria uma apar&#234;ncia coerente nas g&#244;ndolas quando os produtos
s&#227;o expostos lado-a-lado, para mostrar as frutas. Isso intensifica a comunica&#231;&#227;o
dos benef&#237;cios nutricionais inerentes ao suco e evoca imagens de frutas
integrais, exibidas como o seriam na ala de um mercado agr&#237;cola. 

A cria&#231;&#227;o do sistema de embalagens flex&#237;veis e simplificadas foi capitaneada
pelo grupo interno de design da Coca-Cola. "Iniciamos o processo trabalhando com
a equipe global de sucos, para entender os objetivos e a estrat&#233;gia de
crescimento das nossas marcas de suco", afirmou David Butler, vice-presidente de
design da The Coca-Cola Company. "Essa identidade comum e escal&#225;vel foi criada
para fazer frente a um desafio de neg&#243;cios, n&#227;o s&#243; para atualizar um pacote.
Trata-se, de fato, de um design com objetivo." 

Ao colocar as marcas de suco da linha em uma estrutura &#250;nica e escal&#225;vel, &#233;
poss&#237;vel introduzir novas embalagens de maneira r&#225;pida e eficiente, assegurando
a consist&#234;ncia do design global, desenvolvido sobre o valor da marca e, ao mesmo
tempo, apto a reduzir os custos operacionais e aumentar a produtividade de
empresas locais de todo o mundo. 

A partir deste m&#234;s, os consumidores dos Estados Unidos ser&#227;o os primeiros a
experimentar as din&#226;micas mudan&#231;as na embalagem da marca Minute Maid, ao passo
que consumidores de outras marcas de suco da The Coca-Cola Company, como Del
Valle, Andina e Cappy, conhecer&#227;o os novos designs em seus mercados locais ao
longo de 2010. 

Os gr&#225;ficos das embalagens, com novo visual, s&#227;o os primeiros de uma s&#233;rie de
marcos relevantes de uma estrat&#233;gia de neg&#243;cios que continuar&#225; a fortalecer a
posi&#231;&#227;o da empresa como l&#237;der global do segmento de sucos. Nos pr&#243;ximos meses, a
Coca-Cola implementar&#225; novas iniciativas para beneficiar empresas locais e
consumidores de todo o mundo. Entre elas, est&#227;o inova&#231;&#245;es de produto, esfor&#231;os
de sustentabilidade, parcerias estrat&#233;gicas e a introdu&#231;&#227;o, em outros mercados,

&lt;p&gt;Le num&#233;ro 1 des jus de fruits et boissons &#224; base de jus de fruits d&#233;voile son
tout premier design uniforme des emballages de ses principales marques de
boissons aux fruits, dont Minute Maid, Del Valle, Andina et Cappy
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company a r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; aujourd`hui une nouvelle identit&#233; visuelle pour
certaines marques cl&#233;s dans la famille de boissons &#224; base de jus de fruits de la
soci&#233;t&#233; comprenant de nombreux produits. Le design uniforme des emballages,
devant &#234;tre mis en &#339;uvre dans plusieurs marques et produits &#224; l`&#233;chelle
mondiale, s`inscrit dans l`effort strat&#233;gique total de la soci&#233;t&#233; pour &#233;tendre
son leadership mondial dans la cat&#233;gorie des boissons aux fruits. 

Avec plus de 100 marques de jus de fruits et boissons &#224; base de jus de fruits
disponibles dans 145 pays dans le monde, la part de march&#233; de la soci&#233;t&#233; dans
cette cat&#233;gorie &#224; la croissance tr&#232;s fragment&#233;e a presque doubl&#233; au cours des 10
derni&#232;res ann&#233;es et son volume international de boissons aux fruits est &#224;
pr&#233;sent le double de celui de son concurrent le plus proche. The Coca-Cola
Company a d&#233;velopp&#233; les activit&#233;s de son segment de jus de fruits et boissons &#224;
base de jus de fruits pr&#234;ts &#224; consommer dans les 10 ans de 1998 &#224; 2008 &#224; un taux
de croissance annuel de 11 %. La soci&#233;t&#233; est le plus gros acheteur de fruits
destin&#233;s &#224; la consommation de jus de fruits, achetant une orange sur six de
toutes celles transform&#233;es en jus. 

Bas&#233;e sur des &#233;tudes de march&#233; exhaustives, la nouvelle identit&#233; visuelle a &#233;t&#233;
cr&#233;&#233;e pour optimiser la pr&#233;f&#233;rence de marque, am&#233;liorer l`attrait dans les
lin&#233;aires, impulser des efficiences au niveau des co&#251;ts et cr&#233;er une image
homog&#232;ne sur l`ensemble d`une famille de marques de boissons aux fruits et
produits &#224; base de jus de fruits num&#233;ro un mondial. 

&#171; L`&#233;chelle et la magnitude de cet effort de rebranding au niveau international
sont de taille pour notre segment de boissons aux fruits &#187;, a indiqu&#233; Guy
Wollaert, directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral, Global Juice Center, The Coca-Cola Company. &#171; Notre
nouveau syst&#232;me de design uniforme des emballages rassemble des marques cl&#233;s de
notre portefeuille de boissons aux fruits, notamment Minute Maid, Del Valle,
Andina et Cappy, sous une seule identit&#233; de marque embl&#233;matique. &#187; 

Refl&#233;tant le logo historique et la combinaison de couleurs de Minute Maid, la
marque leader du portefeuille de jus de fruits et boissons &#224; base de jus de
fruits de la soci&#233;t&#233;, l`emballage repens&#233; apporte un look et une pr&#233;sentation
unifi&#233;s et coh&#233;sifs, &#224; la gamme mondiale de marques de boissons aux fruits de la
soci&#233;t&#233;. Le design modernis&#233; part d`&#233;l&#233;ments de l`identit&#233; visuelle de Minute
Maid, notamment le rectangle noir et le logotype blanc, tout en y ajoutant une
marque d`horizon verte, des photos de fruits rafra&#238;chissantes et une imagerie
naturelle, afin de souligner que les marques de boissons aux fruits sont une
d&#233;licieuse source de fruits. 

Le nouveau design cr&#233;e &#233;galement un look homog&#232;ne dans les lin&#233;aires lorsque les
produits sont plac&#233;s c&#244;te &#224; c&#244;te pour mettre le fruit en vedette. Ceci transmet
encore plus les bienfaits nutritionnels inh&#233;rents au jus de fruit et &#233;voque
l`imagerie du fruit entier tel qu`il peut &#234;tre pr&#233;sent&#233; au rayon fruits et
l&#233;gumes ou sur les march&#233;s. 

La cr&#233;ation du nouveau syst&#232;me d`emballage flexible et rationalis&#233; a &#233;t&#233; dirig&#233;e
par le groupe de design interne chez Coca-Cola. &#171; Nous avons amorc&#233; ce processus
en travaillant en &#233;troite collaboration avec l`&#233;quipe du segment mondial des
boissons aux fruits afin de comprendre les objectifs et la strat&#233;gie pour le
d&#233;veloppement de nos activit&#233;s de boissons aux fruits &#187;, a expliqu&#233; pour sa part
David Butler, VP du design, The Coca-Cola Company. &#171; Cette identit&#233; &#233;volutive
commune a &#233;t&#233; cr&#233;&#233;e afin de r&#233;pondre &#224; un d&#233;fi commercial, pas simplement pour
mettre les emballages au go&#251;t du jour. Il y a vraiment un but derri&#232;re le
design. &#187; 

En rassemblant le portefeuille de marques de boissons aux fruits sous un seul
cadre &#233;volutif, de nouveaux emballages peuvent &#234;tre lanc&#233;s rapidement et
rentablement, garantissant ainsi un design homog&#232;ne au niveau mondial qui
renforce la valeur de marque tout en minimisant les co&#251;ts d`exploitation et en
augmentant la productivit&#233; pour les entreprises locales du monde entier. 

&#192; partir de ce mois-ci, les consommateurs aux &#201;tats-Unis seront les premiers &#224;
d&#233;couvrir les changements dynamiques apport&#233;s aux emballages de Minute Maid,
tandis que les consommateurs des autres marques de boissons aux fruits de la
famille de jus de fruits et boissons &#224; base de jus de fruits de The Coca-Cola
Company (Del Valle, Andina et Cappy, notamment) d&#233;couvriront les nouveaux
designs dans leurs supermarch&#233;s locaux courant 2010. 

Le graphisme d`emballage new-look est le premier d`une s&#233;rie d`importants jalons
d`une strat&#233;gie commerciale qui va continuer &#224; renforcer la place de leader
mondial des boissons aux fruits de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Dans les prochains mois,
Coca-Cola va mettre en &#339;uvre de nouvelles initiatives qui profiteront aux
entreprises locales et aux consommateurs du monde entier, notamment des
innovations produit, des efforts en mati&#232;re de durabilit&#233;, des partenariats
strat&#233;giques et le lancement dans des march&#233;s suppl&#233;mentaires de produits &#224; base
de jus de fruits qui se vendent bien.

&lt;p&gt;La empresa de jugos y bebidas tipo jugo n.&#186; 1 en el mundo presenta el primer
dise&#241;o uniforme de envases para las principales marcas de jugo como Minute Maid,
Del Valle, Andina y Cappy
ATLANTA, Georgia--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company present&#243; hoy una nueva identidad visual para marcas clave
en la extensa familia de jugos de la empresa. Este dise&#241;o uniforme del envase,
que ser&#225; implementado en diversas marcas y productos en todo el mundo, forma
parte del esfuerzo integral y estrat&#233;gico de la empresa para ampliar su posici&#243;n
de liderazgo mundial en la categor&#237;a de los jugos. 

Con m&#225;s de 100 marcas de jugo y bebidas tipo jugo disponibles en 145 pa&#237;ses de
todo el mundo, la participaci&#243;n de la empresa en esta categor&#237;a de crecimiento
tan fragmentado pr&#225;cticamente se ha duplicado en los &#250;ltimos 10 a&#241;os y su
volumen mundial de jugos ahora tiene el doble del tama&#241;o de su competidor m&#225;s
cercano. The Coca-Cola Company ha aumentado su negocio de jugos listos para
tomar y bebidas tipo jugo en los 10 a&#241;os comprendidos entre 1998 y 2008 a un
&#237;ndice de crecimiento anual del 11%. Esta empresa es la mayor compradora de
frutas para el consumo de jugos, ya que compra una de cada seis naranjas
procesadas para jugo. 

Seg&#250;n una exhaustiva investigaci&#243;n de consumo, la nueva identidad visual se cre&#243;
para aumentar la preferencia de la marca, mejorar la forma en que los productos
se destacan en los estantes, generar rentabilidad y crear consistencia en una
familia que es l&#237;der mundial en productos y marcas de jugo. 

"La escala y la magnitud de este esfuerzo por renovar la marca en todo el mundo
es significativo para nuestro negocio de jugos", coment&#243; Guy Wollaert, gerente
general del Global Juice Center de The Coca-Cola Company. "Nuestro sistema de
dise&#241;o nuevo y uniforme del envase une las marcas clave en nuestra cartera de
jugos, incluidos Minute Maid, Del Valle, Andina y Cappy, en una identidad de
marca &#250;nica y representativa". 

Con el reflejo del logotipo hist&#243;rico y el esquema de colores de Minute Maid, la
marca l&#237;der en la cartera de jugos de la empresa, el envase redise&#241;ado ofrece un
estilo consistente y unificado para la l&#237;nea mundial de marcas de jugo de la
compa&#241;&#237;a. El dise&#241;o modernizado se basa en los elementos de la identidad visual
de Minute Maid, incluido el rect&#225;ngulo negro y el dise&#241;o de letras blancas del
logotipo, y al mismo tiempo agrega una imagen natural, una fotograf&#237;a de frutas
refrescantes y una l&#237;nea transversal con fondo verde para resaltar las marcas de
jugo como fuente de frutas deliciosas. 

El nuevo dise&#241;o tambi&#233;n crea una imagen coherente en los estantes, cuando los
envases se colocan uno junto a otro para exhibir la fruta. Esto comunica de una
mejor forma las bondades nutricionales inherentes al jugo y evoca la imagen de
una fruta entera como podr&#237;a exhibirse en un mercado agricultor o en las
g&#243;ndolas de los almacenes. 

La creaci&#243;n del nuevo sistema de envases flexible y simplificado estuvo dirigida
por el grupo de dise&#241;o en planta de Coca-Cola. "Comenzamos este proceso
trabajando en forma conjunta con el equipo global de jugos para comprender los
objetivos y la estrategia de ampliaci&#243;n de nuestro negocio de jugos", coment&#243;
David Butler, vicepresidente de Dise&#241;o de The Coca-Cola Company. "Esta identidad
com&#250;n y escalable se cre&#243; para encarar un desaf&#237;o comercial, no solo para
actualizar un envase. &#201;ste realmente es un dise&#241;o ex profeso". 

Al unir la cartera de marcas de jugo en un marco escalable, se pueden introducir
nuevos envases con rapidez y eficacia, garantizando un dise&#241;o mundial y
consistente que crea un valor de marca y al mismo tiempo minimiza los costos
operativos y aumenta la productividad para las empresas locales de todo el
mundo. 

A partir de este mes, los consumidores de los Estados Unidos ser&#225;n los primeros
en experimentar los din&#225;micos cambios del envase de Minute Maid, mientras que
los consumidores de otras marcas de jugo pertenecientes a la familia de jugos de
The Coca-Cola Company, como Del Valle, Andina y Cappy, experimentar&#225;n los nuevos
dise&#241;os en sus mercados locales durante el a&#241;o 2010. 

La gr&#225;fica del envase con nueva imagen es la primera de una serie de hitos
importantes dentro de una estrategia comercial que continuar&#225; para fortalecer la
posici&#243;n de la empresa como l&#237;der mundial en jugos. En los pr&#243;ximos meses,
Coca-Cola implementar&#225; nuevas iniciativas que beneficiar&#225;n a los consumidores y
empresas locales a nivel mundial y que incluir&#225;n innovaciones de productos,
esfuerzos de sostenibilidad, asociaciones estrat&#233;gicas y el debut de los
exitosos productos de jugos en otros mercados.

&lt;p&gt; * Court rules Microsoft violated licensing agreement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Dispute over use of Chinese character fonts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Zhongyi Electronic said IP deal was for Windows 95 only&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft to appeal ruling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Little long-term business impact - analysts
 (Adds background, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Melanie Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has
been ordered by a Chinese court to stop selling versions of its
Windows operating systems that include fonts designed by a
local company, citing a violation of licensing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ruling, issued by Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's
Court on Monday, may signal a new challenge for international
and domestic software makers struggling with piracy in China --
newly assertive local firms ready to take their own IP claims
to court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(Chinese firms) are going to think of China as a place to
have their own litigation strategy, I think that's a trend
that's coming," said Michael Vella, head of China litigation
and intellectual property rights at Morrison  Foerster LLP,
who predicts more lawsuits by local companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We saw it in Taiwan. At first, Taiwanese companies were
always on the defensive, and in recent years we have seen them
initiating litigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its ruling, the court said Microsoft violated the scope
of licensing agreements between it and a Chinese technology
company, Zhongyi Electronic, which designs Chinese character
fonts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft will have to stop selling the Chinese versions of
its Windows 98, 2000, 2003 and Windows XP, according to the
court. It is unclear when the ruling will take effect or how
many copies are affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it will appeal the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft respects intellectual property rights. We use
third party IPs only when we have a legitimate right to do so,"
the firm said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the ruling is unlikely to affect Microsoft's
long-term business outlook as only a small percentage of its
total revenue comes from business in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The majority of operating systems in the market today are
illegal copies, and the ones that are Zhongyi-related have an
even smaller share of the market," said Edward Yu, chief
executive of a China-focused technology research firm Analysys
International. "So I don't think it will have much impact on
Microsoft's business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHANGING ROLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China has long been the target for foreign firms seeking to
protect their intellectual property. And China, under pressure
from the U.S. government and the European Union, has increased
enforcement of intellectual property laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has faced its own issues at the hands of Chinese
software pirates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In August, a Chinese court jailed four people for spreading
their bootleg "Tomato Garden" version of Microsoft's Windows XP
program, in what the Xinhua news agency called the nation's
biggest software piracy case. [ID:nPEK241916]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And even before the highly anticipated launch of the
software maker's Windows 7 operating system last month, Chinese
bootleggers were already selling copies. [ID:nTP93178]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But roles are fast reversing as Chinese firms mature and
become more aggressive in protecting their own designs from
foreign firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By winning this case against an internationally well-known
company like Microsoft, it shows that China, although still a
developing country, is taking positive steps to protect
intellectual property rights," said Ling Xin Yu, the lawyer for
Zhongyi, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zhongyi Electronic said in a statement on its website that
the agreements signed with Microsoft only permitted the company
to use Zhongyi's intellectual property in Windows 95, but that
the U.S. tech giant used it in subsequent versions of its
Chinese Windows operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Research firm IDC estimates about 80 percent of software
sold in China was pirated last year.

Filing Follows EMEA`s Conclusion that Pfizer`s Program Studying the Use of
Lipitor in Children with High Cholesterol is in Compliance with its Requirements
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) announced it has submitted pediatric data for Lipitor
(atorvastatin) to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). Pfizer has also
developed a new chewable form of Lipitor, including a pediatric-appropriate 5 mg
dose, which is part of this submission. 

Approximately one in 500 people suffer from an inherited disorder, called
Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), which causes high levels of LDL-cholesterol
("bad" cholesterol) and an increased risk of heart disease. Pfizer hopes that
additional scientific data about the use of atorvastatin in children with FH
will help improve diagnosis and treatment of the condition. 

Pfizer`s data submission reflects a European Union (EU) initiative encouraging
research, development and availability of medicines for children. All authorized
medicines undergo extensive testing in both laboratories and clinical trials
prior to their approval. However, there is often limited information available
about pediatric use. One 2005 study found that more than half of all medicines
in Europe have not been tested and authorized for use in children. 

In 2007, the EU enacted a new Regulation requiring pharmaceutical companies to
research their medicines for use by children. The requirements cover new
medicines, and existing ones under certain circumstances. In 2008, the EMEA`s
Paediatric Committee approved Pfizer`s pediatric investigation plan to study the
use of Lipitor in children aged 6 to under 18. This week, the Committee
concluded that Pfizer`s pediatric atorvastatin program has been implemented in
compliance with its requirements. 

To encourage companies to make the investments necessary to conduct these
trials, the EU also created certain incentives, including the availability of a
six-month extension to an existing patent extension, also known as a
supplementary protection certificate (SPC). If Pfizer fulfils all further
requirements of the EU Paediatric Medicines Regulation, Pfizer will be eligible
and intends to apply for an additional six months of patent/SPC protection for
Lipitor in certain EU countries. 

Pfizer is committed to improving the lives of all adults and children at risk of
cardiovascular disease and will continue to work closely with the EMEA and other
regulatory authorities to help address areas of unmet medical need and reduce
health inequalities. Lipitor has been approved for use in children (aged 10 to
17 years old) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in the United
States since 2002. 

Important U.S. Prescribing Information

LIPITOR is a prescription medicine that is used along with a low-fat diet. It
lowers the LDL ("bad" cholesterol) and triglycerides in your blood. It can raise
your HDL ("good" cholesterol) as well. LIPITOR can lower the risk for heart
attack, stroke, certain types of heart surgery, and chest pain in patients who
have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease such as age, smoking, high
blood pressure, low HDL, or family history of early heart disease. 

LIPITOR can lower the risk for heart attack or stroke in patients with diabetes
and risk factors such as diabetic eye or kidney problems, smoking, or high blood
pressure. 

LIPITOR is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is
not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant. 

Patients taking LIPITOR should tell their doctor if they feel any new muscle
pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
Patients should tell their doctor about all medications they take. This may help
avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check your
liver function before and during treatment and may adjust the dose. Common side
effects are diarrhea, upset stomach, muscle and joint pain, and changes in some
blood tests.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has been pursuing concurrent improvements for its Visual Basic and C# programming languages, plans to open up compilers for the languages and add capabilities for asynchronous programming and immutability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussed at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC) in Los Angeles today, the blueprint for the two languages will feature compilers as services and accommodations for multicore processors, said Luca Bolognese, program manager for the languages group at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ See InfoWorld's report on the convergence of the Visual Basic and C#. | Follow our ongoning coverage of the PDC 009 event. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the opening of the compilers, Microsoft will move away from a "black box" mode and let developers see what is going on inside, offering programming benefits. "Using the same data structures that the compiler users is incredibly useful,"&#160; Bolognese said. With increased insight into the compilers, developers could, for example, parse code or simplify the building of refactorings, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous programming and immutability "allow you to write easier parallel code," benefitting applications running on multicore processors, Bolognese said. With asynchronous programming, he added, threads are freed up for processing of different operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the planned Visual Studio 2010 software development platform, due in March 2010, offers declarative and dynamic programming as well as concurrency for C# and Visual Basic. "In Visual Studio 2010, we move the two languages much closer together, so now we are in a good spot co-evolve them as one," Bolognese said. "In the future, you won't see any big feature inserted in one language and not in the other," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "Microsoft to open up compilers for Visual Basic, C#," originally appeared at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is creating technology to give businesses more fine-grained control over access to data stored in the company's upcoming SQL Azure database-as-a-service, a senior engineer said Tuesday. Code-named Vidalia, the technology will provide "trustworthy data collaboration for highly-sensitive business data across disparate trust domains," said Microsoft technical fellow, Dave Campbell, in a talk at Microsoft's Professional Developers Conference 2009 (PDC09) in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation: Companies will be able to define and enforce policies controlling who can see what data at a very detailed level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will be through what Campbell called a "capability generation center" that will protect data inside the database, i.e. "at rest," and when it's moving through the network, i.e. "in motion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other features are coming to SQL Azure, which will go into production when Windows Azure does on January 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first half of next year, it will bring a "database clone" feature for administrators, said Tony Petrossian, principal program manager for SQL Azure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the second half, Microsoft plans to release continuous backup of SQL Azure databases. Users will be able to restore their databases to any point in time, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also working on making it easier for users to grow and shrink their databases, so that they are not constricted in size or overpay for storage they don't need, Petrossian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other related features include the ability to dynamically split or merge databases, and build tools to manage large groups of schemas across databases, he said, as well as query multiple databases at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These improvements are aimed at both enterprise department end-users, as well as Software as a Service (SaaS)-based resellers of SQL Azure, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Products Focus on Convenient Lifestyles While Delivering Added Safety
Features
PARIS &amp; ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Dassault Syst&#232;mes (DS) (Paris:DSY) (Euronext Paris: #13065, DSY.PA), a world
leader in 3D and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions, and IBM (NYSE:
IBM) today announced that they have teamed up with Panasonic's Home Appliances
Company and its Kitchen Appliance Business Unit (BU) to support the development
of more convenient and safer home appliances and accelerate the introduction of
induced heating (IH) appliances, such as flat cooktops, into the Japanese
market. 

IH appliances are produced and developed by Panasonic's Kitchen Appliance BU and
they are gaining popularity as an alternative to gas-heated appliances. These
appliances generate heat through a process known as Joule heating or the
transfer of heat to the bottom of a cooking pan through an electromagnetic
field. Heating efficiency levels are over 90% since heat is transmitted directly
to the cooking area safely without any air pollution as this method avoids
cooking food using direct fire. 

With its industry`s first all-metal heating and light-sensor technologies,
Panasonic`s IH appliance leads the industry in heat induction technology
allowing consumers to quickly measure cooking temperatures so they can
accurately control the amount of heat generated for cooking. 

As demand increases for products that perform intelligent functions, companies
face the challenge of managing complex design environments to interconnect the
software, mechanical and electrical components required to manufacture more
sophisticated products. IBM and Dassault Syst&#232;mes are helping Panasonic`s
Kitchen Appliance BU use CATIA software, a 3D virtual design platform, for the
digital development of product design plans used in the manufacturing of more
energy-efficient, electrical appliances with features that will help consumers
lead smarter lives. 

Panasonic's Kitchen Appliance BU uses PLM software solution CATIA to help
shorten the product development period and improve design quality as follows:

* All design processes, from initial digital designs to physical mold designs,
were done as part of one integral process to shorten the product development
cycle. 
* Key IH appliance parts, such as resin and plate parts, were designed in a 3D
format allowing fast and direct collaboration with multiple factory mold makers.
The process of mold drawing and production was shortened by 40%. 
* Metal parts, critical to the operation of IH appliances, were designed and
tested quickly, saving up to two days of testing time by using module of CATIA
Sheet Metal Design. 
* With CATIA Analysis features, product designers performed repeated analysis of
large and complex assembly parts quickly, which allowed the Kitchen Appliance BU
team to focus on delivering a high quality product early in the design process.

Industry analysts point to demand for future products such as zoneless induction
stoves that can be powered with intelligent sensors that determine the presence
of pots anywhere on the stove and automatically ignite energy under the cooking
pot and nowhere else. Panasonic's Kitchen Appliance BU will continue using
Dassault Syst&#232;mes PLM solution for the design and development of new
eco-friendly products that help reduce of carbon monoxide (CO2) emissions. 

"Compared to other software design products, CATIA has a rich set of design
functions needed for products requiring sophisticated surface and shape designs
such as our electric cooking heaters," said Mr. Yasushi Morimoto, team leader,
Kitchen Appliance BU, Home Appliances Company, Panasonic Corporation. "Seamless
integration between CAD, CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) and CAM (Computer
Aided Manufacturing) drove our decision to choose Dassault Syst&#232;mes 3D platform.
Our goal is to expand into new product development areas by enhancing
collaboration among internal units, realizing global collaborative design, and
improving perfection of design through expanding utilization of CAE," added Mr.
Morimoto. 

"Japanese companies have long mastered the art of achieving excellence in
product design and manufacturing and with Dassault Syst&#232;mes CATIA 3D software,
Panasonic's home appliance division can now deliver a smarter and greener
product," said Albert Bunshaft, vice president, IBM Product Lifecycle
Management.

&lt;p&gt;Das weltweit f&#252;hrende Unternehmen im Bereich der Fruchts&#228;fte und
Fruchtsaftgetr&#228;nke stellt erstes einheitliches Verpackungsdesign f&#252;r die
wichtigsten Fruchtsaftmarken wie Minute Maid, Del Valle, Andina und Cappy vor
ATLANTA, Georgia (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Die Coca-Cola Company hat heute eine neue visuelle Identit&#228;t f&#252;r die
Schl&#252;sselmarken im umfassenden Fruchtsaftgetr&#228;nkeprogramm des Unternehmens
vorgestellt. Das einheitliche Verpackungsdesign, das f&#252;r zahlreiche Marken und
Produkte weltweit eingef&#252;hrt werden soll, ist Teil der umfassenden strategischen
Bem&#252;hungen des Unternehmens, seine weltweite Marktf&#252;hrerschaft bei Fruchts&#228;ften
auszubauen. 

Mit mehr als 100 Fruchtsaft- und Fruchtsaftgetr&#228;nkemarken, die in 145 L&#228;ndern
erh&#228;ltlich sind, hat sich der Marktanteil des Unternehmens in diesem stark
fragmentierten Wachstumsbereich im Verlauf der letzten zehn Jahre fast
verdoppelt und sein weltweites Fruchtsaftvolumen ist mittlerweile doppelt so
gro&#223; wie das des n&#228;chsten Konkurrenten. Die Coca-Cola Company hat ihr Gesch&#228;ft
mit trinkfertigen Fruchts&#228;ften und Fruchtsaftgetr&#228;nken in den zehn Jahren von
1998 bis 2008 mit einer j&#228;hrlichen Wachstumsrate von 11 Prozent gesteigert. Das
Unternehmen ist der gr&#246;&#223;te Eink&#228;ufer von Fr&#252;chten f&#252;r den Fruchtsaftkonsum und
kauft eine von sechs Orangen f&#252;r die Verarbeitung zu Fruchtsaft. 

Auf der Grundlage umfangreicher Verbraucherumfragen wurde die neue visuelle
Identit&#228;t geschaffen, um die Markenpr&#228;ferenz zu verst&#228;rken, die Auff&#228;lligkeit im
Regal zu verbessern, die Kosteneffizienz zu f&#246;rdern und Kontinuit&#228;t innerhalb
der weltweit f&#252;hrenden Reihe der Fruchtsaftmarken und -produkte zu schaffen. 

&#8222;Der Umfang und die Gr&#246;&#223;e dieser weltweiten Rebranding-Bem&#252;hungen ist f&#252;r unser
Fruchtsaftgesch&#228;ft bedeutend", sagte Guy Wollaert, General Manager, Global Juice
Center, The Coca-Cola Company. &#8222;Unser neues, einheitliches
Verpackungsdesignsystem vereint die Schl&#252;sselmarken in unserem
Fruchtsaftangebot, wie Minute Maid, Del Valle, Andina und Cappy, durch eine
einzige, anschauliche Markenidentit&#228;t." 

Die neu entworfene Verpackung spiegelt das historische Logo und Farbschema von
Minute Maid, der f&#252;hrenden Marke im Fruchtsaftangebot des Unternehmens, wieder
und gibt dem weltweiten Fruchtsaftmarkenangebot ein geschlossenes, einheitliches
Aussehen und Charakteristikum. Das modernisierte Design basiert auf Elementen
der visuellen Identit&#228;t von Minute Maid. Dazu geh&#246;ren das schwarze Rechteck und
der wei&#223;e Markenschriftzug, w&#228;hrend eine gr&#252;ne Horizontmarkierung, erfrischende
Fotografien von Fr&#252;chten und nat&#252;rliche Bilder die Fruchtsaftmarken als Quelle
k&#246;stlicher Fr&#252;chte unterstreichen. 

Das neue Design schafft dar&#252;ber hinaus ein zusammenh&#228;ngendes Aussehen im Regal,
wenn die Verpackungen nebeneinander platziert werden, um die Fr&#252;chte zu
pr&#228;sentieren. Dadurch wird der positive N&#228;hrwert des Saftes herausgestellt und
an Bilder ganzer Fr&#252;chte erinnert, wie sie in der Obst- und Gem&#252;seabteilung oder
einem Bauernmarkt ausgestellt werden. 

Bei der Schaffung des neuen flexiblen und rationalisierten Verpackungssystems
war die interne Design-Abteilung von Coca-Cola f&#252;hrend t&#228;tig. &#8222;Wir haben diesen
Prozess in enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem weltweiten Fruchtsaft-Team begonnen, um
die Ziele und die Strategie f&#252;r das Wachstum unseres Fruchtsaftgesch&#228;fts zu
verstehen", sagte David Butler, VP des Bereichs Design der Coca-Cola Company.
&#8222;Die Schaffung dieser skalierbaren, gemeinsamen Identit&#228;t erfolgte im Rahmen
einer betrieblichen Herausforderung und nicht nur, um eine Verpackung zu
aktualisieren. Das ist echtes Design mit Hintergrund." 

Durch die Vereinigung des Fruchtsaftmarkenangebots in einem skalierbaren Rahmen
k&#246;nnen neue Verpackungen schnell und effizient eingef&#252;hrt werden, wodurch ein
konsistentes weltweites Design sichergestellt wird, das Markenwert aufbaut und
gleichzeitig die Betriebskosten minimiert und die Produktivit&#228;t der lokalen
Firmen weltweit erh&#246;ht. 

Noch in diesem Monat werden die Verbraucher in den USA die ersten sein, die die
dynamischen Ver&#228;nderungen bei der Verpackung von Minute Maid erleben werden,
w&#228;hrend die Konsumenten anderer Fruchtsaftmarken aus dem Programm der
Fruchtsaftgetr&#228;nke der Coca-Cola Company, wie Del Valle, Andina und Cappy, im
Laufe des Jahres 2010 an den jeweiligen lokalen M&#228;rkten in den Genuss des neuen
Design kommen werden. 

Die Verpackungsgrafiken mit dem neuen Aussehen sind die ersten einer ganzen
Reihe von Meilensteinen in einer Gesch&#228;ftsstrategie, die die Position des
Unternehmens als weltweit f&#252;hrendem Anbieter im Fruchtsaftbereich noch weiter
st&#228;rken wird. In den kommenden Monaten wird Coca-Cola neue Programme ins Leben
rufen, die lokalen Firmen und Verbrauchern weltweit zu Gute kommen werden. Dazu
geh&#246;ren Produktinnovationen, Nachhaltigkeitsbem&#252;hungen, strategische
Partnerschaften und die Einf&#252;hrung der erfolgreichen Fruchtsaftprodukte an
weiteren M&#228;rkten.

&lt;p&gt;With Google Inc. working on its upcoming browser-based Chrome operating system, the company is intensifying its grudge match with rival Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Google's new OS , which is expected to be on the market in about a year, catches some momentum, it won't just propel the company into a new market, it also will give Google Apps a boost against Microsoft's ubiquitous Office software. It will also give Google one more avenue into the enterprise, which has always been Microsoft's lofty domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This really is a fight to the death for Google and Microsoft," said Jim McGregor, an analyst with In-Stat. "It is a fight between business models for software, applications, advertising and the Internet. I think this battle will eventually benefit everyone because it is pushing the boundaries of technology and business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google announced today that it is releasing its Chrome OS project as open source , including the code base, user interface experiments and some initial designs for ongoing development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First, it's all about the Web," wrote Caesar Sengupta, a Google group product manager, and Matt Papakipos, an engineering director, in a blog post . "All apps are Web apps. The entire experience takes place within the browser and there are no conventional desktop applications. This means users do not have to deal with installing, managing and updating programs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, Inc., Chrome OS reflects the ascendancy of the Web and the browser. Both the buildup of the Web and the upcoming release of the new operating system will pool to give Google even more power and industry position than it has today, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that would only help the company in its ongoing battle with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies have been locking horns this year over enterprise applications and their search engines . It's a war between the longtime software monolith and the new Internet-based giant on the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Google appears to be setting its sights on taking a chunk out of Microsoft's operating system market share. With many users viewing their computers as simply a way to get on to the Internet, a browser-based OS could be a good step into that arena for Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For most people most of the time, the PC is just a Web player," Gottheil added. "Google is leveraging its Web expertise to strip away a lot of the stuff that people don't use as much any more, and delivering an OS optimized for the Web... This makes business sense for Google. Getting in Microsoft's grill is just gravy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also noted that users running the Chrome OS are likely to use Google Apps, such as Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Docs, along with it. That means pushing out the new OS could bolster sales of Google's office-based applications as the company drive into other Microsoft territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Olds, an analyst with The Gabriel Consulting Group, said that while adopting Chrome OS will boost Google Apps, the reverse is true as well. Anyone who was considering a move to Google Apps might give the Chrome OS a try. He called it a good one-two punch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Google is trying to make inroads against Microsoft's longheld suite of office applications, it's clear that a successful move would be an uphill climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gottheil, however, said Google has the financial resources, industry partners and name recognition to push Chrome OS into a head-to-head fight with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's 100% that [Chrome OS] will make some dent. The question is, how much?" Gottheil said. "I can't quantify it, but I'd guess many of the people who have come to computing more recently, and only for e-mail and IM and seeing the grandkids' pictures, and maybe participating in social networking, they'd use it. And I think there's a class of enterprise users that can be effectively served with Web-only devices. It's not for power users, but for many other users it makes sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group, noted that how much of the Chrome OS -- which he calls a rethinking of the thin client -- is adopted largely depends on which companies Google is able to partner with. He added that partnerships with Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM could help push the new operating system into the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will be a long-term trench warfare type of battle," Olds said. "The war between Microsoft and Google will play out over the next several years. We won't see an absolute winner or loser, but more trench warfare, with each gaining temporary advantages. Users will get the advantage as both companies will be very careful to make sure that their products don't break compatibility and that costs will remain low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today denied that it has built a backdoor into Windows 7, a concern that surfaced yesterday after a senior National Security Agency (NSA) official testified before Congress that the agency had worked on the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has not and will not put 'backdoors' into Windows," a company spokeswoman said, reacting to a Computerworld story Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Richard Schaeffer, the NSA's information assurance director, told the Senate's Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security that the agency had partnered with the developer during the creation of Windows 7 "to enhance Microsoft's operating system security guide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing earlier concerns, Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronics Privacy Information Center (EPIC), questioned the wisdom of letting the NSA participate in OS development. "The key problem is that NSA has a dual mission, COMPUSEC, computer security, now called cyber security, and SIGINT, signals intelligence, in other words surveillance," Rotenberg said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, he raised the issue, which isn't new, of whether the NSA pressures companies like Microsoft to craft so-called "backdoors" into their code that would let the agency track users and intercept users' communications. Rotenberg called it an "obvious concern," and added that it might be difficult for major software makers to turn down NSA "suggestions" because the U.S. federal government is an important customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's categorical denial by Microsoft was accompanied by further explanation of exactly how the NSA participated in the making of Windows 7. "The work being discussed here is purely in conjunction with our Security Compliance Management Toolkit," said the spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company rolled out the Windows 7 version of the toolkit late last month, shortly after it officially launched the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compliance management toolkit provides a set of security configurations that address additional levels of risks beyond those addressed out of the box, as well as tools to deploy these configurations and monitor what Microsoft calls "configuration drift." The toolkit is aimed at enterprises, government agencies and other large-scale organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's rejection of the idea that it's hidden a backdoor in Windows came as no surprise to security researchers, who yesterday expressed doubt that the company would put its reputation at such risk. "I can't imagine NSA and Microsoft would do anything deliberate, because the repercussions would be enormous if they got caught," Roger Thompson, the chief research officer of antivirus vendor AVG Technologies, said yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Pescatore, an analyst with Gartner Research, agreed. "[The concerns] are way overstated," he said today in an e-mail. "NSA worked with Microsoft and others, like Cisco, on security configuration standards for [their] products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco, in fact, has built "lawful intercept" capabilities into its products, including its Internetworking Operating System (ISO) and its VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) lines. The term describes the process by which law enforcement agencies conduct electronic surveillance of circuit and packet-mode communications under authorization, such as electronic wiretap orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rotenberg still questioned NSA involvement. "The key point is that the NSA is not the right agency to promote computer security in the private sector," he argued. "The risks to end users are real -- the original NSA key escrow proposal, 'Clipper,' was a terrible idea -- and there is too little transparency about these arrangements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Clipper chip Rotenberg referred to was a project first proposed in 1993 that would offer ultra-strong encryption, but would allow access to encrypted data by law enforcement. The NSA proposal, however, raised a firestorm of protest and the idea was ultimately dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * FDA advisers back new benefit claim for Spiriva&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Panel says safety data adequate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer shares fall 8 cents
 (Adds panel member, company quotes; updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SILVER SPRING, Md., Nov 19 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)
and Boehringer Ingelheim won support on Thursday for a proposed
new claim for a blockbuster medicine that treats a deadly lung
disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel, in an 11-1
vote, said Boehringer presented "substantial and convincing
evidence" that Spiriva HandiHaler reduced flare-ups of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The inhaled medicine already is approved for treating COPD
but the companies want to specifically promote it for reducing
exacerbations, a claim held by GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK.L) rival
drug Advair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spiriva is considered the gold standard for treating COPD,
or "smoker's lung," commonly caused by cigarette smoke and
other harmful fumes and characterized by a persistent
obstruction of airflow in the lungs which results in
breathlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two Boehringer studies "showed unequivocal evidence of
benefit," said panel member Daren Knoell, an associate
professor at Ohio State University's College of Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDA usually follows panel recommendations. Winning
approval for the new claim could help the company boost sales
of the drug, which hit 2.07 billion Euros ($3 billion)
globally in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDA advisers also said current data were adequate to
address concerns about strokes and heart problems, an issue
raised in a medical journal report last year. A team of
researchers reported in September 2008 that Spiriva raised the
risk of heart attack, stroke and death from heart disease.
Boehringer strongly disagreed with the finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Members of the FDA panel said there were limitations in the
journal study and that other evidence provided reassurance
about the drug's safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr. Mark Brantly, the panel chairman and a pulmonary
specialist at the University of Florida, said he felt the
overall data "is compelling that there is no increased
cardiovascular risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The panel voted 11-1 that data were sufficient on the
stroke issue, and 11-0 with one abstention that cardiovascular
risk data were adequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boehringer said it was pleased the panel supported the
claim for reducing disease flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exacerbations in COPD patients may lead to disability,
premature death and increased healthcare costs," Dr.
Christopher Corsico, a Boehringer vice president, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker and
Boehringer's marketing partner for Spiriva, fell 8 cents to
close at $18.11 on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings takes various rating actions on JP Morgan 2005 LDP1, commercial
mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at
the end of this press release. 

The downgrades are the result of Fitch's loss expectations and its prospective
views regarding cash flow declines and commercial real estate market values.
Fitch forecasts potential losses of 3.3% for this transaction, should market
conditions not recover. Today's rating actions are based on the full losses of
3.3% as a majority of loans mature in the next five years. The bonds with
Negative Outlooks indicate classes that may be downgraded in the future. 

To determine potential defaults for each loan, Fitch assumed cash flow would
decline by 10% from year-end 2008. That is consistent with the analysis used in
its review of recent vintage transactions whereby cash flow was assumed to
decline 15% from year-end 2007 projected over a three year period. If the
stressed cash flow would cause the loan to fall below 0.95 times (x) debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR), Fitch assumed the loan would default during the
term. To determine losses, Fitch used the above stressed cash flow and applied a
market cap rate by property type, ranging between 7.5% and 9.5%, to derive a
value. If the loan balance at default is less than Fitch's derived value, the
loan would realize that amount of loss. These loss estimates were reviewed in
more detail for loans representing 47.8% of the pool and, in certain cases,
revised based on additional information and/or property characteristics. Loss
expectations attributed to loans reviewed in detail represent approximately
42.7% of the 2.6%. 

Approximately 79.7% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as
follows: 10.8% in 2009, 16.5% in 2010, 2.4% in 2011 and 9.2% in 2014, and 40.7%
in 2015. 

Fitch identified 36 Loans of Concern (18.3%) within the pool, 15 of which
(12.5%) are specially serviced. Of the specially serviced loans, eight (9.8% of
the pool) are current. One of the Fitch Loans of Concern (7.8%) is within the
transaction's top 15 loans. 

Fitch's analysis resulted in loss expectations for two of the top 15 loans.
However, none of the top 15 loans are assumed to default during the loan term,
as the stressed cash flow for each loan exceeds 0.95x DSCR. Fitch expects that
14 of the top 15 loans may default at maturity based on an insufficient accrued
equity position as calculated in Fitch's refinance test. However, Fitch's
analysis resulted in losses on two of these loans based on their derived values,
while the remaining 12 loans resulted in no losses. A loan would pass the
refinance test if the stressed cash flow would achieve a 1.25x DSCR as
calculated based on a 30 year amortization schedule and an 8% coupon. 

The largest contributors to loss are as follows: Water's Edge (2.9%), Harbor
Court (1%), and Indian River Office Building (0.4%), 

The Water's Edge loan is secured by a 243,433 square foot (sf) single tenant
office property located in Playa Vista, CA built in 2002. The property continues
to be 100% occupied by Electronic Arts Inc. which develops, publishes, and
distributes interactive software worldwide for video game systems, personal
computers, cellular handsets and the Internet. Their lease expires in September
of 2013. Given the high leverage of the loan at issuance, Fitch expects a
default and losses at maturity. 

The Harbor Court loan is secured by a 57,673 mixed use property located in
Honolulu, HI. As of year-end 2008, the servicer reported DSCR was 1.21x and
occupancy remained strong at 100% occupied. Given the high leverage nature of
the loan, Fitch expects a default at maturity, and the loan to incur losses. 

The Indian River Office Building transferred to the special servicer in July
2009 due to monetary default. The loan is secured by a four building medical
office complex totaling 94,706 sf built in 1980. The current borrower purchased
the complex in August 2004. Three days later three hurricanes struck Vero Beach
and damage to the building was over $6 million. Building sustained severe damage
and loss of tenants. Current occupancy is 66% occupied in a market of declining
rentals and vacancies of 25%. The borrower has been supporting the property out
of pocket and has requested a loan modification. The year-end servicer reported
DSCR was 0.75x. 

Fitch has downgraded, assigned Loss Severity (LS) ratings, Recovery Ratings
(RRs) and Rating Outlooks to the following classes as indicated: 

--$68.4 million class B to 'AA/LS4' from 'AA+'; Outlook Stable;

In addition, Fitch affirms, assigns LS ratings and assigns Rating Outlooks to
the following classes: 

--$311.1 million class A-1A at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$903.8 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$157.5 million class A-3 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$601.5 million class A-4 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$110.7 million class A-SB at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$94.3 million class A-J at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable; 

--$100 million class A-JFL at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

The class A-1 has been paid off in full. Fitch does not rate the $15.9 million
class NR.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES -- Microsoft's Surface touch computer may be generating more oohs and ahs than some of the company's other recent technologies, but the product has yet to generate rabid interest among programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year and half after Microsoft released Surface , just 250 companies are developing applications for the touch system, Microsoft officials revealed during its Professional Developers Conference 2009 (PDC09) held here this week. Some 5,000 copies of its free Software Development Kit (SDK) for Surface have been downloaded, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare that with the 100,000 iPhone SDKs that were downloaded in the four days after its launch on March 6, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some observers question whether such a comparison is valid -- deployment of the $12,500 to $15,000 Surface tabletop PC is limited mostly to hotels, health clinics, banks and other customer-facing businesses looking for a new spin on the computerized kiosk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Surface's April 2008 launch came amid a massive economic downturn that still has businesses shy about investing in new technology, leading to a chicken-and-egg situation where developers are holding off developing Surface apps until the economy improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Carpenter, general manager of Microsoft's Surface team, said he remains patient. "For interest to scale out takes time," he said in an interview at PDC this week. "There are more and more apps every day. So we feel like we are making progress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed out that Microsoft now has 250 Surface partner companies, up from 180 six months ago and 60 a year ago. Similarly, the 5,000 SDK downloads is more than 3 times the 1,500 six months ago, and up sixteenfold from 300 a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accelerate development of applications for Surface, Microsoft announced that the Surface SDK is now available without charge to all developers. The SDK was previously available free only to members of the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft noted that the SDK includes a simulator that lets developers see how their programs would run on a conventional PC. It lets users plug in multiple USB mice to simulate how multi-touch technologies work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SDK runs on Vista today, but Microsoft said the next version will be based on Windows 7. With adequate hardware, Windows 7 offers multi-touch capabilities. Carpenter declined to say when the next version will be available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft disclosed that it is also integrating the touch and object-recognition controls for Surface into the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) version 4. That version of the WPF graphics subsystem is due in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WPF support should help developers more easily create Surface-enabled apps, Carpenter said, as well as make Surface applications run similarly to Windows 7 touch-enabled software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpenter said that the Surface is now available in 18 countries, including 16 in Europe. New customers include Hard Rock Cafe, Barclays Bank and mobile operator Vodafone, which has deployed Surfaces in 62 retail stores to provide customer service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surface's stumbling blocks also continue to be its high price and bulkiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working on a less-expensive version of Surface which will likely be thinner and wall-mountable, like an LCD television, said Carpenter. The technical difficulty would be packing cameras behind the touchscreen to enable object recognition capabilities, as well as the PC hardware -- an Intel Core 2 Duo processor mounted on a desktop motherboard. But, Carpenter said, "I definitely believe it's do-able."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when asked whether future Surface versions would enable in-air gestures like the Xbox 360's Project Natal, Carpenter sounded less optimistic. "We are mostly focused on touch. In-air gestures is not something we are enabling yet," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpenter wouldn't talk about the cost of new Surface versions, but did say a new version should be coming soon. "Our goal was to have a consumer version of the Surface in two to four years. We are on track for that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks featured in this
week`s analysis include B.P. Prudhoe Bay Trust (NYSE: BPT), San Juan Basin
(NYSE: SJT), Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Petrobras (NYSE: PBR). 

Zacks Industry Rank Analysis is written by Dirk Van Dijk, CFA, Chief Equity
Strategist, Zacks.com. 

This week: Some Improvements in Energy

A good example of an industry that is showing both a very good overall rank and
substantial improvement is Oil Royalty Trusts, which with a industry rank of
2.00 is tied for 4th place with several other industries. What sets it apart is
that it improved 21 spots in its ranking as the average ranking of its
components, up from 2.43 last week. Every one of the seven firms in the industry
has a Zacks Rank of 2. 

These are great vehicles for income-oriented investors, as they simply represent
big pools of oil or natural gas in the ground. As the oil is produced, the
proceeds are paid out in the form of dividends. It also means that the dividends
are very variable with the price of oil. 

The problem with them is that eventually the oil in the ground will run out, so
some of that dividend is really a return of capital, not a return on capital.
Thus if you are thinking about investing in them, look at how long those
reserves will last, as well as the current income you are getting from them. 

On the plus side, the tax code recognizes this, so a portion of the dividend is
sheltered from the IRS. Unlike a regular exploration and production oil firm,
there is no risk of a dry hole, nor are they exposed to changes in the price of
drilling. If you think that the price of oil is headed higher, they are very
attractive investments, especially if you want current income. Two of the larger
names in the area that are worth considering are B.P. Prudhoe Bay Trust (NYSE:
BPT)and San Juan Basin (NYSE: SJT). 

A good example of a big important industry that is still distinctly mediocre in
terms of its absolute standing is the Integrated Oil Industry, the home of some
of the world`s largest firms like Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Petrobras (NYSE:
PBR). It currently has an average rank of 2.95, which puts it in 102nd place out
of 206 industries ranked. That, however, is a substantial improvement from the
3.16 average last week, and was enough to lift it by 49 spots.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
(This is a correction for a press release originally issued October 5, 2009. It
removes the Loss Severity rating from the interest-only class X. ) 

Fitch Ratings has downgraded and removed from Rating Watch Negative 15 classes
of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC), mortgage
pass-through certificates. In addition, Fitch has assigned Loss Severity (LS)
ratings. 

The downgrades are the result of loss expectations for current specially
serviced loans and reflect Fitch's prospective views regarding commercial real
estate market value and cash flow declines. Fitch forecasts potential losses of
9.02% for this transaction, should market conditions not recover. Today's rating
actions are based on losses of 7.3% including 100% of the losses associated with
term defaults and any losses associated with maturities within the next five
years. Given the significant term to maturity, Fitch's actions only account for
25% of the losses associated with maturities beyond five years. The bonds with
Negative Rating Outlooks indicate classes that may be downgraded in the future
should full potential losses be realized. Fitch considers the Outlooks on the
super-senior classes to be Stable due to projected losses having limited impact
on credit enhancement when associated pay down is factored into the analysis. 

Fitch analyzed the transaction and calculated expected losses by assuming cash
flows on each of the properties decline 15% from year-end (YE) 2007 and property
values decline 35% from issuance. These loss estimates were reviewed in more
detail for loans representing 55% of the pool and, in certain cases, revised
based on additional information and/or property characteristics. 

Approximately 20.4% of the mortgages are scheduled to mature within the next
five years as follows: 2.9% in 2011, and 17.5% in 2012. In 2017, 66.8% is
scheduled to mature. 

Fitch identified 26 Loans of Concern (23%) within the pool, five of which (1.9%)
are specially serviced. None of the specially serviced loans are within the
transaction's top 15 loans (42.3%). Of the specially serviced loans, one (1% of
the pool) is current. Five (11.5%) of the transaction's top 15 loans are Fitch
Loans of Concern. 

Based on its analysis, Fitch expects 14 of the top 15 loans (40.9%) to default
during the term or at maturity, with loss severities ranging from approximately
1% to 11%. The largest contributors to loss on a pool level basis (by
outstanding balance) are as follows: Overlook III (2.7%), Ten Penn Center
(2.2%), and Sheraton Gunter (1.6%). 

Overlook II is a 438,709 square foot office building located in Atlanta, GA. The
sponsor is Parameter Realty Fund III, Inc. The major tenants at the property
consist of Citicorp Credit Services (14%), Club Management Enterprises, LLC
(8%), and Nations Builders Insurance (6%). Performance has declined due to
increased expenses and a slight decline in occupancy since issuance. The
servicer-reported debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) as of year-end (YE)
December 2008 was 1.17 times (x) down from 1.21x and 1.29x at issuance.
Occupancy as of June 2009 was 76% and 85% including the master lease. Fitch's
analysis of the loan resulted in a higher probability of default at maturity
based on the high loan to value. 

Ten Penn Center is a 670,857 square foot office property located in
Philadelphia, PA. The sponsor is Ten Penn Center Associates, L.P. The major
tenants at the property consist of Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC (23%) and
Sedgwick Claims Management Services (7.5%). At issuance, the property was 67%
occupied and projected to have negative cash flow for the first three years of
the loan term. The property has not reached stabilization expectations. As of YE
2008, the servicer reported DSCR was 0.74x, and the Fitch stressed DSCR at
issuance was 1.11x. As of June 2009, the property was 74.6% occupied down from
85% YE 2007 but up from 67% at issuance. Fitch's analysis of the loan resulted
in a higher probability of default during the loan term based on declining
performance. 

Sheraton Gunter is a full-service, 322 room hotel with meeting space located in
the heart of downtown San Antonio, TX. The loan sponsor is Michael S. Gallegos.
Although 2008 income increased, property performance continues to decline due to
current market conditions within the hotel sector combined with increased
expenses at the property. As of YE 2008, the servicer reported DSCR was 1.15x
down from 1.47x YE 2007 and 1.61x at issuance. Per the July 2009 STR report, the
property is currently lagging it's competitive set with occupancy at 69%
compared to 79%, average daily rate (ADR) at $105 compared to $116 and revenue
per available room (RevPAR) at $71 compared to $92. Fitch's analysis of the loan
resulted in a higher probability of default during the loan term based on
declining performance. 

Fitch downgrades, removes from Rating Watch Negative, and assigns Loss Severity
(LS) ratings to the following classes: 

--$197.2 million class A-J to 'BBB/LS4' from 'AAA'; Outlook Negative; 

--$21.9 million class B to 'BBB-/LS5' from 'AA+'; Outlook Negative;

--$9.4 million class M to 'B-/LS5' from 'BB'; Outlook Negative; 

--$6.3 million class N to 'B-/LS5' from 'BB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$6.3 million class P to 'B-/LS5' from 'B+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$6.3 million class Q to 'B-/LS5' from 'B'; Outlook Negative. 

In addition, Fitch affirms and assigns LS ratings to the following classes: 

--$11.9 million class A-1 at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--$444.9 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--$346.2 million class A-3 at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--$601.7 million class A-4 at 'AAA/LS2''; Outlook Stable; 

--$54.2 million class A-SB at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--$286.5 million class A-1A at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$250.5 million class A-M at 'AAA'/LS3; Outlook Stable; 

--$3.1 million class T at 'B-/LS5'; Outlook Negative.

&lt;p&gt; * Promotions due to take effect on Jan. 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N), in the spotlight over its controversial plans to pay
billions of dollars in year-end bonuses to executives,
announced this week its next class of managing directors,
according to a memo obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are 272 executives in the group, according to a
source familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The promotions, due to take effect on Jan. 1, will make the
executives eligible next year for more of Goldman's bonus
pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has faced public ridicule for setting aside nearly
$17 billion for year-end bonuses after receiving a $10 billion
taxpayer bailout. The bank has paid back that money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has reported robust profits in the past two
quarters, with net income in excess of $3 billion in each of
those quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

LOS ANGELES, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Thursday sales of Windows
7 were running at twice the level of any previous version of
its operating system.

 Windows 7, launched a month ago, has "already sold twice as
many units" than any previous version in a comparable time,
said Ballmer at the software company's annual meeting in
Bellevue, Washington, which was broadcast on the Internet.

 Microsoft did not give any details or actual sales figures.
Consumers and PC manufacturers have generally welcomed Windows

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N) is beefing up its European investment bank by buying the half of Cazenove it does not already own in a deal valuing the revered 190-year old UK stockbroker at 2 billion pounds ($3.4 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transaction, which will land windfalls for dozens of top London dealmakers, will see David Mayhew remain chairman of JPMorgan Cazenove and Chief Executive Naguib Kheraj preside over the integration in a short-term role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayhew, who has been at Cazenove for 40 years and is regarded as the best connected banker in London, will pocket around 19 million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second largest U.S. bank by assets, bought half of Cazenove five years ago to create a UK investment banking joint venture, and as expected took up the option to complete the deal on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Cazenove will continue to operate under that name and become a wholly owned part of the U.S. bank's UK investment bank arm. It will combine cash equities and research operations for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strategically it's a good thing to do, but they have paid a pretty high price to do it," said Richard Staite, U.S. banks analyst at Atlantic Equities in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Large U.S. banks like JPMorgan are looking for overseas growth opportunities and this is a relatively low-risk investment to make and the JV has worked well so far," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's shares were down 1.8 percent at $42.60 by 1544 GMT, broadly in line with a wider slide in the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has weathered the financial crisis better than most rivals and is now taking advantage of their problems, making selected deals and grabbing market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will pay 535 pence per Cazenove share, valuing the 50 percent stake at 1 billion pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see this as the natural evolution of this partnership with a lot of opportunity to do more both in corporate finance and in equities," Kheraj told reporters on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kheraj said there will be some job cuts, but declined to say how many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal marks the end of any independence for Cazenove, which made its name raising funds for railway companies in the 19th century and is today adviser to more top UK companies than any of its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is enjoying a record 2009, and post-tax profits at Cazenove Group -- which holds the half share of the joint venture -- were 65.4 million pounds, well ahead of profits of 48.5 million for all of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has advised on most of Britain's top fundraisings this year, including massive rights issues by HSBC (HSBA.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L) and one under way for Lloyds (LLOY.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BLUE BLOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining Mayhew with fixed roles at the wider investment bank are the heads of JPMorgan Cazenove's three core areas. Alan Carruthers will become head of cash equities for Europe, Ian Hannam remains chairman of capital markets and Charles Harman stays as head of UK investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazenove, dubbed the Queen's stockbroker, prides itself on its deep and strong ties across the City of London. Many of its bankers have been at the firm for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finance Director Michael Power is in line to get 10 million pounds and top dealmakers such as Carruthers and Hannam are looking at seven-figure windfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are about 1,500 shareholders and about 36 percent of shares are owned by current staff. Some 54 percent is owned by former employees, 8 percent by institutions and 1 percent by JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazenove shares do not trade publicly, but trade twice a year on an internal market. They last traded at 260p in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal has been struck at 21 times 2008 profits, but is likely to be under 13 times current year earnings. The price was based on factors including multiples for other companies such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), capital and pensions. Lazard advised Cazenove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very acceptable price all round," Kheraj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Hans Peters, Simon Jessop, John Stonestreet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Nov 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Softchoice Corporation (TSX: SO) is pleased to announce it has become one
of the first partners to be fully authorized under IBM's new Software
Business Partner Value Program. As of January 25th, 2010, IBM will
require partners to complete mandatory technical certifications across 11
product categories in order to resell corresponding software licenses. By
successfully completing the certification process, Softchoice joins a
select group of National value added resellers capable of supporting
IBM's entire portfolio of software solutions. The new program is designed
to help customers identify top tier partners with proven expertise in
configuring solutions, reducing implementation risk, and increasing the
return on investment for IBM technologies.

    "IBM has raised the bar for its partner community and I am pleased to say
that Softchoice has risen to the challenge," said David MacDonald,
President and CEO of Softchoice. "Through our investments in pre-sales
and professional services resources, we continue to increase our value by
serving as a single, reliable source for comprehensive IBM solutions."

About The Princess and the Frog

Presented by Walt Disney Animation Studios, the musical The Princess and the
Frog is an animated comedy set in the great city of New Orleans. A modern twist
on a classic tale, the film features a girl named Tiana who dreams of owning her

fateful kiss that leads them both on a hilarious adventure through the mystical
bayous of Louisiana. The Princess and the Frog marks the return to hand-drawn
animation from the revered team of John Musker and Ron Clements, with music by
Oscar&#174;-winning composer Randy Newman. Featuring the voice talents of Anika Noni

While more than one-third reported losses, 30 percent also showed an increase in
payments fraud over the previous year, and the majority of respondents expect
these illegal activities to grow. (Source: 2009 AFP Payments Fraud and Control
Survey, sponsored by J.P. Morgan) 

"Economic uncertainty coupled with the emergence of new technologies have
brought out fraudsters of all stripes - from first-timers desperate for cash to
organized crime to the most sophisticated technological manipulators in the
industry," said Iqbal M. Khan, executive director, J.P. Morgan Treasury
Services. "Our new report offers tips on the most effective actions to take to
stop criminals in their tracks." 

Among the best practices highlighted in the report are:

* Check Fraud. To prevent check fraud, take practical defensive measures such as
securing check stock and implementing dual control around key treasury functions
such as check issuance and account reconciliation. Using high-quality check
stock with built-in security features will reduce the likelihood of check
manipulation. Industry tools such as Positive Pay reduce the possibility of
fraudulent check payment. 
* ACH Fraud. To minimize ACH or electronic payments fraud, sensitive information
needs to be protected. Masking account numbers and Tax ID numbers in your
written correspondence, and utilizing encrypted email for confidential,
nonpublic information are both critical steps to reducing fraud. ACH debit
blocks or ACH debit filters guard against unauthorized ACH debit transactions. 
* Corporate Credit Card Fraud. Misuse of corporate payment cards by employees is
not typically considered fraud by card issuers. The company is usually
responsible for any loss, so organizations must have prevention programs in
place. Protective controls, such as setting transaction limits and monthly
limits for all cardholders, as well as blocking unauthorized vendors will
greatly reduce misappropriation. Companies should also use Web-based payments
tools that provide enhanced reporting and real-time visibility into spending. 
* Phishing Fraud. Phishing spammers establish fake emails and Web sites in an
attempt to steal security information, such as login names, passwords and other
personal data. Organizations should ensure that browser and security software
information is continually updated, and that spam blocking filters and surfing
block controls are maintained companywide. Privacy locks should be utilized to
restrict access to sensitive data.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Animal Health wants families to talk with one another about bringing the
family dog along when they travel to their Thanksgiving-to-New Year`s
celebrations. 

For most people, the holidays are a time of joy and celebration. But some people
feel guilty or sad about leaving their dog behind because they consider their
dog part of the family. 

"In addition, this year, many families are experiencing tough economic times,"
said Amy Trettien, DVM, Veterinary Operations, Pfizer Animal Health. "The
unconditional love from your family dog can go a long way toward helping your
entire family manage that extra stress." 

To help families talk about including their dog in their family holiday, Pfizer
Animal Health has prepared seven simple tips, and is encouraging family dialogue
at a new holiday Twitter feed, www.Twitter.com/DogOnBoard. 

But some families who want to include their dog in holiday travel can`t because
many dogs get carsick when they travel. According to Pfizer Animal Health
research, one in six dogs - an estimated 7.2 million - will suffer from vomiting
caused by motion sickness. 

Which is why Pfizer Animal Health is encouraging dog owners to also talk with
their veterinarians about canine motion sickness. Since Pfizer Animal Health`s
CERENIA (maropitant citrate) was FDA-approved in 2007 to prevent vomiting caused
by motion sickness and acute vomiting, thousands of families have been able to
get on the road with their dogs, increasing the quality time spent with their
dog. 

"Pfizer Animal Health wants more families to find the peace and joy of a
relationship with their dog, especially during this holiday season," Dr.
Trettien said. 

About CERENIA

CERENIA is available by prescription only from veterinarians and is available in
an easy-to-give, once-daily tablet that will not cause sedation. In the past,
canine motion sickness has been treated with a variety of products designed for
people, often with a sedating effect. Because CERENIA does not cause drowsiness,
dogs will be alert during and upon arrival at family holiday gatherings, making
family holiday travel this year a more positive experience. 

CERENIA works to prevent vomiting due to motion sickness as well as treat and
prevent acute vomiting. CERENIA is recommended for dogs 16 weeks and older. The
common side effects seen with CERENIA are excessive drooling, lethargy and
vomiting not due to motion sickness. For more information, read the full
prescribing information or visit www.CERENIA.com. 

About Pfizer Animal Health

Pfizer Animal Health, a business of Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE), is a world leader in
discovering and developing innovative animal prescription medicines and
vaccines, investing an estimated $300 million annually. For more information on
how Pfizer Animal Health helps dogs and cats live longer, healthier lives, visit

BRING YOUR DOG TO THIS YEAR`S FAMILY HOLIDAY CELEBRATION

1. Start the conversation. Ask the host of your family holiday celebration if
you can bring your dog. Be sure to check if other guests may be bringing pets or
are allergic to animals. 

2. Reassure your host that you have a plan to manage your dog`sholiday visit.
Review the American Veterinary Medical Association tips on Traveling with Your
Pet. 

3. Help make your dog - and your host - comfy. Your dog may need a break from
playtime. Think about bringing a gate, crate, or comfortable bed. If using your
host`s backyard, be sure the area is properly fenced and secure. 

4. Bring on the Food! But make sure it`s your dog`s own food. Review the
American Kennel Club`s holiday safety tips as certain food or plants your dog
might find during the holidays can be harmful. 

5. Be responsible. Some relatives or friends may not be comfortable around your
dog. Keep an eye on your dog to ensure your dog`s interactions with others stay
positive. Some children may not know how to safely play with your dog. 

6. Before you travel, talk with your veterinarian. Make sure your dog`s
vaccines, paperwork and dog tags are up-to-date. Be sure to ask about flea
control, heartworm prevention and canine motion sickness medication like CERENIA
that is non-sedating and easy-to-administer when traveling this holiday season. 

7. Share your experience with others. Go to www.Twitter/DogOnBoard to share
thoughts on how you and your dog enjoyed this year`s family holiday
celebration.

beefing up in Europe by buying the half of Cazenove it does not
already own in a deal valuing the 190-year old UK stockbroker at
2 billion pounds ($3.36 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan Cazenove will become a wholly owned part of J.P.

Cazenove, while Chief Executive Naguib Kheraj "will oversee the

grabbing opportunities. It said it will pay 535 pence per
Cazenove share, valuing the 50 percent stake at 1 billion pounds
and all of the venerable stockbroker at double that.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20091118006475/en

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration`s (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory
Committee voted 10 to 1 that the data presented support the safety and
effectiveness of its 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate candidate vaccine, Prevnar
13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]), for
the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young children.
The Company is seeking an indication for active immunization of infants and
toddlers for the prevention of invasive disease (including sepsis, meningitis,
bacteremia, bacteremic pneumonia, and empyema) and otitis media caused by 13
Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) serotypes. The FDA will consider the
Advisory Committee`s votes and discussion in its review of the Biologic License
Application (BLA) for Prevnar 13, which has an action date of December 30, 2009.


Prevnar 13 includes the seven serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) in
Prevnar&#174; (Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]),
plus six additional serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A) associated with the
majority of remaining invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young
children in the U.S. Serotype 19A is the most common serotype in the U.S.
Prevnar&#174;, the standard in pneumococcal disease prevention for infants and young
children, was first introduced in the U.S. in 2000. 

"Pfizer is very pleased with the outcome of the Advisory Committee`s votes on
the safety and effectiveness of Prevnar 13," says Emilio Emini, Ph.D., chief
scientific officer, Vaccine Research, Pfizer Inc. "We look forward to working
with the FDA to obtain approval for this important vaccine." 

The Advisory Committee`s votes in support of Prevnar 13 were based on a review
of the data from 13 core Phase III studies involving more than 7,000 children.
The Advisory Committee`s discussion included consideration of the multiple
immunogenicity endpoints in the trials. The Committee agreed that the totality
of the data supported the effectiveness of Prevnar 13 for the prevention of
invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young children. The Committee also
discussed the Prevnar 13 safety profile and agreed that the data were adequate
to support its safety. In clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse
events for Prevnar 13 included injection site reactions, irritability,
drowsiness/increased sleep, decreased appetite, fever, and restless
sleep/decreased sleep. 

"Prevnar 13 demonstrates Pfizer`s commitment to vaccine innovation - a key
strategic priority for Pfizer and an expression of its vision to broaden and
diversify its global product portfolio," says Geno Germano, president and
general manager, Specialty Care Business Unit, Pfizer Inc. "Today's votes by the
Advisory Committee bring our Company one step closer to adding an important
vaccine to our portfolio." 

To date, the company has submitted regulatory applications for Prevenar 13*
(Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccine [13-valent, Adsorbed]), as it is
known outside the U.S., in 60 countries spanning six continents. The vaccine has
been approved in three countries for use in infants and young children. In late
September, the European Medicines Agency`s (EMEA) Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion for Prevenar 13. A final
decision is expected by European regulatory authorities in December.
Additionally, the vaccine is being studied in global Phase III clinical trials
for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults, with regulatory
submissions expected in 2010. 

Pneumococcal Disease

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 2002 estimate, pneumococcal
disease is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children
younger than 5 years. Pneumococcal disease is complex and describes a group of
illnesses, all caused by the bacterium S. pneumoniae. Pneumococcal disease
affects both children and adults, and includes invasive infections such as
bacteremia/sepsis and meningitis, as well as pneumonia and acute otitis media. 

Indication for Prevnar&#174;

Prevnar is indicated for active immunization of infants and toddlers against
invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae due to capsular serotypes included in
the vaccine (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F). The routine schedule is 2, 4, 6,
and 12 to 15 months of age. 

The decision to administer Prevnar should be based primarily on its efficacy in
preventing invasive pneumococcal disease. As with any vaccine, Prevnar may not
protect all individuals receiving the vaccine from invasive pneumococcal
disease. 

Prevnar is also indicated for active immunization of infants and toddlers
against otitis media caused by serotypes included in the vaccine. However, for
vaccine serotypes, protection against otitis media is expected to be
substantially lower than protection against invasive disease. Additionally,
because otitis media is caused by many organisms other than serotypes of S.
pneumoniae represented in the vaccine, protection against all causes of otitis
media is expected to be low. 

This vaccine is not intended to be used for treatment of active infection. 

Important Safety Information for Prevnar&#174;

In clinical studies (n=18,168), the most frequently reported adverse events
included injection site reactions, fever (&#8805;38&#186;C/100.4&#186;F), irritability,
drowsiness, restless sleep, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevnar. Hypersensitivity to
any vaccine component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its
use. Prevnar does not provide 100% protection against vaccine serotypes or
protect against nonvaccine serotypes. The decision to administer Prevnar should
be based on its efficacy in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease. 

The frequency of pneumococcal serotypes and serogroups can vary from country to
country, which could influence the effectiveness of the vaccine in any given
country.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has launched new betas for its free Office suite and for the "streaming" technology it will use to deliver some paid versions of Office 2010 next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As first reported by ZDNet blogger Mary Jo Foley, Microsoft has kicked off a private beta of Office Starter 2010, the ad-supported edition that the company will offer computer makers in lieu of the ancient Microsoft Works, which has been discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Starter will include on-screen advertisements, the first desktop edition of Microsoft's longstanding suite to do so. The ads will be limited to a space in the lower-right-hand of the applications' windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced Office Starter 2010 more than a month ago, but said it would not be available to the public until the completed Office 2010 suite ships sometime in the first half of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Starter will include reduced-functionality versions of Word and Excel, the suite's word processor and spreadsheet, but will not be a time-limited trial. Microsoft hopes that customers will like what they see and pony up the money for the real deal, such as the entry-level Office Home and Student 2010 or the more expensive Office Home and Business 2010. Prices for Office 2010 have not been set, and last month Microsoft refused to say whether Office Starter users will receive a discount if they purchase a for-a-fee edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Microsoft confirmed that it has launched a preview of Office Starter 2010 to what a company spokesman said was a "select group of users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also included in the Starter beta, said the spokesman, is a new feature called "Office Starter to Go" that lets testers run Word Starter and Excel Starter from a USB flash drive. According to Foley, Office Starter to Go will run from the flash drive on Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also sent invitations to a larger group of testers for a preview of the "Click-To-Run" mechanism it plans to use to deliver some final editions of Office 2010 next year. In messages sent to people who had tested the Technical Preview of Office 2010 last summer, Microsoft urged them to try the Click-To-Run delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last weekend in an FAQ posted to its Web site, Microsoft hinted that it would offer the public a beta of Home and Business using Click-To-Run, but those plans have been put on hold, said Takeshi Numoto, the corporate vice president for Office, in an interview earlier this week . "We're working to make that available as soon as possible," said Numoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click-To-Run is a new technology that Microsoft debuted in the Technical Preview that went out to testers last July. Essentially, it "streams" pieces of the suite as users begin a download, letting them start running the suite within minutes. It also runs Office 2010 in a virtualized environment, separating it from the rest of Windows and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Office 2010 Beta that went live on Wednesday, the Click-To-Run version of Office 2010 Home and Business must be installed alongside existing versions of Office on the PC; it's not possible to upgrade from Office 2003 or Office 2007 to the beta of 2010. Testers must also first uninstall the Technical Preview before installing the Click-To-Run edition of the beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beta of Click-To-Run Office Home and Business 2010 includes Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint and Word. Like the standard download of Office 2010 Beta, the version delivered via Click-To-Run expires Oct. 31, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Jury finds punitive damages are warranted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Verdict is largest so far in Philadelphia cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Jury to reconvene on damages on Monday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Nov 20 (Reuters) - A Philadelphia jury on
Friday ordered pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (PFE.N) to pay $6.3
million in compensatory damages to an Illinois breast cancer
survivor after finding menopause drugs Premarin, Provera and
Prempro caused the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The panel also found that punitive damages are warranted
because of willful and wanton conduct by Pfizer units Wyeth and
Pharmacia  Upjohn in failing to warn Donna Kendall about risks
associated with the drugs, said her attorney Tobias Millrood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The jury meets on Monday to decide on additional damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The award is the largest so far of about three dozen
Prempro cases tried in Philadelphia, out of about 1,500 pending
lawsuits, Millrood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it was "disappointed" by the verdict and would
evaluate its legal options as soon as the case concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug companies have prevailed in most hormone therapy
cases spurred by the 2002 Women's Health Initiative finding
that long-term use of the menopause drugs increases women's
breast cancer and cardiovascular disease risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kendall, 66, of Decatur, Illinois, had been taking Wyeth's
Prempro as well as Provera, sold by Pfizer's Phamacia unit for
a total of 11 years when she was diagnosed with breast cancer
in 2002, Millrood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth was the original defendant in hundreds of personal
liability cases involving the hormone replacement therapy
drugs. But with its $67 billion acquisition of that company,
completed last month, Pfizer inherited Wyeth's legal headaches
as well as its drug portfolio and promising pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn have argued at trial that the
drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Kendall v. Wyeth et al, Philadelphia County
Court of Common Pleas.

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day

stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Toyota`s 1st Sales Gain in 15 Months

Toyota Motors (NYSE: TM) has posted its first year-over-year monthly sales gain
across the globe in 15 months during October. The company`s sales rose 4% to
more than 630,000 vehicles. In the U.S., the company`s sales fell 3.5%. 

However, in the domestic market Toyota`s sales grew 15% helped by tax breaks for
purchases of environment-friendly cars. In China, the company saw a staggering
rise of 40% in sales. Toyota returned to profitability in the second quarter of
fiscal 2010 ended Sep 30, 2009, after reporting losses since the third quarter
of fiscal 2009. 

The company posted a profit of &#165;21.8 billion ($232 million) or &#165;6.96 per share
(7 cents) per share. This profit was attributed to government incentive programs
across the world - such as the U.S. "Cash for Clunkers"- that helped the company
recoup its market share. Consolidated revenue in the quarter dipped 24% to &#165;4.54
trillion ($48 billion). 

Automotive revenue fell 24% to &#165;4.11 trillion ($44 billion) while Financial
Services revenue shrank 17% to &#165;307 billion ($4 billion). This was on the back
of a decline in vehicle sales in each region as well as a negative impact from
the appreciation of yen. Sales volume declined 16% to 1.64 million units due to
a decrease in volume in all the regions except North America. 

Petrobras Profit Exceeds Ests

Brazilian energy giant Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (NYSE: PBR), or Petrobras S.A.
announced encouraging third quarter results, helped by strong performance from
the Supply segment. Earnings per ADR came in at R$1.66 (96 cents), comfortably
beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. However, on a year-over-year
basis, Petrobras` earnings per ADR was down approximately 28.7%, hurt by lower
prices of oil and natural gas. Still, they were better than the high
double-digit earnings decline suffered by other majors such as ExxonMobil Corp.
(NYSE: XOM), Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX), and Royal Dutch Shell PLC (NYSE: RDS.A).


Total oil and gas production during the third quarter of 2009 reached 2,534
million oil-equivalent barrels per day, from 2,524 million in the previous
quarter and 2,437 million in the same period of 2008. Compared to the third
quarter of 2008, Brazilian oil and natural gas liquids production increased
4.8%, while international production was up 24.6%. However, Brazilian natural
gas volumes were down 3.3% from the year-ago period, while international output
during the quarter was down 6.0% year over year. 

During the third quarter of 2009, the average sales price of oil in Brazil
decreased 36.4% from the year-earlier period to $64 per barrel. Average sales
price of international oil was down 16.9% year-over-year, reaching $57.16 per
barrel. Regarding natural gas, average international sales price decreased 21.5%
from the third quarter of 2008, while domestic price was down 61.5%. 

Refining costs per barrel in Brazil was down 2.6% to $3.37 and internationally,
it fell 45.2% to $3.51. Lifting cost per barrel moved down 24.5% in Brazil to
$22.86, while overseas costs rose 9.4% to $5.6. Petrobras exported an average of
724,000 barrels of oil per day, 10.2% higher compared to the same period last
year.

Data Show Geodon Used as an Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate Is Effective in the
Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar I Disorder
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
approved Geodon&#174; (ziprasidone HCI) Capsules for maintenance treatment of bipolar
I disorder as an adjunct to lithium or valproate in adults. The approval is
based on clinical data demonstrating that Geodon is an effective and generally
well-tolerated adjunctive treatment for long-term symptom control in patients
with bipolar disorder. 

Bipolar disorder, which affects approximately 5.7 million adults in the United
States, is a debilitating, chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment
and management.1 More than 90 percent of patients with bipolar disorder have
recurring mood episodes,2 making it important to establish a long-term treatment
plan to help prevent recurrence and stabilize mood. The recurrence of mood
episodes associated with bipolar disorder can have a devastating impact on
patients` lives, and the disease is associated with high rates of disability.3

"The FDA approval of Geodon provides an additional treatment option for patients
with bipolar disorder, who require maintenance therapy to keep the symptoms of
the disease under control," said Charles Bowden, clinical professor of
psychiatry and pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center. 

The efficacy and safety of Geodon for the adjunctive maintenance treatment of
bipolar disorder were studied in a six-month, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with bipolar I disorder. After an
open-label stabilization period of 10 to 16 weeks, 240 patients were randomized
to continue on Geodon plus lithium or valproate, or to have Geodon replaced by
placebo.4 The primary endpoint in this study was time to recurrence of a mood
episode requiring intervention. 

The data demonstrated that Geodon plus lithium or valproate was superior to
placebo plus lithium or valproate in increasing the time to recurrence of a mood
episode. During six months of treatment, 19.7 percent of patients in the Geodon
arm required intervention for a mood episode, compared with 32.4 percent of
patients in the placebo arm.4

The adjunctive Geodon treatment regimen was generally well-tolerated.4
Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 13 percent of patients in the
placebo group, compared with 9 percent of those in the Geodon group.5 The safety
and tolerability data from this study are consistent with Geodon`s already
well-established safety profile in adult patients. 

"The recurrence of mood episodes associated with bipolar disorder can have a
devastating impact on patients` lives," said Dr. Ilise Lombardo, senior medical
director, Pfizer Specialty Care. "This approval underscores Pfizer`s commitment
to supporting people suffering from serious mental health disorders." 

Geodon is also FDA-approved for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes
associated with bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features, and for
the treatment of schizophrenia. Since the FDA approval of Geodon in February
2001, nearly 2 million adult patients have been treated with this important
therapy.6

Important Safety Information

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic
drugs are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Geodon is not
approved for the treatment of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. 

Geodon is contraindicated in patients with a known history of QT prolongation,
recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure, and should
not be used with other QT-prolonging drugs. Geodon has a greater capacity to
prolong the QTc interval than several antipsychotics. In some drugs, QT
prolongation has been associated with torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal
arrhythmia. In many cases this would lead to the conclusion that other drugs
should be tried first. 

As with all antipsychotic medications, a rare and potentially fatal condition
known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported with Geodon. NMS
can cause hyperprexia, muscle rigidity, diaphoresis, tachycardia, irregular
pulse or blood pressure, cardiac dysrhythmia, and altered mental status. If
signs and symptoms appear, immediate discontinuation, treatment, and monitoring
are recommended. 

Prescribing should be consistent with the need to minimize tardive dyskinesia
(TD), a potentially irreversible dose- and duration-dependent syndrome. If signs
and symptoms appear, discontinuation should be considered since TD may remit
partially or completely. 

Hyperglycemia-related adverse events, sometimes serious, have been reported in
patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of
hyperglycemia or diabetes in patients treated with Geodon, and it is not known
if Geodon is associated with these events. Patients treated with an atypical
antipsychotic should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia. 

Precautions include the risk of rash, orthostatic hypotension, and seizures. 

In short-term schizophrenia trials, the most commonly observed adverse events
associated with Geodon at an incidence of &#8805;5% and at least twice the rate of
placebo were somnolence and respiratory tract infection. 

The most common adverse events associated with Geodon in adult patients with
bipolar mania were somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, dizziness, akathisia,
and abnormal vision.

    Greek Shipping a Global Force:

    Greece, a country of about 11 million people, controls by far the biggest
share -- nearly 20% -- of the world's merchant fleet by tonnage and has a
long tradition as a maritime nation. Greek shipowners who compete on a
global scale have a track record as astute operators and asset traders.
Even though shipping is not related to the development of the Greek
economy itself, it is a significant contributor to it mainly through the
foreign currency inflows it generates.

    Greek shipping has now successfully become a key participant in the U.S.
capital markets. Since 2005, the majority of U.S. listings in shipping
have been by Greek owned or managed shipping companies.

    11th Annual Capital Link Forum on Investing in Greece:

    Top government officials and the CEOs of major Greek corporations will
present to American investors the progress, developments and potential of
the Greek economy, capital markets and companies, as well as business and
investment opportunities in Greece and the wider area of Southeastern
Europe.

    The event is organized every year by Capital Link under the auspices of
the Ministry of Economy, Competitiveness and Shipping of Greece in
cooperation with the New York Stock Exchange and with the support of
major global investment banks.

    Sponsors:

    Bank of America Merrill Lynch is the lead Sponsor of the Forum, with
Knight Capital Group and Tsakos Energy Navigation as the Gold Sponsors.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is the Sliver Sponsor. The event is also sponsored
by Credit Suisse, Sal Oppenheim, Fortis Bank Nederland, Maxim Group,
Alapis, Coca Cola Hellenic, Hellenic Aerospace Industry, Hellenic Foreign
Trade Board, Hellenic Telecommunications Organization, Intralot,

&lt;p&gt;Data Show Geodon Used as an Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate Is Effective in the
Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar I Disorder
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
approved Geodon&#174; (ziprasidone HCI) Capsules for maintenance treatment of bipolar
I disorder as an adjunct to lithium or valproate in adults. The approval is
based on clinical data demonstrating that Geodon is an effective and generally
well-tolerated adjunctive treatment for long-term symptom control in patients
with bipolar disorder. 

Bipolar disorder, which affects approximately 5.7 million adults in the United
States, is a debilitating, chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment
and management.1 More than 90 percent of patients with bipolar disorder have
recurring mood episodes,2 making it important to establish a long-term treatment
plan to help prevent recurrence and stabilize mood. The recurrence of mood
episodes associated with bipolar disorder can have a devastating impact on
patients` lives, and the disease is associated with high rates of disability.3

"The FDA approval of Geodon provides an additional treatment option for patients
with bipolar disorder, who require maintenance therapy to keep the symptoms of
the disease under control," said Charles Bowden, clinical professor of
psychiatry and pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center. 

The efficacy and safety of Geodon for the adjunctive maintenance treatment of
bipolar disorder were studied in a six-month, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with bipolar I disorder. After an
open-label stabilization period of 10 to 16 weeks, 240 patients were randomized
to continue on Geodon plus lithium or valproate, or to have Geodon replaced by
placebo.4 The primary endpoint in this study was time to recurrence of a mood
episode requiring intervention. 

The data demonstrated that Geodon plus lithium or valproate was superior to
placebo plus lithium or valproate in increasing the time to recurrence of a mood
episode. During six months of treatment, 19.7 percent of patients in the Geodon
arm required intervention for a mood episode, compared with 32.4 percent of
patients in the placebo arm.4

The adjunctive Geodon treatment regimen was generally well-tolerated.4
Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 13 percent of patients in the
placebo group, compared with 9 percent of those in the Geodon group.5 The safety
and tolerability data from this study are consistent with Geodon`s already
well-established safety profile in adult patients. 

"The recurrence of mood episodes associated with bipolar disorder can have a
devastating impact on patients` lives," said Dr. Ilise Lombardo, senior medical
director, Pfizer Specialty Care. "This approval underscores Pfizer`s commitment
to supporting people suffering from serious mental health disorders." 

Geodon is also FDA-approved for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes
associated with bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features, and for
the treatment of schizophrenia. Since the FDA approval of Geodon in February
2001, nearly 2 million adult patients have been treated with this important
therapy.6

Important Safety Information

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic
drugs are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Geodon is not
approved for the treatment of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. 

Geodon is contraindicated in patients with a known history of QT prolongation,
recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure, and should
not be used with other QT-prolonging drugs. Geodon has a greater capacity to
prolong the QTc interval than several antipsychotics. In some drugs, QT
prolongation has been associated with torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal
arrhythmia. In many cases this would lead to the conclusion that other drugs
should be tried first. 

As with all antipsychotic medications, a rare and potentially fatal condition
known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported with Geodon. NMS
can cause hyperprexia, muscle rigidity, diaphoresis, tachycardia, irregular
pulse or blood pressure, cardiac dysrhythmia, and altered mental status. If
signs and symptoms appear, immediate discontinuation, treatment, and monitoring
are recommended. 

Prescribing should be consistent with the need to minimize tardive dyskinesia
(TD), a potentially irreversible dose- and duration-dependent syndrome. If signs
and symptoms appear, discontinuation should be considered since TD may remit
partially or completely. 

Hyperglycemia-related adverse events, sometimes serious, have been reported in
patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of
hyperglycemia or diabetes in patients treated with Geodon, and it is not known
if Geodon is associated with these events. Patients treated with an atypical
antipsychotic should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia. 

Precautions include the risk of rash, orthostatic hypotension, and seizures. 

In short-term schizophrenia trials, the most commonly observed adverse events
associated with Geodon at an incidence of &#8805;5% and at least twice the rate of
placebo were somnolence and respiratory tract infection. 

The most common adverse events associated with Geodon in adult patients with
bipolar mania were somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, dizziness, akathisia,
and abnormal vision.

&lt;p&gt;Lobbyists - Mac McLarty, John Breaux, Trent Lott, Mickey Kantor, Carla Hills and
Others - Charged With Misrepresenting Facts
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron has retained at least twelve public relations firms and lobbyists to
discredit claims of Amazon indigenous groups on the eve of an expected
multi-billion dollar judgment against the oil giant in an environmental lawsuit
in Ecuador, according to representatives of the tribes in the U.S. 

Although Chevron is near the top of the list of highest-spending lobbyists in
Washington, the campaign seems to be backfiring. Politico, one of the most
influential publications on Capitol Hill, reported this week that Chevron`s
lobbying was "drawing fire from environmentalists, media ethicists, state
pension funds, New York`s attorney general, members of Congress, and even Barack
Obama when he was a Senator." 

The article also quoted Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) as calling Chevron`s
lobbying "clumsy" and "very heavy handed." Sanchez - who on Tuesday
characterized the Chevron lobbying as "extortion" in testimony before Congress -
said she plans to write three letters to Members of Congress, blasting what she
called the oil giant`s "misguided approach" to dealing with the lawsuit from the
indigenous groups. 

Separately, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is investigating the company
to determine if it is misleading its own shareholders about the financial risk
from the Ecuador case, where damages are assessed at up to $27.3 billion,
Politico reported. 

An American legal advisor to the plaintiffs, Steven Donziger, criticized the
public relations and lobbying effort. "Chevron is paying huge fees to lobby the
U.S. government to inappropriately quash a legal case brought by indigenous
tribes in the country where Chevron asked for the trial to be held," said
Donziger, who has been working on the matter since it was filed in U.S. federal
court in 1993. 

The case, which alleges Texaco dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste in the
Amazon from 1964 to 1990, was transferred from U.S. federal court to Ecuador in
2002 at Chevron`s request. The oil giant filed 14 expert affidavits in the U.S.
court praising Ecuador`s court system, but later began a campaign to discredit
those same courts once the evidence in the Ecuador trial pointed to its
culpability. 

The Amazon Defense Coalition notes that the public relations firms working for
Chevron include Hill &amp; Knowlton, which represented the tobacco industry and, as
it did in the debate over tobacco and cancer, has tried to deny a link between
oil contamination and cancer; Edelman Worldwide, which is believed to be
preparing a Wal-Mart-style political campaign against the indigenous groups in
anticipation of an adverse court judgment; Sard Verbinnen, which handles
financial press in an effort to stem a budding shareholder revolt against
Chevron management for its handling of the case; Robinson Lerer &amp; Montgomery, a
well connected New York-based agency; Sam Singer and Associates, which handles
the matter in the San Francisco area, where Chevron is located; and the
Washington-based CRC Public Relations, which helped create a pro-Chevron video
by former CNN correspondent Gene Randall to counteract a highly unflattering 60
Minutes segment on the legal case that broadcast earlier in the year. 

The Randall video, which did not mention that it was paid for by Chevron, was
blasted by the Columbia Journalism Review for "blurring the line between public
relations and journalism." The President of CRC, Greg Mueller, spearheaded the
Swift Boat campaign against John Kerry and is a former senior aide to Pat
Buchanan. 

Among Chevron`s lobbyists is Wayne Berman, former McCain campaign national
finance chair who chairs the governmental relations practice at Ogilvy
Worldwide; former Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott; Mac McLarty, former chief
of state to President Clinton who is lobbying the State Department; Mickey
Kantor and Carla Hills, former U.S. trade ambassadors who are lobbying their
former agency to cancel Ecuador`s trade preferences; Peter Romero, who served as
U.S. ambassador to Ecuador in the early 1990s under the first Clinton
Administration; Brian Pomper, the former staff director to U.S. Sen. Max Baucus;
Scott Parvin, a career lobbyist who formerly worked with Kantor at the law firm
Mayer Brown; and several members of Chevron`s governmental relations office in
Washington, headed by William Irwin. 

Lawyers for the Amazon communities have long said Chevron`s public relations and
lobbying firms are part of a broader effort by the company to undermine the rule
of law in Ecuador in anticipation of an adverse judgment. The company has taken
out advertisements in both Ecuadorian and American newspapers attacking lawyers
for the communities and various judges who have presided over the case. 

The public relations firms and lobbyists also state incorrectly that Chevron was
released from further clean-up responsibility in Ecuador by the government in
exchange for a limited clean-up in the mid 1990s. But the terms of the release
itself expressly exclude the private claims in the current lawsuit and the
so-called remediation was a fraud that has led to the indictment of two Chevron
lawyers and several former government officials, said Donziger. 

Evidence at trial against Chevron includes more than 50,000 chemical sampling
results produced by the company itself, which prove that 100% of its former well
sites are highly contaminated with cancer-causing toxins, according to an
independent court-appointed Special Master who reviewed the evidence in the case
and assessed damages. 

A final decision on liability and damages is expected next year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some big Goldman Sachs Group Inc shareholders have asked the U.S. bank to cut what could be the biggest bonuses in its history to pass more profit onto investors, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Big investors want Goldman to reduce bonus pool-WSJ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Investors not requesting large cut-paper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Stockholders have not shared concern-Goldman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Goldman shares dip 0.7 percent
 (Adds Freeman comment, additional Goldman comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Some big Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) shareholders have asked the U.S. bank to cut what
could be the biggest bonuses in its history to pass more profit
onto investors, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the investors are not pushing for a huge cut, they
feel Goldman, which received $10 billion of taxpayer help
during the credit crisis, should better reward them for this
year's rebound, the paper said, quoting people familiar with
the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said major shareholders
had not contacted the company about lowering its bonus pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our investors have consistently told us that they expect
the firm to set compensation at a level which produces
attractive returns to shareholders," van Praag said in an
emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They know that compensation at Goldman Sachs is directly
linked to the firm's performance and that our compensation
ratio has consistently been at or among the lowest in the
industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman so far this year has set aside nearly $17 billion
for bonuses and looks well on track to break the $20 billion
mark, which could mean higher payouts per employee than in the
previous record year, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TALENT RETENTION CITED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Barclays Capital analyst Roger Freeman told Reuters he
has not had a "single conversation with any investor that
actually thinks comp is misguided" at Goldman. Freeman was
cited in the paper as saying he has heard from investors
concerned about how much Goldman delivers to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freeman said a change in compensation could cause Goldman
to lose talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That could be far more harmful to shareholders than
reining in comp for a quarter because it is a front-page
issue," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares were down 0.7 percent in early trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, compared with a 0.04 percent gain
in the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer Index .XBD. So far
this year, Goldman shares are up 103 percent, more than double
the gains for the broader sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A year after the implosion of U.S. bank giant Lehman
Brothers LEHMQ.PK, regulators and politicians have called for
closer scrutiny of pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders of Goldman are also concerned about a change
in its financial statements that increased the company's total
headcount by adding temporary employees and consultants, the
Wall Street Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Due to the change, it looked like Goldman employees are on
pace to earn $717,000 per person in 2009, the Journal said,
instead of the $775,000 that they would earn on average if
temporary employees and consultants were not counted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freeman told Reuters that the change is "not enough of a
switch that actually moves the needle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The complaints to Goldman come as institutional investors
have come under increasing pressure to use their influence to
curb excessive compensation and other perks at companies
they've invested in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is pushing a
proposal to encourage more participation in shareholder proxy
votes and give large investors more say in selecting boards of
directors.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it sees U.S.
metallurgical (steelmaking) coal miners better positioned to
benefit from a coal stock rally, driven by supply constraints,
and removed Peabody Energy Corp (BTU.N) its conviction list
partly on stock outperformance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Analyst Brian Singer named Alpha Natural Resources Inc
(ANR.N) his top pick in the sector, citing its spare capacity
of met coal, including high-quality hard coking coal, and
strong thermal coal contracts for 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have greater conviction that, if Asia becomes supply
constrained (as we expect in 2010), U.S. coal producers will
receive Asia spot prices at U.S. ports," the analyst wrote in a
note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singer also said consumers and not producers are likely to
pay the shipping differential as supply in Asia becomes tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst's positive outlook on met-levered coal stocks
was another reason for buy-rated Peabody being excluded from
the conviction list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The miner's thermal coal is said to fuel about 10 percent
of all U.S. electricity generation and 2 percent of global
power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Coal stocks have performed well... We believe the last leg
up for coal stock multiples will come from greater recognition
of supply constraints in the Pacific," said the analyst, who
raised his price target on several coal stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Peabody edged 3 percent lower to $44.79 Friday
morning on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the a summary of the price target changes made on the

&lt;p&gt;Revatio is the Only Treatment in Its Class with Both Oral and Intravenous
Formulations
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
approved Revatio&#174; (sildenafil) Injection, an intravenous formulation of Revatio.
Revatio is the only FDA-approved phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor available
in both tablet and intravenous formulations. 

Revatio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial
hypertension (WHO Group I) to improve exercise ability and delay clinical
worsening. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when Revatio was
added to background epoprostenol therapy. The efficacy of Revatio has not been
adequately evaluated in patients taking bosentan concurrently. Revatio Injection
is for the continued treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension
who are currently prescribed Revatio Tablets but who are temporarily unable to
take oral medication. 

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare, progressive disease that affects an
estimated 100,000 men and women worldwide. This incurable disease is
characterized by continuous high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, often
leading to heart failure and premature death. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
can occur with no known underlying cause, or it can occur in association with
other disorders. 

Due to the chronic nature of pulmonary arterial hypertension, maintaining
medical therapy can delay clinical worsening for patients. However, in some
cases, oral medication may not be an option for a period of time. While oral
treatment can often be re-introduced at a later stage, the ability to maintain
treatment during periods when the patient is unable to take an oral formulation
is important to preserving health in patients with pulmonary arterial
hypertension. 

"The approval of Revatio Injection is a clear demonstration of Pfizer`s
commitment to developing treatments addressing the unmet needs of patients with
pulmonary arterial hypertension," said Dr. Cara Cassino, vice president of
pulmonary vascular disease, clinical development and medical affairs, Pfizer.
"This important milestone highlights the Specialty Care business unit`s
dedication to advancing treatments for serious and life-threatening conditions
such as pulmonary vascular disease." 

About Revatio

Revatio Tablets were approved by the FDA in June 2005 and by the European
Medicines Agency (EMEA) in November 2005. The American College of Chest
Physicians recommends Revatio for adult pulmonary arterial hypertension patients
in functional class II and III in its clinical practice guidelines for the
treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 

Revatio Injection will be supplied in a single-use vial. The recommended dose of
Revatio Injection is 10 mg (corresponding to 12.5 mL) administered as an
intravenous bolus injection three times a day. Revatio is also available as a 20
mg tablet taken three times a day. 

Important Safety Information

If patients take any medicines that contain nitrates (like nitroglycerin for
chest pain) - daily or just once in a while - DO NOT take Revatio. 

Revatio contains the same medicine as Viagra&#174; (sildenafil), which is used to
treat erectile dysfunction (impotence). Do not take Revatio with Viagra or other
PDE5 inhibitors. 

If patients have ever had blockage of veins in their lungs, which is called
pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, Revatio is not recommended. If patients feel
dizzy, have chest pain, or discomfort while taking Revatio, they should tell
their doctor right away. Also, they should discuss their general health with
their doctor, including if they have ever had problems with low blood pressure
or blood circulation. Revatio is not recommended for patients taking ritonavir
or antifungal medicines, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole. If patients are
taking Revatio with bosentan or medicines like barbiturates, carbamazepine,
phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine, rifampin or rifabutin, their doctor may adjust
their dose. Also, patients should tell their doctor if they are taking
alpha-blockers for prostate or blood pressure problems. 

Taking vitamin K antagonists (like Coumadin or warfarin) with Revatio may
increase risk of nosebleeds. Patients should tell their doctor if they take such
medicines. 

The safety of Revatio is not known in patients with bleeding problems and those
with stomach ulcers. If patients have a condition like this, they should tell
their doctor. 

Sudden decrease or loss of hearing has been reported in people taking PDE5
inhibitors, including Revatio. It is not possible to determine whether these
events are related directly to the PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors. If
patients take a PDE5 inhibitor, including Revatio, and experience a sudden
decrease or loss of hearing, they should contact their doctor right away. 

Men who took PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction had a sudden decrease or
loss of sight in one or both eyes. It is not possible to know if these cases are
related directly to these medicines or something else. If patients take a PDE5
inhibitor, including Revatio, and have a sudden decrease or loss of vision, they
should contact their doctor right away. 

Erections that last for more than four hours may occur with all drugs in this
class. Patients should call their doctor right away if this happens. Erections
that last more than six hours may lead to long-term loss of potency. 

Patients who did not take part in the clinical trial were those who have had a
heart attack, stroke, or life-threatening irregular heartbeat within the last 6
months; chest pain; blood pressure greater than 170/110; eye discoloration; or
patients on bosentan. 

The most common side effects of Revatio are nosebleeds, headache, upset stomach,
flushing, and trouble sleeping. 

At doses more than the approved 20 milligrams 3 times a day, some side effects
increased. These included flushing, loose stools, muscle pain, and visual
disturbances.

 WHO:           Disney Store will unveil a spectacular The Princess and the Frog themed window at its beautiful location on Magnificent Mile in Chicago, IL two weeks prior to the themed windows launching at more than 220 Disney Store locations nationwide.

About The Princess and the Frog

Presented by Walt Disney Animation Studios, the musical The Princess and the
Frog is an animated comedy set in the great city of New Orleans. A modern twist
on a classic tale, the film features a girl named Tiana who dreams of owning her
own restaurant, a frog prince who desperately wants to be human again, and a
fateful kiss that leads them both on a hilarious adventure through the mystical
bayous of Louisiana. The Princess and the Frog marks the return to hand-drawn
animation from the revered team of John Musker and Ron Clements, with music by
Oscar&#174;-winning composer Randy Newman. Featuring the voice talents of Anika Noni
Rose, Terrence Howard, John Goodman, Keith David, Jim Cummings, Jenifer Lewis
and Oprah Winfrey, the film opens Nov. 25, 2009, in Los Angeles and New York and
hits theaters nationwide on Dec. 11.

Advisory Committee Also Reaffirms the Product`s Safety Profile
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory
Committee voted 11 to 1 that clinical data included in a supplemental new drug
application (sNDA) provide substantial and convincing evidence to support the
claim that SPIRIVA&#174; HandiHaler&#174; (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder) reduces
exacerbations (worsening of symptoms) in patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). 

The advisory committee also voted affirmatively that data from the UPLIFT
(Understanding Potential Long-term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium) trial
adequately addressed the potential safety concern for an increased risk of
stroke (11 yes to 1 no) or adverse cardiovascular events (11 yes with 1
abstention). This is consistent with the current product label. The advisory
committee makes recommendations to the FDA, which the agency considers in its
final decision. 

"We are pleased with the advisory committee`s vote today supporting the claim
that SPIRIVA HandiHaler reduces COPD exacerbations," said Christopher Corsico,
M.D., MPH, Vice President, Drug Regulatory Affairs, Boehringer Ingelheim
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. "Exacerbations in COPD patients may lead to disability,
premature death and increased healthcare costs. We look forward to working with
the FDA during the final stages of its review of our sNDA." 

The advisory committee reviewed pivotal data from a six-month trial (Veterans
Affairs Study, 205.266) of 1,829 COPD patients and secondary endpoints from a
four-year trial (UPLIFT Study, 205.235) of approximately 6,000 COPD patients.
Although UPLIFT did not meet its primary endpoint, the study supports data from
the VA trial showing that SPIRIVA HandiHaler consistently reduced the risk of
exacerbations in COPD patients. COPD exacerbations were defined as patients
having a new onset or worsening of symptoms (including cough, sputum, wheezing,
or difficulty breathing) lasting for at least three days and which require a
change in treatment (antibiotics or steroids), which could include
hospitalization. 

The safety profile of SPIRIVA HandiHaler has been well-established in clinical
studies involving more than 17,000 COPD patients, 11,000 of whom were treated
with SPIRIVA HandiHaler, and in post-marketing experience involving more than 16
million patient-years of exposure since its European approval in 2002. SPIRIVA
HandiHaler was approved in the U.S. in 2004. 

About COPD

COPD is a progressive, but preventable and treatable lung condition that is
characterized by a restricted flow of air into and out of the lungs and loss of
lung function over time. It includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both. 

COPD is the fourth-leading cause of death and the second-leading cause of
disability in the United States, and is projected to become the third-leading
fatal illness by 2020. Each year, COPD kills 120,000 Americans - that`s one
death every four minutes. 

The disease primarily affects current and former smokers and symptoms include
shortness of breath, coughing (sometimes with phlegm or mucus) and wheezing.
COPD makes it difficult to breathe and, over time, interferes with a person`s
ability to perform daily physical activities. When most severe, COPD may even
limit a person`s ability to perform simple tasks such as washing and dressing.
The damage in the lungs caused by COPD is not reversible, but it is treatable. 

About SPIRIVA&#174; HandiHaler&#174;

SPIRIVA HandiHaler is a prescription medicine used once every day (a maintenance
medicine) to control symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
COPD includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both. SPIRIVA relaxes airways
and helps keep them open, to help make it easier to breathe when used every day.


SPIRIVA HandiHaler is not a rescue medicine and should not be used for treating
sudden breathing problems. 

Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules. Only use SPIRIVA capsules with the HandiHaler
device. The contents of the capsule should only be inhaled by mouth using the
HandiHaler device. 

Stop taking SPIRIVA and get medical help right away if your breathing suddenly
worsens, your throat or tongue swells, you get hives, or have vision changes or
eye pain. 

Tell your doctor if you have glaucoma, problems passing urine or an enlarged
prostate, as these may worsen with SPIRIVA. Also discuss with your doctor all
the medicines you take, including eye drops. 

The most common side effect with SPIRIVA is dry mouth. Others include
constipation and trouble passing urine. For a complete list of reported side
effects, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 

Do not get SPIRIVA powder in your eyes. 

Do not use SPIRIVA if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in SPIRIVA
capsules (tiotropium, lactose monohydrate) and if you have had any allergic
reaction to atropine or any medicines like it, such as ipratropium (Atrovent).

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is, predictably, not all that impressed by Google Inc.'s demonstration of its upcoming Chrome OS today, but neither were a number of potential rivals in the Linux and instant-on operating system space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google released Chrome OS as open source today. It did not, however, release a beta of the operating system for users, and said that hobbyists who would want to install it on their existing netbook or other hardware were out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, developers can compile the source code and run Chrome OS in a virtual machine to test Web app compatibility, Google said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts note the ratcheting up of the rivalry between Google and Microsoft with Chrome OS's release to developers today, but the rival OS won't be available on new netbooks for another year -- and Microsoft seized upon that fact today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From what was shared, it appears to be in the early stages of development," a Microsoft spokeswoman said via e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From our perspective, however, our customers are already voicing their approval of the way Windows 7 just works -- across the Web and on the desktop, and on all sizes and types of PCs -- purchasing twice as many units of Windows 7 as we've sold of any other operating system over a comparable time," the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is taking a longer term view, rethinking the OS and PC to achieve a better user experience, executives said today. For example, by dumping conventional BIOS-based boot-ups and only using solid-state drives , Chrome OS-based netbooks will be able to boot in 7 seconds, and run Web apps within another 3 seconds, the company said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That failed to impress Woody Hobbs, president and CEO of Phoenix Technologies Inc., a long-time BIOS software maker that has re-invented itself with a Linux-based instant-on OS called HyperSpace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instant-on is about being able to access your Internet applications in 1 second. 7 seconds is too long," Hobbs said in an e-mail. "There is no such thing as 'cold boot' for today's mobile PCs such as netbooks and smartbooks. You should be able to use your netbook like you use your smartphone -- a press of a button and you are 'on'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Lee, CEO of DeviceVM Inc., said Google's favoritism towards its own browser and Web apps could rub some users the wrong way, especially those outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In China, users prefer Baidu, not Google," Lee said. DeviceVM's Splashtop platform boots into Firefox within seconds and uses Yahoo or Baidu as default search engines instead of Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects Splashtop to have been shipped on 100 million netbooks and other PCs by the end of next year, when the first Chrome OS netbooks are due to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tariq Krim, founder of Linux netbook OS maker, Jolicloud , said Chrome OS's 100% Web orientation -- users won't be able to install applications locally, though they may be able to run some of the Web apps offline using HTML 5 technology -- is premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Native apps aren't dead yet," Krim said. "I love VLC [media player], I love Skype, I love using OpenOffice.org on the airplane when I don't have Wi-Fi access."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other rivals said they welcomed Chrome OS. Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation, said, "What's good for Chrome is good for Moblin, and what's good for Moblin is good for Chrome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Linux Foundation oversees the Moblin netbook OS , created originally by Intel Corp., as well as the Linux kernel itself. "Many of the technologies present in Chrome originated in the Moblin Project. For example, Moblin pioneered fast boot technology," Zemlin said by e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone will benefit, he said. "The real loser today is Microsoft. Shared development accelerates time to market and innovation, bringing better products to consumers and better returns to companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canonical Ltd., maker of the popular Ubuntu Linux, revealed today that it has been contributing engineers and developers to Chrome OS .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canonical said it is unafraid of potential cannibalization. "While the two operating systems share some core components, Google Chrome OS will provide a very different experience to Ubuntu," wrote Chris Kenyon, Canonical's vice-president for OEM services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ubuntu will continue to be a general-purpose OS running both Web and native applications such as OpenOffice and will not require specialized hardware," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's next browser, Internet Explorer 9 (IE9), will offload image and text rendering chores to the PC's graphic processor, one way the company plans to increase the browser's overall performance, according to the firm's top IE manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft won't be alone. Rivals including Mozilla, which makes Firefox, and Norwegian developer Opera, are working on ways to use a computer's graphics processor unit (GPU) to accelerate their browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft last week revealed a few details about IE9, which has no set ship date or even a publicly-disclosed development plan. While acknowledging that the company had a lot of catching up to do, however, Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft's president of Windows and Windows Live, said that early work on IE9 had already shown significant performance strides .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up interview, Dean Hachamovitch, the general manager for IE, explained one way that Microsoft would speed up IE9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One reason why you get such great value from PC hardware comes from the machine's graphics, [so] we're moving IE on top of the modern Windows graphics engine, DirectX," said Hachamovitch. Specifically, IE9 will ditch Windows' GDI (Graphics Device Interface) used by earlier versions for image rendering, and instead call on the Direct2D and DirectWrite APIs (application programming interfaces) to render two-dimensional images and text, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those APIs shift the processing from the PC's CPU to its GPU. "Graphics hardware acceleration means that rich, graphically intensive sites can render faster while using less CPU," Hachamovitch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Hachamovitch declined to peg a goal for IE9's hardware-based acceleration, he said early results have been encouraging. "On top of GDI, we were seeing IE render at 5-10 frames per second. Users don't know whether that's [caused by] the network, or a site script, but it just seems kind of slow to them. Using [Direct2D], we're seeing 40, 50 or 60 frames per second. That's game-like responsiveness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the image and text rendering -- DirectWrite results in much sharper text -- is done by Windows in conjunction with the GPU, there's nothing Web site or Web application developers will have to do to make their sites seem faster to IE9 users. "Web developers can take advantage of the hardware ecosystem's advances in graphics, but don't have to rewrite their sites to do that," Hachamovitch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn't alone in exploring graphics acceleration: The top engineers at Mozilla and Opera both said that their companies are pursing the same grail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have our own projects to use OpenGL on open platforms, and Microsoft's APIs on Windows," said Mike Shaver, Mozilla's vice president of engineering. OpenGL, or Open Graphics Library, is an open-source set of function calls used to render two- and three-dimensional images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera, like Mozilla, doesn't limit itself to building a browser for Windows only, as does Microsoft, and so faces the same cross-platform issues as Mozilla. But hardware acceleration is coming, argued Hakon Wium Lie, Opera's chief technology officer. "We're going to see hardware acceleration across the board," Wie said. "But we can't tie ourselves to a single API, like Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Shaver and Lie noted that graphics-based browser acceleration would deliver even more benefits on mobile devices, such as smartphones. Mozilla is working on a mobile version of Firefox, dubbed Fennec , while the mobile version of Opera is much more popular than its desktop sibling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaver said that hardware acceleration would debut in one of the upcoming editions of Firefox, although not in Firefox 3.6 , which is slated to hit release candidate status later this month and ship before the end of the year. "We'll put it in when it's ready," Shaver said. Firefox 3.7, another minor upgrade, is set to wrap up in the first half of next year, while the major upgrade to Firefox 4.0 is currently scheduled for later in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some have accused Microsoft of ignoring available standards -- including OpenGL for rendering two-dimensional images -- charges that have been leveled against the company numerous times in the past over other issues, Shaver and Lie refused to be drawn into that conversation. "It would be nice if we could use OpenGL on Windows, but you have to play the cards that are dealt," Shaver said. "On Windows, DirectX and Direct2D are the only reasonable path right now, so for building a Windows browser, using the DirectX APIs is reasonable. Microsoft isn't doing anything that we wouldn't be able to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaver pointed out that Direct2D was only available on Windows Vista and Windows 7, a limiting factor. Most Windows PCs , however, still run the eight-year-old-and-counting Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's approach is reasonable as long as [the APIs] remain documented," said Lie, who added that if they weren't, Opera would be the first to object. Opera has done that in the past by filing complaints with European antitrust regulators over Microsoft's bundling of IE with Windows, and IE's purported lack of support for widely-used Web standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hardware acceleration will deliver extraordinary performance [to IE9]," said Microsoft's Hachamovitch, something that Shaver and Lie echoed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone will have a better experience on the Web," Lie agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

"Goldman must have known this, because it underwrote some of those value-destroying CDOs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman should do this before it gives bonuses to "taxpayer-protected employees," Tavakoli said in the Times report.&lt;/p&gt;

Goldman could be made in such a way that it does not harm
shareholders, noting that the related tax savings could help
finance the company's small-business initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A contribution could also help Goldman ward off "serious
calls for a windfall tax on bonuses, which would be justified
since the profits they are based on are in a large part the
result of government efforts," the editorial said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In another story published in the Times on Saturday,
Gretchen Morgenson quotes Janet Tavakoli, an expert in
derivatives at consulting firm Tavakoli Structured Finance, who
urged Goldman to repay money from the AIG bailout, saying
Goldman should be forced to take back toxic collateralized debt
obligations, or CDOs, which had been insured with AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The prices of the collateralized debt obligations against
which Goldman bought protection from AIG were in sickening
freefall, and the cost of replacing AIG's protection would have
been sky-high," she said. "Goldman must have known this,
because it underwrote some of those value-destroying CDOs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman should do this before it gives bonuses to
"taxpayer-protected employees," Tavakoli said in the Times
report.

&lt;p&gt;Redmond turned red-faced upon learning that an automatically installed Microsoft Windows Presentation Foundation plug-in for Firefox opened a major security hole. Following Microsoft's disclosure of the bug, Mozilla blocked the plug-in. According to Mozilla, Microsoft agreed with the move, even though it had released a patch to close the underlying flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously,The move coincided with Mozilla's launch of a new Plugin Check page designed to identify and update old and vulnerable plug-ins. The page checks only certain popular plug-ins right now, but it's a simple and handy security tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And to top off your Mozilla updates, be sure to pick up the Firefox 3.0.15 or 3.5.5 updates. These new versions close holes that can allow JavaScript and other attacks. Click Help, Check for Up&#173;&#173;dates to ensure that you have the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Patch Push&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft delivered eight critical patches this month, including the Firefox fix, and another five patches that address other important Web-based threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Internet Explorer patch wards off drive-by download attacks and fixes the Firefox plug-in vulnerability. It's rated critical for IE 5 on Windows 2000; IE 6 on XP and Server 2003; IE 7 on XP, Vista, Server 2003, and Server 2008; and IE 8 on Windows XP, Vista, 7, Server 2003, and Server 2008. See the MS09-054 bulletin for details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problems with the Microsoft Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI+) could let an attacker take control of your PC if you view a tainted image on a Web page or open it in an affected program. The MS09-062 patch is critical for XP, Vista, Server 2003, and Server 2008, and needed for IE 6 on Win 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewing a malicious streaming-media .asf file on a Web page or opening one in an affected program could launch an at&#173;&#173;tack on systems lacking the MS09-051 patch for Windows Media Runtime. It's critical for Windows 2000, XP, Vista, Server 2003, and Server 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The associated MS09-052 patch for Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003 fixes a hole in Windows Media Player; but the flaw can also be triggered by using the program to browse to a directory that contains a malicious file, according to security company Shavlik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Active Template Library gets more patches, in the form of the MS09-055 killbit patch for Windows 2000 and XP that disables troublesome ActiveX controls, and the MS09-060 fix for ActiveX controls that Office introduced. Office XP, 2003, and 2007 need the critical fix, as do the Visio 2002, 2003, and 2007 viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Tarnished Silverlight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MS09-061 patch repels takeover attacks from malicious Web pages. It's critical if your Windows client (nonserver) installation or Mac has Silverlight installed, and it's important for Windows servers. The same patch closes holes in versions of .Net on Windows 2000, XP, Vista, and 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final critical patch, MS09-050, fixes an SMB problem (discussed last month) affecting Vista and Server 2008. Unpatched PCs could be hit by a network-based attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run Microsoft Update to ensure that you have all of these critical patches, along with the five security fixes rated Important. For a full list of this month's patches, see Microsoft's Security Bulletin Summary for October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe Reinforcement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge patch for Adobe Reader and Acrobat closes 29 vulnerabilities. Windows, Mac, and Unix users with version 9.1.3 or 8.1.6 of either program need version 9.2 or 8.1.7; Windows and Mac users with version 7.1.3 need version 7.1.4.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today confirmed that exploit code published last week can compromise PCs running older versions of Internet Explorer (IE), but said its security team has not yet seen any in-the-wild attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack code, which was posted Friday to the Bugtraq security mailing list , affects both Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) and the newer IE7, Microsoft acknowledged. "Microsoft can confirm that the publicly available exploit code affects IE6 and IE7, not IE8," a company spokesman said in an e-mail reply to questions today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE6 and IE7 account for more than 41% of all browsers used worldwide, according to the most recent data from metrics firm Net Applications. IE8, meanwhile, has an 18.1% market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend , Symantec researchers took note of the exploit code, but said that it was shaky. "The exploit currently exhibits signs of poor reliability, but we expect that a fully-functional reliable exploit will be available in the near future," the security company's analysis team said in an entry on a company blog Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Danish vulnerability tracking vendor Secunia, the flaw is in IE's layout parser , and could be exploited by hackers to hijack fully-patched Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3) machines. Secunia rated the vulnerability as "highly critical," its second-highest threat ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to answer questions about which versions of Windows are vulnerable. Windows Vista, for example, ships with IE7. Windows 7, however, relies on the unaffected IE8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also declined to spell out plans for quashing the IE bug. "Microsoft is investigating new public claims of a possible vulnerability in Internet Explorer," the spokesman said, using boilerplate that the company regularly rolls out when it's asked about patching progress. "Once we're done investigating, we will take appropriate action to help protect customers ... [which] may include providing a security update through the monthly release process, an out-of-cycle update or additional guidance to help customers protect themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will issue its next scheduled security updates in a little more than two weeks on Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One security researcher said it's unlikely Microsoft will move fast enough to make that deadline. "Seeing as though they haven't even posted an advisory, and with the holiday this week, I'm doubting a Dec. 8 release," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More likely, said Storms, is that Microsoft will offer steps that IE6 and IE7 users can take to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Symantec recommended that users disable JavaScript in IE6 and IE7, a move that could stymie attacks, since the current exploit code requires JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To turn off JavaScript, users should select the "Tools" menu in IE, then click "Internet Options," the "Security" tab and the "Internet" content zone. Next, click "Custom Level" and in the "Settings" box, click "Disable" under "Active scripting." Click "OK" in the current dialog box, as well as the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Nov 23 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on
Monday rejected Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) request that it
reconsider the way patents are upheld in court cases, as the
software maker continues its long legal battle with French
telecoms equipment company Alcatel-Lucent (ALUA.PA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which infringed an Alcatel-Lucent patent,
according to a lower court jury last year, asked the appeals
court to hear its argument that a patent could be held invalid
if evidence is presented in a court case that was not available
at the time the patent was granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also asked that the standard for invalidating a patent
should be a "preponderance" of evidence, rather than "clear and
convincing" evidence, as it stands now, which would make it
easier to invalidate Alcatel-Lucent's patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
which handles many patent and trademark cases, denied that
request on Monday, without any explanation or comment,
according to electronic court records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision means that a retrial of the case, ordered by
the appeals court earlier this year, will go ahead under the
same standards of proof as the original trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In September, the appeals court overturned a $358 million
damages award against Microsoft saying that Microsoft did
infringe a patent, but that damages were not justified and must
be retried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The long-running dispute centers on technology that allows
users to enter dates into calendars in Microsoft's Outlook
e-mail program, known as the "Day" patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Day" patent dispute is the last part of a large,
long-running, multibillion dollar patent dispute between the
two technology firms. The remainder of the litigation was
resolved last December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declined comment on the matter. An Alcatel-Lucent
representative did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.

&lt;p&gt;News Corp. and Microsoft are reportedly in "early stage talks" to cut an exclusive deal that would prevent Google from indexing the media conglomerate's news Websites some of which include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and others. The deal will allegedly give Microsoft's Bing search engine the exclusive rights to deliver search results and news pages with New Corp. content, according to  The Financial Times . The report also says that Microsoft has approached other unnamed major Web publishers to cut similar deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second time this month that rumors and speculation have surfaced about News Corp. delisting its content from Google.  In early November, News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch told Sky News Australia that his company might block Google from indexing its news Websites once all of the company's news properties erect pay walls by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exclusive deal with Bing may look like an attractive deal for both Microsoft and News Corp, but the concept is likely to end up being a major failure for Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay to display will hurt Microsoft first &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times' story quotes an anonymous Web publisher who believes Microsoft's plan for exclusive content deals is "all about Microsoft hurting Google's margins."  In other words, Microsoft wants to force Google to start spending money on the content it now gets to index for free.  But does Microsoft seriously believe it can force Google to also start paying for search content?  Not likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has already said that news organizations are free to stop the search giant from indexing their sites. Not to mention that the FT's story also quotes Google UK's Matt Brittin stating that Google News is not a big revenue generator for the search giant. That's not a surprise since Google doesn't place ads on any of its news pages.  Without ads being displayed, and so many other newspapers willing to be indexed, Google clearly has no appetite for paying to display news content from one media company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Microsoft's deal only hurts Google if the search giant allows itself to play Redmond's game.  Engaging in a bidding war for the right to display exclusive content within search results is a risky gamble that could lead to an explosion of content producers demanding the same type of deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would Google want to encourage that kind of behavior? Sure, Google already pays to display content from the Associated Press, Agence France Presse and other newswires. But those are complete news stories contained within Google's own Web pages.  Google News content fromThe Wall Street Journal, on the other hand, consists of headlines and text snippets that encourage users to click through to the Journal's site.  For the most part, Google News is simply a starting point for information; it is not a destination.  And that's the beauty of any news aggregator: a directory to a variety of news and opinion from different sources found in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other way Google uses news items is by including articles in Web searches for older subjects like Hurricane Katrina or the death of Michael Jackson.  In a Bing partnership with News Corp. world Google would just display non-News Corp. sources discussing the same stories. Who loses there? Not the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could waste a lot of money and effort on buying up exclusivity deals with News Corp and The Financial Times' other unnamed major Web publishers. Meanwhile, Google can just sit back and watch Microsoft pay big bucks to give Bing users exclusive access to news content that will only remain exclusive until a non-News Corp site summarizes the story or does their own reporting on the same subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News is already going to the birds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although popular, Google and Bing are not the only sources of news content. Many people can, and do, find interesting content from their networks on Twitter, Facebook and FriendFeed.  This trend of link sharing will only continue, which could make the need for a Google News or Bing News less important over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exclusivity Cripples the Web&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most serious implication of a possible deal between Bing and News Corp.  Imagine if an agreement like this starts a trend among major content producers?  The end result would be a mess for users like you and me.  Looking for information about News Corp content like Fox television and movies? You'll only find it on Bing. Universal movie trailers? AOL. Baseball scores? Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who wants a future like that? You'd need a roadmap just to remember which content was available on which search engine.  Two solutions would inevitably crop up in this scenario: the search engines would start indexing each other (something they already do), which would mean Google users would resort to searches like 'The Wall Street Journal site:Bing.com.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, we'd see the so-called metasearch engines like Dogpile or Gajeebo become more popular. These engines don't actually do any searching on their own, but evaluate and rank search results from several engines like Ask, Bing, Google and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, in an intensely fractured Web search world, Google and Bing may have no choice but to cut metasearch deals with each other, which would make exclusive indexing even more pointless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep the Web Open&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact is, the Web wants and needs to be an open platform where any search engine can find any publicly available content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By engaging in a news content spending spree, Microsoft would only end up throwing money at a limited advantage that could be invested in more important things like core search technology and a comprehensive end user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft might think it would be making a wise move to pay for exclusive search content, but trying to buy the Web out from under Google and other search engines is, to my mind, a fool's errand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/182849&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Dell Falls Short of Expectations

Dell Inc. (Nasdaq: DELL) reported third quarter 2010 EPS of 23 cents, below the
Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. 

Revenue for the quarter was $10.75 billion, down 17.0% from $12.97 billion
reported in the year-ago quarter and up 1.0% from $10.62 billion reported in the
previous quarter. The company`s third quarter reported revenue was adversely
affected by the timing of the Windows 7 launch and due to backlog buildup in the
company`s SMB and consumer businesses. 

Large Enterprise posted revenue of $3.4 billion, an increase of 4.0%
sequentially and decline of 23.0% year-over-year. In the last quarter, the
company expended its networking partnership with Brocade and Juniper, and
introduced products like PowerEdge 11g servers and expanded PowerVault storage
systems. 

Publicrevenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 3.0% on sequentially and
7.0% from the year-ago quarter. Shipments were down 12.0% on a sequential basis,
due to seasonality in the U.S. public sector business. 

Small and Medium Business revenue for the quarter was $3.0 billion, up 5.0%
sequentially and down 19.0% from the year-ago quarter. Shipments increased 9%
sequentially. The segment benefited from steadily improving demand in both the
Americas and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as better performance in EMEA
during the second half. 

Revenues for Consumer Business were down 10.0% year-over-year, but flat
sequentially to $2.8 billion with shipments growing 4% sequentially. 

Dell`s total sales in China, India, Brazil and Russia increased 18.0%
sequentially and 5.0% over last year. China, the second-largest revenue
generating country for Dell, reported revenue increase of 20.0% sequentially and
8.0% from the year-ago quarter. 

Buffett Borrows for Rail Acquisition

Warren Buffett, the CEO and Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)
announced on Thursday to borrow $8 billion of loan for the acquisition of
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (NYSE: BNI). Berkshire Hathaway, which
already owns a 22% stake in Burlington Northern, announced earlier this month it
would acquire the rest for a total value of $34 billion. Buffet agreed to pay
$100 a share in cash and stock to buy the rest of the company. 

The $8 billion loan that will be provided by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and
Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) is intended to be paid back in three years` time. 

For Berkshire, the acquisition of Burlington Northern, or BNSF, the second
largest railroad, will be its biggest to date. With it, Berkshire is adding a
railroad transportation business with its already diverse range of businesses
including retail, manufacturing and insurance, as well as several regional
electric and gas utilities. 

The acquisition is expected to close in early 2010 and is subject to Burlington
Northern`s shareholder approval. Post acquisition, Burlington Northern will
operate from its headquarters as a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire
Hathaway.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with bond sale, spread, SP, updates quotes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Nov 23 (Reuters) - Mexican media conglomerate
Grupo Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N) sold a 30-year, $600 million
bond on Monday, IFR, a Thomson Reuters service, reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IFR said Credit Suisse was the sole bookrunner of the bond,
which carried 245 basis points over U.S. Treasuries. Televisa
last borrowed from international debt markets in May 2008, when
it issued a $500 million 10-year bond, IFR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch Ratings assigned a BBB-plus rating to Televisa's
proposed bond due in 2040. Proceeds will be used by the
broadcaster for liability management and general corporate
uses, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch's comments on Televisa came shortly after the ratings
agency cut Mexico's sovereign credit ratings by one notch to
BBB from BBB-plus, saying the government's recently approved
tax increases were not enough to address the fiscal

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has had talks with News Corp about a tie up, which would involve News Corp getting paid to take its news websites off Google Inc, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News Corp, which owns such papers as the Wall Street Journal and the Sun, started the discussions, which were at an early stage, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News Corp Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch has said he wants to make people pay for access to his news websites. Other publishers including The New York Times are also searching for ways to charge for news online, convinced that they must not give news through search engines such as Google and Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also talked with other online publishers about removing their sites from Google, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is all about Microsoft hurting Google's margins," the FT quoted a website publisher, who had been approached by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which relaunched its search engine as Bing this year, has been looking for ways to challenge market leader Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, it signed a 10-year global web search partnership with Yahoo, a deal that U.S. and European antitrust regulators are evaluating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could not reached for comment late on Sunday. News Corp declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Microsoft Research India have developed a compression and redundancy elimination technology that can operate as a host service in enterprise systems without the use of accelerator devices over a WAN. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is called Coconet for Content Compression in Networks. The researchers monitored access links at 11 corporate enterprise locations for several days, as well as the access link of the University of Wisconsin, which had some of its students collaborate on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft researchers estimated that about 75 percent of the bandwidth saved using redundancy elimination devices on a WAN comes from removing redundant byte-strings from within each client's traffic, Ramachandran Ramjee, project leader of Coconet, said in a telephone interview on Monday.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of redundancy, described by the Microsoft researchers as intra-user redundancy, consists, for example, of the same user getting different versions of the same files from a server, or going to the same Web sites repeatedly to get an update, Ramjee said. This pattern presented the opportunity to move the redundancy elimination function to software running on end hosts on the network, reducing the need for deployment of expensive accelerator devices, or other redundancy elimination "middle-boxes" on the WAN, according to Ramjee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many large companies, having branch offices across the world, are consolidating their IT resources in a few locations to save on administrative costs, Ramjee said. "Instead of putting servers in each branch office they are consolidating in a few data centers in a few locations," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A result of this move is that what used to be traffic on the LAN from a user's PC to a server in the branch office has now become relatively expensive WAN traffic, according to Ramjee. The move for consolidation has increased demand for products like WAN accelerator devices, which among other things also reduce redundancy in network traffic, he added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software developed by Microsoft Research India has been designed to be asymmetric so that the processing is done at the server, Ramjee said. It does not conflict with encryption on the network, because the removal of a redundancy at the server end is done before encryption, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software runs on general purpose servers and requires a typical cache size of about 10MB on the server for each client, and another 10MB at the client end. This ensures that the technology can also be used when the client is a resource-constrained device like a smartphone, Ramjee said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The host service can identify and suppress redundancy as small as 32 bytes in the packets, according to Ramjee. If any bytes are found to match between a data request and previous data transmitted, the server indicates that the data is already on the client and redirects to it, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology developed by Microsoft Research India does not, however, address "inter-user" redundancy which arises when many users request the same data. Besides WAN accelerator boxes there are other technologies that handle that, including the BranchCache feature in Windows 7, Ramjee said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramjee also claimed lower latency for the Microsoft Research technology, as it can work around the limitation that TCP breaks down packets before sending them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MONTERREY, Mexico--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to Grupo Televisa, S.A.B's (Televisa)
proposed US$400 million senior unsecured notes due 2040. Proceeds from the
proposed issuance will be used by the company for liability management and
general corporate uses. 

Fitch currently rates Televisa as follows:
-- Local currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB+';
-- Foreign currency IDR 'BBB+';
-- National scale long-term rating 'AAA(mex)'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

Televisa's ratings reflect its strong business profile across operating
segments, solid cash flow generation, extended maturity profile and ample
liquidity. Televisa's business and credit profile remains strong as the major TV
broadcaster in Mexico and the largest Spanish speaking content producer
worldwide. Additionally, Televisa holds majority stakes in the largest pay TV
providers in Mexico through DTH operator Innova (Sky) and cable operators
Cablevision (Mexico City) and Cablemas (more than 49 cities in the country), in
addition to its 50% ownership in TVI, which operates in Monterrey. 

Televisa's cash flow generation remains strong despite the global economic
conditions, supported by its leading market positions in all of its business
divisions. In the Television Broadcasting segment Televisa has maintained
audience shares over 70% and EBITDA margin for the latest 12 months (LTM) ended
in Sept. 30, 2009 of 49%, similar to those registered in 2008 and 2007. The
company's management continues to maintain a strict cost and expense control in
order to support profitability. Consolidated EBITDA margin for the LTM at
September 2009 was 39.5%, similar to 40.5% at year-end 2008, but down from 42.6%
in 2007. 

Televisa's media business diversification strengthens its credit profile. For
the LTM ended at September 2009, Television Broadcasting represented 41% of
total sales, compared to 44% in 2008 and 50% in 2007; the DTH and cable/telecomm
segments represented 35.1% of total revenue compared to 32.2% and 25.8% in 2008
and 2007, respectively. Televisa's growth strategy will continue to be focused
on the Mexican telecommunications industry and on maintaining and expanding its
programming and content exports abroad, especially with Univision in the U.S. 

Televisa's credit measures remain strong. For the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2009,
EBITDA to net interest was 9.3 times (x) compared to 12.8x at year-end 2008, and
net debt to EBITDA, including satellite leases, for the same period was 0.2x,
from -0.1x at year-end 2008. As of September 2009, Televisa had cash balances of
approximately the equivalent of US$2.5 billion and total debt, including
satellite leases, of approximately the equivalent of US$2.8 billion. Debt
maturities are manageable for Televisa with approximately US$149.3 million
coming due in 2009-2011. In Fitch's view, the company's strong cash flow
generation in addition to its large cash balances will allow it to finance capex
and fund shareholders' distributions, keeping a conservative liquidity position.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Owners Research Group today announced the conclusion of a first-of-its-kind
survey of major shareholders of six premier U.S. banking institutions. 

The institutional shareholders of Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs,
JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo provided feedback to directors
on a range of issues, including corporate governance, executive compensation,
capital structure, and strategy. Participants responded to 30 questions,
providing direct company assessments, detailed commentary, and comparative
rankings. 

"We are pleased to announce that some of the largest and most highly-respected
asset managers have engaged with us in this process," said Eli Danziger, ORG
Co-founder and Managing Director. "Our goal is to facilitate better
communications and understanding among shareholders, directors, and executives,
and this survey takes an important step in that direction. We have uncovered
shared perspectives and detailed recommendations for these specific companies
and for the financial services industry." 

The aggregated and anonymous shareholder sentiments offer unique insights.
Roughly half of the respondents felt that the industry`s directors should be
doing more to govern these companies. The comments provided are constructive and
specific on how the boards can be more effective at safeguarding these assets
for the future. Over three quarters of participants also felt that the industry
is generally headed in the right direction. While there was a significant range
among the banks` scores, the feedback for directors and executives is both
pragmatic and valuable. 

Individual directors have received a summary report of their company`s results,
and ORG will be contacting these boards to walk through the detailed results and
shareholder comments. 

Directors can contact ORG at (212) 201-6619 or via email at
info@ownersresearchgroup.com for more information or for copies of the results.

&lt;p&gt;  HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA, Nov 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Immunovaccine Inc. (TSX VENTURE: IMV), a vaccine development company,
today announced the signing of an exclusive, worldwide license agreement
with Pfizer Animal Health for Immunovaccine's patented vaccine delivery
technology. Pfizer Animal Health said it plans to develop enhanced cattle
vaccines incorporating Immunovaccine's technology. Under the terms of the
agreement, which were not disclosed, Immunovaccine will receive upfront
signing fees in addition to subsequent milestone payments and royalties
on any Immunovaccine-delivered vaccines developed by Pfizer Animal Health.

    "Pfizer Animal Health is known around the world for its treatment and
prevention of disease in cattle, and we are pleased to secure a further
licensing agreement designed to advance their development of promising
vaccines for veterinarians and producers," said Dr. Randal Chase,
president and CEO of Immunovaccine. "This is further validation of the
commercial potential of our technology."

    "We see global demand growing among beef and dairy producers for new
vaccines that can be safely and easily administered," said Juan Ramon
Alaix, president, Pfizer Animal Health. "Pfizer looks forward to
developing cattle vaccines incorporating Immunovaccine technology that
will contribute to meeting this demand," Alaix said. Pfizer Animal Health
is currently also licensing other Immunovaccine technology for the
development of particular livestock vaccines.

    Compared to conventional vaccines, the strength of Immunovaccine's
platform lies in its ability to reduce the number of required doses and
to significantly enhance antibody onset and duration. The power and
versatility of Immunovaccine's technology to combine with a variety of
antigens and to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses make it
the vaccine delivery system of choice for Immunovaccine's current and
potential biotechnology partners.

discovering and developing innovative animal prescription medicines and
vaccines, investing an estimated $300 million annually. For more

&lt;p&gt;Nov 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Nasdaq OMX Group
(NDAQ.O) to "buy" from "neutral," citing "underappreciated"
growth prospects. The brokerage said it sees the Nasdaq Stock
Market parent company getting revenue of about $10 million a
quarter from its new N2EX British wholesale power exchange,
which the company runs along with Nord Pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman also said the company's independent subsidiary
International Derivatives Clearing Group, while facing
competition from a "well-entrenched" LCH.Clearnet, CME and the
New York Stock Exchange, could add between $1 million to $2
million in revenue per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts at Goldman said the pressure from declining market
share is largely abating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even if share does move away from the exchange, each 1
percent decline in market share in U.S. equities amounts to
only about $0.015 cents in annual earnings," the brokerage said
in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman added that it sees the ebb and flow of U.S.
equities as less of a factor on Nasdaq's valuation, given the
company's increased revenue diversification, geographically and
across products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With many investors focused on the United States, the
opportunities in Europe and through a potential joint venture
with Brazil's BMF Bovespa (BVMF3.SA) highlight our more
optimistic view, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For all the alerts, please double click [ID:nWNAB8822]

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
With the national unemployment rate now above 10 percent, Wachovia, a unit of
Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE: WFC), announced it will donate $1 to Toys for Tots
for every Visa gift card it sells through December 31, 2009 - up to $250,000.
Proceeds will provide toys to children who might otherwise not receive them this
holiday season. 

Wachovia customers can purchase the Visa gift cards in whole dollar amounts from
$25 to $600 at Wachovia retail bank locations or online at
Wachovia.com/giftcard. The cards can be used wherever Visa debit cards are
accepted. There is a one-time charge of $3.95. 

"As the economy continues to suffer, more children than ever will likely face
Christmas morning without a toy," said Bill Grein, vice president of marketing
for the Marine Toys for Tots Foundation. "As a result, Toys for Tots is
expecting an unprecedented increase in requests for toys, as more families must
choose between putting food on the table or a gift under the tree. We are
thankful to Wachovia for helping us reach these families in their time of need."


Gift cards also can be enrolled in Visa Online Discounts, allowing cardholders
to enjoy additional savings with select merchants. 

"Now more than ever, it`s essential for our communities to band together and
help Toys for Tots deliver the magic of the holidays to every child who might
otherwise wake up to an empty tree on Christmas morning," said Lionel Means,
vice president of Wachovia Prepaid Product. "We`re proud to offer our customers
a great product while giving back to Toys for Tots, an organization that puts a
smile on the faces of children who are facing tough times." 

For 62 years, the mission of Toys for Tots has been to make a positive impact on
the lives of our most precious resource - our children. Through the gift of a
shiny new toy during the holidays, Toys for Tots sends a message to economically
disadvantaged children that someone cares, that they have not been forgotten and
that the magic of the holiday season has not passed them by. Each gift instills
a sense of pride, provides positive recognition and makes a positive impact on
the life of a child for years to come. Additional information can be found
online at www.toysfortots.org .

&lt;p&gt;New F5 Application Ready Solutions Offer High Performance, Availability, and
Scalability for Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 to Support an
Increasingly Mobile Workforce
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV), the global leader in Application Delivery
Networking (ADN), today announced the release of new Application Ready Solutions
for Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. These F5 solutions provide
support for Microsoft`s recently released DirectAccess and BranchCache
technologies, which are new features of the Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2
operating systems. 

Along with the release of Exchange 2010 and Forefront Protection 2010 for
Exchange Server, this announcement is the latest in a series of solution updates
from F5 Networks aimed at improving scalability and performance of
business-critical applications from Microsoft. F5 Application Ready Solutions
help to increase the capacity of Windows servers by offloading CPU-intensive
operations, and ensure that F5 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) are
optimized for Microsoft environments. 

Details

* F5 Application Ready Solution Support for Microsoft DirectAccess

Microsoft DirectAccess provides easier remote access to corporate resources with
comprehensive management capabilities and integrated security enforcement, which
allows IT departments to manage remote access at a lower cost. The F5 solution
for DirectAccess enables enterprise customers to scale their deployments and
enjoy the same benefits of other ADC-optimized applications. BIG-IP Local
Traffic Manager can proxy DirectAccess connections to ensure that users have
quick access to the best-performing server resources, improving the performance
and scalability of DirectAccess across multiple servers. 

In addition, F5`s customizable iRules commands enable IT organizations to ensure
that specific client requests will be routed through the appropriate
DirectAccess server. The specific iRule enabling this functionality is freely
available in a recent DirectAccess-focused post on F5`s user community site,
DevCentralSM. The post includes a description of how the iRule is used, what it
does, and how to configure it. With iRules, IT organizations retain DirectAccess
functionality in large deployments with multiple DirectAccess servers without
compromising functionality or security.

* F5 Application Ready Solution Support for Microsoft BranchCache

Branch office users are traditionally challenged by low bandwidth connections to
the files and web content they need to accomplish their daily tasks. Low
bandwidth results in long file download times and lost productivity. As a part
of the Application Ready Solution for Windows Server 2008 R2, F5`s support for
BranchCache increases server capacity by offloading intensive computations used
to alias web content requests from Windows 7 clients at branch locations. 

This solution also functions as a transition technology to bring the benefits of
BranchCache to all Windows 7 client users where web servers have not yet been
upgraded to Windows Server 2008 R2. For servers not yet running Windows 2008 R2,
the F5 solution provides the infrastructure visibility and intelligence
necessary for those servers to participate in a BranchCache solution where
Windows 7 clients are deployed, significantly reducing bandwidth consumption. 

Supporting Quotes

"Microsoft`s DirectAccess and BranchCache technologies highlight the business
value of Windows 7 client and Windows Server 2008 R2 working together to provide
new, transformational features that increase user productivity," said Mike
Schutz, Director, Windows Server Marketing at Microsoft. "Mobile workers will
realize tremendous productivity increases through anytime access, and businesses
will lower their cost of delivering this access in a secure, manageable way
using DirectAccess and BranchCache. F5`s Application Ready Solutions amplify
this value for end-users and corporate IT departments by providing tested,
validated solutions to streamline application deployments." 

"Application delivery and optimization for remote users is becoming a more
common concern for IT departments," said Calvin Rowland, VP of Application
Partner Programs at F5. "In order to ensure the productivity and connection of
these employees, companies need to deploy applications and technologies to
enable remote access just as they enable onsite access. F5 has worked closely
with Microsoft to increase our solution base for Windows 7 and Windows Server
2008 R2. F5 Application Ready Solutions provide customers with increased worker
productivity, greater ROI for IT departments, increased confidence of solution
interoperability, and enhanced scalability for faster, easier technology
deployments."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has discussed paying News Corp. to remove its news Web sites from Google's search results and list them on its Bing search engine instead, The Financial Times reported Sunday on its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also approached other major online publishers about removing their sites from Google, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News Corp. initiated the discussions with Microsoft, the report said, citing an unnamed person close to the talks. The person said discussions are in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report comes two weeks after News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch told Sky News Australia that he planned to block popular search engines including Google and Bing from listing content from his company's news Web sites in order to get readers to pay for online content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times report cites one unnamed Web site publisher that was also approached by Microsoft as saying the plan to pay for delisting from Google could place enormous value on content if they are paid for exclusive indexing. Murdoch has called for an end to search engine listings for his company's news content because search engines make money from his content through their advertising, while he does not get paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal between Microsoft and news Web sites could put Bing in a much better position to compete against Google, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Nov 23 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) said on
Monday that it has appointed Zili Shao, a managing partner at law
firm Linklaters' Asia, to be chairman and chief executive of its
China business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank said it had also appointed Fang Fang, chief
executive of J.P. Investment Banking China, as vice-chairman of
its Asia Investment Banking operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move comes as Western banks seek to bolster their China
operations as Chinese companies increasingly focus on regional
and global expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fang would lead the firm's investment banking strategy and
business development efforts involving China and all markets
across Asia including Japan, Australia and India, the bank said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan said Shao's role as CEO would strengthen the
firm's senior China management and help develop additional
financial products and services for corporate and investor

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York Times editorial slammed Goldman Sachs for its role in the financial crisis and said that instead of paying big bonuses to its employees it should make a multibillion-dollar gift to help reduce the U.S. national debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The editorial, dated November 21 on the Times' website and published in the Sunday, November 22, print edition, attacked Goldman for everything from its top executive's failure to apologize properly for his investment bank's part in creating the crisis as well as Goldman's awarding of bonuses related to profits that the paper said were boosted by a government bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times sniffed at Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein's acknowledgment last week that his bank "participated in things that were clearly wrong," saying that he was not specific about what the company had done wrong and his remarks did not "come close to an apology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It cited the company's ability to set aside $16.7 billion for bonuses this year as it was able to post "blowout profits" after receiving a $10 billion government bailout and $12.9 billion in payments and collateral in relation to the government bailout of American International Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper described Goldman's pledge earlier this week of $500 million over five years to help small businesses as "crumbs from its table," saying it should do much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The money will be welcomed by recipients, but if Goldman wants to make a meaningful contribution, it would have to be in the billions and aimed more directly at taxpayers," the Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It noted, for example, that the federal Bureau of the Public Debt accepts tax-deductible donations to reduce the national debt and urged Goldman to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper said that a multibillion-dollar donation from Goldman could be made in such a way that it does not harm shareholders, noting that the related tax savings could help finance the company's small-business initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A contribution could also help Goldman ward off "serious calls for a windfall tax on bonuses, which would be justified since the profits they are based on are in a large part the result of government efforts," the editorial said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another story published in the Times on Saturday, Gretchen Morgenson quotes Janet Tavakoli, an expert in derivatives at consulting firm Tavakoli Structured Finance, who urged Goldman to repay money from the AIG bailout, saying Goldman should be forced to take back toxic collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, which had been insured with AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The prices of the collateralized debt obligations against which Goldman bought protection from AIG were in sickening freefall, and the cost of replacing AIG's protection would have been sky-high," she said. "Goldman must have known this, because it underwrote some of those value-destroying CDOs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman should do this before it gives bonuses to "taxpayer-protected employees," Tavakoli said in the Times report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the time of year to be thankful for the good things in your life: family, friends, health, a job, a smartphone, a virus-free computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should the software soldiers in Redmond be thankful for? Well, Microsoft has certainly had a topsy-turvy year. But despite layoffs, dismal revenue reports and great difficulty getting anyone to take Windows Mobile seriously, the software giant has much to be thankful for as we head into Turkey Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system -- including hands-on reviews, video tutorials and advice on enterprise rollouts -- see CIO.com's Windows 7 Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few reasons why Microsoft should stay resilient against its many rivals through the holidays and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 Is Not Vista&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a safe bet that Windows 7 will not end up like its embattled predecessor, Vista. The new version of Windows, launched on Oct. 22 in a modest fashion compared to Vista's garish debut three years ago, has received mostly positive reviews, its early sales exceed those of XP and Vista in a comparable time frame, and its market share for last weekend passed 5 percent, according to Web metrics company Net Applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Windows 7 in Pictures: The Coolest New Hardware&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 still faces roadblocks. Those clever Apple TV ads will continue to taint perceptions of the Windows brand, but Windows 7's true enemy is the economy. The upcoming holiday season is ripe for new PC purchases, but the sour economy could prevent buyers from opening their wallets. Also, on the consumer side, if fairly new PCs running Vista ain't broke why fix 'em? And then you have cash-strapped businesses content to run the competent Windows XP into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Windows 7 has silenced the Vista stigma -- an important accomplishment. Also, its frequently-aired TV ads are lively and engaging, and with Gartner forecasting that PC sales will actually make modest gains this year, Windows 7, now running on everything from netbooks to all-in-one touchscreen PCs, is in an ideal position for when consumers and businesses start spending again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Still Owns the Enterprise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to deny the lure of cheap, Web-based productivity suites such as Google Apps, OpenOffice and offerings from Zoho and IBM. But the fact remains that enterprises still choose Microsoft Office desktop tools more frequently than any other suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent survey of 2,000 IT decision-makers by research firm Forrester shows that 80 percent of companies surveyed support some version of Microsoft Office, and 78 percent have no plans for implementing an alternative to Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reasons for Office satisfaction are that businesses are comfortable with it and Office is compatible with Microsoft's ubiquitous Sharepoint enterprise collaboration software, as well as other business applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Office 2010: Three Helpful New Collaboration Features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Office 2010: a Simple FAQ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Web-based e-mail and productivity tools, though much less expensive than Office, require that IT managers retrain workers who are old hat with Microsoft Office. Also, storing company data on someone else's servers in a cloud environment remains a sticking point with many businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with cloud computing becoming more prevalent, enterprises won't resist Web-based apps forever. Microsoft knows this, and will include Web versions of Office 2010 apps when the software launches in the first half of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing Is Holding Its Own&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bing, Microsoft's "decision engine," launched back in June, nobody knew what to expect. Could Bing actually compete with Google search?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, Bing has not revolutionized the search engine world, but it has been surprisingly successful. Putting photos of exotic locations on its main page brought visual flair to search, and its categorized search results, hover preview feature and enhanced video search provided streamlined results in a way that made Google look both disorganized and boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing vs. Google: The Feature War Begins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: 10 Cool Things You Didn't Know About Google&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing's U.S. market share has increased to 9.9 percent, which is almost two percentage points higher than when it launched, according to October data from online market tracker comScore. Yet Bing has hardly taken any share from Google's comfortable 65.4 percent. Bing's share gains have come at the expense of Yahoo, not Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft is committed to Bing growth, dedicating close to $100 million for marketing and advertising. Also, this month Microsoft unveiled new features in Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest updates include Facebook previews, full-page weather reports, expanded hover preview showing a snapshot of the Web site you want to go to, and the integration of Wolfram Alpha, a computational technology that returns deeper search queries such as a person's body mass index or how many grams of sugar are in a banana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's next for Bing? You can expect Bing and Google to try to one-up each other with new search features in the coming months, and Bing will experience a market share jump as it gets rolled into Yahoo when the Microsoft-Yahoo search deal is finalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;As the holiday season approaches, IBM this quarter began its own Black Friday promotion by offering incentives it hopes will convince users to lease its hardware or buy used IBM equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked, Tom Higgins, director of IBM Global Financing, was hard pressed to provide any argument against leasing. IBM, like most other major IT vendors, operates its own financing arm and recommends that leasing is especially attractive for customers that have concerns about their budgets, about upgrade processes and about ultimate equipment disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts have said they expect that leasing will increasingly become the preferred path for many large users of IT equipment, especially as the economy continues to stagnate and large companies look to preserve capital. And in most cases, analysts say, IT vendors have the backing to extend credit, giving them a leg up over many other financing options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to spreading out the cost of equipment, leasing may enable companies to speed upgrades, analysts said. For example, leasing could help a company more easily shift from a five-year to a three-year IT equipment replacement schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study of performance and energy use of IBM blade servers, Cal Braunstein, an analyst with the Robert Frances Group Inc., in Westport, Conn., found that over a three-year period a user could replace 1,000 blades with 250 blades due to constant performance improvements. The cost of leasing the upgraded systems would be less than a company would have spent to power that equipment if it owned it, according to Braunstein's research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Pucciarelli, an analyst at IDC, said the poor economy will probably continue to limit capital available to large firms, so he expects an increase in their leasing of IT equipment. He said the benefits of leasing versus buying may be further justified by allowing IT operations to more easily upgrade to more powerful systems rather than have to build out floor space to house more older equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pucciarelli did note that companies that turn to leasing must have a good lifecycle management process in place so it can effectively utilize the new equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM promotion offers a 90-day payment deferral on leased hardware, software and services, as well as zero percent financing on software products. IBM also said it is offering its pre-owned equipment "at attractive prices" during the promotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the company said that during 2009 it has been passing savings from accelerated depreciation tax benefits to customers even though its global financing arm holds title to the equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest quarter, IBM Global Financing revenue fell by 15% to $536 million. By comparison, rival Hewlett-Packard's financial services unit reported revenue of $726 million in the quarter, up 5% from the prior-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft launched the beta of Office Home and Business 2010 over the weekend and is delivering the preview using its new "streaming" download technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beta was the second that Microsoft made available to the general public, and followed the enterprise-grade Office Professional Plus 2010 test edition that it unveiled last week .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move came just three days after it sent invitations to a small group of people asking them to test Home and Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preview gives the general public a chance to try one of the three editions Microsoft will sell at retail, and includes Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Microsoft has not yet set prices for Office 2010, or slated a ship date more specific than sometime during the first half of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home and Business is the first beta of Office 2010 that Microsoft is delivering via its Click-To-Run system, which "streams" pieces of the suite as users begin a download, letting them start working with the suite in minutes. While users work with the trial, the remainder of the code is downloaded in the background. The technology also places Home and Business in a virtualized environment, separating it from the rest of Windows by running its applications from a virtual "Q:" drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Click-To-Run lets users run the beta on a PC without disturbing existing installations of Office -- with the exception of Outlook, since only one copy of the e-mail client can run on a given machine -- it also presents some problems, Microsoft has acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a Nov. 6 entry on the Office engineering team's blog, users may find that some Office add-ons won't work when running software delivered by Click-To-Run. "In some cases, add-ins might have trouble locating the Click-to-Run Office products on the machine, or they might have issues communicating with Office products when they are running in the virtual environment," the team admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click-To-Run products like Home and Office also ditch Microsoft's usual patching process, and instead update automatically and without any user approval. "Click-to-Run users also get updated automatically over time, with no need to download or install patches," added the Office team in its blog post. "The product seamlessly updates itself in the background."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home and Business can be downloaded in English, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian and Spanish editions from Microsoft's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Nov 24 (Reuters) - Valero's (VLO.N) decision to
mothball its Delaware City, Delaware, refinery will strip the
company of its status as the largest U.S. refiner and elevate
Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) to the top spot, according to U.S. Energy
Information Administration capacity statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On Friday, Valero announced plans to permanently shutter
the plant, citing weak economic conditions that have left
refiners struggling with paltry margins amid sluggish demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shaving Delaware City's crude throughput of 182,200 barrels
per day (bpd) cuts Valero's combined capacity to 1.82 million
bpd from 2 million, and the plant portfolio will be down one to
15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, with six U.S. plants including the nation's largest
in Baytown, Texas, has overall capacity of 1.87 million bpd.
Counting Exxon's half-interest with Venezuelan national oil
company PDVSA in a Louisiana refinery, Exxon's crude capacity
is 1.96 million barrels a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst with Oppenheimer  Co, shrugged
at Valero's No. 2 status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It doesn't really matter," Gheit said. "Twenty years ago
Chevron was the largest refiner before Valero got so big."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valero spokesman Bill Day said Valero "is concentrating on
being the safest, most reliable and most efficient, not the
biggest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, Sunoco SUN.N closed its 145,000 bpd Eagle
Point plant in New Jersey and sold an 85,000 bpd refinery in
Tulsa, Oklahoma, which shaved its overall U.S. capacity to
673,000 bpd from three refineries. Sunoco remains the second
largest independent U.S. refiner and No. 7 overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The closures, along with Flying J's shuttering of its
66,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Bakersfield, California, in
January, cuts overall U.S. refining capacity by 2.25 percent to
17.3 million barrels a day.

Sands China Raises $2.5B in IPO

Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) Macau unit, Sand China raised $2.5 billion through
its Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO). The company has priced the IPO for
1.87 billion shares at HK$10.38 per share, the low end of the expected
HK$10.38-HK$13.88 range. 

The proceeds from this offering, combined with $1.75 billion in bank financing,
would aid Sands China to restart its Macau's Cotai Strip construction projects.
Last year, the company was forced to halt its casino expansion projects in Macau
due to financial constraints, at which time it laid off 11,000 workers. 

The IPO is being handled by five investment banks. Citigroup (NYSE: C) and
Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) are the joint global coordinators for the offer while
Barclays PLC (NYSE: BCS), BNP Paribas SA and UBS AG (NYSE: UBS) are the
underwriters.

FILED UNDER: </body></entry><entry author="None" date="2009-11-24T18:04:00+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS172406+24-Nov-2009+BW20091124"><headline>Fitch Downgrades 7 Classes from JPMCC 2005-CIBC12; Assigns Outlooks and LS Ratings</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has taken various rating actions on J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corp., Series 2005-CIBC12, commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press
release. 

The downgrades are the result of Fitch's loss expectations and its prospective
views regarding cash flow declines and commercial real estate market values.
Fitch forecasts potential losses of 5.2% for this transaction, should market
conditions not recover. Today's rating actions are based on the full losses of
5.2% as a majority of loans mature in the next five years. The bonds with
Negative Outlooks indicate classes that may be downgraded in the future. 

To determine potential defaults for each loan, Fitch assumed cash flow would
decline by 10% from year-end 2008. That is consistent with the analysis used in
its review of recent vintage transactions whereby cash flow was assumed to
decline 15% from year-end 2007 projected over a three-year period. If the
stressed cash flow would cause the loan to fall below 0.95 times (x) debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR), Fitch assumed the loan would default during the
term. To determine losses, Fitch used the above stressed cash flow and applied a
market cap rate by property type, ranging between 7.5% and 10%, to derive a
value. If the loan balance at default is less than Fitch's derived value, the
loan would realize that amount of loss. These loss estimates were reviewed in
more detail for loans representing 49.6% of the pool and, in certain cases,
revised based on additional information and/or property characteristics. 

Approximately 89% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as follows:
8.3% in 2010, 9.3% in 2011 and 7.8% in 2012, 4.7% in 2013, 1.2% in 2014 and
57.7% in 2015. 

Fitch identified 48 Loans of Concern (19.5%) within the pool, 13 of which (5.5%)
are specially serviced. One of the Fitch Loans of Concern (2.1%) is within the
transaction's top 15 loans. 

Fitch expects that 14 of the top 15 loans may default at maturity based on an
insufficient accrued equity position as calculated in Fitch's refinance test.
While defaults are expected, additional losses are not anticipated based on
derived values being higher than the current loan amounts. A loan would pass the
refinance test if the stressed cash flow would achieve a 1.25x DSCR as
calculated based on a 30-year amortization schedule and an 8% coupon. One loan
within the top 15 is expected to incur a loss at maturity, Fort Steuben Mall. 

The largest contributors to loss are as follows: Fort Steuben Mall (2.1%),
Phillips Ranch Industrial Center (0.9%), International Plaza (0.7%), and LXP -
The Dial Corporation (0.7%). 

The Fort Steuben Mall loan is secured by 685,585 square feet (sf) of an 813,165
sf regional mall in Steubenville, OH, approximately 35 miles west of Pittsburgh,
PA. Major tenants at the center include Wal-Mart (30.6% of net rentable area
[NRA]), Sears (17.7%), J.C. Penney (8.1%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (7.5%). The
mall has experienced a steady decline in performance over the last two years,
mainly due to an increase in vacancy and the negative effects the weak economy
has had on the subject's local market. The DSCR and occupancy as of first
quarter 2009 were 1.02x and 86%, compared with 1.16x and 90% at year-end 2008
and 1.39x and 86% at issuance. Fitch expects the loan will default at maturity,
and losses are likely. 

The largest specially serviced loan (0.9%) is a 124,894 square foot (sf) retail
property in Pomona, CA. The loan transferred to special servicing in March 2009
after a significant increase in vacancy limited the borrower's ability to pay
the debt service obligations. The property remains 35% occupied and based on an
updated appraisal, losses are expected. 

The second largest specially serviced loan (0.7%) is a 34,938 sf retail property
in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The asset has been real estate owned (REO) since
August 2008. The property has suffered from a deteriorating retail environment
stemming from reduced vacation travel. The most recent appraisal value indicates
losses upon disposition. 

The third largest specially serviced loan (0.7%) is secured by a 129,689 sf
office building located in Scottsdale, AZ. The loan transferred to special
servicing in November 2008 when its sole tenant notified the borrower that it
intended to vacate at the end of its lease in December 2008. The property is
currently 100% vacant. The property is in foreclosure. Updated appraisal
valuation indicates losses are likely. 

Fitch has downgraded, removed from Rating Watch Negative, and assigned Loss
Severity (LS) Ratings and Outlooks to the following classes: 

--$162.5 million Class A-J to 'AA/LS5' from 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$43.3 million Class B to 'BBB/LS5' from 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$19 million Class C to 'BBB-/LS5' from 'A'; Outlook Stable;

--$24.4 million Class F to 'B/LS5' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$24.4 million Class G to 'B-/LS5' from 'BB'; Outlook Negative. 

In addition, Fitch affirms and removes the following class from Rating Watch
Negative, and assigns an LS Rating and Outlook: 

--$29.8 million Class H at 'B-/LS5'; Outlook Negative. 

In addition, Fitch affirms the following non-pooled class and revises the
Outlook as indicated: 

--$50 million Class UHP at 'B-/LS5'; Outlook to Negative from Stable. 

Fitch also affirms the following classes and assigns LS ratings, Outlooks and
Recovery Ratings (RRs) as indicated: 

--$131.4 million Class A-2 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$163.6 million Class A-3A1 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$122.9 million Class A-3A2 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$200 million Class A-3B at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$649.3 million Class A-4 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$137.4 million Class A-SB at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$216.7 million Class A-M at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only Class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only Class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$8.1 million Class J at 'CC/RR3'; 

--$8.1 million Class K at 'C/RR6';

--$5.4 million Class M at 'C/RR6'; 

--$8.1 million Class N at 'C/RR6'; 

--$5.4 million Class P at 'C/RR6'. 

Fitch does not rate the $26.8 million NR class. Class A-1 has paid in full.

</body></entry><entry author="None" date="2009-11-24T15:05:00+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS141572+24-Nov-2009+BW20091124"><headline>Fitch Affirms Microsoft at 'AA+/F1+'; Outlook Stable</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings of Microsoft Corporation
(Microsoft): 

--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+'; 

--Senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF) at 'AA+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt at 'AA+'; 

--Short-term IDR of 'F1+'; 

--$2.25 billion commercial paper (CP) program at 'F1+' 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

The ratings and Stable Outlook are supported by Microsoft's: i) leading market
position in its core software businesses, including over 90% in PC operating
systems (OS) and 75% in servers; ii) industry leading liquidity, supported by a
considerable cash position and consistent strong free cash flow; and iii)
unparalleled financial performance and operating profile, complemented by a
sizable recurring revenue base. 

The company's sizable liquidity and superior credit profile provide a
significant degree of financial flexibility within current ratings. Fitch
believes Microsoft will become more active with acquisitions and share buybacks
than it has been during the economic downturn, although overall activity is
expected to remain conservative relative to the company's total liquidity and
free cash flow profile. Fitch expects the company to continue to maintain a
significant net cash position. Nonetheless, the company has ample capacity for
significant acquisition activity, particularly given its large cash balance.
Fitch expects all stock repurchases will be completed via available cash
balances and free cash flow generation. Microsoft has $33.1 billion remaining
under its current share repurchase authorization that expires in September 2013.


At Sept. 30, 2009, total liquidity consisted primarily of $33.5 billion of cash
and investments, excluding $3.3 billion of securities pledged as collateral by
borrowers in its securities lending program. This is comprised of $8.8 billion
of cash and cash equivalents, and $24.6 billion of short-term investments, which
are invested in highly liquid fixed-income securities. The company also has $6
billion of long-term investments, consisting of primarily public and highly
liquid equity securities. Fitch believes a significant portion of Microsoft's
cash is located outside the U.S. and will represent an increasing percentage of
the total cash position due to stronger growth in international markets and
continued funding of share repurchases and dividends with U.S.-based cash.
Liquidity is further supported by Microsoft's industry-leading annual free cash
flow, which Fitch estimates will be approximately $13 billion going forward. The
company's undrawn $2.25 billion RCF maturing November 2010 serves as a back-up
to the CP program. 

Despite its strong industry position, Microsoft has experienced cyclical
operating weakness in recent quarters, driven by anemic PC demand and reduced
corporate IT spending. Fitch expects a modest improvement in operating results
in fiscal year 2010 (FY2010), driven by a slightly better demand environment,
particularly for PC unit sales growth from the introduction of the new Windows 7
OS, as well as continued cost efficiencies. Nonetheless, continued weakness in
line with recent quarters would be well within current ratings, given the still
unparalleled profitability, free cash flow, and credit protection measures. 

Although Microsoft's software licensing revenue model currently faces various
competitive pressures, Fitch does not believe there are any near-term threats or
financial risks that would place the company outside of current ratings. That
said, longer-term rating concerns consist of: i) new software models that could
challenge Microsoft's highly profitable model, including open-source software,
software as a service, or advertising-supported software; ii) gross margin
pressures attributable to investments in and stronger growth of products/regions
with lower average selling price (emerging markets, netbooks); iii)
substantially lower operating margins for the Online Services and Entertainment
&amp; Devices Divisions, which represent nearly 20% of total revenue; and iv)
further legal and/or regulatory actions that could impede the company's course
of business. Fitch expects higher international growth and the ongoing expansion
into adjacent businesses will continue to pressure margins, but are unlikely to
materially affect free cash flow. 

Microsoft remains subject to various lawsuits and instances of regulatory
scrutiny, and currently faces up to $3 billion of payments and fines should all
pending issues result in adverse outcomes (not including the ongoing European
Commission objection to the inclusion of web browsing software with the OS, the
financial impact of which cannot currently be reasonably estimated). Fitch views
this contingency as manageable considering the company's significant free cash
flow. 

Total debt at Sept 30, 2009 was $6 billion and consisted of i) the fully drawn
$2.25 billion CP program; ii) $2 billion 2.95% senior unsecured notes maturing
June 2014; iii) $1 billion 4.20% senior unsecured notes maturing June 2019; and
iv) $750 million 5.20% notes maturing June 2039. Fitch expects Microsoft may
seek to increase debt in the medium term to replenish its U.S.-based cash
balances in order to continue funding stock repurchases, cash dividends, or
acquisitions without repatriating offshore cash subject to incremental taxes.
Fitch believes the company has financial flexibility to issue significantly more
debt over the intermediate term, particularly to deal with cash location issues,
as the company maintains its net cash position.

&lt;p&gt;Joint Development Center in France Helps Create Dynamic BSS/OSS and
Service-Delivery Environment


WAKEFIELD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Comverse and IBM (NYSE: IBM) have launched a joint Center of Excellence (CoE) in
France to help global telecom operators speed time to market for new services,
boost subscriber acquisition, and reduce both churn and overall network
operating costs. 

Established within the IBM Telecom Solutions Lab in France, the CoE uses
software components from IBM and Comverse to create a BSS/OSS (Business Support
System/Operational Support System) and Service-Delivery environment that
provides a dynamic setting. 

"To sustain growth in today`s economy, Communication Service Providers are
seeking ways to offer subscribers a more positive and differentiated experience
while taking complexity and cost out of their businesses," said Chris Pearson,
global telco industry leader for IBM Global Business Services, which also
announced three additional telecom development centers today. 

This joint approach allows telecom clients to test proofs of concept with new
capabilities in simulated environments, enhance innovation, and reduce
implementation time and risk. The Service Provider Delivery Environment (SPDE)
framework, which is based on a service oriented architecture (SOA) approach,
combines with IBM server and storage hardware, such as Power Systems and
BladeCenter, to provide the dynamic infrastructure for the CoE. 

"Comverse and IBM understand how critical it is to offer systems and processes
that support the new business models that operators must deliver to stay
competitive," said Dror Bin, President of Global Sales at Comverse. "We believe
that the Comverse-IBM relationship backed by the Center of Excellence will allow
our joint customers to have more efficient operations and generate new
revenues." 

The emergence of new business models - and the potential for even more new
models with the view to next-generation networks - requires a converged approach
to BSS that is demonstrated at the center. Comverse ONE Billing and Active
Customer Management is a single BSS system that allows operators to manage all
subscribers consistently, regardless of payment or service type, resulting in
increased loyalty and new service adoption. 

The telecom industry has benefited from IBM`s globally-integrated network of
capabilities, partnerships and assets that have supported telecom deployments in
major and emerging markets since 2000. 

About IBM Telecommunications

IBM serves 90 percent of communications service providers worldwide. More than
1,000 CSPs worldwide rely on IBM middleware to run their businesses and the
world's 10 largest CSPs have implemented IBM SOA solutions. Partners and
customers have also benefited from the many telecommunications centers of
excellence that IBM has created, including locations in Austin, Texas and La
Gaude, France.

&lt;p&gt;Strategic Agreement Names Visa the Preferred Brand of One of the Nation`s
Largest Consumer-Driven Healthcare Solutions Providers
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and SHPS, Inc. today announced the renewal of a
collaborative agreement which pairs the world`s largest electronic payments
network with one of the nation`s largest providers of account-based,
consumer-driven healthcare solutions. Under terms of the renewal, Visa remains
the preferred payment brand for employee benefit card programs administered by
SHPS, which serves large and mid-sized employers, health insurance carriers, and
government agencies. 

Visa and SHPS first partnered in 2005 to enable employee benefit participants to
more easily access funds in health benefit accounts by using prepaid Visa
Healthcare cards. Visa Healthcare cards provide employees a convenient way to
pay for qualified healthcare expenses with funds in SHPS` Carewise Health
Spending accounts - including Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), Health
Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs), and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). One card
can be used to access multiple spending accounts and can accommodate new
spending accounts as services are added. 

"This relationship supports SHPS` mission of empowering consumers to improve
their overall health and optimize healthcare spending," said Rishabh Mehrotra,
President and CEO of SHPS. "Visa`s payments industry leadership will help us
continue to offer clients card-based solutions that provide a much more
convenient way to access needed funds in health benefit accounts, helping
consumers and employers truly maximize these benefit programs and creating
efficiencies for plan sponsors." 

When Visa Healthcare cards are used as the means for accessing a benefit
account, employee benefit participants can pay for qualified healthcare expenses
ranging from doctor visits and prescriptions to everyday healthcare items such
as over-the-counter medicines, with a quick swipe at the check out counter,
directly accessing spending account funds. Since introducing healthcare cards in
2003, Visa has introduced a number of enhancements to streamline the checkout
experience, making these products even more convenient to use - such as the
ability to automatically substantiate qualified purchases at the point of sale,
eliminating the need file a claim and wait for reimbursement. 

"The convenience and efficiencies offered by a Visa payment card play a valuable
role in encouraging the adoption of consumer-driven healthcare programs," said
Stacy Pourfallah, senior business leader, healthcare products, Visa Inc. "By
enhancing its benefit accounts with a Visa Healthcare card, SHPS helps create a
better experience for employee benefit participants while helping to reduce
costs and paperwork for employers and administrators."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has had talks with News Corp about a tie up, which would involve News Corp getting paid to take its news websites off Google Inc, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Monday night issued a security advisory that provides customers with guidance and workarounds for dealing with a zero-day exploit aimed at Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, the company said it was investigating the incident which emerged over the weekend when someone published the exploit code to the Bugtraq mailing list. By Monday night, Microsoft switched gears and issued the advisory. There have not been any active exploits of the vulnerability reported so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released Security Advisory 977981,  which includes workarounds for an issue that exposes a flaw in Cascading Style Sheets that could allow for remote code execution. Vulnerabilities that allow remote-code execution generally result in patches rated as critical by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory confirmed the vulnerability affects IE 6 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, and IE 6 and IE 7 on supported editions of XP, Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008.  Microsoft&#8217;s said users running IE 7 on Vista can configure the browser to run in Protected Mode to limit the impact of the vulnerability. It also recommended setting the Internet zone security setting to &#8220;High&#8221; to protect against the exploit. The &#8220;High&#8221; setting will disable JavaScript, which currently is the only confirmed attack mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said IE  5.01 Service Pack 4 and IE 8 on all supported versions of Windows are not affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an attack to work, the hacker would first have to get his victim to visit a Web site that hosted the exploit code. This could be a malicious Web site set up by the hacker himself or it could be a site that allows users to upload content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way cyber criminals have launched this type of attack, however, is by hacking into legitimate Web sites. Earlier this week, for example citizen's band radio vendor Cobra Electronics disclosed that it had been hacked in June, most likely by a professional hacker who had used the site to download malware to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not say whether it would patch the flaw during its next regularly scheduled set of security updates, due Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Robert McMillan of the IDG News Service contributed to this report.)&lt;/p&gt;

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Salesforce Partners with CA &amp; BMC

Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) entered into a number of strategic alliances that are
expected to enhance the cloud computing service and solutions offered by it. 

The first among these strategic alliances is with enterprise IT management
company CA Inc. (NYSE: CA). This partnership is expected to deliver agile
development management in the cloud on the Force.com platform. 

The CA Agile Planner on the Force.com site is targeted at small businesses and
enterprises alike. The service is intended to accelerate development timelines
while gaining control and visibility over all of the development initiatives.
This innovative product will result in reduced time to market. 

The second in the list is the agreement with BMC Software (NYSE: BMC). This
strategic alliance is expected to deliver BMC`s industry-leading IT management
solutions on the Force.com platform. The joint offering is expected to address
the overwhelming customer demand for critical service desk function and
processes that are delivered through the cloud computing platform. 

This new product is intended to help customers simplify and automate their IT
process and at the same time fetch a quick return on their investment. These new
collaborations are expected to help the company strengthen its position in the
cloud computing market and attract additional customers by providing enhanced
solutions. 

Salesforce reported better than expected third quarter results, exceeding the
Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The company reported revenue of $330.5 million, an
increase of 20.0% from the year-ago quarter and over the guided range of
$323-324 million. These encouraging numbers are illustrative of the fact that
the company is constantly creating value for itself and its shareholders. We
expect Salesforce to continue with the same trend going forward. 

Although the company is growing exponentially in the cloud computing segment,
Salesforce is expected to face stiff competition from big companies such as
Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL).

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has delayed re-releasing a Windows 7 installation tool that it has admitted included open-source code, saying that it's still testing the revamped utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company now plans to issue a new version of Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (WUDT) in the "next few weeks," said Peter Galli, Microsoft's open-source community manager in a post to the firm's Port25 blog last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Microsoft yanked WUDT from its Web site after blogger Rafael Rivera accused the company of lifting code from the GPLv2-licensed "Imagemaster" open-source project. Rivera, who writes the Within Windows blog, said Microsoft compounded the problem by not acknowledging the source of the code embedded in WDUT, and by not sharing the source code for its modifications, or the tool itself, to the project, as required by the terms of GPL (GNU General Public License).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galli admitted the error Nov. 13, also on the Port25 blog , saying that it was "not intentional on our part." He blamed a third-party developer Microsoft had contracted to create WDUT, but said Microsoft took final responsibility for the snafu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We share responsibility, as we did not catch it as part of our code review process," Galli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Galli also promised that Microsoft would make the source code and the binaries for WDUT available the following week under the GPLv2 terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he had to backtrack on Friday. "While we worked extremely hard to try and get the code ready for release by today [Nov. 20], we still need to test and localize it," said Galli. "Our goal is now to release the tool in all languages on the same day in the next few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft originally released WUDT in October, when it touted the tool as a way for netbook owners to create a bootable flash drive from a downloaded .iso file, or disk image, of Windows 7 purchased from Microsoft's online store. Most netbooks lack an optical drive and so can't install the new OS from a DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  REDWOOD CITY, CA, Nov 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Check Point(R) Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: CHKP), the worldwide
leader in securing the Internet, today announced that ZoneAlarm(R)
Extreme Security protects consumers against the zero-day vulnerability in
Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE). Check Point customers are preemptively
protected from the unpatched threat that if exploited causes the browser
to crash and leave systems vulnerable.

    Also known as "Summoner," the still unpatched vulnerability can occur when
Internet Explorer tries to access an object that has been deleted (or
"summoned from the dead"). Successful exploitation of this vulnerability
will crash the browser, and may allow execution of arbitrary code on the
vulnerable system. Such arbitrary code execution can lead to a variety of
possible consequences such as the transmission of spyware and viruses that
can lead to identity theft and silent takeover of the victim's computer.
To trigger the issue, an attacker may create a malicious web page that
will cause IE to exit unexpectedly, leaving a given system vulnerable.
The flaw affects widely used IE6 and IE7 running on Windows XP, Windows
Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and on Microsoft Windows
2000 SPT4 systems.

    "Once again, Check Point's unique technology offers preemptive protection
against new attacks that bypass traditional security suites," said Bari
Abdul, vice president of consumer sales. "By placing a two-way 'bubble of
security' around the browser, ZoneAlarm Extreme Security with
virtualization technology, stops the download of malicious programs onto
the victim's PC, delivering the highest level of protection needed to
defend against constantly evolving Web-based threats."

    ZoneAlarm Extreme Security successfully prevents against these types of
attacks from damaging users' PCs or stealing their information through its
unique virtualization technology. This technology, first introduced in
ZoneAlarm ForceField, is able to identify any downloads that the user
doesn't know about or invite. It redirects unwanted malware to a "sandbox"
where it remains trapped and cannot harm the operating system. Although
products with anti-virus can stop currently known attack vectors that
exploit this latest Microsoft IE vulnerability, it still leaves the user
exposed to new strains. Check Point delivers anti-virus protection and
then goes further with browser security technology that completely stops
this threat at the source, blocking not yet known strains and attack
vectors. For more information or to download ZoneAlarm Extreme Security

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Nov 25 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) plans to
expand its research and development operations in central and
western China as it strengthens its biomedical infrastructure
throughout the country, the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer (China) Research and Development Co Ltd will team up
with its Chinese partnerm Wuhan National Bioindustry Base
Construction and Management Office, to establish a new Pfizer RD
centre in Wuhan, expand its existing RD facility in Shanghai and
serve as a platform for global drug development and strategic
biomedical alliances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With plans to be a state-of-the-art facility, the Wuhan
center will be an integral part of Pfizer's global RD operations
while being closely aligned with the Chinese government's
strategy on biopharmaceutical industry development in the
region," Allan Gabor, the company's Regional President for North
Asia, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's RD operations in Wuhan will support global clinical
drug development programs, including Phase I-IV clinical trials,

&lt;p&gt;Emulex`s Virtual Fabric Adapter and BLADE`s 10 Gigabit Ethernet Switch Provide
End-to-End Converged Networking in Highly Virtualized Blade Server Environments
PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Emulex Corporation (NYSE:ELX) and BLADE Network Technologies, Inc. (BLADE), the
trusted leader in data center networking, announced that the two companies are
delivering the essential networking components for IBM BladeCenter Virtual
Fabric. BLADE`s BNT Virtual Fabric 10G Switch Module combined with Emulex
Virtual Fabric Adapter CFFh for IBM BladeCenter provide an end-to-end converged
networking solution for IBM BladeCenter H and HS22 blade servers. 

Virtual Fabric for IBM BladeCenter provides flexible Ethernet connectivity,
virtual port switching and support for future converged networking with iSCSI or
FCoE. Unlike the physical port switching employed by conventional switch
fabrics, the Emulex-BLADE solution provides a virtual fabric for IBM BladeCenter
supporting 1Gb/s or 10Gb/s that can be configured into up to eight virtual ports
with bandwidth allocation in 100Mb/s increments. 

BLADE`s switch-resident and hypervisor-agnostic SmartConnect with VMready
software is the industry`s first shipping product to enable network policies to
move along with Virtual Machines to maintain application performance,
availability and security. 

The Emulex Virtual Fabric Adapter CFFh for IBM BladeCenter provides the fastest
and most flexible blade server Ethernet connections in the industry, offering
two physical 10Gb/s Ethernet ports that can be configured into up to eight
virtual ports with bandwidth allocations in 100Mb/s increments. Emulex Virtual
Fabric Adapters are field upgradable to iSCSI or next-generation Fibre Channel
over Ethernet (FCoE). BLADE`s 10 Gigabit Ethernet switches support iSCSI and can
be upgraded with new firmware to support FCoE, allowing a converged networking
infrastructure to support diverse application requirements within the data
center. 

"One of the challenges customers face today is that they have too many devices
in their data centers that need to be managed," said Alex Yost, vice president,
IBM Systems &amp; Technology Group. "Virtual Fabric for IBM BladeCenter, developed
in partnership with Emulex and BLADE Network Technologies, allows customers to
significantly reduce the number of adapters, switches and cabling by offering up
to eight virtual adapters with the flexibility to work at any bandwidth from
100Mb to 10Gb." 

"Emulex and BLADE Network Technologies are working with IBM to bring
industry-leading 10Gb/s Ethernet and virtual I/O solutions to the market that
help IT managers reduce costs and scale their operations through the performance
and consolidation benefits of network convergence," said Steve Daheb, chief
marketing officer and senior vice president of Business Development, Emulex.
"Emulex Virtual Fabric Adapters for IBM BladeCenter are based on our OneConnect
Universal Converged Network Adapter architecture and work seamlessly with
BLADE`s convergence-ready switches to provide an ideal solution for IBM
BladeCenter customers seeking to lower capital expenditures, maximize blade
consolidation and deploy highly virtualized environments." 

"BLADE`s FCoE-ready virtual fabric switch automatically recognizes Emulex`s
Virtual Fabric Adapter and has the ability to connect massive virtualization
environments that span thousands of servers, helping simplify management and

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

J. Crew Beats Zacks Estimates

J. Crew Group Inc. (NYSE: JCG), a multi-channel retailer of women's, men's and
children's apparel, shoes and accessories across the U.S., has reported
better-than-expected fiscal 2009 third quarter results with a net income of
$43.9 million or 67 cents per share, compared to a net income of $19.0 million
or 30 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The earnings also exceeded
the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents. 

The strong third quarter performance was primarily driven by a healthy sales
growth across its segments. J. Crew Group is one of the few U.S. apparel
retailers that witnessed robust sales growth during the quarter despite an
overall weak economy. Total revenues increased 14.0% to $414.1 million from
$363.1 million in the year-ago quarter, while same-store sales increased 8%
year-over-year. 

J. Crew Group attributes its strong sales to unique and differentiated
merchandise, coupled with its tailor-made customer service. The merchandise
margins of the company hit a historical high during the quarter, buoyed by
stringent inventory management policies and a relatively positive outlook ahead
of the upcoming holiday season. At quarter-end, inventories were $223.9 million
compared to $250.1 million in the previous year. Inventory per square foot
decreased 17% year-over-year. 

FDIC Fund in the Negative

In its quarterly report on the banks, issued on Tuesday, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said that the deposit insurance fund used to
protect customer accounts dropped by $18.6 billion during the third quarter of
2009 to a deficit of $8.2 billion, while banks earned only $2.8 billion as loan
defaults continued to hurt bank balance sheets. The agency said that the decline
in the insurance fund was due primarily to an additional $21.7 billion set aside
by the FDIC during the quarter for additional bank failures. 

While the state of the economy is showing signs of recovery, there are lingering
concerns related to the banking industry. As the industry has to tolerate bad
loans that were made during the credit explosion, the trouble in the banking
system goes even deeper, increasing the possibility of more bank failures. 

In the third quarter of 2009, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 552 from 416 in the second quarter. This is the highest
since 1993. Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to
cause hundreds more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC anticipates
bank failures to cost about $100 billion over the next four years. 

In order to replenish the depleting fund, the FDIC board recently mandated the
U.S. banks to pay fees for three years in advance. Also, the regulators are
considering requesting the healthy banks to bail out the government as soon as
it is necessary to replenish the deposit insurance fund. The FDIC also has
access to the Treasury Department credit line of up to $500 billion. 

The FDIC insures deposits at 8,195 institutions with roughly $13.5 trillion in
assets. When a bank fails, it reimburses customers for deposits of up to
$250,000 per account. The outbreak of bank failures has significantly stretched
the regulator`s deposit insurance fund. 

Most of the taxpayer-provided money was provided to financial institutions
through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) as these are the backbone of
the economy, and they were the primary victims of the recession. However, we
continue to see more bank failures, with the tally reaching 124 so far this
year. During the third quarter alone, 50 institutions failed, bringing the total
number of failures in the first nine months of 2009 to 95. 

The failure of Washington Mutual last year was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq:
FITB), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq: ZION), among others.

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ABN AMRO, Goldman Sachs and World Online misled investors during the 2000 initial public offering (IPO) of the Dutch Internet provider, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The listing of World Online in March 2000 was the biggest Dutch Internet IPO at the time, valuing the company at 12 billion euros ($18 billion). The stock plunged after it became known that World Online's chief executive had sold shares far below the IPO price before the stock was floated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABN AMRO and Goldman Sachs were jointly global coordinator, lead manager and bookrunner of the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unlawful behavior of World Online, ABN AMRO, and Goldman Sachs has been confirmed by this ruling of the Supreme Court," the court said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors lost a total of 2.3 billion euros and should be entitled to damages, shareholder group VEB said in statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court confirmed a lower court's verdict after an appeal from the three defendants and an added allegation from VEB that ABN AMRO had manipulated the share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court concluded that ABN AMRO had brought about "a misleading opening price" by buying shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina Brink, World Online's CEO at the time, sold stakes in the company for $6.04 per share almost three months ahead of the public offering, effectively offering a discount to the IPO price. World Online's shares tanked after news of the share sales broke after the listing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court said there was unlawful behavior because the IPO's prospectus did not mention Brink had sold shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said that World Online gave false information in announcing alliances with other companies, which according to the Supreme Court were "hardly of any substance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which currently owns the ABN AMRO unit that co-managed the IPO, and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Italy's broadband provider Tiscali, which bought World Online in late 2000 for 3.4 billion euros in Tiscali shares, said World Online would publish a statement later on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gilbert Kreijger; edited by Karen Foster)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 28 (Reuters) - Japanese financial institutions,

billion yen ($1.16 billion) in Dubai, the Nikkei business daily

Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (8316.T) and about 10 billion yen
at Mizuho Corporate Bank (8411.T), it said, adding that other
Japanese banks are also likely to hold various amounts of loan
claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Services Agency and the Bank of Japan are
asking major banks and other financial institutions to reveal
their exposures to Dubai, the paper said citing sources close
to the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Dubai spooked financial markets when it said
two flagship firms planned to delay repaying billions of
dollars in debt. For more on the Dubai story, click

&lt;p&gt;Energy Efficient LED Sign to Be Unveiled in Late December 
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company announced today plans to replace the historic neon sign in
San Francisco`s South of Market district. Coca-Cola has maintained a display
alongside the southbound lanes on the I-80 freeway heading in to downtown San
Francisco for more than 75 years. In its place will be a state-of-the-art LED
display that is consistent in size and brightness with the existing sign but 80%
more energy efficient and is to be powered by 100% sustainable and certified
"green" energy. 

The display, located at 701 Bryant St. (Bryant and 5th St.) and near San
Francisco`s famed flower market, is visible to drivers approaching the Bay
Bridge from the south/east and disembarking the bridge from the north. It has
become a familiar landmark for those who live and work in the downtown area.
Work on replacing the sign will begin on the weekend of November 28-29, 2009. 

"For decades the historic Coca-Cola sign has greeted those crossing the Bay
Bridge and those who live and work nearby with a warm welcome to San Francisco,"
said Bea Perez, Senior Vice President, Integrated Marketing, Coca-Cola North
America. "It is our desire for the new energy efficient and technologically
advanced sign to offer the same hospitable message." 

The classic display has been a familiar sight to millions of pedestrians,
commuters and visitors. The original billboards were installed on the rooftop of
a newly constructed building in 1937 just as the Bay Bridge was opened and have
been replaced several times with the last update more than 25 years ago. Today,
the building houses an independent retail business Antonio`s Antiques. 

To begin preparations for installation, power will be shut off to the existing
display starting today. Skilled display and lighting workers will begin
carefully dismantling and removing the display faces. By December 11, it will be
completely disassembled and the installation of the replacement faces will
begin. The metal materials and wiring from the existing faces will be recycled
as much as possible and items such as the old neon will be disposed of in
accordance with environmental guidelines. 

In its place will rise an improved display expected to be operational within a
few weeks. Visually, it will maintain a consistent size and appearance as the
existing Coca-Cola sign. The new sign will now also feature the familiar
Spenserian script of the Coca-Cola logo on both the north and south of the
display. In view of thousands of people who cross the Bay Bridge every day, the
high efficiency lighting of the new faces will not increase the brightness of
the sign but will enhance the reliability of its performance and with much
greater energy efficiency. 

"The Coca-Cola Company has a companywide commitment to engage in environmentally
responsible and sustainable energy practices for all aspects of our business,"
said Laura Younkin, Message Integration Manager, Coca-Cola North America. "We
took a multifaceted approach to lighting, construction materials and mounting,
to create the most energy efficient display as possible. We also kept in mind
the aesthetics and history of our sign in the area. I am very pleased that we
have been able to secure 100% green energy for the reduced power requirements of
the sign." 

In addition to the environmental benefits from powering the new display, its
lighter weight and structural upgrades offer additional earthquake stability.
The new display will be engineered and assembled by YESCO, a leading
manufacturer and supplier of electronic displays in the U.S. They will
manufacture the display in Reno, NV and it will be reassembled in San Francisco
starting December 11. The replacement displays will be in place and relit by the
end of December. 

Coca-Cola also plans a `flip-the-switch` ceremony to celebrate relighting the
new sign. More details will be forthcoming.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. has done more to popularize graphical programming than any other vendor. The company's development tools, led by Visual Basic and Visual Studio, have been used by millions of software developers over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But during a revealing and often humorous panel discussion on the future of programming at last week's Professional Developers Conference in Los Angeles, Microsoft's own superstar developers espoused their loyalty to old-school methods of coding software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will fight you if you try to take away my text editor," said Don Box, a Microsoft distinguished engineer .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do people want to draw pictures [to program]? Sure, I guess," continued Box, who works on creating declarative languages and tools for Microsoft. "But if you grew up programming when I did, you did it in text. And I think we lose that at our peril."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Graphical programming environments are usable when they are useless, but unusable when they would be useful," said Jeffrey Snover, another Microsoft distinguished engineer and creator of Microsoft's PowerShell scripting tool for Windows . "When there are five things on the screen, you can burp that out [in text]. But when there are 500 things, [graphical programming] is completely unusable. You zoom in and zoom out and you lose all context. I think it's just smokin' dope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While visual programming can be easier to learn and can help make developers more productive, it's also "easier to delude yourself," said Butler Lampson, a technical fellow at Microsoft . For instance, "no one can ever tell you what a UML diagram means."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lampson, winner of the Association for Computing Machinery's A.M. Turing Award in 1992 for his "contributions to personal computing and computer science," is a co-creator of nine programming languages .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is belatedly increasing support for the Unified Modeling Language, or UML , in the upcoming Visual Studio 2010 release that's slated to ship next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides visual programming tools and UML, Microsoft is pushing managed code through its Common Language Runtime (CLR) technology in the next version of the tool set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managed code runs inside a virtual machine. That makes it easier and faster to write, and more secure, say proponents. Managed code also lets developers "perform above their level of competence," Snover said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Managed code is like antilock brakes," he added. "You used to have to be a good driver on ice or you would die. Now you don't have to pump your brakes anymore."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snover joked that programming is getting so abstract, developers will soon have to use Microsoft's in-air motion sensor game controller for the Xbox, dubbed Project Natal , to "write programs through interpretative dance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other programming gurus, such as Herb Sutter, lead designer of Microsoft's C++/CLI programming language, predict that writing code to run on bare metal may come back into fashion, as chip makers find themselves unable to keep boosting processor speeds at current rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we have maybe five to 10 years left [with Moore's Law]," he said. "Optimizations will get very, very sexy again, when people realize how we pay for abstractions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Sutter said, programmers need to start writing apps optimized for parallelized, multicore PCs , which have been available for the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, significant improvements to multicore programming languages are needed first, said Burton Smith, a Microsoft technical fellow and expert on parallel programming languages. "Today's [multicore] programming languages are pretty low level and not very productive. They take a lot of human attention and effort," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be a long time before parallel programming becomes mainstream, he predicted. "Because of the bias towards sequential programming, we'll still be reinventing ourselves [as parallel programmers] 12 years from now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Court says ABN, Goldman, World Online misled investors
* Ruled on Dutch Internet provider World Online's 2000 IPO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Ruled ABN AMRO caused "misleading" opening price&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * CEO sold shares below IPO price before listing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Investors lost 2.3 bln euros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMSTERDAM, Nov 27 (Reuters) - ABN AMRO, Goldman Sachs and
World Online misled investors during the 2000 initial public
offering (IPO) of the Dutch Internet provider, the Dutch Supreme
Court ruled on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The listing of World Online in March 2000 was the biggest
Dutch Internet IPO at the time, valuing the company at 12
billion euros ($18 billion). The stock plunged after it became
known that World Online's chief executive had sold shares far
below the IPO price before the stock was floated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABN AMRO and Goldman Sachs were jointly global coordinator,
lead manager and bookrunner of the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The unlawful behaviour of World Online, ABN AMRO
[ABNNV.UL], and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has been confirmed by this
ruling of the Supreme Court," the court said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors lost a total of 2.3 billion euros and should be
entitled to damages, shareholder group VEB said in statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Supreme Court confirmed a lower court's verdict after an
appeal from the three defendants and an added allegation from 
VEB that ABN AMRO had manipulated the share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Supreme Court concluded that ABN AMRO had brought about
"a misleading opening price" by buying shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nina Brink, World Online's CEO at the time, sold stakes in
the company for $6.04 per share almost three months ahead of the
public offering, effectively offering a discount to the IPO
price. World Online's shares tanked after news of the share
sales broke after the listing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Supreme Court said there was unlawful behaviour because
the IPO's prospectus did not mention Brink had sold shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said that World Online gave false information in
announcing alliances with other companies, which according to
the Supreme Court were "hardly of any substance".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which currently owns the ABN
AMRO unit that co-managed the IPO, and Goldman Sachs declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for Italy's broadband provider Tiscali
(TIS.MI), which bought World Online in late 2000 for 3.4 billion
euros in Tiscali shares, said World Online would publish a
statement later on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 30, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMAX Corporation (Nasdaq:IMAX)
(TSX:IMX) and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures today announced that Disney's
A Christmas Carol, the spectacular Disney Digital 3D(TM) holiday release from
director Robert Zemeckis and starring Jim Carrey, crossed the $20 million mark
at IMAX(R) theatres during Thanksgiving weekend. The IMAX release grossed $3.3
million from 182 IMAX theatres domestically during the weekend from November 27
through November 29, 2009 -- a noteworthy 53% increase over the previous weekend
-- registering 21% of the film's total domestic fourth-weekend gross of $15.9
million on approximately 3% of the screens. The film's domestic IMAX total is
now at $16.5 million.

Internationally, the IMAX release continued to build momentum during its fourth
weekend, with an estimated gross of over $1 million, bringing the film's IMAX
global cume to $20.8 million.

Commenting on the announcement, Bob Chapek, president, Distribution, The Walt
Disney Studios, said, "We have been watching IMAX releases demonstrate strong
box office legs over the years and it's great to be a part of it for this
wonderful holiday movie."

"The 53 percent increase over last weekend demonstrates how The IMAX
Experience(R) can add event status to an already exciting movie," said IMAX CEO
Richard L. Gelfond. "It's great to see momentum continue as we head into the
final three weeks of the run, and we're pleased that this momentum includes
international markets -- particularly Russia, which has grossed an estimated
$600,000 on three screens in just ten days."

"This weekend's significant box office increase is encouraging as we head into
the final stretch," added Greg Foster, Chairman and President of IMAX Filmed
Entertainment. "Moviegoers around the world only have three more weeks left to
experience the unique and magical combination of Robert Zemeckis, IMAX(R) 3D and
Disney."

Disney's A Christmas Carol: An IMAX 3D Experience has been digitally re-mastered
into the unparalleled image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience with
proprietary IMAX DMR(R) (Digital Re-mastering) technology.

Robert Zemeckis takes the art of performance capture to the next level with
Disney's A Christmas Carol. This multi-sensory 3D motion picture captures the
fantastical essence of the classic Dickens tale in a groundbreaking motion
picture event. Ebeneezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) begins the Christmas holiday with
his usual miserly contempt, barking at his faithful clerk (Gary Oldman), and his
cheery nephew (Colin Firth). But when the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and
Yet to Come (all played by Carrey) take him on an eye-opening journey revealing
truths Old Scrooge is reluctant to face, he must open his heart to undo years of
ill will before it's too late.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today confirmed that it is looking into reports that November's security updates have triggered a black screen on some Windows users' PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is investigating reports that its latest release of security updates is resulting in system issues for some customers," said a company spokesman in an e-mail Monday. "Once we complete our investigation, we will provide detailed guidance on how to prevent or address these issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports Microsoft alluded to stemmed from U.K.-based security vendor Prevx, which claimed last Thursday that the Windows security updates issued on Nov. 10 changed Access Control List (ACL) entries in the registry, preventing some installed software from running properly. The result, said Prevx, is a black screen , sometimes dubbed "black screen of death" in a sop to the "blue screen of death" that Windows puts up after a major system crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevx added that security software seemed to be especially affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Microsoft spokesman said the company would provide additional information once its support and security teams complete their investigations, it was unclear Monday exactly how extensive the problem was, or how many users were affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searches of Microsoft's support forums today, for example, turned up only one "black screen" thread with posts after the Nov. 10 security updates had been released. Four different users on that Windows 7-specific thread said that they faced a blank screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 19, a moderator of the support forum suggested a workaround that involved starting another Windows Explorer (explorer.exe) process. Prevx essentially gave the same advice a week later when it told users with blank screens how to download a free tool it said would fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's November collection of patches addressed 15 vulnerabilities in six security updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one of the half-dozen updates included a known issue. According to the detailed support document for MS09-065, one of the month's three critical updates, customers running Windows XP and using an ATI Radeon HD 2400-series video card "may find that the computer does not start correctly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's next security update release is slated for Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM has acquired database security vendor Guardium, it said Monday, confirming earlier reports. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardium makes technology for provides real-time monitoring of database activity, allowing companies to detect fraud, outside attacks and other illegal activities. The privately held Waltham, Massachusetts, company has about 150 employees and 400 customers, according to CEO Ram Metser. Its products will be rolled into IBM's sprawling Information on Demand product portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guardium and its competitor Imperva have been the subject of acquisition rumors for more than a year, according to Adrian Lane, an analyst with Securosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Guardium is one of the only firms still standing with a mainframe monitoring solution, which is a major prerequisite for much of IBM's customer base. From the IBM perspective, the functionality makes sense and fits well into some of their existing security products," he wrote in a blog post Monday. "From an architectural standpoint, integration (as opposed to just sharing data and events) will be a challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, Guardium's software supports a wide range of database platforms and IBM has no plans to change that, given the heterogenous nature of its customers' IT environments, according to Arvind Krishna, general manager in the IBM Information Management division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to be able to support them, and only expect to add [more platform support] over time," Krishna said during a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the deal leaves other vendors in the space "a little more valuable," Lane said in his blog post. "There remain a lot of firms like EMC, McAfee, Oracle, Symantec, and others who would really benefit from gaining DAM technology, so I expect additional acquisitions in the next 6 months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a roll up could "spell great news in the coming years, in the form of increased quality, better-integrated server agents and one-stop shopping -- not to mention the rapidly increasing possibility to think of database vendors as being part of the solution when firms move to establish enterprise-wide data security (or anti-data-loss) programs," said Nick Selby, managing director of security consultancy Trident Risk Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Robert McMillan in San Francisco contributed to this report.)&lt;/p&gt;

according to notices filed California pollution regulators.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks featured in this
week`s analysis include Private Bancorp (Nasdaq: PVTB), Sterling Bancshares TX
(Nasdaq: SBIB), Peoples Bancorp of Ohio (Nasdaq: PEBO), J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM)

Zacks Industry Rank Analysis is written by Dirk Van Dijk, CFA, Chief Equity
Strategist, Zacks.com. 

This week: Avoid Regional Domestic Banks

The Zacks Ranks for the regional banks look even worse than the ranks for the
real estate companies themselves. The 206 total industries have seven related to
the regional banks, with five regional industries plus one for the major
regional banks that cover several different regions. With the exception of the
major regionals and the banks in the Northeast -- both of which are neutral and
tied for 104th place with average scores of 3.00 -- the banks all look downright
ugly. 

The worst of the bunch, by a hair, are the Western Regional banks in 198th place
with an average score of 3.64, followed by the Midwest in 197th place and a
score of 3.51, the Southeast (180th place, 3.31) and the Southwest (177th,
3.29). I don`t think the differences between them are all that significant --
just stay away from them all. Some of the larger names among the banks with
Zacks Rank #5 scores include: Private Bancorp (Nasdaq: PVTB), Sterling
Bancshares TX (Nasdaq: SBIB) and Peoples Bancorp of Ohio (Nasdaq: PEBO). None of
them will be mistaken for J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) or Bank of America (NYSE:
BAC).

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Mixed Signals in U.S. Oil Demand

The higher-than-expected crude stockpile drop and the encouraging rise in the
distillate inventories has raised hopes that the worst of the recession-induced
slump may be over and demand is picking up. However, it did little to strengthen
the price of the commodity, as higher-than-expected increases in gasoline more
than offset this positive news. Moreover, the drop in petroleum stocks was
triggered by weak refinery activity rather than a much-awaited pick-up in oil
demand. 

As such, we prefer to maintain our cautious stance on oil refiners like Sunoco
Inc. (NYSE: SUN), Tesoro Corp. (NYSE: TSO) and Western Refining Inc. (NYSE:
WNR), given that the overall environment for refining margins is likely to
remain poor going into 2010. 

Companies like ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) --
oil majors that have significant refining operations -- are also expected to
remain under pressure until pricing and demand improve.

Morgan and Toyota Motor</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Hubbell (NYSE: HUB.B) as the Bull of the Day
and Lindsay Corporation (NYSE: LNN) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS), J.P. Morgan
(NYSE: JPM) and Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Hubbell's (NYSE: HUB.B) third quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus by a
wide margin, although revenue was more or less in-line. Government initiatives,
the company's market position, the product line-up and acquisition strategy
indicate a strong comeback once the economy is more conducive. 

We agree that near-term growth could be impacted by the non-residential
slowdown, conservatism and transmission focus of utilities and general weakness
in the industrial market. However, the signs of a recovery in 2010 are
encouraging. 

Consequently, we are upgrading HUB.B shares to Outperform. 

Bear of the Day: 

Lindsay Corporation (NYSE: LNN) is a leading manufacturer of self-propelled
agricultural irrigation systems. The company stands to benefit in the long-term
from the demand for increased food production driven by worldwide population
growth, and the growing need for biofuels. 

However, lower expected farm income and uncertainty surrounding reauthorization
of the federal highway bill are adversely impacting the company's incoming order
rate. The near-term revenue visibility remains low for Lindsay. 

The company does not expect substantial recovery in its end markets in fiscal
2010. We are downgrading the rating on the stock from Neutral to Underperform.

Dubai-ous Loans&#8230;

The main investment vehicle of Dubai banking, Dubai World, has asked that its
payments on $59 billion it owes be suspended until May, signaling to the
financial world that Dubai investment is severely strapped for cash. Dubai is
the one emirate that does not have any oil of its own, but it had expanded at a
breakneck pace in an attempt to become the main financial hub of the Persian
Gulf region. 

This Dubai banking news has given the world markets a severe case of indigestion
as we in the States digested our turkey and stuffing. The initial reaction,
interestingly enough, was a further sell off of the dollar, but it has since
turned around. World stock markets sold off dramatically after this Dubai
investment news, with most of the major markets falling by more than three
percent. 

Emerging markets are also down, but surprisingly by less than the developed
markets, more like a little bit more than 2% on average. Commodities have also
been hit hard, including gold which is down by $31.90, or 2.69%. Oil is being
hit even harder, down by more than 5.0% and below its $75 support level. 

Normally, Black Friday has been an up day for the market. That is not going to
happen this year. The big question is if this Dubai investment news is the first
of a series of sovereign defaults, or is a one-off affair. 

In the overall scheme of things, $60 billion is not a huge amount, but it is not
pocket change either. It is not clear where all the bodies are buried with
respect to this Dubai banking loan, although it is thought that European banks
like Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS) have a bigger exposure to Dubai banking and Dubai
investment than do U.S. banks like J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM). 

Toyota Cuts Bonus Payments

Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM) has decided to cut winter bonus payments for its
managers and union workers in Japan in order to keep the company afloat by
managing its largest-ever recall in the U.S. and meeting its annual forecasts.
The company announced that it will slash bonus payments for 8,700 managers in
Japan by 20% and for union workers by 18% on a year-over-year basis. 

Managers are entitled to twice-a-year performance linked bonus payments in
addition to their monthly salaries. However, Toyota sought a reduction in bonus
payments in order to manage its recently implemented largest-ever recall of 3.8
million vehicles in the U.S., which would entail huge cost. 

Toyota assured that it will address problems with sudden acceleration in some of
its U.S. models by replacing the gas pedals on the recalled vehicles. The recall
involved popular vehicles such as the Toyota Camry (2007-10 model year) - the
top-selling passenger car in the U.S., and the Toyota Prius (2004-09) - the
best-selling gas-electric hybrid, apart from Toyota Avalon (2005-10), Toyota
Tacoma (2005-10), Toyota Tundra (2007-10) and Lexus (2007-10 ES350 and 2006-10
IS250/350). 

Toyota returned to profitability in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 after
reporting losses since the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The company posted a
profit of &#165;21.8 billion ($232 million) or &#165;6.96 (7 cents) per share. This was
attributed to government incentive programs across the world - such as "Cash for
Clunkers" in the U.S - that helped the company recoup its market share.

&lt;p&gt; * Price not disclosed, earlier reported at $225 mln&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Guardium helps monitor, protect databases from hackers
 (Adds share move, background on IBM)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 30 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) said on Monday it
had bought database security company Guardium, aiming to expand
its software portfolio and help its business clients protect
their databases from hacking and fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp did not disclose how
much it paid for the privately held company specializing in
database monitoring, but Israeli financial newspaper TheMarker
earlier reported the deal was worth $225 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM, which bought PwC Consulting from
PricewaterhouseCoopers for about $3.5 billion in 2002 and sold
its personal computer business to Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) in
2005, has been shifting its focus from hardware to the more
lucrative software and technology services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guardium will be incorporated into IBM's information
management software portfolio, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guardium was founded in 2002, and network equipment maker
Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) was a strategic investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its products help protect databases and automate corporate
compliance auditing processes. The world's top five banks
install its security platform, Guardium said in a recent press
release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move comes as large-cap technology companies, including
IBM rival Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), have stepped up
acquisitions to expand their product portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has said it plans to expand its services and software
businesses, and analysts have said it has the cash to make more
deals. It ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $11.5
billion, although it recently approved a new $5 billion stock
buyback plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares rose 65 cents, or 0.53 percent, to close at
$126.35 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Tim Dobbyn and

&lt;p&gt; * Woods disappointed to skip own tournament&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cites injuries sustained in car accident

 (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Mark Lamport-Stokes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Tiger Woods will not play in
this week's Chevron World Challenge, which he has hosted in
Thousand Oaks, California, for the past nine years, because of
injuries sustained in a car accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The American world number one has dominated news headlines
since suffering facial cuts and briefly losing consciousness
after crashing his SUV outside his Florida home in the early
hours of Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am extremely disappointed that I will not be at my
tournament this week," Woods, 33, said in a statement on his
official website (web.tigerwoods.com).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am certain it will be an outstanding event and I'm very
sorry that I can't be there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's Graeme McDowell will replace four-times winner
Woods in the 18-strong field for the $5.75 million event, which
starts at Sherwood Country Club on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woods, whose World Challenge raises money for his charitable
foundation, also cancelled a news conference he had been
scheduled to hold on Tuesday in the build-up to the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added he would not return to golfing action until 2010,
although he had not been scheduled to compete anywhere else in
the world for the rest of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GREATEST GOLFER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The greatest golfer of his generation and arguably the best
of all time, Woods struck a fire hydrant and a tree outside his
mansion in Windermere, Florida at about 2:25 a.m. EST (0725 GMT)
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was subsequently released from hospital in good condition
after being treated and said later he had some cuts and bruising
and felt "pretty sore".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sunday, he took responsibility for the accident and
praised his Swedish wife Elin for acting courageously to help
him get out of his SUV. But he again cancelled an interview with
authorities investigating the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woods, a winner of 14 major titles and 82 tournaments
worldwide, said he wanted to keep the crash details private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, a Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) officer said charges
were still pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woods ended his 2009 U.S. PGA Tour campaign with six
victories in 17 starts, posting 14 top-10 finishes for overall
earnings of $10,508,163. He also won the season-long points race
for the FedExCup, plus the $10 million bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Forbes magazine, his FedExCup success in
September had made him the first billionaire athlete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the world's most recognisable figures, Woods has
lucrative endorsement deals with Nike, ATT, Gillette and
Gatorade and he ratchets up television ratings whenever he
competes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by John Mehaffey. To query or comment on this story

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cocaine addicts can control their cravings by willpower alone, U.S. researchers reported on Monday in a study that suggests the right training may help abusers kick the habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said their volunteers could control cravings even when they saw the typical cues that make people want to use the illegal stimulant, such as the sight of drug paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists are working on vaccines or drugs that can help users avoid cocaine and other addictive drugs, the team at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York said their finding suggests a non-drug approach may help too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it may translate to other problems related to cravings or addictive behavior, such as gambling or overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know from previous studies that drug cues can trigger dramatic changes in the brain that are linked to a strong craving response," Gene-Jack Wang, who worked on the study, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study provides the first evidence that cocaine abusers retain some ability to cognitively inhibit their craving responses to drug-related cues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a brain-scanning technique called positron emission tomography or PET to watch the areas of the brain associated with drug craving in 24 cocaine users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were asked to watch a video showing people buying, preparing and smoking crack cocaine and randomly asked to try to resist feeling their own cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists monitored the volunteers' heart rate and blood pressure and asked them to describe their cravings during the scans. As expected, the video triggered brain activity in several brain regions and raised heart rate and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when asked to control this craving, the patients were in general able to do so and the PET scans showed dramatic decreases in the signals from brain regions involved in experiencing and anticipating rewards, as well as in a part of the brain that determines the significance of a stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many current drug treatment programs help addicted individuals predict when and where they might be exposed to drug cues so that they can avoid such situations," Dr. Nora Volkow, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which helped fund the study, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While this is a very useful strategy, in real-world situations, cues may come up in unexpected ways. Our findings suggest that a clinical strategy that trains cocaine abusers to exert greater cognitive control could help them selectively inhibit the craving response whenever and wherever drug cues are encountered, whether expectedly or unexpectedly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has rated the J.P. Morgan Resecuritization Trust 2009-12. This
transaction consists of nine non-crossed groups. Each group is a
resecuritization of a residential mortgage backed securities certificate. Fitch
is not rating Group 3, 6, and 9 certificates. 

--Group 1 is a resecuritization of 55.26% interest in CHL 2007-9, Class A-6; 

--Group 2 is a resecuritization of 6.97% interest in WFMBS 2006-AR12, Class
II-A-1; 

--Group 4 is a resecuritization of 11.08% interest in CHL 2005-29, Class A-1; 

--Group 5 is a resecuritization of 12.55% interest in FHASI 2007-2, Class I-A-4;


--Group 7 is a resecuritization of 30.33% interest in WFMBS 2007-11, Class A-85;


--Group 8 is a resecuritization of 4.92% interest in WFMBS 2007-11, Class A-96. 

As resecuritizations, the certificates will receive their cash flows from the
underlying classes of certificates. The underlying certificates represent
beneficial ownership interest in fixed-rate and adjustable-rate, conventional,
first lien residential mortgage loans, substantially all of which have original
terms to stated maturity of 30 years. 

This transaction contains certain classes designated as Base Certificates and
others as Exchangeable Certificates. Group 1 A-1 certificate is a Base
Certificate and can be exchanged for certain combinations of A-3 through A-16.
The A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-6 certificates in group 2, 7 and 8 are Base
Certificates and can be exchanged for certain combinations of A-3 through A-19.
The class A-3, A-4 and A-6 certificates in group 4 are Base Certificates and can
be exchanged for class A-1. The class A-1 certificate in group 5 is a Base
Certificate and can be exchanged for certain combinations of A-3 through A-8.
Classes C-A-1 through C-A-8 can be exchanged for certain combinations of
certificates from group 7 and group 8. 

ResiLogic, the regression-based model used by Fitch, takes into account multiple
risk factors which can broadly be placed into three categories in the following
order of influence: seasoned loan risks, economic risks, and collateral risks.
For seasoned loan risks, the delinquency status and volatility are the most
important with regards to Frequency of Foreclosure (FOF), while change in home
price index and loan age are the most important with regards to Loss Severity
(LS). Economic risk is solely comprised of state and MSA level risk multipliers
as well as a national multiplier. In the category of collateral risk, the credit
score, credit sector, and combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio are the most
heavily-weighted risk factors in calculating the FOF. Closing balance,
loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and loan coupon are the most heavily-weighted risk
factors in calculating Loss Severity. Due to concerns over recent pool
performance and volatility, loss levels were adjusted higher than the ResiLogic
model results for Group 5. 

The loan level information used in analyzing pools is taken from the Loan
Performance database. In general, fields in the data tapes are complete unless
otherwise noted. In this transaction the back-end debt-to-income (DTI) ratio
field was missing. For loans missing DTI information, Fitch uses an
industry-standard assumption. 

The underlying collateral and cash flow structure were analyzed according to
Fitch's 'Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria', 'U.S. Residential Mortgage
Re-REMIC,' 'ResiLogic: U.S. Residential Mortgage Loss Model' and 'U.S. RMBS Cash
Flow Analysis' criteria.

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp did not disclose how much it paid for the privately-held company specializing in database monitoring, but Israeli financial newspaper TheMarker earlier reported the deal was worth $225 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, which has shifted from hardware to the more lucrative software and technology services over the past decade, said it will integrate Guardium into its information management software portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guardium was founded in 2002, and its products help protect databases in real-time and automates corporate compliance auditing processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's top five banks install its security platform, Guardium said in a recent press release. It also said network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) was a strategic investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) can wait 12 to 15 months before deciding from among a "myriad" of possibilities on how to replace reigning daytime TV talk show queen Oprah Winfrey when she ends her show in 2011, said Disney/ABC Television Group President Anne Sweeney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Oprah has given us two years' notice, which is not something you generally see in television," Sweeney said at the Reuters Global Media Summit on Monday. "We are certainly in the process right now of reviewing our options."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney, who is also co-chair of Disney Media Networks and oversees the ABC Television Network, described Oprah as "one of a kind" but nonetheless said she could foresee many ways to replace the TV star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No one expected her to come on the scene 25 years ago," said Sweeney. "So I think it's really going to be interesting to see who comes forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winfrey will end her show to focus on OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, a cable channel to be launched in partnership with Discovery Communications Inc (DISCA.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say Disney and its ABC stations, which carry the show, could lose out financially from Oprah's decision. The show's large audiences have long boosted ratings and advertising for the stations and their local newscasts that follow it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's going to be really interesting to see who comes forward and who emerges during this time as the next great idea, personality and then the next great piece of programing," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney declined to comment on any specific replacements for Winfrey's show, which airs weekdays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a matter of understanding the marketplace and thinking about what it's going to look like in two years and what is the best thing that you could be programing at that hour for consumers, and I think it's going to vary station to station," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEEPING UP WITH YOUNG VIEWING HABITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney also talked about a range of issues facing the television industry, from singer Adam Lambert's controversial performance on an awards show to advertising and the quickly evolving market for distributing content via television, cable and the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During ABC's live broadcast of the American Music Awards on November 22, Lambert simulated oral sex on-stage with a backup dancer, kissed a man and gave the middle finger to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC edited his performance during the West Coast broadcast of the night-time awards show, and later canceled a scheduled November 25 appearance by Lambert -- the runner-up on this year's "American Idol" -- on the "Good Morning America" program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney said the controversy caused Disney to review the steps it takes to vet live performances by getting assurances from artists that their stage shows will resemble their rehearsals, and using contractual obligations to hold them to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We certainly don't want to suppress artistry at any level, but we also have to be very cognizant of who our audience is," Sweeney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that it was the right decision for ABC to cancel Lambert's scheduled performance on "Good Morning America," noting that many children watch the morning news show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really had to take the decision very seriously and found that his performance was very unpredictable at night and (we) didn't know what to expect in the morning," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said in mid-November that the market for last-minute TV commercial spots is 20 percent stronger than it was during the upfront negotiations in the spring, when longer-term advertising deals were signed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's reflective of certainly a little more heat in the economy and great programing," Sweeney said of the 20 percent increase. "Companies are showing up who (had) cut their spending last year," she said, citing more advertising by auto and retail companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether the relative strength was sustainable, Sweeney said: "We certainly hope so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has been moving aggressively to provide content on various platforms to reach an increasingly fragmented audience used to getting entertainment through multiple channels, from the Web to broadcast TV, cable and mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You come to realize very quickly that all these platforms are very different. Sometimes they're being used or accessed by different demographics," Sweeney said, adding that her own 19-year-old daughter did not want to take a television to college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She said: 'Mom, you don't understand; I don't need it.' I said: 'You're going to have a television if I have to nail it to your wall. You have to have one,'" Sweeney recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis and Paul Thomasch, editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Signs of market stabilization emerging -Gartner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * IBM gains more than 1 point of revenue market share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * HP's share up slightly, Dell also gains, Sun struggles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Worldwide server revenue
tumbled 15.5 percent in the third quarter to $10.7 billion,
industry tracker Gartner said on Monday, with four of the top
five vendors posting double-digit declines from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Gartner noted that signs of stabilization are
appearing in the market, as improvement was seen from the
previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of servers and other technology hardware have been
severely impacted by the economic slowdown, as business
customers have drastically dialed back on spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Third quarter server unit shipments fell 17.1 percent to
1.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gartner analyst Jeffrey Hewitt noted the July-September
period saw solid unit and revenue increases from the second
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That suggests that the market as a whole is showing signs
of stabilization as we move toward the end of 2009," he said in
a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM (IBM.N) maintained the top spot in Gartner server
rankings, gaining more than a point of market share to 31.7
percent. IBM saw server revenue fall 12.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Server revenue at Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), the No. 2
vendor, fell 15.1 percent, but its market share edged up
slightly to 30.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The biggest market share gain among the top 5 came from No.
3 Dell Inc DELL.O, where revenue fell a mere 5.1 percent. The
company's market share rose to 13.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Server sales at No. 4 Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O
continued to sink, falling 32 percent in the third quarter.
Sun's $7 billion acquisition by Oracle Corp ORCL.O is still
being examined by European Union regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of the top tier vendors saw sequential revenue growth
in the third quarter except for Sun.

&lt;p&gt;The brokerage raised its prime mortgage loss range to 5 percent to 6 percent and the commercial real estate loss range to 8 percent to 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to a lower consumer loss outlook, the brokerage remained positive on big banks and credit card stocks such as JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), but was cautious on regional banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said the stress test carried out by the U.S. Treasury in the first half of the year was enough as 2009 loan losses, trading results and pre-provision earnings were better than the stress test forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jochelle Mendonca in Bangalore; Editing by Anil D'Silva)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAVANNAH, Ga.--(Business Wire)--
Health Discovery Corporation (OTCBB: HDVY) is pleased to announce that the
Company has appointed Thomas Gallagher as Executive Vice President and Managing
Director of Global IP Strategies, charged with executing new revenue-producing
licensing and development relationships in the non-healthcare and high tech
industries thereby significantly expanding upon HDC`s focus in the healthcare
and personalized medicine arena. 

Gallagher spent close to fifteen years on Wall Street as a securities and
business transaction lawyer, as well as an assistant general counsel managing
risk on a transaction and policy basis for a then-$9 billion publicly traded
company. He went on to become a Vice President at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. (NYSE:
GS), New York, NY, where he helped lead the restricted stock desk on the equity
trading floor. Gallagher pioneered the use of 10b5-1 selling plans, working with
CEOs and other corporate executives to manage their large, single stock risk. He
also assisted numerous companies in strategic buy backs of their stock.
Subsequently, Gallagher was a member of an investment management team at Goldman
Sachs that advised clients with approximately $1.5 billion in assets. 

The Company has just completed a call of a significant number of its outstanding
warrants, and retired all of its secured debt prior to its due date. "The
Company is now financially well positioned to build upon our products and
successes in healthcare and personalized medicine by expanding into
non-healthcare and high tech arenas," said Dr. Barnhill. "Included in the 38
issued patents and 32 pending patents owned by HDC are 11 issued patents and 6
pending patents that have broad claims encompassing the non-healthcare and high
technology arenas." 

Dr. Barnhill continued, "Tom`s legal, capital markets and business development
and transaction experience are exactly what Health Discovery Corporation needs
at this time in its growth cycle to create additional new revenue streams by
expanding the license and development advantages in our patent portfolio to
include the substantial and significant business opportunities in the
non-healthcare and high technology arenas." 

"Given the quality of people assembled by Dr. Barnhill, HDC`s pioneering
technology, pipeline of products and substantial intellectual property
portfolio, I`m excited about joining the team at Health Discovery Corporation,"
said Gallagher. "My mission is to immediately begin generating revenue-producing
licensing and development relationships in the non-healthcare and high tech
industries. My initial focus will be on those technologies that integrate the
Company`s SVM and RFE-SVM technology into very sophisticated pattern recognition
platforms. The Company`s SVM technology and applications are pivotal in the
fields of Internet search engines, spam email detection, oil exploration,
homeland security and law enforcement, including biometrics and crime hot-spot
prediction, risk management, industrial control and fault detection, as well as
vehicle-related applications, including vehicle recognition, vehicle sensor
monitoring, obstacle detection, motor vehicle accident prediction, and load
balancing for electric vehicle batteries, among countless others applications,"
said Gallagher. 

In healthcare and personalized medicine, the Company has entered into
royalty-bearing licenses which include those for its new urine-based prostate
cancer test with Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX) and Abbott
Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) for development and commercialization. Health Discovery
Corporation`s patented SVM technology, for which Vermillion, Inc. (Other OTC:
VRMLQ.PK) was granted a limited license, played a role in the creation of a new
ovarian cancer test recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which
is expected to be commercialized by Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX). 

In addition to his Wall Street experience, among other activities, Gallagher
spent three years working on a pro bono basis for Mother Teresa`s religious
order, the Missionaries of Charity, developing and administering the Mother
Teresa of Calcutta Center, Inc., and traveling to Kolkata (Calcutta), India, and
other locations. He also spent a year working for a Jesuit-affiliated
not-for-profit organization supporting Fe y Alegria, a network of 2,600 schools
for the poor, serving 1.3 million students in Latin America and the Caribbean. 

Gallagher writes a bi-monthly "best practices" column for the National Catholic
Reporter, the largest independent newspaper in the country. Gallagher is also an
ultra endurance athlete, who competes in desert races around the world.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical announced the completion and start-up of an expansion at its
Rotterdam Aromatics Plant. The expansion has made this world-scale plant
ExxonMobil`s largest paraxylene production facility. 

Paraxylene capacity at the plant has been increased by 25 percent to 700,000
tons, and benzene capacity increased by 20 percent to 830,000 tons per annum.
The expansion at the Rotterdam complex, owned and operated by ExxonMobil
Chemical Holland B.V., was announced in 2007 and completed on schedule. 

The expansion is part of ExxonMobil Chemical's strategy to develop world-scale,
highly integrated chemical facilities with globally competitive cost structures.
The new unit in Rotterdam benefits from integration with existing facilities and
captures a number of synergies with the base plant. 

"This expansion demonstrates ExxonMobil`s commitment to invest, across the
business cycle, in order to meet the longer term, growing customer demand for
these products," said T.J. Wojnar, senior vice president, ExxonMobil Chemical
Company. "This project is an example of our continued efforts to meet the supply
and quality needs of our global customers." 

The new unit employs ExxonMobil`s proprietary PxMaxSM technology to produce
paraxylene and benzene. The PxMax process improves selectivity, generates less
waste and reduces energy requirements versus existing technologies.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs maintained its "attractive" view on the European automotive sector and raised its price targets on some stocks, saying it expects the sector to continue to outperform driven by potential earnings surprises in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman expects earnings surprises from sources such as structural cost savings, a potential rise in sector consolidation and improved financial leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman revised its ratings and price targets on several European auto companies and reinstated Porsche (PSHG_p.DE) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) with "buy" ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Goldman said the global auto industry must double annualized net cost savings to offset profit headwinds over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe consolidation will be part of the industry's response, given limits to cost cutting," Goldman said, and highlighted Fiat FIA.MA, PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) and Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T) as attractive industrial partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman expects growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) to influence the global automotive industry, along with the challenge to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global automotive industry is facing the threat of significant negative mix-shift toward smaller cars from economic realignment and associated growth in emerging markets and a downsizing trend within developed markets, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging market growth and changing consumer behavior could reduce industry profits by $26 billion, Goldman believes, adding it estimates an incremental cost of $117 billion to the industry for complying with tightening carbon-dioxide emissions standards by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman expects wealth levels in emerging economies to rise quickly, with the global economic realignment showing a potential $86 billion profit opportunity over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On our forecasts, BRIC countries will account for almost 70 percent of this growth ... with China becoming the world's largest car market by 2020," Goldman said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mary Meyase in Bangalore; Editing by Kavita Chandran)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best-in-Class IP Reputation Solution Empowers Small and Medium Size Businesses
with Ease of Management, Improved Productivity and Reduced Costs
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Engate Technology Corporation, leaders in next generation reputation network
profiling technology and proactive botnet, phish, virus and email security
solutions, today announced integration of Engate`s security software suite with
IBM Lotus Foundations Start line of software appliances for small and
medium-sized businesses (SMB). 

Lotus Foundations Start `plug and play` appliances help companies with little or
no in-house technical resources to focus on running their business rather than
managing their computer systems. This Linux-based IBM solution provides staple
collaboration tools such as email, file sharing, and remote access and affords
peace of mind through automated network security features, data protection,
backup and recovery. With Engate, Lotus Foundations Start will offer an
industry-leading security suite that proactively protects SMBs from a diversity
of email-borne threats. 

"Email remains one of the most widely-used attack vectors against small and
medium size business users, making email security essential to IBM Lotus
Foundations Start," said Caleb Barlow, Integration Executive for Lotus
Foundations, IBM Corporation. "Together with Engate, IBM Lotus Foundations Start
offers SMB customers an easy-to-use, best-in-class security solution that
protects from the growing number of email-borne botnet, phish, spam and virus
threats." 

"Engate provides organizations with proactive protection against the growing
threat of phish, spam and botnet attacks," said Wil Cochran, CEO,
Engate."Working together, we are combining our connection-level protection with
Lotus Foundations Start to deliver a solution that helps SMBs mitigate
resource-intensive email security administration by stopping malicious threats
outside their network before they compromise their privacy, productivity and
resources." 

"Botnet-based email attacks are the most prominent malicious security threat to
my business customers today. My clients were dissatisfied with their
conventional security products as they struggled to keep up with the high volume
of sophisticated attacks that were secretly bypassing their filters, spreading
new infections and stealing sensitive data," said John Gray, Partner, Bentor
Technologies. "I`m excited to be working with Engate and IBM Lotus Foundations
Start as their integrated functionality offers my business customers the
innovation, flexibility and reliability necessary in stopping these dangerous
attacks at the edge of the network before they have a chance to damage resources
and disrupt business productivity." 

Award-winning IP Reputation Solution Empowers SMBs to Focus on Growth

Botnets are one of the most dangerous online security threats today, where an
estimated 40% of the 800 million computers on the Internet unsuspectingly
distribute spam, steal private data, launch dangerous attacks, and spread new
infections. In particular, SMBs face unique security and IT resource challenges
that leave them vulnerable to email-borne attacks and botnet threats that can
disrupt business productivity. 

As email-borne threats continue to double annually, Engate`s advanced botnet,
phish, virus and email security protects companies with a powerful solution that
proactively protects networks from illicit hosts that are distributing threats.
Engate`s innovative security suite employs patented reputation network
profiling, source verification, and anti-forgery techniques to identify and
block email-borne botnet attacks at the connection level, before they have a
chance to compromise IT resources, invade privacy, degrade network performance,
and waste user productivity. 

Next Generation Reputation Network Profiling Technology for OEM Partners

With more than seven years of operational experience collecting and analyzing
data on global networks, Engate`s reputation network profiling technology
empowers strategic OEM partners to take advantage of the reputation of over 400
million `good and bad` IP`s in Engate`s 17,000 rules database - known as
GlobalRules. By profiling entire networks beyond infected hosts, Engate has
built a repository of intelligence on potential and unknown hosts that may
become infected. This unique intelligence on unknown threats is a critical
component to enhancing an OEM partner`s security portfolio today - as well as in
the future - particularly as unknown threats continue to rise due to the growth
of botnets. Engate delivers incremental value to security software, appliance,
secure web gateway, unified threat management, intrusion prevention, firewall,
and router partners in the following ways: 

(1) Enhance 3rd party threat scoring systems with an extra layer of threat
intelligence proven to achieve an additional 10-15% unique catches on top of
existing content scanning, Real-time Blacklists (RBL) and reputation
technologies. 

(2) Improve connection-level security and the efficiency of 3rd party email
security filters by radically reducing the large volume of unwanted traffic and
malicious payloads from reaching the gateway. 

(3) Augment multi-layer security strategy with proactive protection from known
and unknown threats. Engate`s unique network profiling functionality gives OEM
partners preemptive defense against botnet-based attacks, phish, spam, viruses
and blended web/email threats.
