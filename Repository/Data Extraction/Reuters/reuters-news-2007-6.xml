"We are working to meet the objectives of AB32 in the most equitable, technically feasible and cost-effective manner possible. Chevron looks forward to working with the Governor and his administration to create an effective, market-based approach that will reduce carbon emissions while safeguarding the growth of California's economy."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background, changes dateline to HOUSTON from previous NEW
YORK)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Friday shut a
200,000 barrel-per-day crude distillation unit at its 260,000 bpd El
Segundo, California, oil refinery near Los Angeles for planned work, the
company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokesman said the overhaul would take "a number of weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources familiar with refinery operations said the work was expected to
last two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit is the larger of two CDUs at the plant. CDUs do the initial
refining of oil coming into a refinery. A refinery's capacity is its CDU
capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This maintenance is planned, and we will continue to ensure supply to
our regular customers," the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trade sources said the Chevron overhaul is unlikely affect refined
products prices in the normally volatile Los Angeles market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High prices have drawn large amounts of refined products imports to the
West Coast in the past few weeks and Chevron has been stockpiling to meet
contractual obligations during the overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unleaded, ethanol-blend gasoline made to meet California's strict
emission standards fell 1.5 cents in trade on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK, June 1 (Reuters) - A Thai unit of Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) said on Friday it would comply with the Thai
government's policy by listing in Bangkok by the end of this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will follow the energy minister's policy to list shares

Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thailand has seven refineries, and Esso and Star Petroleum
Refining Co are the only two that have not listed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Star is 64 percent owned by U.S. oil firm Chevron (CVX.N)

this year, but the plan needed approval from Chevron.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Citywire) - JPMorgan American Investment Trust manager Garrett Fish has been increasing his weightings in aerospace and defence stocks across the 362 million pound trust's portfolio to cash in on increased U.S. government spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aircraft manufacturers Lockheed Martin, Boeing and United Technologies are among the top 10 holdings in the trust . Fish says the US Congress's decision to increase the Supplemental Defence Budget in February has meant companies in the sector should benefit from the increased uplift in spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "The big projects include the new F32 and F35 jet fighters and the US tanker fleet which is 45 years old."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish expects the commercial side of the aerospace business to benefit from an uplift in orders from European and US carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "US airlines are far behind in the order cycle. After 9/11 they shrunk their capacity and now need to get in the queue for new narrow and wide body planes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Delta Airlines has just come out of bankruptcy and American Airlines is now ordering Boeing 737s and possibly the new Boeing 787 Airbus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish believes Boeing will also receive a further boost from the greener credentials of the new 787 Airbus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has 20 percent better fuel efficiency than its rivals," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish has trimmed back his weighting in Gulfstream Jet manufacturer General Dynamics while maintaining his long term holds in Boeing, United Technologies and Lockheed Martin which have increased in line with the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish has also increased his exposure to healthcare over the last three months because he believes the large pharmaceutical company's focus on clamping down on costs has helped to improve margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has increased positions in top ten holdings Wyeth and Viagra producer Pfizer as well as healthcare maintenance organisation Wellpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish has maintained underweight positions in consumer products, materials and processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "I have been wrong over the last 18 months and copper is still being widely bought."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish has been adding to his position in fast food chain McDonalds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is our number two overweight. They have slowed their expansion plans and are growing on slow, steady consistency. The stock has gone from 17p in 2003 to 49p now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also maintained a zero weighting in materials because he believes "the spread between risky and non risky assets is too narrow". The trust is currently trading at around an 8.5 percent discount although its range over the last year has been between 6.5 percent and 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(c) Citywire Financial Publishers Ltd 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney wants to breathe 
some excitement into the TV-DVD business, which after several 
years of explosive growth is beginning to lose some of its 
luster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The studio is taking the unusual step of announcing all its 
upcoming marquee TV-DVD releases at once and packing into them 
a wealth of novel extras, from Spanish-language audio tracks to 
a virtual fashion show, extended and bonus episodes and unaired 
story lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The highlight: Season 3 sets of top-rated shows "Lost," 
"Desperate Housewives" and "Grey's Anatomy." Breaking 
tradition, each set gets a special name, similar to special 
editions of movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Desperate Housewives: The Complete Third Season -- The 
Dirty Laundry Edition" will arrive in stores September 4. The 
six-disc set includes all 23 episodes along with such extras as 
a behind-the-scenes look at the season finale, a Spanish audio 
track, a conversation with series star Eva Longoria in which 
she shares stories from some of her favorite bloopers, a 
collection of creator Marc Cherry's favorite scenes and several 
unaired story lines, deleted scenes and outtakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A week later, on September 11, comes "Grey's Anatomy: The 
Complete Third Season -- Seriously Extended Edition," a 
seven-disc set with all 25 episodes, four of them extended 
exclusively for the DVD release. Other bonus features include a 
one-on-one with series star Ellen Pompeo, a visit to the race 
track with star (and race-car enthusiast) Patrick Dempsey, cast 
and crew members' favorite scenes and audio commentaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Lost: The Complete Third Season -- The Unexplored 
Experience" follows December 11 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The 
23-episode, seven-disc set comes with a one-on-one with star 
Matthew Fox, a featurette on "The Others," a documentary 
chronicling 24 hours in production and a selection of 
never-before-seen flashbacks. Also included are 
behind-the-scenes looks at 10 episodes, audio commentaries, 
deleted scenes and bloopers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also in the pipeline are three new series that never before 
have been available on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Ugly Betty: The Complete First Season -- Bettyfied 
Edition" will be out August 21. The six-disc set contains all 
23 episodes as well as an exhibit of some of the first season's 
best and worst fashions, a Spanish audio track, a discussion 
with the cast on the show's origins and a behind-the-scenes 
documentary with the show's production, costume and set 
designers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Brothers  Sisters: The Complete First Season," also a 
six-disc set, is scheduled for a September 18 release. On 
September 25 comes "What About Brian? -- Seasons 1  2," a 
five-disc set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Disney announcement comes at a time when the pace of 
TV-DVD releases is slowing. Just 158 multi-disc TV-DVD season 
sets came to market in the first four months of this year, 
according to the DVD Release Report, down 12.2% from the same 
period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 June 1 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities started Ness
Technologies Inc. NSTC.O with an "overweight" rating, saying
it is an attractively priced niche player.

 Ness is the Israeli IT services market leader and is
seeking to replicate its leadership position in Eastern Europe,
the brokerage said.

 In addition, the company has increased its exposure to the
U.S. and Asia Pacific markets, it said.

 As the new management improves the business's efficiency

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Thursday it would offer improved capacity to search copyrighted books on the Internet as the company battles Google Inc. for advertising dollars from Web-based services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it had received permission from dozens of publishers including Cambridge University Press, McGraw-Hill Cos Inc. and Simon  Schuster, a CBS Corp. unit, to use their copyrighted titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes to its Live Search Books comes months after Microsoft attacked Google for what it called the Web search leader's "cavalier" approach to copyright protection in services like Google Book Search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's top software maker said Google's ambitious plan to scan millions of published works and make them available via its search system without first gaining copyright holders' permission could open the door to massive infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Live Search Books is part of its "Live" online services aimed at augmenting its dominance in desktop software with a host of Web offerings to rival Google. Both companies aim to make money from Web services through advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Live Search Books would now include a counter telling how many pages are left within the number of pages they are allowed to view, and tools to allow people to more easily search within books using specific keywords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preview pane will include a cover image, book summary and table of contents and the system will have links allowing readers to buy books from online retailers or the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Tim McLaughlin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 31 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) is downplaying its role in subprime lending even as spectacular flameouts in that sector have turned the Wall Street bank into one of the biggest originators of risky mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We don't do much in the subprime business -- at all," JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told investors earlier this month at the company's annual meeting. "It will be a good business, by the way." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Indeed, the No. 3 U.S. bank, along with other Wall Street companies, has stepped into a void triggered by a meltdown in the market for lending money to homebuyers with weak credit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan's first-quarter subprime mortgage originations, through Chase Home Finance, jumped 11 percent to $3.02 billion, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. The bank was No. 11 in a ranking that included No. 7 New Century Financial Corp. NEWCQ.PK, which now is being liquidated in bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Not much subprime business at JPMorgan translates into a subprime mortgage portfolio that stood at $13.2 billion at the end of last year, or about 3.6 percent of the company's $367 billion consumer loan portfolio. JPMorgan sold most of its 2006 subprime production, offloading risk.  JPMorgan does not specify how much subprime lending contributes to its bottom line, but the earnings potential is there. In March, Charles Scharf, head of JPMorgan's retail division, said home equity loans and subprime mortgages have the potential to contribute a total of $800 million in annual net income when working with the company's investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Profits increase when JPMorgan's investment bank packages pools of loans into securities and sells them to investors. That's one key reason why Wall Street banks have stepped up their subprime game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    CitiMortgage, a unit of Citigroup (C.N), originated $8.1 billion in subprime mortgages during the first quarter, a 29 percent year-over-year gain that catapulted the bank to the top spot among U.S. subprime lenders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    While CitiMortgage, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s subprime unit, First Franklin Financial, showed gains, industrywide subprime lending plummeted 32 percent to $95 billon in the first quarter, Inside Mortgage Finance said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N and HSBC Finance, the U.S. unit of London's HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L), have reined in their subprime lending, but remain the No. 2 and No. 3 lenders in the sector, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Merrill Lynch Chief Executive Stanley O'Neal recently told Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz that Merrill's $1.3 billion acquisition of First Franklin will allow the company to boost its market share for mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Mr. O'Neal admitted that it's hard to make money in mortgages now," Hintz said in a research note. "But he pointed out that 25 competitors have left the market or declared bankruptcy and (First Franklin) leaves Merrill Lynch with large origination capabilities that will prove its value as the market adjusts to new issuance standards and economics of the mortgage business." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Tim McLaughlin, editing by Richard Chang; Reuters messaging: tim.mclaughlin.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6033)) Keywords: USA SUBPRIME WALLSTREET &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's experimental oral biotechnology drug axitinib demonstrated substantial anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced thyroid cancer in a small, mid-stage clinical trial, according to data released at a major cancer meeting on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in Chicago, tested the drug in 60 patients whose thyroid cancer had advanced despite receiving other treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the trial was to measure response rate of the drug, given in pill form, with partial response defined as tumors that shrank by 31 to 68 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two percent, or 13 patients, experienced partial response with tumor shrinkage that lasted from one to 16 months, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another 50 percent of patients, the tumors stopped growing, while blood tests showed that axitinib was binding to its intended target, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axitinib, from a class of drugs known as VEGF inhibitors, works by starving tumors of blood and nutrients necessary for growth, a process called anti-angiogenesis. Genentech's widely used cancer drug Avastin was the first approved medicine to work in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As recently as three years ago we had very little to offer these patients, and now we're seeing response rates at a level we've never seen with chemotherapy," said Ezra Cohen, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and the study's lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Axitinib and other VEGF inhibitors represent an exciting new front in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thyroid cancer is generally treated with surgery and/or radioactive iodine with a fairly high cure rate. But there are few treatment options for patients who do not respond to those therapies, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common side effect seen with axitinib was fatigue reported by 43 percent of patients. Other side effects included hypertension, protein in the urine, diarrhea and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is also testing the drug in breast, lung and kidney cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, June 4 (Reuters) - More than 387,900 acres (157,000 hectares) of coca were detected in Colombia in 2006, an increase of 32,120 acres (13,000 hectares) from the previous year, the White House anti-drug office said on Monday. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) said the area surveyed in 2006 was 19 percent larger than in 2005 and that almost all of the increase in coca cultivation was found in the newly surveyed areas. However, statistically there was no change in the amount of coca being grown between 2005 and 2006, the agency said. Because they had not been previously surveyed, it is not possible to know with certainty if the coca found in the areas is in fact newly planted and had not been producing for a period of time, the ONDCP said in a statement. Rapid crop reconstitution, a move to smaller plots and the discovery of previously unsurveyed coca growing areas, have posed major challenges to the techniques and methodologies used to understand Colombia's coca cultivation and cocaine output, the statement said. Colombia has received around $4 billion in U.S aid since 2000 to help fight traffickers and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, accused by U.S. and Colombian officials of using the drug trade to finance Latin America's longest insurgency. Colombia says the U.S.-backed fumigation program is the only way it can counter coca production in remote areas where guerrillas are still fighting government forces. Officials estimate the Andean country still produces around 600 tonnes of cocaine a year, most of which is shipped to the United States and Europe.

Monday said it will advance three of its experimental cancer
drugs into late-stage trials this year against different types
of tumors, including the most common form of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which hopes its growing number of experimental
cancer drugs will prove successful and make it a force in
oncology, disclosed the planned Phase III trials at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology being held
in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Company executives told analysts at the ASCO meeting that
its drug Sutent, now in Phase III trials for breast cancer,
will enter Phase III trials this year for non small-cell lung
cancer as well as for colon and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sutent is already approved for treatment of kidney cancer
and is considered the gold standard of treatment for the
disease, having prolonged lives of patients in clinical
trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axitinib, a biotechnology treatment in late-stage trials
for thyroid cancer, will also enter Phase III studies for
pancreatic cancer, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer executives said the costly larger trials of Axitinib
are warranted because of promising signs in Phase II trials
that the oral medicine has activity against pancreatic cancer,
one of the most life-threatening and difficult to treat
tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data from those mid-stage trials of Axitinib was reported
earlier on Monday at the ASCO meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it also plans to begin late-stage trials
this year of its experimental drug CP-751,871 against
non-small-cell lung cancer -- the most common form of lung
cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug is a monoclonal antibody that blocks receptors to
a protein called insulin like growth factor 1.

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA/KANO, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigeria filed new charges 
against Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Monday, seeking $6.95 billion in 
damages over the deaths of children who received an unapproved 
drug during a meningitis epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The suit came after a separate court delayed until July two 
cases in which Pfizer is accused by the northern state of Kano 
of harming Nigerian children by testing them with the 
antibiotic Trovan in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the Kano state government case has been running 
for more than two years, Monday was the first time the federal 
government filed its own charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria alleged in papers filed at a Federal High Court in 
the capital Abuja that Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, 
did not obtain approval from the relevant regulatory agencies 
and acted unethically when it tested the antibiotic in Kano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The plaintiff contends that the defendant never obtained 
approval of the relevant regulatory agencies ..., nor did the 
defendant seek or receive approval to conduct any clinical 
trial at any time before their illegal conduct," Nigeria said 
in court papers obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After taking preliminary arguments from counsels to both 
parties, Justice Babs Kuewumi adjourned the case to June 26 for 
further hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer denies the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Pfizer spokesman in New York, Bryant Haskins, reiterated 
comments the company had already made, that its clinical trial 
of Trovan was conducted with the full knowledge of the Nigerian 
government and in a responsible and ethical way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These allegations against Pfizer, which are not new, are 
highly inflammatory and not based on all the facts," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to maintain, in the strongest terms, that the 
Nigerian government was fully informed in advance of the 
clinical trial; that the trial was conducted appropriately, 
ethically and with the best interests of patients in mind; and 
that it helped save lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kano state government has filed criminal charges and a 
civil lawsuit seeking $2.075 billion in damages from Pfizer 
over the tests which it alleges caused the deaths of some 
children and permanent health problems for others.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOCIAL MISGIVINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria is seeking $500 million for what the government 
says it has spent on treatment, compensation and support for 
the Trovan victims and their families, and $450 million for 
public education to erase social misgivings that arose from the 
ill-fated tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government says it spent $1 billion on a health 
programme that failed because of the misgivings caused by the 
Trovan tests, while it is claiming $5 billion in general 
damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cases in Kano were due to come up for hearing on Monday 
at a state high court but no representative of Pfizer was 
present in court. The judge adjourned the civil case to July 4 
and the criminal case to July 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haskins said company lawyers did not attend the hearing 
because Pfizer had not been served notice of the proceeding -- 
and that the cases were postponed for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The legal dispute has been going on for years. A U.S. 
federal judge in 2005 dismissed a lawsuit that accused Pfizer 
of not properly warning Nigerian families about the risk of 
Trovan, saying it should be heard in a Nigerian court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has said the clinical trial was conducted "in a 
responsible and ethical way consistent with the company's 
abiding commitment to patient safety."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said that at the time of the meningitis 
outbreak, Trovan was in late-stage development and had been 
evaluated in 5,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Trovan for 
adult use in 1997 but did not approve the drug for use by 
American children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    (adds details of open-source deal, Microsoft comment) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, June 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) announced a marketing, technology and patent agreement with open-source software distributor Xandros on Monday, marking the company's second such deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The five-year deal is similar to the one Microsoft signed with Novell Inc. NOVL.O last year when the world's biggest software maker said it wanted to enter into similar pacts with other open-source providers.  That agreement included a clause that Microsoft would not sue Novell's Linux customers, which angered some in the open-source software community who feared Microsoft would use it to back intellectual property claims against others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal with Xandros, which sells desktop versions of Linux, also includes patent protections for the open source distributor's customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Linux is the most popular type of open-source software, or computer programs that developers can download and modify as long as they share those changes with the public. The packages have gained in popularity over the past decade, taking market share away from Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The agreement also comes less than a week after a foundation that owns the rights to much of the code behind Linux software said it would not bar Novell from getting access to parts of its open-source software code under a new licensing agreement still being finalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Novell's access to components of Linux controlled by the nonprofit Free Software Foundation had been called into question because of the agreement the company struck with Microsoft not to sue each other's clients for patent infringement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The agreement caused an uproar in the open-source community, because it was seen as an endorsement of Microsoft's claims that open-source software violates some of its patents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The foundation released last week the 'last call' draft of its new license agreement, which is known as the General Public License version 3, and said it did not punish Novell because its agreement "can be turned against Microsoft" to benefit the open-source community. It did not give details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft said it would continue work with the open source community but declined to address the specific issue of how its agreement with Novell could be turned against it or talk about further questions on the subject. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft has been and will remain focused on building a bridge between the worlds of proprietary and open source software," Horacio Gutierrez, Microsoft's vice president of Intellectual Property and Licensing, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ((Reporting by Michael Kahn and Daisuke Wakabayashi, editing by Dave Zimmerman; Reuters Messaging: rm://michael.kahn.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail: michael.kahn@reuters.com; Tel: +1 415-677-2511)) Keywords: MICROSOFT OPENSOURCE/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background, quotes) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on Monday its experimental drug axitinib showed enough promise in a mid-stage trial against advanced pancreatic cancer to warrant continued development of the medicine in large late-stage studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest drugmaker said the oral medicine, when combined with the standard treatment Gemzar, "showed a trend towards prolonged overall survival," compared with treatment with Gemzar alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said the Phase II trial results, while favorable, barely missed achieving statistical significance in terms of prolonging survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Larger Phase III trials will likely focus on patients who showed most improvement in the mid-stage trial -- those with advanced pancreatic cancer in best overall health, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "These findings suggest that axitinib has anti-tumor activity in advanced pancreatic cancer and provide the basis for a Phase III program to further evaluate the potential benefits" of the medicine, said Jean-Philippe Spano, the study's lead investigator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer is hoping that its growing number of experimental cancer drugs will prove successful and make it a force in oncology, which has been a highly lucrative area for rival drugmakers such as Switzerland's Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The study involved 103 previously untreated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Those taking axitinib plus Gemzar survived a median 6.9 months, compared with 5.6 months for those taking Gemzar alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Pancreatic cancer continues to be one of the most life-threatening and difficult-to-treat solid tumors," Spano said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer is also testing the biotechnology drug in breast, lung, kidney and thyroid cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In data presented on Saturday at ASCO, axitinib demonstrated substantial anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced thyroid cancer in a small, mid-stage clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In that study, 22 percent of patients (13) had their tumors shrink by 31 to 68 percent, with shrinkage that lasted from one to 16 months.  Axitinib, from a class of drugs known as VEGF inhibitors, works by starving tumors of blood and nutrients necessary for growth, a process called anti-angiogenesis. Genentech's DNA.N widely used cancer drug Avastin was the first approved medicine to work in this way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The most common adverse side effects in trials of axitinib as a single agent included fatigue, protein in the urine,  stomatitis/mucositis, hypertension and diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The overall profile of axitinib looks good because it is clearly showing activity against a number of tumors," including those of the thyroid, the pancreas and the lung, said Charles Baum, Pfizer's head of oncology development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot, editing by Brian Moss; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6034)) Keywords: CANCER PANCREATIC/PFIZER  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

(PFE.N) stands accused of harming Nigerian children by testing them with an unapproved drug. Pfizer denies the allegations and says it acted ethically when it tested the antibiotic Trovan on children in the northern state of Kano in 1996. The Kano state government has filed criminal charges and a civil lawsuit seeking $2.075 billion in damages from Pfizer over the tests, which it alleges caused the deaths of some children and permanent health problems for others. Both cases were due to come up for hearing on Monday at a state high court but no representative of Pfizer, the world's biggest drug maker, was present in court. The judge adjourned the civil case to July 4 and the criminal case to July 9.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Monday said its experimental drug axitinib showed promise in a mid-stage trial as a treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said the oral drug, when combined with the standard treatment Gemzar, "showed a trend towards prolonged overall survival," compared with treatment with Gemzar alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A trend towards prolonged survival typically means activity was seen with the drug, but results were not statistically significant. A Pfizer statement describing the Phase II trial results did not specify whether the results were statistically significant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "These findings suggest that axitinib has anti-tumor activity in advanced pancreatic cancer and provide the basis for a Phase III program to further evaluate the potential benefits" of the medicine, said Jean-Philippe Spano, the study's lead investigator, of Hospital La Piti-Salpetriere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail, quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Noel Randewich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, June 5 (Reuters) - The Supreme Court struck
down a key part of a media law on Tuesday that favored industry
heavyweight Televisa, in a rare legal blow against Mexico's
dominant business interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges ruled that broadcasters cannot automatically use
frequency freed up by improved technology to launch
telecommunications services and that new concessions should not
necessarily go to the highest bidder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ruling is a loss for Televisa (TLVACPO.MX), which has a
70 percent share of Mexico's television audience and is one of
the country's most powerful companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I can't think of anything in the last several decades that
has fundamentally opened the markets in Mexico to competition
so much," said Dan Lund, head of MUND Americas research firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawmakers had complained to the Supreme Court about the
so-called "Televisa Law," which they criticize as tilting the
playing field in favor of Televisa and No. 2 broadcaster TV
Azteca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moving toward digital technology, television and radio
broadcasters are using less and less of the broadcasting
spectrum that for years has been assigned to them by the
government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics of the law say spectrum no longer needed for
broadcasters' core businesses should be returned to the
government and tendered to give new or small operators a chance
to compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa, which says the law creates more transparency and
certainty for investors, had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's stock fell 1.57 percent to 60.94 pesos and its
New York-traded stock (TV.N) lost 58 cents, or 2.02 percent, to
close at $28.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Large, family-controlled companies dominate broadcasting,
telecommunications, cement and other key industries in Mexico
and are often seen as using their heft to push out potential
competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico's two main television networks account for nearly
all of the country's programming and are the only source of
news for many, giving the networks powerful sway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa, which also owns the country's largest cable
operator and its only satellite television service, and TV
Azteca are the only private nationwide networks in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tuesday's ruling, which along with other verdicts this week
and last week must be ratified when the court wraps up the
case, means Congress will have to rewrite the law, said
political analyst Jose Antonio Crespo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The court can't know how the legislation will be written,
but fundamentally I believe this is one of the Supreme Court's
most far-reaching decisions in recent times," magistrate
Margarita Luna Ramos told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Felipe Calderon has vowed to promote competition
in sectors like telecommunications and cement, but since taking
office in December, he has made no notable progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Opponents accuse Televisa of bullying political parties and
their presidential candidates into pushing the bill through
Congress during last year's election campaign, narrowly won by
Calderon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At least one part of the Mexican state did not submit to
the interests of the broadcasters," said Crespo, referring to
the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Telecommunications and media companies are eager to move
into each others' traditional businesses, with telephone
operators rushing to offer television services and cable
companies launching Internet and telephone products.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds Commission and Microsoft having no comment, court unavailable for comment) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By David Lawsky &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    BRUSSELS, June 5 (Reuters) - The European Union's second highest court is expected to rule on Sept. 17 whether the European Commission was right in 2004 to find that Microsoft violated antitrust laws, sources familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sept. 17 is the final working day before the retirement of Court of First Instance President Bo Vesterdorf, who is presiding over the landmark case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The ruling is expected to clarify whether the European Commission can continue to pursue the case, or whether it must pull back and permit Microsoft (MSFT.O) to continue its business practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Neither the Commission nor Microsoft had any comment and the Court was unavailable for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In March 2004, the Commission imposed a record 497 million euro ($657 million) fine on Microsoft and ordered it to change its business practices, ruling the company failed to give other makers of small business servers the information needed to compete with Microsoft's own products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It also ruled that Microsoft unfairly bundled in its own Windows Media Player audiovisual software, making life difficult for rivals such as RealNetworks' (RNWK.O) Real Player. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft's business model is to bundle software into its operating system in order to forestall competition, the Commission says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Changing the business model could threaten Microsoft's 95 percent share of the PC operating system market, the Commission says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft says its business model is innovation and that it has a right to add what it wants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The case is being heard before a special 13-judge Grand Chamber of the Court of First Instance, which conducted hearings on the matter in April, 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Commission says Microsoft has failed to comply with its 2004 decision, and in July 2006 fined the company 280.5 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In March this year, the Commission held out the possibility that the company could face further fines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "In the 50 years of European antitrust policy, it's the first time we've been confronted with a company that has failed to comply with an antitrust decision," said the Commission's competition spokesman Jonathan Todd. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For its part, Microsoft says it has done nothing wrong and is being prevented from competing by the Commission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Court of First Instance's ruling is final so far as findings of fact are concerned, but the losing party can appeal questions of law to the European Union's highest court, the Court of Justice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the meantime, the Commission has taken the precaution of putting on hold the possibility of issuing new guidelines on how lawyers and companies should interpret Article 82, the European Union treaty article that covers the Microsoft decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by David Lawsky, editing by Will Waterman; Reuters messaging david.lawsky.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail david.lawsky@reuters.com; +322-287-6811.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - Investment portfolio
construction has gone through big changes in the last decade to
meet growing investor interest in "alternative" strategies such
as hedge funds, senior JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N) executives
said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A decade ago, a typical pension fund might invest 70
percent of their assets in equities and 30 percent in fixed
income instruments. Now a model portfolio might include as much
as half its assets in alternative assets, according to James
Staley, chief executive of JPMorgan Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While there is no one-size-fits-all portfolio, alternatives
-- which also include real estate, private equity and
structured products -- are clearly attracting exponentially
more interest among pension funds as a diversification
strategy, Staley said at a New York news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said a new model was emerging that calls for investing
about 20 percent of assets into hedge funds, 15 percent into
"hard assets" like private equity and real estate, and another
15 percent into structured notes such as collateralized debt
obligations. The remainder would be in long-only equities and
fixed income funds, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such a strategy, Staley said, is attracting more pension
funds investors looking for diversification, consistent returns
with lower volatility than the standard 70-30 stock-bond
portfolio. University endowments and foundations spearheaded
such strategies in past years but now many more public and
private pension funds are adopting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is one of the top providers of alternative
investments with its $1.4 trillion asset management division.
It owns a majority stake in the $34 billion Highbridge Capital
Management LLC hedge fund, runs some $50 billion in real estate
and infrastructure investments, $13.7 billion in private
equity, $300 billion in mutual funds and retail assets and
another $30 billion in its private banking division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But experts have long said alternatives are becoming less
alternative and more mainstream as an investment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As the number of alternative asset classes proliferate, it
has certainly worked its way into asset allocation strategies"
for institutional investors, said Robert Hering, consultant
with Cogent Alternative Strategies, which advises pension funds
and others on hedge fund investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hering argues that hedge funds, with more than a dozen
broad classes of strategies, are not really an asset class, but
a myriad of different and sometimes-opaque strategies that
makes a portfolio manager's job more challenging than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, like other banks such as UBS and Goldman Sachs,
now offer services to make it easier for institutional funds,
wealthy individuals and others to invest in alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Douglas Wurth, CEO of JPMorgan Private Bank's Alternative
Investments Group, said small- to mid-sized investors typically
are concerned that they cannot access the top-performing hedge
and private equity funds, and that the fund manager will not
listen to them even if they can get into a fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such concerns, Wurth said, can be mitigated by pooling
investments through JPMorgan, similar to a fund of funds
strategy. "We aggregate and collect these commitments and have
influence with the managers," Wurth said.

&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada has denied a visa to South African anti-apartheid leader Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who was to be the keynote speaker at a fund-raising gala in Toronto on Tuesday, because of her criminal record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madikizela-Mandela, the ex-wife of former South African President Nelson Mandela, had packed her bags and was about to set out for the airport when the Canadian embassy notified her that she would not be allowed to enter the country, organizers of the Toronto event said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No reason was given," said Carole Adrianns, event director for MusicaNoir, an organization that raises awareness about Africa through cultural projects. "The Mandela family was very, very confident that they were getting the visa," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official in Ottawa would not comment on Madikizela-Mandela's particular case but said people with past criminal convictions are usually not allowed into the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madikizela-Mandela was convicted in 1991 in the murder of a 14-year-old township activist. Her six-year jail term was reduced to a fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some people who are deemed inadmissible to come to Canada for a number of reasons, including that they've been convicted of a serious crime," said Marina Wilson, a media relations official at Citizenship and Immigration Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 70-year-old Madikizela-Mandela rose to heroine status as a fearsome opponent of South Africa's apartheid regime. But her reputation was tarnished after revelations about the violent activities of the group of supporters she had formed called "The Mandela United Football Team".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courts ruled she was involved in the murder of the teenaged boy, whose body was found near her home with his throat cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also had a public falling-out with her husband after he formed a new government in 1995. They were divorced a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she still remains a symbol for many because of her battle against apartheid while Nelson Mandela languished in jail for 27 years until his historic release in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madikizela-Mandela had just been to New York on May 19 to receive an award for her work on AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Toronto event Madikizela-Mandela was to attend will include excerpts from a multimedia opera about her life, called "The Passion of Winnie", a creation of composer Bongani Ndodana-Breen, and filmmaker Warren Wilensky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Scott Haggett&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta, June 5 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (XOM.N) and
Enbridge Inc. (ENB.N) (ENB.TO) said on Tuesday they will work
together to develop a new oil pipeline to carry about 400,000
barrels of crude a day from the Midwest to refineries on the
U.S. Gulf Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pipeline would transport U.S. and Canadian crude oil
from Patoka, Illinois, to Beaumont, Texas, and onward to
refineries around Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposal is one of a number of new pipelines under
construction or planned by Enbridge and its rivals to carry
burgeoning output from Canada's oil sands to new markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The oil sands contain an estimate 174 billion barrels of
recoverable reserves, a resource second in size only to Saudi
Arabia. Production from the oil sands region in northern
Alberta is expected to reach close to 3 million barrels a day
by 2015, about triple current production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Traditional markets for Western Canada (crudes) ... aren't
expanding quickly enough," said Enbridge Executive
Vice-President Richard Bird. "Hence the need to move further
and further afield."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enbridge, Canada's No. 2 pipeline company, said the two
companies will not finalize the size and cost of the pipeline
until talks with potential shippers are wrapped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However Bird said the two firms expect there to be a need
for at least a 400,000 barrel a day line, using 30-inch
diameter pipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've had preliminary, informal discussions with a number
of shippers, both producers and refiners... There is good
interest," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies already control a pipeline right-of-way
between Patoka and the Gulf, with an Enbridge line running from
the Illinois refining center to Cushing, Oklahoma, where
Exxon's Pegasus line to Nederland, Texas, begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is expected to  complete by the end of 2010 at
the earliest.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) on Tuesday abandoned its forecast for any interest rate cuts this year, adding that it sees none in 2008 either, citing tightness in the labor market and expectations for stronger economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, the bank's economics research team expected three quarters of a percentage point of cuts in benchmark U.S. interest rates this year by the Federal Reserve's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, beginning at the September FOMC meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's decision came a day after a similar forecast change by Merrill Lynch MER.N .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mmhhh, crow," Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman, said in a note to clients, referring to the adage of eating crow when one is proven wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the economy has slowed and inflation moderated in line with our forecasts over the past few quarters, we've been very surprised at the stability of the unemployment rate," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's economics research team said the absence of any tangible evidence of rising unemployment makes it unlikely that Fed officials will cut the funds rate target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed's benchmark overnight target lending rate, the federal funds rate, stands at 5.25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's team said they have boosted their estimates for real GDP growth on an annual basis in the second and third quarters of this year to 3 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Previous estimates were for 2 percent for both quarters. The group said it raised real growth estimates "on accumulating evidence of an impending rebound in manufacturing output."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's move comes a day after Merrill Lynch slashed its expectations for a rate cut this year, reducing its call for 2007 from 100 basis points of cuts to none. The firm cited its revised view on the Fed's persistent hawkish inflation stance and a recent string of stronger-than-expected data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co announces that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted its motion for a reversal of the district court judgment in its patent infringement litigation with Pfizer (PFE) concerning amlodipine besylate. On Feb 22, 2007, the district court for the Western District of Pennsylvania had ruled in favor of Pfizer and Mylan immediately appealed and has continued to fully expect a reversal of the decision. The co was able to launch its amlodipine products following a March 22, 2007 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that claims 1-3 of the amlodipine '303 patent were invalid. Amlodipine Besylate Tablets are the generic version of Pfizer's Norvasc Tablets, which had U.S. sales of approx $2.7 bln for the 12-month period ending Dec. 31, 2006, according to IMS Health.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) misled investors by overestimating the impact of stock-based compensation expenses on quarterly earnings in 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The securities regulator made the statement as it reached a settlement with International Business Machines Corp., in which the company agreed not to commit future disclosure violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC did not impose any monetary penalties and IBM, the world's largest technology services company, did not admit or deny the SEC's findings in the settlement announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM misled investors by failing to disclose information that would have allowed them to accurately determine the impact that the company's decision to expense stock options would have on its financial results," SEC Associate Director of Enforcement Scott W. Friestad said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The facts here are particularly troubling because the disclosure decision was driven, in part, by management's perception of how the news would be interpreted by analysts," Friestad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an April 5, 2005, conference call, IBM led analysts to believe that the company expected stock option expenses to reduce first-quarter earnings by 14 cents per share and to reduce full-year earnings by 55 cents per share, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, however, actually expected stock options expenses to reduce earnings by only 10 cents per share in the first quarter and by only 39 cents for the full year, the SEC found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's first-quarter earnings, reported nine days after the conference call, fell short of average analysts' estimates by 5 cents per share, a big miss for the company. Some analysts later complained that IBM, in effect, had led them to believe that the stock options' impact would be larger than it actually was, disguising the magnitude of the earnings shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said IBM had wanted the gap in its stock options expense estimates to offset a previously announced, unrelated increase in pension expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM did not want analysts to reduce their estimates for the stock option expenses because it would have increased their expected growth rate for the company, which would have been hard to achieve because of the pension expense, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By engaging in this conduct, IBM violated the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws," the SEC said in its order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC order contains no finding that IBM had committed securities fraud or violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, IBM said in a separate statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An SEC enforcement agent said the two sides had had discussions over several months before reaching the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of IBM of Armonk, New York, fell 47 cents, or 0.44 percent, at $105.76 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Rachelle Younglai in Washington)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Tuesday
abandoned its forecast for 75 basis points of benchmark U.S.
interest rate cuts this year because of tightness in the labor
market and expectations for stronger economic growth in the
second and third quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Previously, we expected 75 basis points of rate cuts,
beginning at the September FOMC meeting," the bank's economics
research team wrote in a note to clients. "However, although
real (gross domestic product) growth has slowed as anticipated,
the absence of any tangible evidence of rising unemployment
makes it unlikely that Fed officials will cut the funds rate
target."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The Federal Reserve's benchmark overnight target lending
rate is 5.25 percent.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co. (PG.N) said on Tuesday that it still expected to meet its financial forecasts for the current quarter, easing worries that sales might slow down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company, whose products include Gillette razors, Pampers diapers and Tide laundry detergent, said it should earn 64 cents to 66 cents per share in its fourth quarter, which ends in late June. Analysts on average expect profit of 66 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the company's forecast still suggests that its profit could miss Wall Street's expectations, investors were pleased with the affirmation, sending shares of PG up slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view the reiteration of both sales and profit outlooks as a positive," Morgan Stanley analyst Bill Pecoriello wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecoriello, who rates the stock "overweight," said the reiteration should help abate investor concern about a potential slowdown in sales because of tough comparisons, increased spending by competitors and soft demand for PG products in U.S. stores tracked by research firms early in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cincinnati-based PG said it expected sales to rise 6 percent to 7 percent in the quarter. It still expects organic sales, which exclude mergers and the impact of foreign exchange, to rise 5 percent to 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given tough (comparisons), this is as much as the market hoped for," Bank of America equity analyst April Scee wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scee, who rates PG shares at "buy," said the company's affirmed outlook increased her confidence in her earnings estimate of 66 cents per share and organic sales growth of 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early May, PG said it would soon end its long-time practice of giving such midquarter updates after many long-term shareholders said the announcements created greater short-term stock volatility and did not have strategic value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change will take effect in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most major U.S. consumer products companies that present financial forecasts typically only give updates when they report results, unless a situation calls for a major revision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of PG, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, were up 52 cents at $63.71 in late-morning New York Stock Exchange trade. Through Monday, the stock had fallen 4.7 percent from a 52-week high of $66.30 hit in mid-January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company plans to release full quarterly results on August 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Releads with new lawsuit, adds byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Camillus Eboh and Mike Oboh &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ABUJA/KANO, Nigeria, June 4 (Reuters) - Nigeria filed new charges against Pfizer (PFE.N) on Monday, seeking $6.95 billion in damages over the deaths of children who received an unapproved drug during a meningitis epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The suit came after a separate court delayed two cases until July in which Pfizer is accused by the northern state of Kano of harming Nigerian children by testing them with the antibiotic Trovan in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Although the Kano state government case has been running for more than two years, Monday was the first time the federal government filed its own charges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nigeria alleged in papers filed at a Federal High Court in the capital Abuja that Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, did not obtain approval from the relevant regulatory agencies and acted unethically when it tested the antibiotic in Kano. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The plaintiff contends that the defendant never obtained approval of the relevant regulatory agencies ... nor did the defendant seek or receive approval to conduct any clinical trial at any time before their illegal conduct," Nigeria said in court papers obtained by Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    After taking preliminary arguments from counsels to both parties, Justice Babs Kuewumi adjourned the case to June 26 for further hearing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer denies the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Pfizer spokesman in New York, Bryant Haskins, reiterated comments the company had already made, that its clinical trial of Trovan was conducted with the full knowledge of the Nigerian government and in a responsible and ethical way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "These allegations against Pfizer, which are not new, are highly inflammatory and not based on all the facts," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We continue to maintain, in the strongest terms, that the Nigerian government was fully informed in advance of the clinical trial; that the trial was conducted appropriately, ethically and with the best interests of patients in mind; and that it helped save lives." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      Kano state government has filed criminal charges and a civil lawsuit seeking $2.075 billion in damages from Pfizer over the tests, which it alleges caused the deaths of some children and permanent health problems for others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SOCIAL MISGIVINGS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nigeria is seeking $500 million being the amount the government says it spent on treatment, compensation and support for the Trovan victims and their families, and $450 million on public enlightenment to erase social misgivings that arose from the ill-fated tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The government says it spent $1 billion on a health programme that failed because of the misgivings caused by the Trovan tests, while it is claiming $5 billion in general damages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The cases in Kano were due to come up for hearing on Monday at a state high court but no representative of Pfizer was present in court. The judge adjourned the civil case to July 4 and the criminal case to July 9. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The legal dispute has been going on for years. A U.S. federal judge in 2005 dismissed a lawsuit that accused Pfizer of not properly warning Nigerian families about the risk of Trovan, saying it should be heard in a Nigerian court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer has said the clinical trial was conducted "in a responsible and ethical way consistent with the company's abiding commitment to patient safety". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said that at the time of the meningitis outbreak, Trovan was in late-stage development and had been evaluated in 5,000 patients.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Trovan for adult use in 1997 but did not approve the drug for use by American children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Writing by Tume Ahemba; editing by Myra MacDonald; Lagos newsroom tel: +234 1 463 0257))   Keywords: NIGERIA PFIZER/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) said on
Tuesday it has hired Mariafrancesca Carli from rival Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) to join its European sponsors group to boost its
work with infrastructure investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Carli, who has worked at Goldman Sachs since 1992, will join
the bank in July and report to Larry Slaughter, head of J.P.
Morgan's European financial sponsors group, which advises
private equity firms.
  She will be responsible for client coverage of
infrastructure-related companies at the bank, which in April
hired Martin Bradley and Neale Marvin to lead its European
infrastructure finance business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The bank is making the move as buyout firms and other
financial investors such as Australia's Macquarie Bank Limited
increasingly look to buy into infrastructure assets such as
water companies, roads and power distribution networks.
Among such assets that have recently come onto the market in
recent days are UK regional utility Southern Water, which
sources familiar with the matter have said Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS.L) is putting up for sale, as well as United
Utilities Plc's (UU.L) power distribution business.

Fantastic Four to the Hulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Stan has so many fantastic new ideas for films, and we 
can't wait to get started," said Oren Aviv, president of 
production at Walt Disney Studios. "Stan Lee is a living legend 
in the world of pop culture, and his characters and stories 
have been the inspiration for some of Hollywood's biggest 
blockbusters. We're very excited to be working with him and his 
talented team in creating some incredible new motion picture 
experiences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A major component of the agreement is home entertainment. 
Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment president Bob Chapek was 
instrumental in bringing the deal to Disney. Chapek will work 
closely with Lee on many of his projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(We) feel very fortunate to be collaborating with him on a 
wide range of new projects for all divisions of our company," 
Chapek said. "His track record is impressive by any measure, 
and (the home entertainment unit) is sure to benefit from his 
creations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee made his first non-Marvel venture at the height of the 
dot-com boom with Stan Lee Media, with the intent of creating 
superheroes for the Internet. The venture collapsed, however, 
amid a stock manipulation scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee, who was never implicated, created POW! in 2005. The 
venture so far has produced a Sci Fi Channel movie as well as 
two direct-to-DVD movies, "Mosaic" and "The Condor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also created the 2003 Spike TV cartoon series 
"Stripperella," featuring the voice talent of Pamela Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in LG Electronics Inc. (066570.KS) rose more than 4 percent on Thursday to their highest in more than a year after news of a cross-patent deal with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) on hardware and software products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LG Electronics shares had already surged in early morning trade ahead of the official announcement out at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT) amid market speculation about the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LG Electronics rose as much as 5.2 percent to a session high of 74,500 won, its highest since May 2006.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail on Symonds, background on 2005 CEO succession) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) said on Wednesday Chief Financial Officer Jon Symonds, who lost out in an earlier race for the CEO job, would leave the company at the end of July to join investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The move marks a new blow for the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, which has suffered a series of setbacks with experimental medicines and has struggled to regain investor confidence by  acquiring biotech companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I regret Jon's decision to leave AstraZeneca, however, the move to Goldman Sachs represents an exciting career challenge," AstraZeneca Chairman Louis Schweitzer said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    AstraZeneca said an external search was underway to find a successor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Symonds joined Zeneca in 1997 and within months was involved in the merger negotiations with Sweden's Astra. He quickly won respect from industry analysts and adopted a higher profile in running the business than many drug firm finance directors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    His high reputation meant he was seen as a potential contender for the top position at AstraZeneca to replace Tom McKillop as chief executive two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the end, however, he was passed over in favour of U.S. operations head David Brennan, who was appointed chief executive-designate in mid-2005. Brennan formally took over as CEO at the start of 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ((Reporting by Ben Hirschler and Mark Potter, email: ben.hirschler@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: ben.hirschler.reuters.com@reuters.net; +44 20 7542 5082))   Keywords: ASTRAZENECA CFO/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. is creating a virtual teenager hangout like MySpace and Facebook, only on cell phones, to lure more youngsters to its sodas and flavored drinks, starting in the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eyeing the success of mostly desktop computer-bound teen social sites run by media companies, like News Corp's MySpace, the world biggest soft drink maker said on Wednesday it was creating a cell-phone network under its Sprite brand where members can set up profiles, post pictures and meet new friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke, part of a growing group of advertisers putting ad campaigns on cell phones, will make the U.S. site available to Web-ready phones on June 22. It launched in China last week and is eyeing other markets in regions like Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Coca-Cola Company needs to continue to recruit future generations of consumers," said Mark Greatrex, senior vice president of marketing for Coca-Cola. "Mobile marketing is absolutely where it's at for us going forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySpace, the leading teen social site, is available on some cell phones. But its nearly 67 million monthly unique visitors in the United States mostly access the site on computers, as Web use on cell phones has been hampered by small screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke hopes to overcome such mobile Web barriers by tailoring the format of the service to be used more easily on cell phones and by offering free content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not give financial details on the cost of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke will also use the site to promote Sprite through free music and video clips to visitors who type in a pin number found under bottle lids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lemon-lime-flavored Sprite trails Coca-Cola in popularity, the company chose this brand for its mobile venture because of its appeal to teenagers. It said it may expand the service to other brands as well as create related desktop Internet sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankee Group has forecast the mobile advertising market to more than quadruple to $275 million in 2007 and eventually increase to $2.2 billion in 2010, up from an estimated $60 million in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some media experts have said the mobile advertising market could be worth as much as $5 billion in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke said it worked with the top U.S. wireless providers on the service and is in touch with other social networks such as Facebook about expanding its experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One potential issue is how to keep children safe from predatory adults. MySpace has faced lawsuits and negotiated guidelines with legal authorities over protecting its teen members from convicted sex offenders posing as youngsters online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That certainly is a priority," said Sprite global brand director Denis Sison when asked how the mobile social network, Sprite Yard, would protect its members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sison said the site would be monitored to make sure inappropriate photos and video were not posted, while conversations would also be screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site would encourage members not to share their cell phone numbers and would only add a person to another's friend list on an opt-in basis, Sison said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said it expects sales of its Windows Mobile program in the Asia-Pacific region to jump by over 75 percent in the business year to June, helped by closer ties with wireless carriers and device makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which lags behind leader Symbian Ltd in the mobile software market, is eyeing demand for high-data applications as the line between consumer gadgets and PCs blurs, Tony Mestres, general manager of Microsoft's mobile business, said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unit shipment (growth) in Asia will exceed 75 percent this fiscal year, and that's a comfortable number," Mestres told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday, without giving a revenue figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is keen to raise mobile software sales in Asia, which are currently less than one percent of total revenue, as it tries to catch up with Symbian's operating system used in high-end models made by Nokia (NOK1V.HE), LG Electronics (066570.KS) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One challenge for Microsoft has been Japan, where carriers selling low-priced phones can read documents or Web pages without Windows Mobile, and where Symbian software is used on many handsets from top mobile phone operator NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft has made inroads. Softbank Corp. (9984.T), Japan's third-largest wireless carrier, released two handsets with Microsoft's Windows Mobile software in May. Smaller carrier Willcom Inc. plans to release its newest handset on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in talks with all key players in Japan's wireless (market)," Mestres said. Device makers that have put Windows on their smartphones include Toshiba Corp. (6502.T) and Sharp Corp. (6753.T), he said. "We're on the right track."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which hopes more users will want to synchronize their cell phones with their Windows-based PCs, expects unit shipments of Windows Mobile to double in the year ending June 2008 to 20 million units, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 0.46 percent to $30.58 at its latest close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Italian oil refiner Saras (SRS.MI) is considering a possible purchase of French refineries being offered for sale by oil majors Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the company's general manager said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There's been talk of possible sales by the majors in the south of France, and we're looking at it," Dario Scaffardi told the Reuters Energy Summit in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell said in January it was investigating a possible sale of its French refineries and industry sources said Exxon was also examining a sale of its French assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaffardi said Saras could look at purchasing the companies' whole portfolio of French refineries or just their Mediterranean refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wouldn't be scared at looking at the whole thing or part of the thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell's Berre L'Etang refinery, which has a 126,000 barrel per day (bpd) capacity, and Exxon's 115,000 bpd Fos-sur-Mer refinery are located west of Marseille in southern France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saras is still among the shortlisted bidders in the sale of I.E.S., which owns a 57,000 bpd refinery in northern Italy and about 150 retail stations, Scaffardi said, adding the sellers would likely be heartened by the announcement on Wednesday of the sale of Italian refiner Tamoil at an enterprise value of 4 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was around twice the level Scaffardi said he had expected Libyan-controlled Tamoil to sell for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaffardi added that Saras was unlikely to bid for assets in the Balkans where governments are selling stakes in state refiners and that lack of availability made Spanish acquisitions unlikely too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds SEC statement, stock movement) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Philipp Gollner &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SAN FRANCISCO, June 5 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) misled investors by overestimating the impact of stock-based compensation expenses on quarterly earnings in 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The securities regulator made the statement as it reached a settlement with International Business Machines Corp., in which the company agreed not to commit future disclosure violations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The SEC did not impose any monetary penalties and IBM, the world's largest technology services company, did not admit or deny the SEC's findings in the settlement announcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "IBM misled investors by failing to disclose information that would have allowed them to accurately determine the impact that the company's decision to expense stock options would have on its financial results," SEC Associate Director of Enforcement Scott W. Friestad said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The facts here are particularly troubling because the disclosure decision was driven, in part, by management's perception of how the news would be interpreted by analysts," Friestad said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In an April 5, 2005, conference call, IBM led analysts to believe that the company expected stock option expenses to reduce first-quarter earnings by 14 cents per share and to reduce full-year earnings by 55 cents per share, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM, however, actually expected stock options expenses to reduce earnings by only 10 cents per share in the first quarter and by only 39 cents for the full year, the SEC found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM's first-quarter earnings, reported nine days after the conference call, fell short of average analysts' estimates by 5 cents per share, a big miss for the company. Some analysts later complained that IBM, in effect, had led them to believe that the stock options' impact would be larger than it actually was, disguising the magnitude of the earnings shortfall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The SEC said IBM had wanted the gap in its stock options expense estimates to offset a previously announced, unrelated increase in pension expenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM did not want analysts to reduce their estimates for the stock option expenses because it would have increased their expected growth rate for the company, which would have been hard to achieve because of the pension expense, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "By engaging in this conduct, IBM violated the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws," the SEC said in its order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The SEC order contains no finding that IBM had committed securities fraud or violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, IBM said in a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    An SEC enforcement agent said the two sides had had discussions over several months before reaching the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of IBM of Armonk, New York, fell 47 cents, or 0.44 percent, at $105.76 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Rachelle Younglai in Washington) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;An ABC News spokesman said the report was "not true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper reported that ABC News would pick up a minority stake in the venture and provide technical support, the paper quoted sources as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UTV Software, whose businesses include film and television production as well as gaming and animation, was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are exploring various opportunities for our television content business in India and Asia Pacific and have nothing to announce at the moment," the paper quoted an ABC representative as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs told the Merrill Lynch media conference in London on Thursday that the company's priorities for investing capital were in developing content, the mobile sector, and making selected acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs also said Disney plans to spend "in the neighborhood of $100 million in film development outside the U.S." in the next two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney Channel has given 
the series go-ahead to "Imagination Movers," a show for the 
preschool-targeted "Playhouse Disney" daily programming block 
that stars the New Orleans-based music group of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In addition, the group, whose music videos have been airing 
on Disney Channel since the fall, has signed with Walt Disney 
Records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Movers," which will include music performances, stories 
and skits, is intended to emphasize creative problem-solving 
skills and introduce "high-energy" rock music to kids. It will 
feature the band members as "everyday guy" brainstormers 
working hard to solve "idea emergencies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The band, now on tour, comprises former journalist Rich 
Collins, former teacher Scott Durbin, architect Dave Poche and 
Scott "Smitty" Smith, a New Orleans firefighter who was a

&lt;p&gt; (Adds JPMorgan comment, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By George Georgiopoulos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATHENS, June 7 (Reuters) - Greek pension funds turned down
on Thursday an offer by investment bank JP Morgan to buy back a
Greek government structured bond at the heart of a scandal
rocking the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said its proposal was rejected and was now off the
table while funds said the deal did not cover interest they
would have earned otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We can confirm that the pension funds rejected our proposed
and generous offer," JP Morgan spokesman Michael Golden told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, JP Morgan and London-based brokerage North Asset
Management agreed to buy back the structured Greek government
paper, which ministers have said was sold to pension funds at a
high price, prompting an investigation by the prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the government, which had hoped a buyback deal would
take the affair off centre stage, the setback means the headache
remains. Opinion polls show the scandal is hurting its
popularity as elections loom, possibly as early as this autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This will give the political opposition more room to keep
jabbing," said a fund manager who declined to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INTEREST SOUGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan had offered to buy back the bond at the price it
was sold, compensating Greek pension funds for the full amount
paid minus any interest payments they have received. Its offer
expired June 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We counter-proposed to be compensated for foregone interest
had the money been placed with the central bank but this was not
accepted so the deal is off," said George Kotzamanoglou, a board
member at TEAPOKA, which handles public sectors workers' pension
funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pension funds said they did not take up JP Morgan's
offer to reverse the deal because this would mean giving up
interest earned on the bond so far and the bank refused to match
the minimum interest they would have earned from a central bank
deposit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 280 million euro, 12-year bond with an initial coupon of
6.25 percent was underwritten by JP Morgan in February. It
changed hands several times before ending up with state pension
funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TEAPOKA, which bought 80 million euros of the structured
bond, said funds would hold on to the bonds for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have no other route to follow other than to hold the
bond and collect high interest for the first two years,"
Kotzamanoglou said. "After that we will consider our next move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the findings of the prosecutor investigating the case
still awaited, the government has moved to revamp the regulatory
framework of how pension funds invest their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, new Labour Minister Vassilis Maginas submitted
a bill in parliament, limiting pension fund investments in
structured bonds to just 2 percent of their assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bill allows funds to invest up to 23 of their assets in
other higher risk instruments in Greece and, for the first time,
in the rest of the eurozone.

"While we are very pleased with the positive momentum shown in April and May, we are wary of the future effect of newly restrictive visa requirements imposed by the central government in China which have, in the past few weeks, restricted visitation to Macau from Guangdong province.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Citywire) - JPM European Fledgling Investment Trust achieved a 23.34 percent rise in net asset value for the 12 months to March 31 after a reduction in stock holdings and a tilt away from construction stocks towards support service companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL, June 7 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Asset Management expects
to launch three funds in South Korea next month to raise a
combined $500 million, its first foray into the country's booming
$270 billion fund management market, executives said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Asset, managing about $1.05 trillion in assets as a
unit of JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), launched its business in South
Korea on Thursday, becoming the 50th asset manager in Asia's
second-biggest fund management market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That comes after its Indian unit was set up earlier this
year, a country in which JPMorgan Asset has invested 6 trillion
won ($6.5 billion) in the form of fund portfolios, compared with
5 trillion won of its equities funds investing in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market will grow by a low double digit if you look at a
five year or 10 year's growth trends," Clive Brown, CEO of
JPMorgan's international asset management business, told a news
conference, referring to South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "[We see] half of a billion assets ($500 million) in a year
or two years' time with the launch of three funds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to elaborate on its growth target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Seoul shares .KS11 on a roll setting a series of
records, JPMorgan Asset plans to launch three specialist funds
for domestic investors initially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They consist of a Korea Equity fund investing in 30 large-cap
stocks, an Asia Consumer/Infra fund focusing on 50 stocks outside
Japan and South Korea, and a Middle East  Africa fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Asset, wholly owned by the Wall Street bank, has
arrived as a number of other global players have just bought
domestic rivals or are preparing to open their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs (GS.N) agreed to acquire a small asset manager
majority owned by Australia's Macquarie Bank MBL.AX in May,
followed by Swiss bank UBS AG's (UBSN.VX) (UBS.N) deal to buy 51
percent of a fund management firm for $195 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dutch ING Group (ING.AS) (ING.N) also has been named the
preferred buyer of an asset management firm in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main driver of global asset managers' interest in South
Korea is the introduction of a mandatory pension savings scheme,
set to cover all local companies by 2010 and the rapid growth in
millionaire creation, as well as tax exemptions on gains from
investment funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brown dismissed the possibility that JPMorgan Asset would buy
into a domestic rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have no current plans to buy any asset managers or merge
with asset management companies in Korea. We plan to grow
organically," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan had been in talks with South Korea's top lender
Kookmin Bank 060000.KS to form an asset management joint
venture, and then negotiated to buy a majority of No. 4 lender
Hana Financial Group's (086790.KS) fund management unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toby Cha, who leads the South Korean unit, blamed disputes
over how to share profits with its domestic partner for the
failure of the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cha said the current bull run in South Korean shares has been
driven by previously underperforming stocks such as builders and
machinery makers. He expected the local stock markets to gain
fresh momentum next year, led by IT stocks and with private
spending seen picking up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, JPMorgan cautions about a short-term overheating
in Vietnam, citing a lack of liquidity and capacity of the local
stock market.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Manhattan federal judge has ordered Visa USA to stop charging a special fee that penalized debit card issuers for jumping to smaller rival MasterCard Inc. (MA.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of MasterCard, which had been up 2 percent, rose an additional 3.5 percent after the company issued an afternoon statement about the ruling. They closed up $4.17, or 3 percent, at $143.58 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Barbara Jones agreed with a court-appointed adviser that Visa's "settlement service fee" was anti-competitive. She ordered Visa to allow any of its top 100 debit card issuers to terminate its agreement with the card association, so long as the issuer separately agreed to issue MasterCard debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa had been charging the fee to issuers that moved their portfolios to MasterCard. The fee was intended to cover part of Visa's $2 billion settlement in 2003 of a antitrust class-action lawsuit by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) and other retailers. MasterCard settled that case for $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears to be a major win for MasterCard's domestic debit business, which trails Visa by a significant margin, but has now been presented with a golden opportunity to capture some of Visa's top customers," wrote Calyon Securities analyst Craig Maurer. He rates MasterCard "add."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones wrote that "because banks make the brand-switching decision 'at the margin,' the settlement service fee is large enough in relation to MasterCard's incentive package to effectively prevent a bank from switching."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Vice President Rosetta Jones said her card association is studying the ruling and may appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a significant win," MasterCard General Counsel Noah Hanft said in a statement.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds suspension of shares, details, comment) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Marie-Louise Gumuchian &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MILAN, June 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Mediobanca (MDBI.MI) have offered to help troubled Italease BIL.MI, Italy's biggest leasing company, by injecting capital or restructuring its derivatives portfolio or both. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Italease, which announced the offer on Friday, welcomed the proposal from the U.S. bank and Italian bank after its stock starting falling last week and its chief executive resigned due to a big exposure to derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The shares plunged an additional 13 percent on Friday to 23 euros and was later suspended limit down. At 1441 GMT, the stock was indicated down 24.59 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The market fears the idea of a capital increase," one trader said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A capital increase could dilute the value of Italease stock, and the company said it could lead to the banks' acquisition of a stake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "(Italease's) board has mandated the chairman to effect an in-depth review of the proposals received," the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts have said Italease would need a capital increase and one-off provisions worth at least 200 million euros ($268.5 million) to address its derivative-linked woes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Italease's troubles began late last week when it said its credit exposure to customers involved in derivative instruments  had nearly doubled to 400 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    EXPOSURE RISES &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In Friday's statement, Italease said it had paid 192 million euros to close some hedging instruments held by customers. In this case, it said its customers had a potential exposure to Italease of about 235 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Another batch of contracts entailed a potential exposure of about 365 million euros, it said, adding that it was evaluating the possibility of arranging for closing out the hedging instruments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The news is not good," said John Raymond at Credit Sights in a research note, explaining that the overall amount of exposure had risen to about 600 million euros from the initially reported 400 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It is not yet clear how these items will affect the bank's first-half income statement," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Italease also said it had named Massimo Mazzega, a senior manager with Cassa di Risparmio di Venezia, as its new chief executive to replace Massimo Faenza, who resigned on June 4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Faenza has been named in an investigation into a bankruptcy involving Italian real estate developer Danilo Coppola. Faenza has denied having anything to do with the issues at the centre of the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Italease's troubles have dragged down shares in Italian bank Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara BPVN.MI, its biggest shareholder with a 30.7 percent stake. They were down 2.73 percent at 20.66 euros after touching a year low of 20.30 euros. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Italease has an 18 percent market share in Italy in terms of volume, slightly ahead of the leasing arm of Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) and Locat, which is part of UniCredit (CRDI.MI), according to Italease slides. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Additional reporting by Lisa Jucca and Gianluca Semeraro) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;((Editing by Jane Baird; Milan newsroom +39 02 66129 695, elisabetta.jucca@reuters.com)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.7449 Euro) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, NEW YORK dateline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores Inc. (PLCE.O) said on Friday that it settled a dispute with a Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) unit regarding its license to operate the Disney Store retail chain in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As part of the deal, Children's Place said it is developing a new prototype for the Disney stores and will obtain Disney's approval of the prototype this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The retailer said it will remodel 234 existing stores into the new store prototype by Jan. 31, 2012. It will also open at least 18 new Disney stores using the new store prototype by early 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In addition, Children's Place will complete a "maintenance refresh" program in about 165 Disney stores, including the flagship store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, no later than June 30, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the dispute, Disney had alleged that Children's Place committed 120 "uncured material breaches" of its license agreement to operate the stores, meaning Disney could have terminated the agreement. The alleged breaches mainly related to store remodeling and maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Children's Place said its board has approved spending $175 million between now and Jan. 31, 2012 for the store maintenance and renovation program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The companies also agreed to reduce the restrictions on Disney to grant direct merchandising licenses to other specialty retail store chains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Children's Place did not return phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Ankur Relia in Bangalore) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Nicole Maestri in New York; editing by John Wallace; Reuters Messaging: nicole.maestri.reuters.com@reuters.net; (646) 223-6173)) Keywords: CHILDRENSPLACE DISNEY/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Manhattan federal judge has ordered Visa USA to stop charging a special fee that penalized debit card issuers for jumping to smaller rival MasterCard Inc. (MA.N), sending the latter's shares higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge Barbara Jones agreed with a special master that the fee, which related to a 2003 class-action settlement of antitrust claims against the card associations by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) and other retailers, was anti-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears to be a major win for MasterCard's domestic debit business, which trails Visa by a significant margin, but has now been presented with a golden opportunity to capture some of Visa's top customers," wrote Calyon Securities analyst Craig Maurer. He rates MasterCard "add."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa had been charging "settlement service fee" to any of its 100 largest debit issuers that moved its portfolio to MasterCard. The fee was to represent the issuer's share of Visa's remaining obligations under the settlement. Visa had settled for $2 billion and MasterCard for $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because banks make the brand-switching decision 'at the margin,' the settlement service fee is large enough in relation to MasterCard's incentive package to effectively prevent a bank from switching," Jones wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge also required Visa to allow any issuer that agreed to the fee to terminate its agreement, so long as the issuer entered into an agreement to issue MasterCard debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a significant win," MasterCard General Counsel Noah Hanft said in a statement. "With this roadblock out of the way, financial institutions (can) make decisions based on their best judgment about quality of service, strength of brand and other competitive factors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Vice President Rosetta Jones said her card association is studying the ruling and may appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2003 settlement related to claims that retailers incurred billions of dollars of processing costs to meet card association requirements that they accept signature-verified debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard is based in Purchase, New York, and Visa in San Francisco. MasterCard conducted its initial public offering in May 2006. Visa last October said it planned to go public within 12 to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of MasterCard, which had been up 2 percent, rose an additional 3.5 percent after the company issued an afternoon statement about the ruling. They closed up $4.17, or 3 percent, at $143.58 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) will triple the amount of money it spends developing video games to benefit from strong growth prospects in the global market, the entertainment company's chief financial officer said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are ramping up our investment in video games ... It is a market where there is real opportunity," Disney's CFO Tom Staggs told journalists during a briefing in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the entertainment company's strategy centers on making sure hit products sell strongly across the business, irrespective of whether they start as a film, product or game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney spent around $100 million on gaming development last year and will spend $130 million this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the next five years or so we are ramping up to about a pace of $350 million per year in video game investment, principally consoles and handhelds," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market researcher Screen Digest forecasts the particularly cyclical global gaming software market will be worth $21.3 billion in 2009, compared with $20.2 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a particularly fast-growing area is so-called massively multiple player online gaming (MMOG), which is expected to see subscription revenues jump from $875 million last year to $1.4 billion in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The potential to make profits in that space if you have a hit game is significant," said Screen Digest gaming analyst Piers Harding-Rolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs said Disney created a "Pirates of the Caribbean" game to coincide with the release of the latest film, which became a hit across gaming platforms in the UK, France and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later this year, Disney plans to launch a multi-player online Pirates game in the U.S., then in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are early on in the process of developing a video gaming capability," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months ago, Disney launched "Spectrobes", a role-playing game for Nintendo's 7974.OS hand-held DS player produced by the company's Interactive Studios arm that has shipped about 700,000 units, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The galactic action adventure game was developed for Disney by Japan-based Jupiter Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am comfortable that it warrants a sequel in the games business. We would like to see video games become a vibrant creative venture," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has been positioning itself more aggressively in the gaming market over the past year, and late last year launched a games studio to focus on creating new and Disney-inspired titles for Nintendo's DS player and Wii console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs said around 70 percent of development spend in video games in the near future would be on established content franchises, with the rest in areas where Disney hopes to create intellectual property it can exploit across the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile gaming applications were part of this, though this area was primarily being pursued "quite aggressively" within the company's Internet business, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs said 90 percent of Disney's development efforts across gaming, including mobile, fall under the Disney brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this is traditionally done on a license basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not that we have no position in the market, it is that as a developer and publisher our activities have been very limited. But to the extent that we are successful in creating games as a publisher ... there is substantially more economic upside to the company," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFO said Disney's gaming aspirations did not imply the company wanted to "go flying into the teeth" of competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading players in this area include Electronic Arts ERTS.O, the world's largest video game publisher, and Ubisoft (UBIP.PA), Europe's second-largest video games publisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we are doing is trying very deliberately to develop our core capabilities in video games content development, leveraging what already exists in the Disney brand," said Staggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney already has a licensing partnership in its ESPN sports network with Electronic Arts to create video gaming sports titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the Disney-branded titles we thought we could maximize our success going it alone," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs said Disney was also exploring opportunities for gaming initiatives in virtual worlds such as Second Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can serve a real consumer desire to delve deeper into the worlds we create," he said, adding that such segments can play an important role in keeping users engaged in particular franchises over a sustained period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

"With this roadblock out of the way, financial institutions will not be deterred by this coercive fee and can make decisions based on their best judgment about quality of service, strength of brand and other competitive factors that benefit their cardholders.

In addition to requiring that Visa repeal the SSF, Judge Jones also issued an order allowing all of Visa's top 100 debit issuers, with Visa debit agreements that were signed while the SSF was in place, to terminate such agreements in the event that they enter into a new agreement with MasterCard to issue debit cards on MasterCard's network.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATHENS, June 8 (Reuters) - Greece offered on Friday to pay
interest to state pension funds in a move to facilitate a deal
between them and JP Morgan to buy back a structured bond at the
heart of a scandal rocking the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For the buyback of the 280 million euro bond there is
disagreement between pension funds and the bank (JP Morgan) on
the interest earned during the period the funds held the bond,"
the Labour Ministry said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Greece will cover the difference in case the two sides
reach an agreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, JP Morgan and London-based brokerage North Asset
Management agreed to buy back the structured Greek government
paper, which ministers have said was sold to pension funds at a
high price, prompting an investigation by a prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, JP Morgan (JPM.N) said Greek pension funds
turned down its offer to buy back the bond from the pension
funds at the price it was sold, minus the interest earned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The funds said they did not take the offer because it did
not cover interest they could have earned otherwise -- by
parking the money with a central bank deposit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The labour ministry statement said the government would pay
funds the rate of interest money earns in deposits with the Bank
of Greece (BOGr.AT), the country's central bank.

gaming capability," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three months ago, Disney launched "Spectrobes," a 
role-playing game for Nintendo's hand-held DS player produced 
by the company's Interactive Studios arm that has shipped about 
700,000 units, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The galactic action adventure game was developed for Disney 
by Japan-based Jupiter Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am comfortable that it warrants a sequel in the games 
business. We would like to see video games become a vibrant 
creative venture," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has been positioning itself more aggressively in the 
gaming market over the past year, and late last year launched a 
games studio to focus on creating new and Disney-inspired 
titles for Nintendo's DS player and Wii console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said around 70 percent of development spend in video 
games in the near future would be on established content 
franchises, with the rest in areas where Disney hopes to create 
intellectual property it can exploit across the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mobile gaming applications were part of this, though this 
area was primarily being pursued "quite aggressively" within 
the company's Internet business, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said 90 percent of Disney's development efforts 
across gaming, including mobile, fall under the Disney brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, this is traditionally done on a license basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is not that we have no position in the market, it is 
that as a developer and publisher our activities have been very 
limited. But to the extent that we are successful in creating 
games as a publisher ... there is substantially more economic 
upside to the company," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CFO said Disney's gaming aspirations did not imply the 
company wanted to "go flying into the teeth" of competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leading players in this area include Electronic Arts, the 
world's largest video game publisher, and Ubisoft, Europe's 
second-largest video games publisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What we are doing is trying very deliberately to develop 
our core capabilities in video games content development, 
leveraging what already exists in the Disney brand," said 
Staggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney already has a licensing partnership in its ESPN 
sports network with Electronic Arts to create video gaming 
sports titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the Disney-branded titles we thought we could maximize 
our success going it alone," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said Disney was also exploring opportunities for 
gaming initiatives in virtual worlds such as Second Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We can serve a real consumer desire to delve deeper into 
the worlds we create," he said, adding that such segments can 
play an important role in keeping users engaged in particular 
franchises over a sustained period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top antitrust official at the U.S. Justice Department last month backed Microsoft Corp. by urging state prosecutors to reject a confidential complaint filed by Google Inc., The New York Times reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google accused Microsoft of designing its Vista operating system to discourage use of Google's desktop search program, lawyers involved in the case told the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint, which is tied to a consent decree that monitors Microsoft's behavior, has not been made public by Google or the judge overseeing the consent decree, the article said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State officials told the newspaper that a memo by Thomas Barnett, an assistant attorney general, rejected the Google complaint, repeating legal arguments made by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article said the memo was sent to state attorneys general around the United States and alarmed many of them, with some state officials saying they believed Google's complaint had merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times said the action demonstrates that nearly a decade after the U.S. government began its landmark effort to break up Microsoft, the Bush administration has changed course by defending the company against accusations of anti-competitive conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradford Smith, the general counsel at Microsoft, told the Times that the company was unaware of the memo. He told the newspaper that Microsoft had not violated the consent decree and that it had already made modifications to Vista in response to concerns raised by Google and other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Google and the Justice Department could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge overseeing the consent decree is Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Scott Hillis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, June 11 (Reuters) - Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) is
introducing a version of its Safari Internet browser for
Windows, Chief Executive Steve Jobs said on Monday, taking on
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) in its key stronghold of Web access
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move by Apple, which has expanded beyond its Macintosh

could let the company control how large numbers of people use
the Web at a time when services and programs are increasingly

company's previous position that the device would not support
other software due to security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But investors were disappointed that Jobs -- known for his
surprise announcements -- did not have bigger news to unveil --
and Apple shares sank nearly 3.5 percent, their biggest one-day
fall in about four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Apple always hits a home run, and when they hit a triple,
it's a disappointment," said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper

the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The focus on Safari sets the stage for a new browser war
nearly a decade after Microsoft knocked off pioneering rival
Netscape by including Internet Explorer for free in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said Apple clearly hopes to replicate its success
in making a Windows version of its iTunes media program, a move
that helped drive sales of its iPod media players as well as
Mac computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soleil Equity Research analyst Shannon Cross said the
availability of Safari on Windows would boost popularity of the
software and encourage Web site creators to make their sites
compatible with the browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It should also help increase Apple's exposure to the
Windows community and potentially attract a larger audience of
switchers," Cross wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Addressing concerns that the iPhone would not support
programs not created by Apple, Jobs said independent developers
could write application software for Safari, which is included
in the multimedia device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's an innovative new way to create apps for mobile
devices ... and it gives us tremendous capability, more than
has ever been in a mobile device," Jobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ThinkEquity analyst Jonathan Hoopes said developers writing

&lt;p&gt;ANAHEIM, California (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. on Monday launched a "Finding Nemo" submarine ride with underwater animation at its Disneyland park, in an effort to use its Pixar film division to bolster theme park admissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney saw attendance at its parks rise to record levels the past two years as a result of its Disneyland 50th anniversary celebration, and was hoping that refreshing some older rides with Pixar themes will keep ticket sales strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said last year the company would invest a little more in its theme parks in fiscal 2007 than the previous year, especially around attractions derived from its Pixar animated films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had invested $396 million in its five parks and resorts in the first six months of fiscal 2007, compared with $344 million in the same period last year, according to financial filings. Disney's fiscal year begins October 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has said it will spend less than $1 billion in domestic parks capital expenditures this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Finding Nemo" Submarine Voyage takes riders on a 12-minute voyage through a luminous Australian barrier reef and a lost civilization to search for the clownfish made famous in the 2003 Pixar film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney used the bones and ships of the former Submarine Voyage attraction, which closed nine years ago, to design an updated underwater tour featuring original "Nemo" animation that appears to be projected onto water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eight 40-passenger submarines, built for the original 1959 ride, were painted yellow, switched from diesel to electric motors and outfitted with interior sound systems that synchronize with what is going on outside each porthole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passengers sit below the water line in the ship, which moves on a track in the Southern California park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMH Capital analyst David Miller on Monday estimated the "Finding Nemo" ride upgrade took Disney about three years and cost some $172 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Parks and Resorts Chairman Jay Rasulo said the company would continue to leverage Pixar titles for new attractions to bring in younger park-goers. Both Disneyland and Florida's Walt Disney World are set to open "Toy Story"-themed Midway Mania attractions later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There have been great stories coming out of Pixar that we would like to tell at the parks," Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division's research and development teams also are working to incorporate more wireless technology into enhance attractions, Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That effort started last month when both U.S. parks added wireless hotspots to let parkgoers access unique features of Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean" online game while in the parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kids today look for interactivity -- technology that is beyond what they can find in their (homes)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note to clients, Miller speculated that the Nemo ride could be the first in a series of new attractions at Disneyland's companion park, California Adventure, which has seen soft attendance since its 2001 opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasulo said Disney intends "to continue to fill out the entertainment in that park .... You can definitely look for further expansion and additional entertainment there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's shares edged down 6 cents to $34.14 on the New York Stock Exchange in late-afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dana Ford)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - Connecticut's attorney
general said on Monday he is investigating the breach of
confidential information of thousands of employees of drugmaker
Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N), including that of 305 state residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Richard Blumenthal said in a news release that he has sent
a letter to Pfizer requesting that they take specific steps to
protect their employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My office will seek all relevant information from Pfizer
about this security breach and fight to assure that its
employees have as much protection as possible from the scourge
of identity theft," Blumenthal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, said prior to
Blumenthal's request, it had already sent letters to some
17,000 current and former employees notifying them of the
security breach and steps being taken to address concerns
following the unauthorized disclosure of names, social security
numbers and in some cases addresses and bonus information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Keep in mind that Pfizer has no indication that any
unauthorized individual has used or is using your personal
information," the letter, dated June 1, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The personal information had been stored on a company
laptop computer that Pfizer provided to an employee for use in
her home. It got out due to the unauthorized installation of
certain file sharing software, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Immediately after Pfizer learned of this incident we
retrieved the laptop, disabled the unauthorized file sharing
software, and conducted an investigation to determine which
files, if any, were exposed," the letter to employees said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although our investigation revealed that files containing
names and social security number data were exposed to and, in
some instances, accessed by one or more unauthorized persons
over a 'peer to peer' network, we are unable to determine the
identity or location of those persons, or whether any
particular file was opened or examined. Our investigation is on
going," the letter continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The letter also said the investigation has been unable to
determine whether the sensitive data were copied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it would provide affected employees with one
year of credit monitoring at no cost and encouraged them to
continue to use the service even if initial reports do not find
any potentially suspicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also agreed to fund $25,000 of identity theft
insurance for affected employees with no deductible provided by
a designated, third-party insurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it has contacted the three major U.S. credit
agencies to inform them of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Please rest assured that Pfizer takes data security very
seriously and we have already taken steps to minimize any risk
from this incident," the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In addition, we will continue to investigate and monitor
this particular situation. Should there be any further
significant developments in this matter, we will notify you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The letter, signed by Pfizer privacy officer Lisa Goldman,
ended with an apology for any inconvenience.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N),
the world's top merger and acquisitions adviser, plans to bulk
up in Russia this year after its cautious approach allowed
rivals to pull ahead in this important emerging market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; New York-based Goldman intends to expand its Moscow office
to 100 investment bankers, analysts, salespeople and money
managers by the end of this year from about 70 today, people
familiar with the situation said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is been a perennial champion in global and U.S.
MA, but it has faced a tougher fight in Europe and especially
in Russia, one of the world's fastest growing markets and a top
priority among Wall Street firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far this year, Goldman ranks sixth in announced Russian
MA deals, according to capital markets research firm Dealogic.
Last year it ranked a paltry 15th and just 11th in 2005, a far
cry from its No. 1 ranking in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By comparison, since returning to Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in
2005, Chief Executive John Mack made Russia a high priority and
has expanded aggressively there. Goldman's archrival this year
is the No. 1 MA advisor in Russia based on Morgan Stanley's
involvement in 8 deals, climbing from fourth place in the prior
two years, Dealogic said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has had fits and starts in Russia. Until recently,
Goldman's top executives expressed concern about Russia's
nascent financial markets, where some foreign investors remain
leery of corruption and a lack of protection from government
interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But chief executives from top global companies hailed
Russia's prospects at a weekend investment forum and signed
some $13.5 billion worth of business deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shut its last Moscow effort eight years ago, just
before the Russian government defaulted on ruble denominated
debt, a move that led to huge trading losses, slashed the value
of U.S. banks and contributed to a worldwide slump in financial
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Russia already the world's 10th largest economy and
growing quickly, thanks to soaring oil and natural gas prices,
Goldman is ready to try again. Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein in
April met to discuss the bank's plans for Russia with First
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.

attractions derived from its Pixar animated films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company had invested $396 million in its five parks and
resorts in the first six months of fiscal 2007, compared with
$344 million in the same period last year, according to
financial filings. Disney's fiscal year begins Oct. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has said it will spend less than $1 billion in
domestic parks capital expenditures this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Finding Nemo" Submarine Voyage takes riders on a
12-minute voyage through a luminous Australian barrier reef and
a lost civilization to search for the clownfish made famous in
the 2003 Pixar film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney used the bones and ships of the former Submarine
Voyage attraction, which closed nine years ago, to design an
updated underwater tour featuring original "Nemo" animation
that appears to be projected onto water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The eight 40-passenger submarines, built for the original
1959 ride, were painted yellow, switched from diesel to
electric motors and outfitted with interior sound systems that
synchronize with what is going on outside each porthole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Passengers sit below the water line in the ship, which
moves on a track in the Southern California park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMH Capital analyst David Miller on Monday estimated the
"Finding Nemo" ride upgrade took Disney about three years and
cost some $172 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Parks and Resorts Chairman Jay Rasulo said the
company would continue to leverage Pixar titles for new
attractions to bring in younger park-goers. Both Disneyland and
Florida's Walt Disney World are set to open "Toy Story"-themed
Midway Mania attractions later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There have been great stories coming out of Pixar that we
would like to tell at the parks," Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The division's research and development teams also are
working to incorporate more wireless technology into enhance
attractions, Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That effort started last month when both U.S. parks added
wireless hotspots to let parkgoers access unique features of
Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean" online game while in the
parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Kids today look for interactivity -- technology that is
beyond what they can find in their (homes)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a note to clients, Miller speculated that the Nemo ride
could be the first in a series of new attractions at
Disneyland's companion park, California Adventure, which has
seen soft attendance since its 2001 opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rasulo said Disney intends "to continue to fill out the
entertainment in that park .... You can definitely look for
further expansion and additional entertainment there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's shares edged down 6 cents to $34.14 on the New
York Stock Exchange in late-afternoon trading.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Updates throughout with NBC, sources) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Michele Gershberg &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - General Electric Co.'s (GE.N) NBC Universal and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) explored a competing bid for Dow Jones &amp; Co. DJ.N but the idea was dropped about a week ago, people familiar with the discussion said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N is offering $60 per share, or $5 billion, for Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, as the company aims to build a business cable news channel that would compete with NBC's profitable CNBC outlet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    GE and Microsoft discussed matching News Corp.'s bid, according to a report in the Journal, which cited people briefed on the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The conversations with Microsoft were exploratory conversations that ended over a week ago," an NBC Universal spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NBC is continually evaluating potential strategic acquisitions, the spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sources familiar with the situation described the talks as a very preliminary look at Dow Jones because the company, controlled by the Bancroft family, might come into play. NBC and Microsoft were partners in forming cable news channel MSNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The economics did not make sense," said GE spokesman Russell Wilkerson of the NBC and Microsoft talks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Bancrofts initially opposed Murdoch's bid, but have since held talks with the media mogul and said they would explore other possibilities. Dow Jones' employee union is openly soliciting rival bids from U.S. billionaires who have expressed an interest in media assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Dow Jones' union has said it was trying to drum up interest from six to 10 potential suitors. But GE was not one of the parties contacted, according to Steven Yount, president of the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Would NBC be a more comfortable fit than (News Corp.'s) Fox News? You know, yes," Yount said. "But that doesn't mean that is the only choice that is there. There are all kinds of options that would be preferable to News Corp." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The union has approached billionaire investors Ron Burkle and Warren Buffett to see if they were interested in bidding. The union's adviser said it has been approached by an Internet entrepreneur and a Wall Street group, while Philadelphia newspaper investor Brian Tierney also expressed interest in Dow Jones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Officials at Microsoft could not immediately be reached. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    GE shares gained 12 cents to $37.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Robert MacMillan, Megan Davies and Nick Zieminski in New York and Ben Klayman in Chicago) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reuters Messaging: michele.gershberg.reuters.com@reuters.net; E-mail: michele.gershberg@reuters.com; +1-646-223-6185. editing by Gunna Dickson)) Keywords: DOWJONES GE/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;ANAHEIM, California (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. on Monday launched a "Finding Nemo" submarine ride with underwater animation at its Disneyland park, in an effort to use its Pixar film division to bolster theme park admissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney saw attendance at its parks rise to record levels the past two years as a result of its Disneyland 50th anniversary celebration, and was hoping that refreshing some older rides with Pixar themes will keep ticket sales strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said last year the company would invest a little more in its theme parks in fiscal 2007 than the previous year, especially around attractions derived from its Pixar animated films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had invested $396 million in its five parks and resorts in the first six months of fiscal 2007, compared with $344 million in the same period last year, according to financial filings.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. will triple the amount 
of money it spends developing video games to benefit from 
strong growth prospects in the global market, the entertainment 
company's chief financial officer said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We are ramping up our investment in video games ... It is 
a market where there is real opportunity," Disney's CFO Tom 
Staggs told journalists during a briefing in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of the entertainment company's strategy centers on 
making sure hit products sell strongly across the business, 
irrespective of whether they start as a film, product or game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney spent around $100 million on gaming development last 
year and will spend $130 million this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Over the next five years or so we are ramping up to about 
a pace of $350 million per year in video game investment, 
principally consoles and handhelds," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Market researcher Screen Digest forecasts the particularly 
cyclical global gaming software market will be worth $21.3 
billion in 2009, compared with $20.2 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, a particularly fast-growing area is so-called 
massively multiple player online gaming (MMOG), which is 
expected to see subscription revenues jump from $875 million 
last year to $1.4 billion in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The potential to make profits in that space if you have a 
hit game is significant," said Screen Digest gaming analyst 
Piers Harding-Rolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said Disney created a "Pirates of the Caribbean" 
game to coincide with the release of the latest film, which 
became a hit across gaming platforms in the UK, France and 
Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later this year, Disney plans to launch a multi-player 
online Pirates game in the U.S., then in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are early on in the process of developing a video 
gaming capability," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three months ago, Disney launched "Spectrobes," a 
role-playing game for Nintendo's hand-held DS player produced 
by the company's Interactive Studios arm that has shipped about 
700,000 units, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The galactic action adventure game was developed for Disney 
by Japan-based Jupiter Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am comfortable that it warrants a sequel in the games 
business. We would like to see video games become a vibrant 
creative venture," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has been positioning itself more aggressively in the 
gaming market over the past year, and late last year launched a 
games studio to focus on creating new and Disney-inspired 
titles for Nintendo's DS player and Wii console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said around 70 percent of development spend in video 
games in the near future would be on established content 
franchises, with the rest in areas where Disney hopes to create 
intellectual property it can exploit across the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mobile gaming applications were part of this, though this 
area was primarily being pursued "quite aggressively" within 
the company's Internet business, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said 90 percent of Disney's development efforts 
across gaming, including mobile, fall under the Disney brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, this is traditionally done on a license basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is not that we have no position in the market, it is 
that as a developer and publisher our activities have been very 
limited. But to the extent that we are successful in creating 
games as a publisher ... there is substantially more economic 
upside to the company," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CFO said Disney's gaming aspirations did not imply the 
company wanted to "go flying into the teeth" of competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leading players in this area include Electronic Arts, the 
world's largest video game publisher, and Ubisoft, Europe's 
second-largest video games publisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What we are doing is trying very deliberately to develop 
our core capabilities in video games content development, 
leveraging what already exists in the Disney brand," said 
Staggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney already has a licensing partnership in its ESPN 
sports network with Electronic Arts to create video gaming 
sports titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the Disney-branded titles we thought we could maximize 
our success going it alone," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said Disney was also exploring opportunities for 
gaming initiatives in virtual worlds such as Second Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We can serve a real consumer desire to delve deeper into 
the worlds we create," he said, adding that such segments can 
play an important role in keeping users engaged in particular 
franchises over a sustained period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STOCKHOLM/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - IBM, the world's largest technology services company, said on Monday it plans to buy Swedish business software company Telelogic AB for about 5.2 billion crowns ($748.6 million) to boost growth in its most-profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telelogic TLOG.ST said its board unanimously recommended IBM's (IBM.N) cash bid of 21 crowns a share, a 21 percent premium over Telelogic's closing share price on May 31, before it said it was in talks on a bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Telelogic shot up last week after it said it had received a conditional offer from an undisclosed bidder. They closed at 21.50 crowns on Monday, above the bid level. IBM shares rose 0.53 percent to $103.62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. said Telelogic's products help companies model, build and test complex systems such as aircraft radar and automotive anti-lock braking systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telelogic, based in Malmo, Sweden with more than 1,100 employees in 22 countries, had 2006 revenue of $208 million, or growth of 20 percent. Its U.S. headquarters are in Irvine, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchase, if approved, would be IBM's 45th software firm acquisition since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has been expanding in software as growth in technology services, its largest business, has been slowing, while profitability in services lags other units. Software last year accounted for 20 percent of revenue and had gross profit margin of 85 percent at IBM, based in Armonk, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Johan Eliason at brokerage Cheuvreux said a counterbid from the likes of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) or Sun Microsystems Inc. SUNW.O could not be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telelogic said a combination with IBM offered growth opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By combining with IBM, Telelogic will have a greater opportunity to accelerate its growth globally and be able to provide customers (with) a more comprehensive solution for complex software development," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telelogic said it would also benefit from IBM's sales and services organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swedish company's board, whose members own shares corresponding to about 0.5 percent of the share capital and votes in the firm, have pledged to accept the offer. The board was advised by the investment banking unit of Zurich-based UBS AG (UBSN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telelogic said it would become part of IBM's Rational Software unit once the deal closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=6.946 Swedish Crown)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Veronica Ek in Stockholm)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Shares of Netflix Inc. (NFLX.O) dropped more than 5 percent on Monday after JP Morgan downgraded the online DVD rental company due to stiffer-than-expected competition from rival Blockbuster Inc. BBI.N.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyst Barton Crockett also said the possibility of a takeover of Netflix by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN.O), an idea which sent Netflix shares up as much as 15 percent last week, was "unlikely due to value concerns and competitive challenges."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crockett downgraded Netflix to "underweight" from "neutral," saying the company, which pioneered online DVD rental and dominates the space with more than 6.8 million subscribers, faces competition from Blockbuster that is "much tougher than we had originally expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Netflix lowered its revenue and subscriber growth forecasts for the year as Blockbuster's Total Access plan, rolled out late last year, cut into its subscriber growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix left its earnings outlook for the year unchanged and said it would continue to grow "slowly but profitably" as it waits for Blockbuster to raise prices on Total Access, which allows online subscribers to exchange DVDs at its stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Crockett said on Monday that Blockbuster was unlikely to raise prices on its popular but money-losing Total Access rental program until next year, and that a projected price increase of $3 per month would be too small to benefit Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are assuming that Netflix's gross (subscriber additions) flatten out, massively missing bullish long-term goals for 20 (million) subscribers by 2010-2012," Crockett wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Netflix "at best will split growth in online video rental subscribers with Blockbuster, rather than have a dominant share of subscriber growth..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said estimates that Blockbuster would lose more than $220 million on Total Access in 2007 were "about right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Netflix were down 5.3 percent, or $1.25, to $22.18 in early afternoon trading on Nasdaq on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments from Microsoft) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - The top antitrust official at the U.S. Justice Department last month backed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) by urging state prosecutors to reject a confidential complaint filed by Google Inc. (GOOG.O), The New York Times reported on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Google accused Microsoft of designing its Vista operating system to discourage use of Google's desktop search program, according to a Microsoft spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The complaint is tied to a consent decree that monitors Microsoft's behavior as part of its landmark 2002 antitrust settlement with the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The latest legal wranglings demonstrate the intensity of the growing competition between Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, and Google, the leader in Web search and a provider of software applications run over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    State officials told the newspaper that a memo by Thomas Barnett, an assistant attorney general, rejected the Google complaint, repeating legal arguments made by Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft spokesman Jack Evans said the company was notified in December that a complaint was filed with the Justice Department regarding desktop search in Windows Vista. Microsoft was told it was filed by Google, according to Evans, who said the company has not yet seen the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "While we don't believe there are any compliance concerns with desktop search, we are committed to going the extra mile to resolve this issue," Microsoft said in an e-mail statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Google and the Justice Department could not immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The New York Times article said the memo was sent to state attorneys general around the United States and alarmed many of them, with some state officials saying they believed Google's complaint had merit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The newspaper said the action demonstrates that nearly a decade after the U.S. government began its landmark effort to break up Microsoft, the Bush administration has changed course by defending the company against accusations of anti-competitive conduct. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The judge overseeing the consent decree is Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Nicole Maestri, Megan Davies and Daisuke Wakabayashi, editing by Gary Hill and Tomasz Janowski; Reuters Messaging: nicole.maestri.reuters.com@reuters.net; (646) 223-6173)) Keywords: MICROSOFT ANTITRUST/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;ANAHEIM, California (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. on Monday 
launched a "Finding Nemo" submarine ride with underwater 
animation at its Disneyland park, in an effort to use its Pixar 
film division to bolster theme park admissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney saw attendance at its parks rise to record levels 
the past two years as a result of its Disneyland 50th 
anniversary celebration, and was hoping that refreshing some 
older rides with Pixar themes will keep ticket sales strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said last year 
the company would invest a little more in its theme parks in 
fiscal 2007 than the previous year, especially around 
attractions derived from its Pixar animated films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company had invested $396 million in its five parks and 
resorts in the first six months of fiscal 2007, compared with 
$344 million in the same period last year, according to 
financial filings. Disney's fiscal year begins October 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has said it will spend less than $1 billion in 
domestic parks capital expenditures this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Finding Nemo" Submarine Voyage takes riders on a 
12-minute voyage through a luminous Australian barrier reef and 
a lost civilization to search for the clownfish made famous in 
the 2003 Pixar film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney used the bones and ships of the former Submarine 
Voyage attraction, which closed nine years ago, to design an 
updated underwater tour featuring original "Nemo" animation 
that appears to be projected onto water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The eight 40-passenger submarines, built for the original 
1959 ride, were painted yellow, switched from diesel to 
electric motors and outfitted with interior sound systems that 
synchronize with what is going on outside each porthole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Passengers sit below the water line in the ship, which 
moves on a track in the Southern California park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMH Capital analyst David Miller on Monday estimated the 
"Finding Nemo" ride upgrade took Disney about three years and 
cost some $172 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Parks and Resorts Chairman Jay Rasulo said the 
company would continue to leverage Pixar titles for new 
attractions to bring in younger park-goers. Both Disneyland and 
Florida's Walt Disney World are set to open "Toy Story"-themed 
Midway Mania attractions later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There have been great stories coming out of Pixar that we 
would like to tell at the parks," Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The division's research and development teams also are 
working to incorporate more wireless technology into enhance 
attractions, Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That effort started last month when both U.S. parks added 
wireless hotspots to let parkgoers access unique features of 
Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean" online game while in the 
parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Kids today look for interactivity -- technology that is 
beyond what they can find in their (homes)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a note to clients, Miller speculated that the Nemo ride 
could be the first in a series of new attractions at 
Disneyland's companion park, California Adventure, which has 
seen soft attendance since its 2001 opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rasulo said Disney intends "to continue to fill out the 
entertainment in that park .... You can definitely look for 
further expansion and additional entertainment there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's shares edged down 6 cents to $34.14 on the New 
York Stock Exchange in late-afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Dana Ford)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - Shares of struggling home furnishings retailer Pier 1 Imports Inc. (PIR.N) jumped more than 8 percent on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to "buy" and raised its price target by 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Pier 1, which Goldman previously rated "neutral," were up 63 cents, or 8.1 percent, at $8.44 in late-morning New York Stock Exchange trading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman raised its price target for the stock to $10.50 from $7.50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We see the next retail turnaround opportunity unfolding at Pier 1 as it should regain profitability despite a challenging home environment and competition from peers," wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    She said Pier 1's fundamental performance had suffered over the last four years, but she sees an "inflection point drawing near," given the retailer's new management and turnaround plan, and more vocal shareholder base advocating change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier this year, Pier 1, which has suffered from declining same-store sales and quarterly losses, named former TJX Cos. Inc. (TJX.N) executive Alex Smith as chief executive and president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pier 1 is now looking for ways to cut costs and is reviewing its stores to eliminate underperforming units. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The home furnishings sector has not been kind to anyone, with even best in class retailers such as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY.O) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM.N) feeling pressure," Shapira wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We do not expect the environment to spare Pier 1; however, we believe we are nearing a key inflection point in EBITDA, largely driven by cost cutting efforts, which should power shares forward during F07," she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Separately, Target Corp. (TGT.N) shares were down 20 cents at $62.74 after Goldman removed the discount retailer from its Americas "conviction buy list." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman cited the recent outperformance of the stock and few catalysts on the horizon besides earnings releases. Over the last 12 months Target stock has risen 30 percent, while the S 500 has risen 20.5 percent, the bank noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman maintained its "buy" rating and $72 price target on Target shares, saying it viewed the company "as a successfully differentiated discounter" set to drive healthy revenues over the longer term through solid merchandising and marketing strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "However, with success comes little to turn around," the note stated, "and we believe sentiment might shift more positively towards Wal-Mart and away from Target" following Wal-Mart's capital restructuring announcement earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    At Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s (WMT.N) annual shareholders meeting on June 1, the world's largest retailer said it would cut the number of supercenters it plans to open this year by as much as 30 percent as it tries to boost sales at U.S. stores. It also said it would buy back $15 billion of its own stock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But Goldman analyst Shapira wrote in the note that Wal-Mart's rollback meant "positives unfolding for Target as well," including fewer Wal-Mart stores to compete with over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Nicole Maestri, editing by Lisa Von Ahn; Reuters Messaging: nicole.maestri.reuters.com@reuters.net; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(646) 223-6173)) Keywords: PIER1 SHARES/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  (Adds JP Morgan official's comments to committee) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By George Georgiopoulos &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ATHENS, June 12 (Reuters) - A JP Morgan (JPM.N) executive told Greek legislators on Tuesday the investment bank had acted properly in a structured bond deal at the heart of a scandal which has rocked the Greek government for months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The affair is being investigated by a public prosecutor after claims by ministers that the Greek government bond, underwritten by JP Morgan in February, was sold to pension funds at too high a price. No charges have been pressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "JP Morgan did not pay any commissions, it did not deal with any pension funds and it did not know the price paid by the pension funds," said Jacob Stott, its chief operating officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa. "I do not believe that there is cause for complaint about JP Morgan's role." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The 280 million euro ($373 million) structured bond changed several hands before ending up with pension funds. Last week four funds accepted JP Morgan's offer to reverse the transaction and buy back the bond at the full amount they paid for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Stott told parliament's 50-member economic and monetary affairs committee the bank's proposal was generous, something it was not legally obliged to do but felt was the right move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He admitted that one JP Morgan official knew when the bond was sold to North Asset Management that the investment fund was planning to sell it on but had not informed his superiors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "As a result, we know that the letter sent (to Greek authorities) on March 28, 2007, was incorrect in that JP Morgan stated that North was a "buy and hold" investor," he said, adding that while the bank regretted the error, it was not significant to the deal.  POLITICAL COST &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With snap elections looming possibly as early as autumn, the government has seen its popularity suffer as a result of the scandal, which has prompted the sacking of a minister and the suspension of two brokerages so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal between JP Morgan and the four funds was reached after the government offered to satisfy a key demand and pick up the tab for the interest the pension funds would have otherwise earned had they deposited the money at the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The government's move to facilitate the transaction at the expense of taxpayers -- a cost estimated at about 3.5 million euros -- has angered the political opposition, which said it was an attempt to cover up kickbacks and huge commissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "JP Morgan does not have reason to believe that the Ministry of Finance knew that the bonds would be purchased by Greek pension funds," Stott told the committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Opposition deputies hammered Stott, accusing JP Morgan of helping the government hush up the scandal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Are you in cooperating with the Greek government to cover up the affair? In only 15 minutes you made 14 million euros on a 280 million euro bond just for fees on services rendered," PASOK deputy Vasso Papandreou. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The socialists were also angry that the two JP Morgan officials directly involved in the deal did not respond to the committee's invitation to appear. Testimony before the committee is voluntary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It is a very serious offence against the Greek Parliament that the persons who were called did not appear today," PASOK deputy George Floridis told Stott. "The invitation was not addressed to bodies. It was addressed to individuals". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Writing by Dina Kyriakidou, dina.kyriakidou.reuters.com@reuters.net;+30210 3311813; editing by David Christian-Edwards)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.7506 Euro)   Keywords: GREECE JPMORGAN/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds browser comments) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, June 11 (Reuters) - Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) will let independent developers write applications for its upcoming iPhone and will introduce a version of its Safari Internet browser that would run on Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Windows operating system, Chief Executive Steve Jobs said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But shares in the Macintosh computer company sank about 2.8 percent after Jobs' speech to software developers. Demand for details of the iPhone is extremely high ahead of the multimedia device's launch on June 29. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The announcement that Apple would let other companies write iPhone applications -- by tapping into the device's built-in Web browser -- softened the company's previous position that the iPhone would not support outside programs due to concerns about security, a stance that had caused dismay among many Apple enthusiasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Jobs cited industry market data showing that Safari, which currently runs on the Apple Macintosh operating system, has  4.9 percent of the browser business. Microsoft's Internet Explorer has around 78 percent, while Firefox is second-largest with around 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We would love for Safari's market share to grow substantially," Jobs said during a presentation in which he focused on new features in Apple's upcoming operating system software, called Leopard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Apple stock fell 2.8 percent to $120.00 on Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Scott Hillis, editing by Gary Hill; San Francisco Newsroom, e-mail: scott.hillis@reuters.com, +1 415 677 2505)) Keywords: APPLE IPHONE/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - LG Household and Health Care Ltd. (051900.KS) said on Tuesday it submitted a final bid for the South Korean operations of Australian soft drinks firm Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX), in a deal analysts valued at about $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other firms which had made preliminary bids -- Samlip General Foods (005610.KS), and a consortium of private equity fund MBK Partners and Woongjin Capital, an affiliate of South Korea's Woongjin Foods -- were not immediately available for comment on whether they handed in final bids by Tuesday's deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LG Household did not give details about its bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil said in February it had appointed Goldman Sachs JBWere (GS.N) to review its South Korean business, bought in 1998 for $461 million, whose growth is slowing as more consumers turn to healthier, low-sugar drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S.-based Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) owns 35 pct of Coca-Cola Amatil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs JBWere said in a research report in April that given the franchise's poor track record, the business was likely to be sold for around A$400 million ($337.3 million) - $A500 million ($421.6 million), below its book value of A$699 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Australian firm told Reuters it hoped to raise some A$700 million from the sale, citing its strong retail network in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola controls 48 percent of South Korea's soft drinks market but lost volume following a recall of Coca-Cola bottles last July after a criminal poisoning case. It is also the third-biggest maker of non-carbonated beverages in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil earned A$18 million in 2006 in South Korea, up from a loss of A$9.2 million a year earlier, helped by an A$7.5 million profit on the sale of properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Bill Berkrot &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - Connecticut's attorney general said on Monday he is investigating the breach of confidential information of thousands of employees of drugmaker Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N), including that of 305 state residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Richard Blumenthal said in a news release that he has sent a letter to Pfizer requesting that they take specific steps to protect their employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "My office will seek all relevant information from Pfizer about this security breach and fight to assure that its employees have as much protection as possible from the scourge of identity theft," Blumenthal said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, said prior to Blumenthal's request, it had already sent letters to some 17,000 current and former employees notifying them of the security breach and steps being taken to address concerns following the unauthorized disclosure of names, social security numbers and in some cases addresses and bonus information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Keep in mind that Pfizer has no indication that any unauthorized individual has used or is using your personal information," the letter, dated June 1, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The personal information had been stored on a company laptop computer that Pfizer provided to an employee for use in her home. It got out due to the unauthorized installation of certain file sharing software, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Immediately after Pfizer learned of this incident we retrieved the laptop, disabled the unauthorized file sharing software, and conducted an investigation to determine which files, if any, were exposed," the letter to employees said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Although our investigation revealed that files containing names and social security number data were exposed to and, in some instances, accessed by one or more unauthorized persons over a 'peer to peer' network, we are unable to determine the identity or location of those persons, or whether any particular file was opened or examined. Our investigation is on going," the letter continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The letter also said the investigation has been unable to determine whether the sensitive data were copied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said it would provide affected employees with one year of credit monitoring at no cost and encouraged them to continue to use the service even if initial reports do not find any potentially suspicious activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company also agreed to fund $25,000 of identity theft insurance for affected employees with no deductible provided by a designated, third-party insurer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said it has contacted the three major U.S. credit agencies to inform them of the incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Please rest assured that Pfizer takes data security very seriously and we have already taken steps to minimize any risk from this incident," the letter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "In addition, we will continue to investigate and monitor this particular situation. Should there be any further significant developments in this matter, we will notify you." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The letter, signed by Pfizer privacy officer Lisa Goldman, ended with an apology for any inconvenience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Leslie Gevirtz; Reuters Messaging: bill.berkrot.reuters.com@reuters.net phone 646 223-6030)) Keywords: PFIZER INVESTIGATION/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (For an expanded IPO diary, please click on VN/IPOMENU)
 (Changes attribution, adds strategic partner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ho Binh Minh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HANOI, June 12 (Reuters) - State-run Industrial and
Commercial Bank (Incombank), Vietnam's fourth-largest, has
picked JP Morgan (JPM.N) to advise on its partial privatisation
and an IPO scheduled for October, an official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The official did not disclose the fee JP Morgan will
receive from for consultation for the process, which includes
evaluation of the bank and organising the initial public
offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We picked JP Morgan," the official said. He said the
Hanoi-based bank would make an official announcement soon, but
did not give a date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The consultant would also help Incombank select a strategic
partner, the bank has said. It did not make clear if the
partner would be a Vietnamese or a foreign company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Incombank, with assets of $9.2 billion, has said it will
conduct the IPO in October 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is one of four state-run banks, including Vietcombank,
Vietindebank and the Mekong Delta Housing Development Bank,
ordered to issue shares this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan was shortlisted to join the Incombank tender
along with Daiwa Security SMBC, Lehman Brothers LEH.N,
Macquarie MBL.AX, Merrill Lynch MER.N, Morgan Stanley
(MS.N) and UBS (UBSN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan along with Merrill, Morgan Stanley and UBS also
joined a tender by Vietindebank to pick its adviser by late
this month for privatisation and IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vietindebank said Merrill had the highest score of 87.2 for
technical proposals while JP Morgan had the lowest, at 73.9.  
 Vietindebank plans an IPO in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Incombank has not said how much it aimed to raise in the
IPO or disclosed whether it would list on the main Ho Chi Minh
Stock Exchange .VNI or the over-the-counter Hanoi Securities
Trading Center .HASTCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Partly-private Sacombank STB.HM is the only bank listed
on the Ho Chi Minh City market and Asia Commercial Bank
(ACB.HN) has listed shares on the Hanoi exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Incombank signed with Vietnam Posts and
Telecommunications (VNPT) group, the country's largest telecoms
firm, an agreement to boost their investment and business,
using each other's services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Incombank has arranged a syndicate loan worth 2.3 trillion
dong ($143 million) which will enable the telecoms group to
launch Vietnam's first telecoms satellite, Vinasat, in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement also aimed "at a target that Incombank and
VNPT will become each other's strategic partners during their
operation and development," Incombank said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. plans to move its investment bank to a new tower at the office complex to be built on the World Trade Center site, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the government agency that controls the site, said in April that it was negotiating with the No. 3 U.S. banking group about building an office tower just south of the complex that was destroyed on September 11, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York State Governor Eliot Spitzer alerted reporters in an advisory that he was holding a news conference on Thursday about a "major economic development announcement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment on the agreement to build the tower, initially reported by the Wall Street Journal on its Web site. Officials from Spitzer's offices and the Port Authority could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous reports had identified the former Deutsche Bank building near Ground Zero as the probable site of a new JPMorgan building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's world headquarters would remain at its current site at 270 Park Avenue, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An agreement to move JPMorgan's investment bank, which employs 6,000 people in New York City, would be a latest sign of progress in the quest to redevelop the site near Ground Zero, which has proceeded in fits and starts since the September 11 attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, seven insurers agreed to pay an additional $2 billion to the Port Authority and developer Larry Silverstein to resolve all outstanding claims from the attacks, a move that was expected to speed redevelopment of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) said on
Wednesday that it has completed drilling at its Tahiti prospect
in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and is on track to start
producing oil in mid-2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company plans to move two drilling rigs that have been
working on the project within a month and will likely have the
drilling platform in place at Tahiti by September, spokesman
Mickey Driver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tahiti is expected to produce about 125,000 barrels of oil
per day. Chevron will spend about $3.5 billion to put the
Tahiti field into production in two phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Driver also said the company plans to drill another
appraisal well at its closely-watched Jack prospect, also in
the deepwater Gulf, late this year or early in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron operates the Jack field and has a 50 percent stake
in the project. Devon Energy (DVN.N) and Norway's Statoil
(STL.OL) each own a 25 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Driver would not disclose any specific details about when
drilling would start or what rig the company plans to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, a Devon spokesman said that the companies plan to
drill the new well at the Jack site toward the end of 2007
using the Ocean Endeavor Deepwater Rig that Devon has under
long-term contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron-led group announced that it had successfully
tested an appraisal well at Jack in September 2006, making it
the deepest successful well in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A report late last year said Chevron planned to start
drilling the latest appraisal well at Jack in July, but Driver
said that lack of availability of drilling rigs had slowed the
process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had to make sure that there was a rig available," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsch Bank trading analyst Jennifer Gordon said that a
trend is emerging in the Gulf of Mexico, with companies unable
to drill due to the lack of availability of drilling rigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Recent data shows during the past 12 months only an
estimated 400 million barrels of oil equivalent has been
discovered in the deepwater -- the majority of that attributed
to Jack," she said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This compares to 1.7 billion boe in the preceding 12
months (June 05-May 06). The market is not paying attention
here and should be -- U.S. oil production is spiraling down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Devon President John Richels said last week that the Jack
field will probably start producing oil commercially sometime
between 2011 and 2013.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - Walt Disney Studios is keen to build its presence in markets such as India and China, and will harness local talent to ensure that it is not just exporting U.S. movies but making entertainment tailored for domestic tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unit of The Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) said this week it will collaborate with India's Yash Raj Films Studios on a series of computer-animated films for Indian audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is talking to local studios and directors to make live-action films to tap both India's love for films and its improving technology, Mark Zoradi, president of worldwide marketing and distribution, Walt Disney Studios, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've traditionally made movies in the U.S. and exported them, but in recent years we've realized that to continue to grow our business internationally, we need to make movies that are culturally relevant to different markets," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not in every country, but those with potential, like India and China. In India, 95 percent of the movie business is local, so we need to be in that space," said Zoradi, who helped broker the deal with Yash Raj in a little more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, the No. 3 U.S. entertainment company, and Yash Raj -- known for its mushy Bollywood romances -- will be equal partners in the venture to make one animation feature a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first, "Roadside Romeo", is set for release in 2008. It will be made in India, with animation by Tata Elxsi (TTEX.BO) and voiceovers by Bollywood stars Saif Khan and Kareena Kapoor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoradi did not say how much Disney was investing, only that it was a part of the $100 million that Disney has said it would spend making films outside the United States in the next two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venture with Yash Raj is similar to a one-off deal Disney has with The China Film Group and Hong Kong's Centro Digital Pictures Ltd. for a Chinese animated film. "The Secret of the Magic Gourd" is due to debut at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's film entertainment industry is worth about 85 billion rupees ($2.1 billion) and is forecast to more than double to 175 billion rupees by 2011, according to PriceWaterhouseCoopers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Disney is late to the co-production table: Sony Pictures (6758.T) and News Corp. NWS.N already have deals in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEART AND SOUL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which operates the Disney Channel and Toon Disney in India, last year bought Hungama, a children's Hindi-language entertainment channel, from UTV Software Communications Ltd. UTVS.BO and also took 14.9 percent in the Indian broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoradi said he would like to see 20-25 percent of Disney's revenues in India to come from its film and home video business. "We don't have unrealistic expectations, but as we look long-term, India will be a very important, strategic market," he said, adding Disney would also continue to outsource some of its animation production to India in a "significant manner".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had done very well exporting our movies, but then we looked at India and realized the infrastructure was about to explode: theatres were getting better, tax laws were improving." Disney is also keen to make more films in China despite restrictive regulations, said Zoradi, a 27-year Disney veteran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest limiting factor is the regulatory framework, but we're clearly going to make more Chinese films," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the long-term, China will be a Top 10 market for Disney. India, too, in the long-term, has the potential to be a Top 10 market," said Zoradi, adding the recently released "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," was Disney's biggest hit in India so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=40.7 rupees)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANAHEIM, California (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. on Monday 
launched a "Finding Nemo" submarine ride with underwater 
animation at its Disneyland park, in an effort to use its Pixar 
film division to bolster theme park admissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney saw attendance at its parks rise to record levels 
the past two years as a result of its Disneyland 50th 
anniversary celebration, and was hoping that refreshing some 
older rides with Pixar themes will keep ticket sales strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said last year 
the company would invest a little more in its theme parks in 
fiscal 2007 than the previous year, especially around 
attractions derived from its Pixar animated films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company had invested $396 million in its five parks and 
resorts in the first six months of fiscal 2007, compared with 
$344 million in the same period last year, according to 
financial filings. Disney's fiscal year begins October 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has said it will spend less than $1 billion in 
domestic parks capital expenditures this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Finding Nemo" Submarine Voyage takes riders on a 
12-minute voyage through a luminous Australian barrier reef and 
a lost civilization to search for the clownfish made famous in 
the 2003 Pixar film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney used the bones and ships of the former Submarine 
Voyage attraction, which closed nine years ago, to design an 
updated underwater tour featuring original "Nemo" animation 
that appears to be projected onto water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The eight 40-passenger submarines, built for the original 
1959 ride, were painted yellow, switched from diesel to 
electric motors and outfitted with interior sound systems that 
synchronize with what is going on outside each porthole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Passengers sit below the water line in the ship, which 
moves on a track in the Southern California park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMH Capital analyst David Miller on Monday estimated the 
"Finding Nemo" ride upgrade took Disney about three years and 
cost some $172 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Parks and Resorts Chairman Jay Rasulo said the 
company would continue to leverage Pixar titles for new 
attractions to bring in younger park-goers. Both Disneyland and 
Florida's Walt Disney World are set to open "Toy Story"-themed 
Midway Mania attractions later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There have been great stories coming out of Pixar that we 
would like to tell at the parks," Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The division's research and development teams also are 
working to incorporate more wireless technology into enhance 
attractions, Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That effort started last month when both U.S. parks added 
wireless hotspots to let parkgoers access unique features of 
Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean" online game while in the 
parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Kids today look for interactivity -- technology that is 
beyond what they can find in their (homes)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a note to clients, Miller speculated that the Nemo ride 
could be the first in a series of new attractions at 
Disneyland's companion park, California Adventure, which has 
seen soft attendance since its 2001 opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rasulo said Disney intends "to continue to fill out the 
entertainment in that park .... You can definitely look for 
further expansion and additional entertainment there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's shares edged down 6 cents to $34.14 on the New 
York Stock Exchange in late-afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Dana Ford)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, June 15 (Reuters) - China's Ministry of Commerce has
given its approval for an investment arm of Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
to pay about $350 million for a stake in Midea Group 000527.SZ,
the leading Chinese household appliance maker said in a notice
published on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The ministry gave its go-ahead on Thursday for Midea to issue
an additional 75.59 million shares to GS Capital Partners Aurum
Holdings, an investment arm of Goldman Sachs, according to a
statement published in the China Securities Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Midea has to sell the shares for no less than 90 percent of
its average share price in the past 20 trading days, the notice
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Thursday's closing price of 35.88 yuan, Goldman's stake of
10.7 percent is valued at 2.7 billion yuan, or $354 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal was announced in principle in November when Midea
said it would sell new shares to Goldman in a private placement
at 9.48 yuan apiece, valuing the investment bank's stake then at
717 million yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Midea, a private company that is one of China's
biggest makers of appliances including refrigerators and electric
fans, have since risen sharply with the rest of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal still needs final approval by the securities
regulator, the notice said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) agreed to build its investment banking headquarters in lower Manhattan at the site of the World Trade Center complex that was destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001, New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer said on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Spitzer told a news conference JP Morgan will pay the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey $290 million for a 92-year lease and $10 million to the World Trade Center foundation and the church at the same site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The new 1.3 million-square-foot building, to be located where the Deutsche Bank building now is being torn down, will house about 7,000 JP Morgan Investment Bank employees. The approximately 40-story building will include six world-class trading floors, J.P. Morgan said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JP Morgan's decision is the latest sign of a renewed influx of banks, many of which are seeking space for large trading floors, into a neighborhood some abandoned following the 2001 attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This demonstrates once again that downtown has become the financial capital of the world," Spitzer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Anastasija Johnson, editing by Leslie Adler; Reuters Messaging: Anastasija.Johnson.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail: anastasija.johnson@reuters.com; +1-646-223-6342)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: JPMORGAN NEWYORK/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;But if earnings reports from the No. 1 and No. 5 U.S. investment banks on Thursday show anything, it's the importance of investment banks not keeping too many eggs in one basket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both banks suffered from rising mortgage defaults, which made lenders less likely to make home loans and reduced underwriting volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That helped depress fixed income trading revenues 21 percent at Bear Stearns and 24 percent at Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman Sachs, which is more diversified than Bear Stearns, still managed to eke out a profit increase for the quarter, while Bear Stearns' earnings fell 10 percent, or 33 percent including a one-time write-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of both brokers fell following the release of results that deflated investor hopes lifted earlier this week by stellar results at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N. Bear Stearns shares rallied late in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three investment banks were haunted throughout the week by the debacle in lending to less creditworthy home buyers. Lehman disclosed on Wednesday that it would merge two residential mortgage units, cutting 400 jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Bear Stearns put $4 billion of mortgage bonds on sale on Thursday to raise cash and cover reported losses in one of its hedge funds, fund managers and other sources said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer term, Goldman's broader array of businesses makes it likely to continue outperforming Bear Stearns, several analysts and portfolio managers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd rather invest in a company that has a strong international business and equity business, in addition to a strong bond business," said Adam Compton, co-head of global financial stocks research at RCM Global Investors in San Francisco, which has some $150 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns is hiring internationally -- it is doubling its staff in London to more than 2,500 in the next few years, and opening a Paris office in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bear Stearns is late to the party. Right now, about 85 percent of its revenues are from the United States. Compare that to Goldman Sachs, which generated more than half its revenue outside the U.S. in the second quarter, or Lehman which said on Tuesday that 48 percent of its revenue was international.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear also has a proportionately smaller investment banking business than Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs's advisory business generated about $709 million in revenue, or about 7 percent of total revenue, compared with $140 million, or about 5.6 percent at Bear. Advisory revenues are key for profits, since a very higher percentage of them end up as profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares trade at about 2.8 times their book value, or the accounting value of their assets minus liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's far higher than Bear Stearns' 1.6 times, but Goldman Sachs has a much higher return on equity, and so while Bear appears fairly valued, a case could be made that Goldman is undervalued, said Joe Dickerson, analyst at Atlantic Equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns' return on equity -- a measure of how efficient the company is at squeezing profits from its net assets -- was 15.6 percent excluding a one-time charge, compared with 26.7 percent for Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear's return on equity was hurt by the weak U.S. mortgage market, where defaults rose to a record high, an industry group said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SILVER LINING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear's profits for the second quarter were $361.7 million, down from $553.7 million a year earlier, while Goldman's were $2.33 billion, compared with $2.29 billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear's results included a $227 million write-down for assets linked to its New York Stock Exchange specialist unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everything is gloomy for Bear Stearns. Its mortgage revenues rose compared to the first quarter, even if they were well off their levels of the second quarter of 2006, the company's chief financial officer said on a conference call. The company's hedge fund business is growing dramatically, CFO Sam Molinaro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Molinaro said Bear Stearns' exposure was minimal to the fund whose bonds were put on the block on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Joe Giannone in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Oil company Exxon Mobil Corp. never in 
the past decade doubted the risk from climate change, its 
global spokesman Kenneth Cohen said on Thursday, in a latest 
attempt to improve its green credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon had simply firmed up, or "evolved," its understanding 
of the threat, said Cohen, the company's head of public 
affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's most profitable company now accepted that a 
U.S. climate policy was inevitable and it preferred either a 
carbon market that would allocate carbon credits solely to 
suppliers of fossil fuels, such as oil companies, or else a 
carbon tax, Cohen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under an existing European scheme, carbon credits have been 
given to utilities and will earn these companies tens of 
billions of euros in windfall profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commonest greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is made by 
burning fossil fuels like oil. Environmental groups have long 
accused Exxon of funding research groups that rubbished the 
threat of a manmade, climate change catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're very much not a denier, very much at the table with 
our sleeves rolled up," Cohen told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohen also chairs the Exxon Mobil Foundation which last 
year, alongside Exxon, handed out $139 million to charities and 
research groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2005 the company withdrew support for the Competitive 
Enterprise Institute, which the following year ran an 
advertising campaign promoting carbon dioxide, which said "we 
call it life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It still funds groups such as the Heartland Institute, 
which describes global warming as "a prime example of the 
alarmism that characterizes much of the environmental 
movement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Cohen said Exxon had only ever funded such groups 
because they were against the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, 
negotiated in the late 1990s, and which Exxon still rejects -- 
and not because they cast doubt on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We started funding a number of these groups because we 
were opposed to the Kyoto Protocol. We were slow to stop 
funding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon could terminate its support of more groups, Cohen 
added -- "It's a question we're asking ourselves," he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CARBON PRICE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon now sees as inevitable a federal U.S. law to penalize 
greenhouse gas emissions, for example through a carbon tax or 
trading scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It prefers what Cohen called an "upstream cap and trade" 
carbon market, capping emissions at the level of fossil fuel 
suppliers, rather than energy consumers like utilities, arguing 
that this would distribute carbon costs more evenly through an 
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We lean move towards an upstream cap and trade with a 
price protector, or a carbon tax."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carbon markets cap emissions by distributing a fixed quota 
of carbon emissions permits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two-year-old European Union carbon trading scheme takes 
a "downstream" approach, and power utilities which got most 
carbon emissions permits for free have passed on the carbon 
price to electricity consumers regardless, in a practice which 
is expected to earn them tens of billions of euros in profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If permits were auctioned rather than given away for free, 
or if companies were unable to pass on the carbon price, a 
scheme could cost companies money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It will not be a profit-maker if the rights are sold. The 
devil's in the detail," said Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
(GS.N), one of the biggest movers of stocks and securities
through the world's exchanges, is ready to compete with those
markets as it seeks lower trading costs, Chief Financial
Officer David Viniar said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "I would say there are a lot of exchanges around the world
and, in certain places where we may think that exchanges are
not being competitive in the prices they charge us, we and
others in our industry might get together and try to form a
consortium that performs services in competition with certain
exchanges at better prices," Viniar said on a conference call
in response to an analyst question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar's comments come as the exchange business undergoes
sweeping changes. Member-owned markets worldwide have been
converting to for-profit companies with shareholders to please
and earnings goals to match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The equities world in particular has consolidated into a
handful of exchange operators, raising worries among brokers
that concentrated market power could lead to higher fees.
That is critical in a business where commissions have been
falling for 30 years amid regulatory and technology changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street firms, in response, have established new
trading platforms and bought stakes in smaller, alternative
marketplaces to keep their options open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York investment bank years ago invested in a number
of electronic networks. It later orchestrated the 2004 merger
of Archipelago, the leading alternative trading network, with
the New York Stock Exchange, accelerating the Big Board's shift
toward electronic trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has also been active as an investor in U.S.
regional stock and options exchanges developing electronic
systems and it was an investor in Intercontinental Exchange
Inc. (ICE.N), which has grabbed commodities trading volume from
the venerable New York Mercantile Exchange NYM.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More recently Goldman and other broker dealers have
launched alternative systems BATS Trading for stocks, Block
Interest Discovery Service (BIDS) and, in Europe, "Project
Turquoise" to compete with NYSE Euronext NYX.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More recently, Goldman launched "GS True," a platform for
trading unregistered stock issued through private placements.
This venture, announced last month as part of Goldman's raising
$880 million for private equity firm Oaktree Capital
Management, take direct aim at a similar venture under
development by Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. (NDAQ.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar told analysts that GS True could accommodate other
clients outside of the private equity industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think it could have application for various types of
companies, not just private equity," Viniar said.

&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, California (Reuters) - The high priests of free software have congregated at Google Inc. (GOOG.O) headquarters this week to debate the future of the movement and face down recent patent threats by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading names of Linux, the world's biggest grassroots software phenomenon, are spending three days to Friday debating whether an increasingly commercial open source community should fight or ignore the world's largest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dressed in the alternative software movement's casual uniform of T-shirts and jeans, the group is coming to grips with internal divisions that sap at its success -- Linux is now used to power desktop computers, major Web sites, mobile phones -- since rival factions often create very similar products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as many of the world's top tech companies and corporate customers demand ever more from Linux, open source devotees still fight among themselves with the fervor of a tiny monastic order seeking to root out theological error in their midst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Guys: Be seekers of truth, not finders of contradiction," Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, organizer of the event, only half-jokingly told the 150 attendees of what is billed their "Collaboration Summit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux is the best-known variant of so-called open source software -- software that is freely available to the public to be used, revised and shared. Linux suppliers earn money selling improvements and technical services. By contrast, Microsoft charges for software and opposes freely sharing its code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Microsoft has sown dissension by claiming open source programs such as Linux violate 235 of its patents while striking deals to insulate the customers of two Linux suppliers -- Novell and Xandros -- from patent lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Linspire Inc., which sells Linux-based personal computers through Wal-Mart and other retailers, became the third company to strike a patent deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICROSOFT: ENEMY OR PUNCHING BAG?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the group is militantly opposed to Microsoft, which some attending the summit openly refer to as "the enemy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most believe Linux users control their own destinies and Microsoft's patent threats are just the latest attempts to create "fear, uncertainty and doubt" among customers. After closed-down sessions Thursday and Friday, the group aims to issue a consensus statement next week on what they plan to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Bottomley, who works as chief technology officer at Steeleye Technologies, is in charge of maintaining the software code used by Linux to transfer data between computers and peripheral devices like printers, a job he does for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottomley says Microsoft is unlikely to sue Linux customers because most Linux users also buy Microsoft. "Their customers are our customers," he said, adding that: "It's just bloody annoying. It gets everyone riled up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zend Technologies, developers of an open source programming language called PHP that is used in many Web sites, is seeking to remain neutral. Eighty percent of its customers use open source software, but it recently struck a deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Microsoft is a big company trying to make up its mind," said Zend Chief Executive Harold Goldberg, who is not taking part in the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the one hand Microsoft has a big established business it is trying to defend," Goldberg said. "On the other hand, there are those inside the company, though they won't admit it publicly, who see open source as the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WORKING TO WORK TOGETHER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first conference of the Linux Foundation, an umbrella advocacy group formed early in 2007 to unite two predecessors, Open Source Development Labs and the Free Standards Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are as many as 360 rival flavors of Linux, known as distributions, according to Distrowatch.com. This factionalism fuels rapid innovation but splits the energies of developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There really is a sense in many projects that there is an 'us' and a 'them'," said Mark Shuttlesworth, founder of Ubuntu, a free, desktop version of Linux that competes with Windows. "There are the folks who are inside a project and those who are outside a project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Linux Foundation boasts 70 corporate and non-profit backers, including Intel (INTC.O), Oracle ORCL.O, IBM (IBM.N), Cisco (CSCO.O), Motorola MOT.N, Nokia (NOK1V.HE), NTT (9432.T), Dell DELL.O, Red Hat (RHT.N) and Sun SUNW.O, along with major customers like ADP ADP.N, Bank of America (BAC.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux used to be worked on by professionals doing the work on their own time, said Jason Wacha, an expert on licensing Linux and attorney for MontaVista, a maker of Linux software for mobile and consumer electronics devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, I think (Linux) is being pushed by commercial forces ... Now a lot of people are being paid to do Linux as professionals," he said of how many top open-source developers now work for big-name companies like Google, HP and Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Joseph A. Giannone &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) eked out a 1 percent increase in quarterly profit on Thursday to beat expectations, yet revenue slipped as a sharp drop in fixed income trading offset record investment banking fees and strong equities income. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest investment bank by profit and market value said net earnings rose to $2.33 billion, or $4.93 a share, in the second quarter ended on May 25, from $2.29 billion, or $4.78 a share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts on average expected profit of $4.76 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Net revenue slipped 1 percent to $10.2 billion, just beating the average estimate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman shares were down 2.8 percent in premarket trading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Trading and principal investments revenue fell 6 percent to $6.65 billion, paced by a 24 percent drop in the bank's biggest profit engine, debt and commodities trading. Revenue booked from principal investment activities more than doubled to $784 million from last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Investment banking income rose 18 percent to a record $1.72 billion, fees from mergers and acquisition rose 17 percent and debt issuance rose by 50 percent, overcoming a 26 percent drop in stock underwriting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Revenue from the bank's asset management arm increased 11 percent to $1.06 billion, as managed assets rose 28 percent to $758 billion. Noncompensation expenses rose 16 percent to $1.86 billion, while global headcount increased 17 percent to 28,012 employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The results come two days after rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Corp. LEH.N reported a 27 percent jump in profit, trouncing expectations and sparking a rebound in brokerage stocks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In contrast to Lehman, Goldman's results include the last week of February, when a sudden drop in China's stock market sparked a weeklong sell off in financial markets worldwide. The period also reflects weakness in the subprime mortgage market, which trimmed growth in debt trading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman stock, which hit an all-time high of $233.94 at the end of May, rose 4 percent during the fiscal quarter, outperforming the 1.3 percent gain in the AMEX Securities Broker-Dealer Index .XBD, but slightly lagging the S 500 .SPX. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Joseph Giannone, editing by Lisa Von Ahn; Reuters messaging: joseph.giannone.reuters.com@reuters.net;+1 646 223 6184)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: GOLDMANSACHS RESULTS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) continued to raise its risk appetite in May, shifting
away from commodities and toward stocks, currencies and
interest rates, the company said on Thursday in its quarterly
earnings statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman's value at risk, a measure of how much money it
could lose on any particular trading day, jumped 15 percent to

$127 million in the three months ended Feb. 23 and $112 million

and currency rates, with value at risk in commodities prices
getting clipped, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs official was not immediately available to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Value at risk allocated to commodities fell to $24 million
in the three months ended in May, down from $30 million in the
three months ended in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Goldman increased its average daily exposure to
interest rate products to $81 million in the three months ended
in May from $57 million in the three months ended in February,
according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Average daily value at risk in equities, meanwhile, rose to
$101 million from $96 million, and risk in currency rates rose
to $20 million from $18 million.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
has hired HSBC's (HSBA.L) George Foussianes for its private
equity banking team, according to an internal memo, beefing up
the group amid a boom in leveraged buyout activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's financial sponsors group, as private equity
bankers are known on Wall Street, also hired two other bankers
-- one from UBS AG (UBSN.VX), the other from Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce (CM.TO), according to the memo, dated June 13
and obtained by Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At HSBC Holdings Plc, Foussianes was head of its Americas
Global Banking group, overseeing investment banking, corporate
banking, leveraged finance and private equity. He was
previously a managing director in the MA group at Goldman
Sachs, focusing on industrials and natural resources, according
to the memo. HSBC hired him in April 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's sponsors group also hired James Gray from UBS,
where he was a managing director and founding member of the UBS
Financial Sponsor Group, according to the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group hired David Sommer from CIBC, where he was a
managing director in the Financial Sponsors Group. Sommer will
focus on expanding our midcap sponsor coverage platform, the
memo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The memo was sent by John Coyle, JPMorgan's head of
financial sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial sponsors groups across Wall Street have increased
substantially in size in the last few years, as demands grow
from the surging private equity deal volume. Sponsor groups
typically are responsible for maintaining the relationship with
private equity firms, generating ideas for them and arranging
financing for deals.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a boost to downtown Manhattan, JPMorgan Chase  Co. has agreed to build a skyscraper near Ground Zero and will relocate its investment banking headquarters from midtown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third-largest U.S. bank will build a 1.3 million square foot building, with at least six trading floors, on the site of the former Deutsche Bank building, which was badly damaged in the September 11 attacks and is being dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey $290 million for a 92-year lease, and another $10 million to the World Trade Center foundation and a church at the site. The bank said it will invest about $2 billion in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 7,000 investment banking employees are expected to move to the building, which is expected to open in 2012. The bank's main headquarters will stay in midtown Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the financial capital of the world and it's terribly important that we maintain that," New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference. "This will accelerate a downtown renaissance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government officials did not specify what incentives JPMorgan is receiving for the move, but said they are well below the $1.75 billion package Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the largest U.S. investment bank, won in 2005 to build headquarters in nearby Battery Park City. Critics blasted that award as a giveaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose profit totaled $14.4 billion in 2006, will receive incentives it deserves "as of right" or as otherwise previously authorized by government, in part to spur job growth, officials said. The bank employs about 176,000 people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be value that will pass to (JPMorgan) that is somewhere north of $200 (million)," New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer said at the news conference. "The spigot will be turned off when these pre-existing, statutorily designed and constructed benefits expire."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called JPMorgan's package a "good, fair deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said the move downtown, which houses such financial services companies as Goldman, Merrill Lynch  Co. Inc. and Bank of New York Co. Inc., is a vote of confidence in the Wall Street district, which many firms abandoned after 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRADING SPACES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new building will contain six or seven trading floors, each about 60,000 square feet, according to Steve Black, co-chief executive of JPMorgan's investment banking unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks including Bank of America Corp. and Wachovia Corp. have built or are building large trading floors in a bid to generate greater revenue from the purchase and sale of stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking accounted for $18.8 billion, or 29 percent, of JPMorgan's $65.1 billion of revenue last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan building is sometimes referred to as Tower 5. The Port Authority also holds rights to the planned Freedom Tower, while developer Larry Silverstein holds rights to several other nearby sites. In a statement, Silverstein called the JPMorgan building "a tremendous addition to the new downtown."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan  Co. moved to midtown after being acquired at the end of 2000 by Chase Manhattan Corp. to form JPMorgan Chase, whose chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is a Queens native.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon joined the company in 2004 when JPMorgan Chase bought his Bank One Corp.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) barely managed to show a rise in quarterly profit as a sharp drop in fixed income trading revenue offset record investment banking fees and strong equities income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest investment bank by profit and market value on Thursday said net earnings rose 1 percent to $2.33 billion, or $4.93 a share, in the second quarter ended on May 25, from $2.29 billion, or $4.78 a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While earnings were about 4 percent higher than the analysts' average estimate of $4.76 a share, the results paled in comparison with the double-digit growth of previous periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net revenue slipped 1 percent to $10.2 billion, just beating the average estimate, while Goldman routinely trounces expectations. Some analysts said earnings growth would have been even lower if not for reduced compensation and tax rates, and Goldman shares fell more than 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman has historically beaten by so much, so people are bound to have high expectations," said Jim Huguet, president and co-chief executive at Great Companies Inc. in Tampa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mixed results come two days after Lehman Brothers LEH.N reported a 27 percent jump in profit, surprising investors and sparking a rebound in broker stocks as the one-time bond shop benefited from expansion in new businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman has been doing spectacularly for several quarters and this was only OK, and that's not OK with investors," said Ken Crawford, who helps run $850 million in separate accounts for Argent Capital Management in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIXED TRENDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading and principal investment revenue fell 6 percent to $6.65 billion, paced by a 24 percent drop in debt and commodities trading revenue, the bank's largest business. Goldman said rising defaults on risky home loans had hurt the mortgage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Business trends during the quarter were mixed," Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a conference call. "Where equities recovered after a weak start, several businesses saw reduced volatility and risk appetite from our clients, compared with a very robust first quarter. At the same time, corporate and financial sponsor activity did accelerate to record levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading results last year included a $700 million gain from a power plant sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's traders took on even more risk in bonds and stocks, with average daily value at risk reaching $133 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Michael Hecht of Bank of America said he was disappointed that Goldman, which is bigger and broader than Lehman, was hurt more by subprime mortgage weakness. Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N on Thursday said earnings fell by a third due to mortgages and the write-down of a trading venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from principal investments more than doubled to $784 million from last year, fueled by a range of company and real estate stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the quarter also demonstrated the risk of making big direct bets with house money, as Goldman's stakes in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK) and Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T) fell in value and trimmed overall earnings by 14 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECORD BACKLOG IN INVESTMENT BANKING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking income rose 18 percent to a record $1.72 billion for the quarter, as advisory fees from mergers and acquisitions rose 17 percent. Debt underwriting revenue rose by 50 percent, powered by loans for leveraged buyouts. These gains helped overcome a 26 percent drop in stock underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman this year is the top adviser for MA and public stock offerings worldwide. Looking ahead, Viniar said the backlog of investment banking business set a record, surpassing its previous high in the second quarter of 2000, when the 1990s technology stock bull market peaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from the bank's asset management arm increased 11 percent to $1.06 billion, as managed assets rose 28 percent to $758 billion. Noncompensation costs rose 16 percent to $1.86 billion, with headcount soaring 17 percent to 28,012 people from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Viniar predicted that problems in subprime would get worse before they get better. Goldman previously expressed interest in acquiring subprime businesses, but Viniar said the company would be "very cautious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there is pain yet to be felt in some structured vehicles and potential default rates," Viniar said. "I don't think we're through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares were down $7.36, or 3.2 percent, at $226.28 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock, which hit an all-time high of $233.94 at the end of May, rose 4 percent during the fiscal quarter, outperforming the 1.3 percent gain in the AMEX Securities Broker-Dealer Index .XBD, but lagged the SP 500 .SPX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) Chief Financial Officer David Viniar predicted that the U.S. subprime mortgage market, which has suffered rising defaults and generated losses for lenders over the past year, will get worse before it gets better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The subprime business continues to be weak. We have not seen the bottom in the market. There will be more pain felt by people as it works its way through system," Viniar told reporters in a conference call on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said subprime weakness contributed to the decline in fixed-income trading results for the second quarter. He added, though, that problems in the market for the riskiest home buyers still has not spread to other debt markets, as was feared earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So far we still have not seen any contagion," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L)
and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) have put North Sea oil and gas
fields with around 74,000 barrels per day of production up for
sale, as the oil majors reduce their involvement in the mature

private-equity backed Fairfield Energy on the sale of some of
the assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many analysts believe that the oil majors should reduce
their exposure to the North Sea and reinvest money in more
prospective regions but UK-registered companies like Shell and
rival BP Plc (BP.L) are cautious about showing a lack of
commitment to the UK North Sea.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Joseph A. Giannone &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N), once excluded from Blackstone Group LP's pending $4 billion initial public offering, in the end have been invited to participate in the biggest market event this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The two Wall Street titans are, however, stuck in the cheap seats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In its latest IPO proxy, the private equity investment giant listed 17 underwriters led by Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Citigroup Inc. (C.N) for an offering expected next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman and JPMorgan, conspicuously absent from the largest U.S. offering of the year when filed in March, were quietly added to the list in Blackstone's latest IPO prospectus on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But they were only listed among 11 third-tier co-managers that will buy and distribute Blackstone stock to investors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's unusual for Goldman to play second fiddle. Typically it's 'If we're not book-runner, we're not interested,'" said Clemson University assistant professor Daniel Bradley, who tracks IPO activity. "This is a high-profile deal." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Officials from Morgan Stanley, Citi, Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Blackstone [BG.UL], one of the world's largest private equity investment firms, filed in March to sell more than 133 million shares, a 10 percent stake, in an IPO that could raise $4.75 billion. It would be the sixth-largest U.S. IPO ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Below Morgan Stanley and Citi, co-managers in the initial prospectus included Merrill Lynch MER.N, Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But Wall Street was abuzz when Goldman, the world's top stock underwriter, and JPMorgan, an important financial backer to Blackstone over the years, were left out. Their absence immediately prompted speculation that the banks had landed in Blackstone's doghouse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sources at the time said Goldman and JPMorgan were sidelined because they had already agreed to take public rival private equity firm Apollo Management. Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment; no Apollo deal has been registered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But other people familiar with the Blackstone deal contend Goldman's absence reflected concern among several buyout firms that the Wall Street financier and merger adviser had grown too aggressive as an equity investor and competitor for buyouts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As Blackstone unveiled plans to go public, Goldman executives disclosed the bank would soon close a $20 billion fund, the largest ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Blackstone spokesman, who declined to comment on the IPO, denied there was ever bad blood between the firm and Goldman. "We're still doing deals with them. We're working very closely with them," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Regardless, Goldman and JPMorgan won't be getting rich off their Blackstone IPO work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    An underwriting source said Blackstone negotiated a reduced underwriting fee of about 3.75 percent -- well below the standard 7 percent fee for U.S. IPOs -- or roughly $150 million to $180 million to be shared among 17 banks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The fees are especially thin for the 11 co-managers added to the amended proxy on Monday: ABN AMRO Rothschild AAH.AS, Bank of America (BAC.N), Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N, Lazard Capital Markets (LAZ.N), Nikko Citigroup, SEB Enskilda, UBS (UBSN.VX), Wachovia Corp. WB.N and Wells Fargo and Co. (WFC.N), along with Goldman and JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "These guys in the lower tier on this deal are not getting much in terms of the underwriting proceeds," Clemson's Bradley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Braden Reddall; Reuters messaging: joseph.giannone.reuters.com@reuters.net;+1 646 223 6184) Keywords: BLACKSTONE/IPO GOLDMAN .

&lt;p&gt; (Add details, analysts' comments, stock action)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 14 (Reuters) - Shares of Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd. (Chalco) (2600.HK), the world's No.3 alumina producer,
jumped more than 12 percent to an all-time high on Thursday after
Goldman Sachs upgraded it to buy from neutral, citing
accelerating aluminium demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The surge also came a day after Chalco said it was planning
discussions with Baotou Aluminum 600472, which is four-fifths
owned by Chalco's state parent, fuelling speculation of an asset
injection and talk of a further jump in its shares. For story,
click on [ID:HKG41232].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I wouldn't be surprised if Chalco ends up 15 percent on the
day," said Andrew Clarke, a trader at SG Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The asset injection story could spur further rerating since
it should lower (Chalco's) earnings volatility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hong Kong-listed shares of China's top alumina producer
(601600.SS) (ACH.N) hit a record high of HK$12.34 before closing
the morning at HK$12.12, for a 10.2 percent gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs nearly doubled its 12-month target price for
Chalco to HK$15.50 from HK$8.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Demand shows clear signs of acceleration, up 40 percent year
to date from 21 percent in 2006," the investment bank said in a
research report, adding that Beijing's mandate to curb the
expansion of smaller smelters should also benefit Chalco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe aluminum fundamentals could be at a turning point
in 2007," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chalco is eyeing Baotou's estimated 300,000 tonnes of annual
aluminium capacity, which could ramp up its own capabilities by
almost a 10th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chalco has expanded at a frenetic pace as Beijing
consolidates a fragmented, energy-intensive industry, trying to
become a major aluminium player along the lines of Alcan (AL.N)
and Alcoa (AA.N) -- an 8 percent shareholder -- with prices for
its main product alumina coming under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Chalco have surged 53 percent in the year so far,
outpacing a 7 percent gain in the index of Chinese companies
listed in Hong Kong .HSCE.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, June 14 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), the top
oil producer in Indonesia, will launch an enhanced oil recovery
project in the Minas field in a bid to boost production, an
official at the country's energy watchdog said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The plan over the next decade is of particular interest to
the market given the status of Minas crude as a regional
benchmark, along with its potential to boost flagging oil
output from Asia Pacific's only OPEC member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "BPMIGAS has approved the Minas oil recovery trial project.
We hope this project will produce good results to boost
Indonesia's oil production," Achmad Luthfi, the deputy chief of
watchdog BPMIGAS, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the Minas field, the largest in Indonesia, still
had big reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has struggled to maintain production and became a
net crude oil importer for the first time last year, an energy
ministry official had said, as OPEC's second-smallest member in
terms of output has failed to tap new oilfields fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nicole Hodgson, Chevron Asia's media adviser said BPMIGAS
and the company had studied a variety of technologies and had
agreed in principle to conduct limited scale field trials to
test the  performance of surfactant/polymer, the chemical being
eyed for the enhanced oil recovery project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We hope to start chemical injection by early 2011. We
expect results to be obtained by 2012," Hodgson told Reuters
via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By 2013 a decision is likely to be made on whether or not
to expand the use of this technology. It is too early to make
estimates on recovery or production rates," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A second BPMIGAS official, who declined to be identified,
said oil reserves in the Minas field were estimated at 4
billion barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We need technology to recover that. If we can produce 10
percent of that reserve, that is good for Indonesia," the
official said adding that production from U.S. major Chevron
was currently running at around 420,000 barrels per day (bpd).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia's overall crude oil output edged up to 845,300
bpd in May from April, helped by the return of some wells after
maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia produced 838,900 bpd of crude in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The country's condensate output also rose slightly to
114,700 in May from 114,200 bpd in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State oil firm Pertamina aims to boost crude output to
180,000-190,000 bpd next year, up from around 155,000 bpd in
2007, before raising it further to between 255,000 and 300,000
bpd by 2010, focusing on optimising production in domestic
fields, its chief executive had said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) plans to move its investment bank to a new tower at the office complex to be built on the World Trade Center site, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the government agency that controls the site, said in April that it was negotiating with the No. 3 U.S. banking group about building an office tower just south of the complex that was destroyed on September 11, 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    New York State Governor Eliot Spitzer alerted reporters in an advisory that he was holding a news conference on Thursday about a "major economic development announcement." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan declined to comment on the agreement to build the tower, initially reported by the Wall Street Journal on its Web site. Officials from Spitzer's offices and the Port Authority could not immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Previous reports had identified the former Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) building near Ground Zero as the probable site of a new JPMorgan building. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan's world headquarters would remain at its current site at 270 Park Avenue, the source said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    An agreement to move JPMorgan's investment bank, which employs 6,000 people in New York City, would be a latest sign of progress in the quest to redevelop the site near Ground Zero, which has proceeded in fits and starts since the September 11 attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last month, seven insurers agreed to pay an additional $2 billion to the Port Authority and developer Larry Silverstein to resolve all outstanding claims from the attacks, a move that was expected to speed redevelopment of the site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Christian Plumb, editing by Richard Chang; Reuters Messaging: christian.plumb.reuters.com@reuters.net +1 646 223-6134)) Keywords: JPMORGAN BUILDING &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Colombian drug kingpin was convicted of narcotics and money laundering charges on Friday for smuggling $100 million worth of cocaine into the United States on speedboats and in cranes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manuel Felipe Salazar-Espinosa, nicknamed "Hoover," was found guilty in federal court of importing cocaine via Panama and Mexico between 2002 and 2005, the U.S. Attorney's office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Salazar-Espinosa, who was extradited in 2006 from Cali, Colombia, helped launder between $12 million and $14 million in drug proceeds every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He headed a ring that smuggled cocaine by the ton aboard speedboats running from Colombia to Panama, court papers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugs were then shipped to Mexico hidden inside heavy machinery, including in the arm of a crane, and from there smuggled into the United States through a Mexican drug ring, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under an extradition agreement with Colombia, prosecutors promised to seek a prison term in years instead of the maximum life sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With today's conviction, Hoover Salazar-Espinosa's 20-year-long career of narcotics trafficking and money laundering has come to an end," U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, June 15 (Reuters) - Shares of the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) rose nearly 3 percent on Friday after an analyst upgraded the company to a "buy" rating, citing the effect of share buybacks and a potentially stronger-than-expected performance at its Media Networks division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SMH Capital analyst David Miller, who previously had a "neutral" rating on Disney, said in a client note that the No. 2 U.S. entertainment company was set to profit from "a significant premium" on live ESPN sports programming as the debate continues on a new TV ratings system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He said Media Networks, which included ABC and ESPN, also would benefit from higher syndication fees from a number of series, such as the popular "Desperate Housewives," "Lost" and "Grey's Anatomy," that are headed for international syndication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Miller noted that Disney has authorization to repurchase 400 million shares and said the company could shrink its share count to 1.99 billion, where it stood in 2005 before Disney bought Pixar Animation Studio in an all-stock deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Miller, who does not own Disney shares, set a 12-month price target of $44 for the company's shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney shares were trading up 2.6 percent, or 87 cents per share, at $34.66 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Gina Keating, Editing by Derek Caney; Reuters Messaging: gina.keating.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 213 955 6776)) Keywords: DISNEY SHARES/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its rating on
Intel Corp. (INTC.O) and Raymond James resumed coverage of the
company with its top rating, sending the world's dominant
chipmaker's shares up more than 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman upgraded Intel to "buy" from "neutral," saying
smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (AMD.N) possible
move to outsource manufacturing will benefit Intel over the
long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "AMD's move to an outsourced manufacturing strategy is
likely to have negative repercussions for its product quality
and, in turn, its market share over the longer term," Goldman
analyst James Covello wrote in a note to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Covello said it will be difficult for AMD to maintain its
technology position while attempting to manufacture on foundry
technology while Intel will be manufacturing in-house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said the launch of AMD's new Barcelona
processor is likely to be delayed to October or November, while
Intel's Penryn processor may come early, further improving
Intel's near-term competitive positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its price target on Intel stock to $28
from $22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RAYMOND JAMES RESUMES INTEL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brokerage Raymond James resumed coverage of Intel with a
"strong buy" rating and a price target of $30, saying the
company has had the best product portfolio over the last decade
and should start to regain market share in all PC segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMD's poor timing in acquiring Canadian graphics chipmaker
ATI Technologies and a late and weak product and technology
roadmap are advantageous to Intel, analyst Hans Mosesmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mosesmann also resumed coverage of AMD with an
"underperform" rating saying the company did not fully
understand the challenges faced by ATI, which increased AMD's
execution risk overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel shares were trading up 82 cents at $24.05 in late
afternoon trade on the Nasdaq. AMD shares were down more than
1.5 percent at $13.57 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEMICONDUCTOR OPTIMISM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raymond James initiated coverage of the larger cap
semiconductor group with a positive predisposition over the
next two to three years due to improved structural industry
efficiencies and the emergence of Vista operating system

Nvidia Corp. (NVDA.O), and Altera Corp. (ALTR.O) with a "strong

8 percent.

&lt;p&gt;DETROIT (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer on Friday said a complaint lodged by Google Inc. (GOOG.O) was "baseless" as the software company was complying with a 2002 antitrust settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed with the Department of Justice in December, Google said a feature built into Microsoft's Windows Vista operating system that allows users to search a computer's hard drive did not leave room for competition from other desktop search applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google argues that this feature violates a consent decree that monitors Microsoft's behavior as part of its settlement with the U.S. government, which had accused the company of using its monopoly to harm competition by incorporating new features into its operating system at no additional costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to comply with the consent decree we signed with the U.S. government in recognition to the findings around our position with Windows," Ballmer said at the Detroit Economic Club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think all claims to the contrary are baseless," said Ballmer, a Detroit native, in response to a question from the audience following his speech to the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest quarrel between the two technology heavyweights reflects the growing competition between Microsoft, the world's largest maker of software that runs on a computer's hard drive, and Google, the leader in Web search and other services working on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In afternoon Nasdaq trade, Microsoft shares were up 5 cents at $30.57, while Google rose $3.29, or 0.7 percent, to $506.13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to midday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced for a
third day on Friday on reassuring inflation news and fresh
optimism about the tech sector after an upgrade of bellwether
Intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq climbed to its highest in more than six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A jump in the shares of Intel Corp. (INTC.O) triggered an
advance in technology stocks after Goldman Sachs raised its
rating on the world's dominant chip maker, to "buy" from
"neutral." The stock was up 3.4 percent at $24.02.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deal news also lent support, following a report that the
New York Mercantile Exchange NMX.N was exploring a sale.
Shares of the NYMEX, the world's largest energy market, rose 2
percent to $142.64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 99.58
points, or 0.73 percent, at 13,653.30, off its session high at
13,688.66. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 11.30
points, or 0.74 percent, at 1,534.27, below its session high
of 1,538.71.. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 23.24
points, or 0.89 percent, at 2,622.65. Earlier, the Nasdaq rose
to 2,630.51, its highest level in more than six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N), the world's biggest publicly
traded oil company, topped the list of the major advancers in
both the Dow and the SP 500 as oil prices climbed. Exxon's
stock was up 1.5 percent at $86.04. U.S. crude for July
delivery CLN7 was up 53 cents at $68.18 a barrel -- the
highest in nine months -- on concerns about low gasoline
supplies and increased violence in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We got exactly what we had hoped for, a very equities
friendly core CPI number," said Ted Oberhaus, manager of
equity trading Lord Abbett  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What we've been concerned about is higher interest rates
and the fact that would choke of the MA pipeline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street got some good news about the outlook for the
U.S. economy and interest rates before the opening bell, when
government data showed the core U.S. Consumer Price Index,
which excludes food and energy, rose only 0.1 percent in May,
below Wall Street's median forecast for a gain of 0.2
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tame inflation reading reinforced the view that the
Federal Reserve, which meets June 27-28, is likely to hold
interest rates steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A pullback in benchmark U.S. Treasury bond yields gave
investors a reason to buy shares of utilities, banks and other
companies especially sensitive to interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A much lower-than-expected reading in the
Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index did
not spoil the Street's party mood. The major indexes briefly
tirmmed gains on the news that the preliminary June reading
for the index was 83.7, the weakest in 10 months, as gasoline
prices soured consumers' mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But investors' attention quickly shifted back to the tame
inflation data and the indexes sharply extended their gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel ranked as the second-biggest gainer in both the SP
500 and the Nasdaq 100 .NDX. Intel, which also is one of the
30 stocks that make up the Dow average, also was among the top
five contributors to the Dow's advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq's biggest advancer was Apple Inc. (AAPL.O), up
1.2 percent at $120.17, continuing its recent climb spurred by
optimism about its soon-to-be-released iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note
US10YT=RR fell to 5.18 percent, down sharply from its climb
earlier this week to 5.33 percent -- above the fed funds rate
target of 5.25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An SP index of utility shares .GSPU rose 1.7 percent,
while an SP index of financial companies' shares .GSPF
advanced 0.6 percent. Higher bond yields in the past week had
dented the appeal of high dividend-paying stocks such as
utilities.

&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, California (Reuters) - The high priests of free software have congregated at Google Inc. (GOOG.O) headquarters this week to debate the future of the movement and face down recent patent threats by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading names of Linux, the world's biggest grassroots software phenomenon, are spending three days to Friday debating whether an increasingly commercial open source community should fight or ignore the world's largest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dressed in the alternative software movement's casual uniform of T-shirts and jeans, the group is coming to grips with internal divisions that sap at its success -- Linux is now used to power desktop computers, major Web sites, mobile phones -- since rival factions often create very similar products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as many of the world's top tech companies and corporate customers demand ever more from Linux, open source devotees still fight among themselves with the fervor of a tiny monastic order seeking to root out theological error in their midst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Guys: Be seekers of truth, not finders of contradiction," Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, organizer of the event, only half-jokingly told the 150 attendees of what is billed their "Collaboration Summit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux is the best-known variant of so-called open source software -- software that is freely available to the public to be used, revised and shared. Linux suppliers earn money selling improvements and technical services. By contrast, Microsoft charges for software and opposes freely sharing its code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Microsoft has sown dissension by claiming open source programs such as Linux violate 235 of its patents while striking deals to insulate the customers of two Linux suppliers -- Novell and Xandros -- from patent lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Linspire Inc., which sells Linux-based personal computers through Wal-Mart and other retailers, became the third company to strike a patent deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICROSOFT: ENEMY OR PUNCHING BAG?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the group is militantly opposed to Microsoft, which some attending the summit openly refer to as "the enemy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most believe Linux users control their own destinies and Microsoft's patent threats are just the latest attempts to create "fear, uncertainty and doubt" among customers. After closed-down sessions Thursday and Friday, the group aims to issue a consensus statement next week on what they plan to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Bottomley, who works as chief technology officer at Steeleye Technologies, is in charge of maintaining the software code used by Linux to transfer data between computers and peripheral devices like printers, a job he does for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottomley says Microsoft is unlikely to sue Linux customers because most Linux users also buy Microsoft. "Their customers are our customers," he said, adding that: "It's just bloody annoying. It gets everyone riled up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zend Technologies, developers of an open source programming language called PHP that is used in many Web sites, is seeking to remain neutral. Eighty percent of its customers use open source software, but it recently struck a deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Microsoft is a big company trying to make up its mind," said Zend Chief Executive Harold Goldberg, who is not taking part in the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the one hand Microsoft has a big established business it is trying to defend," Goldberg said. "On the other hand, there are those inside the company, though they won't admit it publicly, who see open source as the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WORKING TO WORK TOGETHER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first conference of the Linux Foundation, an umbrella advocacy group formed early in 2007 to unite two predecessors, Open Source Development Labs and the Free Standards Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are as many as 360 rival flavors of Linux, known as distributions, according to Distrowatch.com. This factionalism fuels rapid innovation but splits the energies of developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There really is a sense in many projects that there is an 'us' and a 'them'," said Mark Shuttlesworth, founder of Ubuntu, a free, desktop version of Linux that competes with Windows. "There are the folks who are inside a project and those who are outside a project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Linux Foundation boasts 70 corporate and non-profit backers, including Intel (INTC.O), Oracle ORCL.O, IBM (IBM.N), Cisco (CSCO.O), Motorola MOT.N, Nokia (NOK1V.HE), NTT (9432.T), Dell DELL.O, Red Hat (RHT.N) and Sun SUNW.O, along with major customers like ADP ADP.N, Bank of America (BAC.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux used to be worked on by professionals doing the work on their own time, said Jason Wacha, an expert on licensing Linux and attorney for MontaVista, a maker of Linux software for mobile and consumer electronics devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, I think (Linux) is being pushed by commercial forces ... Now a lot of people are being paid to do Linux as professionals," he said of how many top open-source developers now work for big-name companies like Google, HP and Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) and 
Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N are learning that it's a tough 
time to be in the U.S. mortgage business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But if earnings reports from the No. 1 and No. 5 U.S. 
investment banks on Thursday show anything, it's the importance 
of investment banks not keeping too many eggs in one basket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both banks suffered from rising mortgage defaults, which 
made lenders less likely to make home loans and reduced 
underwriting volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That helped depress fixed income trading revenues 21 
percent at Bear Stearns and 24 percent at Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Goldman Sachs, which is more diversified than Bear 
Stearns, still managed to eke out a profit increase for the 
quarter, while Bear Stearns' earnings fell 10 percent, or 33 
percent including a one-time write-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of both brokers fell following the release of 
results that deflated investor hopes lifted earlier this week 
by stellar results at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N. 
Bear Stearns shares rallied late in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three investment banks were haunted throughout the week 
by the debacle in lending to less creditworthy home buyers. 
Lehman disclosed on Wednesday that it would merge two 
residential mortgage units, cutting 400 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Bear Stearns put $4 billion of mortgage bonds on sale 
on Thursday to raise cash and cover reported losses in one of 
its hedge funds, fund managers and other sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Longer term, Goldman's broader array of businesses makes it 
likely to continue outperforming Bear Stearns, several analysts 
and portfolio managers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'd rather invest in a company that has a strong 
international business and equity business, in addition to a 
strong bond business," said Adam Compton, co-head of global 
financial stocks research at RCM Global Investors in San 
Francisco, which has some $150 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns is hiring internationally -- it is doubling 
its staff in London to more than 2,500 in the next few years, 
and opening a Paris office in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bear Stearns is late to the party. Right now, about 85 
percent of its revenues are from the United States. Compare 
that to Goldman Sachs, which generated more than half its 
revenue outside the U.S. in the second quarter, or Lehman which 
said on Tuesday that 48 percent of its revenue was 
international.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear also has a proportionately smaller investment banking 
business than Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs's advisory business 
generated about $709 million in revenue, or about 7 percent of 
total revenue, compared with $140 million, or about 5.6 percent 
at Bear. Advisory revenues are key for profits, since a very 
higher percentage of them end up as profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs shares trade at about 2.8 times their book 
value, or the accounting value of their assets minus 
liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's far higher than Bear Stearns' 1.6 times, but Goldman 
Sachs has a much higher return on equity, and so while Bear 
appears fairly valued, a case could be made that Goldman is 
undervalued, said Joe Dickerson, analyst at Atlantic Equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns' return on equity -- a measure of how 
efficient the company is at squeezing profits from its net 
assets -- was 15.6 percent excluding a one-time charge, 
compared with 26.7 percent for Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear's return on equity was hurt by the weak U.S. mortgage 
market, where defaults rose to a record high, an industry group 
said on Thursday.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SILVER LINING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear's profits for the second quarter were $361.7 million, 
down from $553.7 million a year earlier, while Goldman's were 
$2.33 billion, compared with $2.29 billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear's results included a $227 million write-down for 
assets linked to its New York Stock Exchange specialist unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not everything is gloomy for Bear Stearns. Its mortgage 
revenues rose compared to the first quarter, even if they were 
well off their levels of the second quarter of 2006, the 
company's chief financial officer said on a conference call. 
The company's hedge fund business is growing dramatically, CFO 
Sam Molinaro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Molinaro said Bear Stearns' exposure was minimal to the 
fund whose bonds were put on the block on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Joe Giannone in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, China (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp.(MSFT.O) has agreed to pay 94 million yuan ($12.3 million) for a stake in Sichuan Changhong Electric Co., a major maker of televisions and electrical appliances, the Chinese company said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies will cooperate to develop, make and market TVs, computers and other digital home-entertainment products, Sichuan Changhong (600839.SS) said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a memorandum of understanding, the Chinese company would place 15 million new shares with Microsoft at a price of 6.27 yuan each, a 37 percent discount to its last traded market price of 9.93 yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would give Microsoft a stake of nearly 1 percent in Sichuan Changhong, according to Reuters calculations. The U.S. software giant would be a long-term, strategic investor, Sichuan Changhong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese company, which posted sales of 4.97 billion yuan in the first quarter of 2007 as net profit climbed 24 percent from a year earlier to 96.32 million yuan, said it would soon present the deal to its board for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=7.62 yuan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Global retail sales of Walt Disney 
Co. consumer products are expected to rise 13 percent to a 
record $26 billion in fiscal 2007 and the company plans to 
nearly double that figure within seven years, Disney Consumer 
Product Chairman Andy Mooney told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney licenses its characters and intellectual property to 
manufacturers, and receives royalties and other revenue equal 
to a low double-digit percentage of retail sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has more than doubled global retail sales and 
diversified product lines since Mooney took over in 2000, when 
80 percent of sales came from Winnie the Pooh and Mickey Mouse 
merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With momentum from successful lines such as Disney 
Princesses, "Cars" and "Hannah Montana," Mooney said in a 
recent interview he expects the division to see double-digit 
annual growth as it heads for $50 billion in global retail 
sales in five to seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You have got four independently strong storytelling 
divisions that have the ability to create new intellectual 
property that ... could then be exploited by the other 
divisions," he said. "That is exactly the point that we have 
reached."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's retail sales have been bolstered in fiscal 2007, 
which ends on September 30, by rapid growth in its Princess and 
Fairies lines for girls and by the strong new "Cars" line for 
boys and Disney Channel lines for tweens (older pre-teenage 
children), Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Princesses, the largest global girls' franchise, is 
expected to grow 17.6 percent to $4 billion, while the 18- 
month-old Fairies line, aimed at older girls, is set to hit 
$800 million in fiscal 2007, Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Princess is a fundamental play pattern that's enduring. 
That's why we think the $4 billion figure we have is 
sustainable," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The year-old "Cars" franchise, aimed at young boys, 
continues to perform strongly and is expected to top $2 billion 
this fiscal year -- a level Mooney also believes is 
sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in uncharted territory (with Cars) because we have 
never seen this type of phenomenon where in the year post-DVD 
release we are actually experiencing growth not decline," he 
said. "We actually think that Cars is going to be our hallmark 
property for boys."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merchandise spun off from the Disney Channel's live action 
shows for tweens, including "Hannah Montana" and "High School 
Musical," will reach $400 million by the end of the fiscal 
year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, June 18 (Reuters) - The founder of Ubuntu Linux, a widely used version of the open-source operating system for personal computers, said he is not interested in a business partnership with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) as the software giant steps up its challenge to open-source software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have declined to discuss any agreement with Microsoft," Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth wrote on his blog in comments posted on Saturday at www.markshuttleworth.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shuttleworth said he wanted to refute media speculation that he might enter into such an deal after Microsoft signed agreements with three other Linux providers -- Novell Inc. NOVL.O, Linspire Inc. and Xandros Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The agreements call for the Linux companies to cooperate with Microsoft on making their products more compatible with its Windows operating system. The partnerships also provide legal protection to customers of those Linux companies over any potential patents violations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last month, Microsoft made its broadest challenge to date against Linux and other open-source software titles claiming that such programs violate 235 Microsoft patents and saying it will seek license fees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest software maker said that various open-source packages violate patents it holds in areas related to graphical user interfaces, e-mail programs and other technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Linux is the most popular type of open-source software, or computer programs that developers can download and modify as long as they share those changes with the public. The packages have gained in popularity over the past decade, taking market share away from Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Ubuntu is a user-friendly version of Linux and the most widely used distribution of Linux on desktop personal computers and laptops. Other large Linux distributors include Novell and Red Hat Inc. (RHT.N), whose products are widely used on server computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Personal computer maker Dell Inc. DELL.O last month started selling three personal computer models that come preloaded with Ubuntu Linux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Jim Finkle, editing by Richard Chang; jim.finkle@reuters.com, Reuters messaging: jim.finkle.reuters.com@reuters.net, + 1 617 367 4164)) Keywords: UBUNTU MICROSOFT/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (New throughout, adds byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N),
the third-largest U.S. bank, has hired Gordon Smith from
American Express Co. (AXP.N) to head its credit card unit,
replacing Richard Srednicki who plans to retire next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith, 48, had spent his entire career of more than 25
years at American Express, including the last two as head of
the global commercial card group. He led American Express's
consumer card services group from 2001 to 2005. Smith's
appointment is effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The card unit is one of JPMorgan's biggest businesses. It
accounted for 16 percent of profit and 19 percent of revenue in
the first quarter, generating net income of $765 million on
revenue of $3.68 billion. The unit's profit fell 15 percent
from a year earlier as credit losses increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has issued more than 150 million cards and ranks
among the three largest U.S. card issuers, along with Bank of
America Corp. (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc. (C.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith will join JPMorgan's operating committee and report
to Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. In an internal memo, Dimon
called Smith "highly experienced and respected in the
industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Srednicki, 59, once worked at Sears Roebuck  Co. as
president of the home services division, and he joined Chase
Manhattan Corp. in 2000, the same year it bought JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He oversaw JPMorgan's the launch of "contactless" credit
cards, which users wave past rather than swipe through
terminals. He also oversaw purchases of card portfolios from BP
Plc (BP.L), Kohl's Corp. (KSS.N) and Sears Canada (SCC.TO), and
has had oversight of the Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N card
portfolio that Bank One Corp. acquired in 2004. JPMorgan bought
that bank the same year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a memo to employees, Srednicki said he told Dimon of his
retirement plans several months ago. He said he will work with
Smith on the transition. None of the executives was immediately
available for interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anre Williams will become head of global commercial cards
at American Express, while Valerie Soranno Keating will become
executive vice president of global marketing and
source-to-settle, which involves electronic payments, a
spokeswoman for the travel and card services company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams was previously executive vice president of U.S.
commercial cards, and Soranno Keating was president of
travelers cheques and prepaid services, the spokeswoman said.

the maker of electronic instruments to its analyst focus list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it views the company's high level of

measurement peers in the coming months owing to its healthy
operating margins in previous cycles, its new products thrust
and its share buyback plans, among others, the brokerage added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan set a June 2008 price target of $39 on the
company's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company rose nearly 7 percent to $33.95 in
midday trade on the Nasdaq. It hit a new year-high of $34.33
earlier in the session.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 18 (Reuters) - U.S. coal stocks fell after Goldman
Sachs downgraded the sector to "cautious" from "neutral" saying
the "massive over-production" seen in 2006 would likely lead to
continued high inventory levels in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coal stocks have rallied 34 percent since the beginning of
January, anticipating a better pricing environment in coming
months, Goldman noted, adding that it expects comfortable
inventory levels in 2007 and fairly stagnant pricing for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage downgraded Arch Coal Inc. (ACI.N) and
Foundation Coal Holdings Inc. FCL.N to "sell" from "buy" and
Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR.N) to "neutral" from "buy."
It upgraded Consol Energy Inc. (CNX.N) to "buy" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ARCH COAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman cut its rating on the mining company saying its
business is nearly all U.S. thermal base and has significant
un-priced tonnage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were down almost 4 percent at $37.60
in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALPHA NATURAL RESOURCES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage downgraded the Appalachian coal producer
citing valuation and the cautious view on the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company fell almost 4 percent to $19.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONSOL ENERGY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman raised the coal miner as it considers the company
is well positioned to achieve better pricing and margins than
others. The shares were up almost 0.5 percent at $48.14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOUNDATION COAL HOLDINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage downgraded the company saying the stock has
rallied beyond what can be justified by the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were down more than 2.5 percent at
$41.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among other coal companies, Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU.N)
was down almost 3 percent at $50.74, Massey Energy Co. MEE.N
fell nearly 4 percent to $26.91 and International Coal Group
(ICO.N) was down almost 2 percent at $6.20. All the three
stocks are rated "neutral" by Goldman.

&lt;p&gt;June 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its rating on
Symantec Corp. (SYMC.O) and added the world's largest
security-software maker to its Americas buy list, sending the
company's shares up more than two percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said its positive view on the stock was
driven by impressive upcoming releases of the company's
flagship products and aggressive buybacks, among other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Symantec is organizationally and competitively healthier
since the Veritas acquisition that closed more than two years
ago, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman raised its June-quarter earnings per share estimate
for the company to $0.22 from $0.20, saying it believes
consensus estimates are too conservative post some difficult
quarters driven in large part by revenue recognition changes
that should reverse in part this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage upgraded Symantec to "buy" from "neutral" and
raised its price target to $25 from $21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares were trading up 47 cents at $20.17 in

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) may acquire more software companies this year following two recent purchases as it tries to boost software's share of total IBM profit to 50 percent, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. is banking on software, which accounts for 20 percent of revenue but generates 40 percent of pretax earnings, to lift overall profitability of a company that spans computer hardware, services and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gross profit margins at the company's software unit, led by Steve Mills, are typically the highest of IBM's four main businesses and stood at 83.6 percent in the first quarter. The hardware unit's profit margin, by comparison, was 34.8 percent, and global technology services came in at 29.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM of Armonk, New York, is the world's second-largest software maker, behind Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area where IBM sees opportunity is selling software to companies that repackage it with their own software. For example, IBM last week announced an expansion of a deal with network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO.O) under which Cisco will use IBM software to help customers better manage their communications networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said its business in that market, called OEM for original equipment manufacturer, is growing at a double-digit annual percentage rate following acquisitions in recent years. The company has signed more than 4,500 deals with companies that use IBM software in their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a good opportunity out there," Mills said in an interview. "We're moving more and more toward the commercial off-the-shelf model" in which customers buy IBM software and use it in their own applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry researcher IDC estimates the market for such products at about $25 billion annually, said Paul Edwards, program director for software sales channels at IDC. Among the fastest-growing segments is security software, Edwards said, an area in which IBM has been expanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM earlier this month announced the acquisitions of Watchfire Corp., a privately held security and compliance testing software firm, and Sweden's Telelogic AB TLOG.ST, which IBM is buying for about $750 million. Financial terms of the Watchfire purchase were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telelogic's products help companies model, build and test complex systems such as aircraft radar and automotive anti-lock braking systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies will add to IBM's original equipment manufacturer software business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Software is the most important part of IBM from a profitability perspective," said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research Inc. in Scottsdale, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They also hope to find some room for growth in the slowest-growing part of the company," he added, referring to services. "Acquisitions that straddle that area make great sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said in March it planned to keep up the "accelerated" pace of acquisitions set in 2006, when it bought 13 companies for $4.8 billion in cash. Last month, IBM said it planned to boost software's share of total profit to 50 percent in 2010 from 40 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2006 acquisitions included $862 million for Micromuse Inc., which makes network management software for banks, telecommunications carriers, governments and retailers. IBM also paid $1.61 billion for FileNet Corp., whose software helps companies simplify business processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Telelogic purchase, if approved, would be IBM's 45th software firm acquisition since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. unveiled on Sunday a new brand name for its Internet-based television platform, a service deployed by 10 companies including ATT Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Mediaroom, formerly known as Microsoft Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), will link with computers found in the home to allow users to access a PC hard drive to listen to music or view photos on a TV screen, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The television push by the world's largest software maker aims to deliver TV over high-speed Internet networks and hopes the software will eventually open up the TV to a world of services already on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Mediaroom will also enable some applications that access the Internet without a Web browser, so users can view streaming online video or look at photos uploaded onto the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it will introduce a toolkit to allow developers to create applications for the Mediaroom platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) has agreed to pay 94 million yuan ($12.3 million) for a stake in Sichuan Changhong Electric Co. (600839.SS) and will form a cooperative alliance with the TV and electrical appliance maker, the Chinese company said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the nearly 1 percent stake sale, the two companies will cooperate to develop, make and market TVs, computers and other digital home-entertainment products, said Sichuan Changhong in a stock filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project will face challenges that have dogged several such collaborations in the past, but the market is now more mature and the deal gives Microsoft a foot in the door with a potentially key player, said Sigurd Leung, head of IT research at Beijing-based Analysys International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changhong is a state-backed company, so for Microsoft to get 1 percent is still quite significant," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft's move echoed its 1999 "Venus project", an operating system that would allow Chinese electronics firms to combine a Web browser, PC and video compact disc player in a single box atop TVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That project eventually failed, because of low-speed Internet connections and lack of good content," Leung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has since become the second-largest Internet market after the United States, with around 140 million Web users and growing use of high-speed broadband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This time, the project is also not guaranteed to succeed. Others have also tried it for some time, without much obvious success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a memorandum of understanding, the Chinese company would place 15 million new shares with Microsoft at a price of 6.27 yuan each, a 43 percent discount to its last traded market price of 10.92 yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changhong's shares rose their daily 10 percent limit on Monday, helping to lift other technology stocks including TCL Corp. 000100.SZ, which rose 4.72 percent, and Datang Telecom Technology Co. (600198.SS), up 5.02 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would give Microsoft a stake of nearly 1 percent in Sichuan Changhong, according to Reuters calculations. The U.S. software giant would be a long-term, strategic investor, Sichuan Changhong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese company, which posted sales of 4.97 billion yuan in the first quarter of 2007 while net profit climbed 24 percent from a year earlier to 96.32 million yuan, said it would soon present the deal to its board for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 7.62 Yuan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. launched a redesigned MSN portal optimized for mobile phones on Sunday, stepping up its offering at a time when more powerful devices increase the demand for richer content on handsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. mobile Internet use still represents only a fraction of computer-based Web usage, but technology heavyweights like Microsoft see increasingly powerful mobile phones and faster networks opening the door for new services and content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We firmly believe there is an inflection point here," said Phil Holden, Microsoft's director of mobile Web services. "There's a new battle, a new frontline developing on the mobile phone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new MSN Mobile portal -- mobile.msn.com -- offers news, sports information, entertainment features and access to services like e-mail, search, maps and instant messaging all on one page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a user accesses the portal, the MSN platform detects the handset and optimizes the site for that device, adjusting things like font sizes for different screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of U.S. mobile Internet users is expected to more than triple to 110 million in 2011 from the current 32 million, according to Sterling Market Intelligence and Opus Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft faces a lot of competition in the space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its Web competitors Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc. are trying to establish a mobile Internet presence while wireless carriers want to keep their consumers close with portals of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate prize for all the players is to gain a foothold in the market for mobile advertising. ABI Research has forecast global mobile marketing and advertising to increase sixfold to $19 billion by 2011 from an estimated $3 billion by the end of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will not place advertising on the portal right away, but said it expects to have either banner, text or click-to-call ads in place this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of the new MSN Mobile portal comes a few weeks before Apple Inc. releases its highly anticipated iPhone, which features a Safari browser that allows users to view full Web pages by zooming in and out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greg Sterling, founding principal of research firm Sterling Market Intelligence, said the iPhone and the new MSN portal reflect how companies are trying to address consumer dissatisfaction with surfing the Internet on mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The majority of users are not surfing the mobile Internet yet, but there is pent-up demand for content on mobile phones," said Sterling, noting that small screens and slow networks contributed to a poor experience for most users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. is hoping a fractured fairy tale that swaps Manhattan for a magic kingdom, a divorce lawyer for a prince, and roaches and pigeons for wholesome forest creatures will turn into its newest film franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Enchanted," set for a November 21 release, pokes fun at old Disney films such as "Sleeping Beauty" or "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" where the heroine surrounds herself with cuddly creatures or people whistling happy tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the movie represents a big risk for the studio to turn into a profit-making franchise with numerous sequels, such as its "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney would not disclose how much the film cost to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony of Disney flaunting the conventions of the very films on which the company was built was one idea that excited the film's makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really difficult material," director Kevin Lima told Reuters following a news conference on Monday. "What it really took is ... someone who understood the heritage, who loved it. Someone who wasn't afraid of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney executives knew "the only way this was going to work is if we can take the 'Mickey' out of ourselves, so to speak, so we can look back at who we are and be able to laugh," Lima said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether "Enchanted" could be a franchise film, he said, "We all hope," and added that already he was thinking about ideas for a sequel featuring the same key characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Enchanted" blends old-style, hand-drawn animation as well as live action to turn the idea of fairy tales upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It begins in the animated world of Andalasia, where Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) is preparing to marry her handsome Prince Edward (James Marsden), but ends up in the real world of Times Square at rush hour after the ubiquitous wicked queen (Susan Sarandon) pushes Giselle down an enchanted well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lima, a longtime Disney animator who directed "Tarzan" and "101 Dalmatians" and designed characters for "The Little Mermaid" and "Aladdin," said he drew on Disney fairy tale cliches to come up with the right tone for "Enchanted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney did not disclose whether the actors have signed multi-picture contracts to come back for a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A movie about a rat in a kitchen may not appear to be the best hook for a high-end merchandising campaign, but Walt Disney Co. is using the upcoming film "Ratatouille" to expand its move into upscale branding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animated Pixar film about a cuisine-loving rat who risks his life to follow his passion for French cooking will debut in theaters on June 29. It will be accompanied by a small but posh merchandising program featuring items that appeal to the gourmet sensibility in adults, while attempting to cultivate a taste for the finer things in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given that so much of the movie is set in a kitchen, it's fairly logical to go from there to a high-end collection," Disney Consumer Products Chairman Andy Mooney said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to toys, books, stationery and video games, the program includes bedding, cookware and tableware for kids and adults sold at the high-end kitchen store chain Sur La Table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, Disney will offer red and white wines to compliment the film's backdrop, a five-star Parisian restaurant, as well as cheese platters, both from Costco Wholesale Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrefour will carry "Ratatouille"-branded water, tomato sauces, milk, cheese and yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am totally confident that everything will sell through rapidly so we'll probably do a higher level of business around the DVD release," Mooney said. "I think we're going to have a good year(-long) run with 'Ratatouille.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has had a better run with luxury goods than Mooney said he expected, although taking the brand upscale was one of his priorities when he took over the division in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upscale marketing push marks a different approach for the company, which for decades made its mark using the mass appeal of family-oriented movies, theme parks and related merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company does not break out sales from its high-end products or costs related to designing those goods, Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEEPING MASS MARKET TIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Disney's consumer products division has strengthened its relationships with mass market retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Carrefour and C and A, which Mooney said he believed "were destined to become bigger and global, and we wanted to grow with them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having a significant presence in mass (market) and having committed to growing with mass (market retailers), we felt that simultaneously we had to go up-market, which is a challenge," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney began its push into the upscale market by giving top clothing designers access to the company's archives for inspiration. The result was a line of casual couture, called Disney Vintage, sold at the world's priciest boutiques that later drove the company's mass market apparel sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You get influential people who show up (at high-end boutiques) and wear the stuff, like celebrities, particularly in Los Angeles," Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But more important, I would argue is the buyers for mass channels show up there ... to look because they figure whatever's happening there is going to be happening in their stores in 12 months or 24 months from now," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lines of jewelry and home furnishings -- including high thread-count linens, silverware and china -- as well as couture wedding dresses and furniture inspired by Walt Disney's life and era have followed, licensed to category leaders such as Drexel Heritage, or up-and-comers like Kidada Jones and Kirstie Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Stone, chief executive of the Beanstalk Group, said Mooney was "doing a smart thing" by positioning Disney at both ends of the price spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a multi-channel strategy," Stone said. "Disney is not abandoning the mass market, as a matter of fact, they are mining it, not with a shovel, with earth movers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Disney characters appear in many of the luxe products, although designers often draw on color schemes, background art or themes from the company's animated movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We very much want to move upscale because we think moving upscale is good for the brand, it's turned out to be better than we anticipated for the business, bigger business than we thought it would be," Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Silverstein, a senior partner with The Boston Consulting Group and author of "Treasure Hunt: Inside the Mind of the New Consumer," pegs the total new luxury market worldwide at close to $1.5 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The segments in which Disney has a presence -- apparel, jewelry, travel and home goods -- account for around $500 billion worldwide, Silverstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney is a fascinating brand for core consumers, it has tremendous pull and value," Silverstein said. "It is not a luxury by old definitions. It is not for aristocrats only. But it is a brand that the upper- and upper-middle income consume at a high rate."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Exxon Mobil comment in paragraphs 10-12, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tom Miles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, June 19 (Reuters) - Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) asked
the government on Tuesday to block an Exxon-led (XOM.N) project
from selling gas to China, which would remove a challenge to its
Asia strategy and seal its absolute control of gas exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Alexander Ananenkov said the
gas from Sakhalin-1 on the Pacific coast was needed to supply
Russia's Far East and plan to export 8 billion cubic metres
(bcm) a year to China would leave the domestic market short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We consider it necessary for a directive to be issued and
Sakhalin-1 gas to be sold to Gazprom, so we could supply gas to
Russia's regions, and for the gas not to be exported as proposed
by Exxon Mobil," Russian news agencies quoted Ananenkov as
saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Demand in the four Far Eastern regions alone is more than
15 bcm," he told a meeting of Russia's Far East socioeconomic
development council, chaired by Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stopping Exxon's Chinese plan would keep all Russian gas out
of China, despite its thirst for energy supplies. An agreement
on Russian gas pipelines has stalled because China is unwilling
to pay as much for its gas as Gazprom wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom is building an Asian export strategy on the basis of
the huge Sakhalin-2 project, next to Sakhalin-1, and is trying
to shore up domestic supplies to give it free rein in exports, a
strategy it has already employed in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom bought control of Sakhalin-2 at a knock-down price
from Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and its Japanese partners, who
were obliged to sell up after a campaign of criticism from
Russian officials and threats of crippling licence withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal put Gazprom in charge of a huge liquefied natural
gas (LNG) plant due to come on stream next year. It wants to
expand the plant to supply Asia's emerging LNG market, but first
it must guarantee the domestic market will be fully supplied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom told Reuters earlier this month that it was in talks
with Exxon about buying all the gas from Sakhalin-1, whose
shareholders also include state-controlled Rosneft (ROSN.MM),
ONGC (ONGC.BO) and a Japanese consortium, Sodeco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon signed a preliminary agreement in 2004 to supply
Sakhalin-1 gas to Chinese firm CNPC but it has also held talks
with Japan and India, which want to import its gas as LNG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spokeswoman Jeanne Miller told Reuters the firm was
evaluating potential gas sales to China and was conducting
preliminary studies into the feasibility of a pipeline to
northeast China, the nearest part of China to Sakhalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've been in discussions with Gazprom about all potential
options for delivering the pipeline gas there," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gazprom may also face opposition from Rosneft, the main
force on Sakhalin until the Gazprom-Shell deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One investment banker said Rosneft, long a rival of Gazprom,
would want to keep the right to sell its gas even if it was
processed by Gazprom's LNG plant at Sakhalin-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think Rosneft want Gazprom to push them around," he
said. "They won't want to lose the ability to trade the gas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 are production sharing agreements,
excluding them from Gazprom's legal monopoly on gas exports. But
Deputy Energy Minister Andrei Dementyev said Exxon Mobil still
needed government approval if it wanted to export gas to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Without this gas there won't be any regional balance," he
told the meeting with Fradkov. "(Exxon) may be autonomous in its
intentions, but when it comes to putting them into practice, all
gas deliveries are linked by the single supply system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another field on Gazprom's wishlist is Sakhalin-3, a licence
Russia may award this year or next. Ananenkov said it could be
on stream in 2014, until when Gazprom would need Sakhalin-1's
gas to meet Russian demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To further cover domestic supplies in eastern Russia,
Gazprom signed a deal this week with Urals Energy (UEN.L) and is
trying to lock in another deposit, TNK-BP's huge Kovykta field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom is in talks with TNK-BP and its parent, BP (BP.L),
about taking a controlling stake in Kovykta, which cannot supply
the Chinese export market without Gazprom's cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gazprom is in no rush to supply China and says Kovykta
will not be required for exports until 2015. The stalemate over
China's pipelines has left it with potentially spare gas at home
and made Sakhalin-2 the mainstay of its Asian export strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TNK-BP, which is under threat of losing the licence for
Kovykta, has said it would welcome Gazprom as a controlling
shareholder in the East Siberian field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom has said any agreement on Kovykta is likely to be
part of a wider deal and may involve other BP and TNK-BP assets
in Russia or abroad. It is also interested in Sakhalin-4 and
Sakhalin-5, 49 percent owned by BP and 51 percent by Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Douglas Busvine and Michael Erman)

Under Immersion's sublicense agreement with Microsoft, in the event of a settlement with Sony Computer Entertainment, Immersion is obligated to pay Microsoft a minimum of $15.0 mln for any amounts received from Sony up to $100.0 mln, plus 25% of any amounts over $100.0 mln up to $150.0 mln, and 17.5% of any amounts over $150.0 mln.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Global retail sales of Walt Disney 
Co. consumer products are expected to rise 13 percent to a 
record $26 billion in fiscal 2007 and the company plans to 
nearly double that figure within seven years, Disney Consumer 
Product Chairman Andy Mooney told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney licenses its characters and intellectual property to 
manufacturers, and receives royalties and other revenue equal 
to a low double-digit percentage of retail sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has more than doubled global retail sales and 
diversified product lines since Mooney took over in 2000, when 
80 percent of sales came from Winnie the Pooh and Mickey Mouse 
merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With momentum from successful lines such as Disney 
Princesses, "Cars" and "Hannah Montana," Mooney said in a 
recent interview he expects the division to see double-digit 
annual growth as it heads for $50 billion in global retail 
sales in five to seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You have got four independently strong storytelling 
divisions that have the ability to create new intellectual 
property that ... could then be exploited by the other 
divisions," he said. "That is exactly the point that we have 
reached."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's retail sales have been bolstered in fiscal 2007, 
which ends on September 30, by rapid growth in its Princess and 
Fairies lines for girls and by the strong new "Cars" line for 
boys and Disney Channel lines for tweens (older pre-teenage 
children), Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Princesses, the largest global girls' franchise, is 
expected to grow 17.6 percent to $4 billion, while the 18- 
month-old Fairies line, aimed at older girls, is set to hit 
$800 million in fiscal 2007, Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Princess is a fundamental play pattern that's enduring. 
That's why we think the $4 billion figure we have is 
sustainable," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The year-old "Cars" franchise, aimed at young boys, 
continues to perform strongly and is expected to top $2 billion 
this fiscal year -- a level Mooney also believes is 
sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in uncharted territory (with Cars) because we have 
never seen this type of phenomenon where in the year post-DVD 
release we are actually experiencing growth not decline," he 
said. "We actually think that Cars is going to be our hallmark 
property for boys."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merchandise spun off from the Disney Channel's live action 
shows for tweens, including "Hannah Montana" and "High School 
Musical," will reach $400 million by the end of the fiscal 
year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst projection, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on
Wednesday that U.S. health regulators will approve its novel
AIDS drug called maraviroc once certain conditions have been
met, although the world's biggest drugmaker did not elaborate
on what was necessary to obtain outright approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer received a so-called approvable letter from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for the twice-a-day pill that is
the first drug designed to keep the HIV virus that causes AIDS
from entering healthy immune cells. Older AIDS medicines attack
the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it was in discussions with the FDA to
address the agency's outstanding questions and finalize the
product labeling as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry analysts have projected annual maraviroc sales of
about $500 million by 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug may offer a new option to patients who are not
responding to current medicines. An estimated 25,000 to 40,000
U.S. AIDS patients resist treatment with current drugs meant to
keep the virus at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To date, more than 2,000 patients worldwide have received
or are currently receiving treatment with maraviroc through
clinical trials, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 45 percent of patients who took maraviroc in Pfizer
studies had their HIV suppressed to undetectable levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maraviroc blocks the CCR5 co-receptor that serves as a main
doorway for the HIV virus into immune cells. HIV needs to get
into the cells to replicate.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. said on Wednesday it has discontinued trials of an experimental lung cancer drug licensed from Coley Pharmaceutical Group COLY.O after an independent review committee deemed it ineffective, spurring a 60 percent decline in Coley shares . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The (committee) concluded that the risk-benefit profile did not justify continuation of the trials," Pfizer (PFE.N) said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The New York-based drugmaker, which is trying to become a major force in oncology, said the canceled trials include two late-stage and two mid-stage studies of the medicine, which it licensed from Coley in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The compound, called PF-3512676, was no more effective in combination with chemotherapy than chemotherapy alone, according to an analysis by the independent data safety monitoring committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It is Coley's only drug in late-stage trials, making it the company's most important drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coley shares were down $5.06 to $3.43 in heavy afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Pfizer was down 44 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $25.77 on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a 0.9 percent decline for the American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cowen and Co. had predicted the medicine, if approved, would generate annual sales of $100 million by 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by John Wallace; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER COLEY/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A movie about a rat in a kitchen 
may not appear to be the best hook for a high-end merchandising 
campaign, but Walt Disney Co. is using the upcoming film 
"Ratatouille" to expand its move into upscale branding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The animated Pixar film about a cuisine-loving rat who 
risks his life to follow his passion for French cooking will 
debut in theaters on June 29. It will be accompanied by a small 
but posh merchandising program featuring items that appeal to 
the gourmet sensibility in adults, while attempting to 
cultivate a taste for the finer things in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given that so much of the movie is set in a kitchen, it's 
fairly logical to go from there to a high-end collection," 
Disney Consumer Products Chairman Andy Mooney said in an 
interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to toys, books, stationery and video games, the 
program includes bedding, cookware and tableware for kids and 
adults sold at the high-end kitchen store chain Sur La Table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the first time, Disney will offer red and white wines 
to compliment the film's backdrop, a five-star Parisian 
restaurant, as well as cheese platters, both from Costco 
Wholesale Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carrefour will carry "Ratatouille"-branded water, tomato 
sauces, milk, cheese and yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am totally confident that everything will sell through 
rapidly so we'll probably do a higher level of business around 
the DVD release," Mooney said. "I think we're going to have a 
good year(-long) run with 'Ratatouille."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has had a better run with luxury goods than Mooney 
said he expected, although taking the brand upscale was one of 
his priorities when he took over the division in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The upscale marketing push marks a different approach for 
the company, which for decades made its mark using the mass 
appeal of family-oriented movies, theme parks and related 
merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company does not break out sales from its high-end 
products or costs related to designing those goods, Mooney 
said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KEEPING MASS MARKET TIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Disney's consumer products division has 
strengthened its relationships with mass market retailers such 
as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Carrefour and C and A, which Mooney 
said he believed "were destined to become bigger and global, 
and we wanted to grow with them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Having a significant presence in mass (market) and having 
committed to growing with mass (market retailers), we felt that 
simultaneously we had to go up-market, which is a challenge," 
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney began its push into the upscale market by giving top 
clothing designers access to the company's archives for 
inspiration. The result was a line of casual couture, called 
Disney Vintage, sold at the world's priciest boutiques that 
later drove the company's mass market apparel sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You get influential people who show up (at high-end 
boutiques) and wear the stuff, like celebrities, particularly 
in Los Angeles," Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But more important, I would argue is the buyers for mass 
channels show up there ... to look because they figure 
whatever's happening there is going to be happening in their 
stores in 12 months or 24 months from now," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lines of jewelry and home furnishings -- including high 
thread-count linens, silverware and china -- as well as couture 
wedding dresses and furniture inspired by Walt Disney's life 
and era have followed, licensed to category leaders such as 
Drexel Heritage, or up-and-comers like Kidada Jones and Kirstie 
Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Stone, chief executive of the Beanstalk Group, said 
Mooney was "doing a smart thing" by positioning Disney at both 
ends of the price spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a multi-channel strategy," Stone said. "Disney is not 
abandoning the mass market, as a matter of fact, they are 
mining it, not with a shovel, with earth movers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No Disney characters appear in many of the luxe products, 
although designers often draw on color schemes, background art 
or themes from the company's animated movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We very much want to move upscale because we think moving 
upscale is good for the brand, it's turned out to be better 
than we anticipated for the business, bigger business than we 
thought it would be," Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Silverstein, a senior partner with The Boston 
Consulting Group and author of "Treasure Hunt: Inside the Mind 
of the New Consumer," pegs the total new luxury market 
worldwide at close to $1.5 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The segments in which Disney has a presence -- apparel, 
jewelry, travel and home goods -- account for around $500 
billion worldwide, Silverstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Disney is a fascinating brand for core consumers, it has 
tremendous pull and value," Silverstein said. "It is not a 
luxury by old definitions. It is not for aristocrats only. But 
it is a brand that the upper- and upper-middle income consume 
at a high rate."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N), striving to close the gap on archrival Goldman Sachs (GS.N), reported higher second-quarter profit and revenue, the latest sign the investment bank's fortunes have blossomed under Chief Executive John Mack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Wednesday, Morgan said net income surged 40 percent to $2.58 billion on net revenue of $11.5 billion. By comparison, Goldman earned $2.33 billion on $10.2 billion of revenue. Morgan also reported a higher return on equity, 28 percent versus Goldman's 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One quarter does not win the race," said Brad Hintz, a Sanford Bernstein analyst and former Morgan Stanley treasurer. Still, "I guess this means we can say the old Morgan Stanley is coming back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment banking, brokerage and credit card giant lost ground to Goldman Sachs, both in terms of stock price and financial results, after the U.S. stock market peaked in 2000. Laggard performance led to the early retirement of then-Chief Executive Philip Purcell two years ago and the return of John Mack with a mandate to revive Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mack promptly adopted changes, many of which had helped make Goldman Wall Street's largest and most profitable bank. He expanded Morgan's debt and derivatives businesses, bought hedge funds, increased trading risk and returned to private equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while Morgan Stanley is still a turnaround story in progress, the second quarter yielded record results in almost every business and showed it had closed the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Morgan Stanley revenue rose 32 percent from last year. A week earlier, Goldman beat forecasts but disappointed investors by reporting a 1 percent drop in revenue after fixed income trading took a surprising hit from subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley equities underwriting surged 64 percent from the February quarter, besting Goldman's 34 percent increase. Debt issuance rose 35 percent, while Goldman debt underwriting rose 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined investment banking revenue rose 65 percent, while Goldman's was little changed compared with the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan, No. 1 in completed MA through the end of May, reported advisory fees of $725 million during the quarter, versus Goldman's $709 million. Morgan's equity underwriters made $493 million in fees, versus Goldman's $358 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman made almost twice as much from MA fees as Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman still leads in many businesses, such as debt underwriting, where it was half again as big as Morgan Stanley. It is the world's largest manager of hedge funds and the top private equity investor among Wall Street banks, businesses Morgan Stanley just began to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Goldman traders still make a lot more money -- equity and debt revenue of $5.9 billion compared with $5.0 billion -- Morgan's traders have closed the gap here, too. A year ago, Goldman stock and debt traders made 80 percent more than their Morgan Stanley counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also has come close to regaining its position as the largest investment bank in terms of market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley was worth $92.6 billion compared with Goldman's $93.7 billion on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Morgan Stanley's market value and profit will drop after it spins off Discover Financial Services next week, shedding a unit that earned $209 million in the quarter and has a $14 million market value.&lt;/p&gt;

MER.N, Citigroup (C.N) and other creditors in an attempt to restructure the hedge funds, which have suffered significant losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase and others had put some of the Bear Stearns assets up for sale, but JPMorgan Chase has canceled its auction and is negotiating instead, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Wednesday said it has discontinued all trials of an experimental lung cancer drug it had licensed from Coley Pharmaceutical Group COLY.O after an independent data safety monitoring committee determined it was not effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The (committee) concluded that the risk-benefit profile did not justify continuation of the trials," Pfizer said in a release of the drug called PF-3512676. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The New York-based drugmaker, which is trying to become a major force in oncology, said the canceled trials include two late-stage and two mid-stage studies of the medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The compound in combination with chemotherapy was no more effective than chemotherapy alone, according to the analysis by the safety monitoring committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, editing by Maureen Bavdek; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER COLEY/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Google comment) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Peter Kaplan &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    CHICAGO, June 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) has agreed to modify its Windows Vista operating system in response to a complaint that its computer search function put Google Inc. (GOOG.O) and other potential rivals at a disadvantage, the Justice Department and Microsoft said on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Under an agreement with the department and 17 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia, Microsoft will build into Vista an option to let users select a default desktop search program on personal computers running Windows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The function, known as "Instant Search," allows Windows users to enter a search query and get a list of results from their hard drive that contain the search term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The agreement was made public as part of a joint report that the Justice Department and Microsoft filed late on Tuesday with the court overseeing Microsoft's compliance with a 2002 antitrust consent decree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     As part of the deal, a Microsoft official said the company also had pledged to place links inside the Internet Explorer window and the "Start" navigation menu to make it easier for people to access that default desktop search service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The changes will be introduced in a service pack, or updated version of Windows Vista software. Microsoft said it anticipates a test version of the Vista Service Pack 1 to be ready by the year-end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Under the agreement, Microsoft also promised to provide additional technical information to third-party developers, such as Google, in order to optimize the performance of their desktop search service on Vista. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "These remedies are a step in the right direction, but they should be improved further to give consumers greater access to alternate desktop search providers," David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The changes stem from a complaint Google filed with the Justice Department in December, in which it argued that a feature built into Vista that allows users to search a computer's hard drive did not leave room for competition from other desktop search applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Google said the feature violated the consent decree that monitors Microsoft's conduct as part of its settlement with the government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are pleased that as a result of Google's request that the consent decree be enforced, the Department of Justice and state Attorneys General have required Microsoft to make changes to Vista," Drummond said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The agreement is expected to be presented to the judge monitoring the consent decree, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, at a June 26 court hearing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Microsoft consent decree, which settled the government's landmark antitrust case against the company, is scheduled to expire in November. However, some provisions have been extended to November 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has called Google's complaint "baseless" and said it was in compliance with the antitrust settlement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Additional reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle and Eric Auchard in San Francisco) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Toni Reinhold &amp; Ian Geoghegan; e-mail: peter.kaplan@reuters.com; +1 202 898 8463)) Keywords: MICROSOFT GOOGLE/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, table)

 June 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it raised metal
price forecasts to reflect recent changes made by its commodity
analysts.

 The brokerage said it now expects iron ore prices to rise 9
percent for April 2008 contracts and by a further 5 percent for
April 2009 contracts. On platinum, it expects a peak price of
$1,350/oz through 2009 on persistent supply deficits.

 The brokerage said it expects rising global growth in 2008
to lead to accelerating demand growth for metals, further
tightening supply/demand balances.

 Goldman Sachs raised the price targets on several companies
and boosted the rating on Xstrata Plc. XTA.L to "buy" from
"neutral".

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. won U.S. approval on Thursday to promote its prescription drug Lyrica for treating fibromyalgia, a chronic disease which can cause debilitating pain, sleep problems, stiffness and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medicine is the first treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fibromyalgia, which affects about 3 million to 6 million people in the United States each year, mostly women, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer already sells Lyrica for treating neuropathic pain, a type of pain arising from the nerves without any obvious cause, and epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval "provides a reason for optimism for the many patients who will receive pain relief with Lyrica," said Dr. Steven Galson, director of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, consumers should understand that some patients did not experience benefit in clinical trials. We still have more progress to make for treatment of this disorder," Galson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promotion of the drug for fibromyalgia is expected to boost sales of Lyrica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First-quarter Lyrica sales more than doubled to $395 million, Pfizer reported in April. The drug has been prescribed to more than 5 million people worldwide. Its generic name is pregabalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, and no test exists to confirm a diagnosis. Doctors rely on patient complaints of symptoms and subjective responses to physical exams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients may try dietary changes or exercise, or antidepressants, pain relievers and other medicines to ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibromyalgia patients experience pain differently than others, and are thought to be more sensitive to stimuli that are not normally painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact way that that Lyrica reduces pain is unknown, the FDA and Pfizer said. The drug is thought to calm damaged nerves that may be overactive in fibromyalgia, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Pfizer study evaluated 745 patients who took either Lyrica or a placebo, and found more Lyrica patients reported pain reduction by at least 50 percent over 14 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seven percent of patients who took a 450-milligram daily dose said their pain was cut by half or more, compared with 15 percent who got a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA approved doses of 300- and 450-milligrams per day but declined to clear the highest dose of 600 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyrica's most common side effects in clinical trials included mild-to-moderate dizziness and sleepiness. Patients also reported blurred vision, weight gain, dry mouth, and swelling of the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug also may impair motor function and cause problems with concentration and attention, the FDA said. Patients should ask their doctor if Lyrica may impair driving ability, the agency advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 30-day supply of Lyrica costs about $130 at some retailers, a Pfizer spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other companies, including Eli Lilly and Co., Forest Laboratories Inc. and Wyeth, also are studying fibromyalgia treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares gained 21 cents, or 0.8 percent, to close at $25.92 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) is preparing to marry her handsome 
Prince Edward (James Marsden), but ends up in the real world of 
Times Square at rush hour after the ubiquitous wicked queen

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tom Bergin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp.'s (XOM.N)
chief executive said on Thursday he expects negotiations over
Venezuela's planned takeover of majority stakes in multibillion
dollar projects in the country would go on beyond the June 26
deadline set by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has ordered a group of six
global energy oil companies to give the government 60 percent
stakes in projects in the country's Orinoco Belt as part of a
nationalization drive toward what he has described as his
socialist revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to talk to the government of Venezuela about
receiving compensation and value for the interests that we
transfer under the migrating contracts," CEO Rex Tillerson told
reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've come to no conclusion on that and so my expectation
is that even though the date of the 26th certainly will come
and go, that we'll continue to work with them to see if we
cannot find a way to mutually resolve the value of the
migration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, the country's oil minister said a group
of the companies was on the verge of signing deals with
Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The targeted companies are Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips
(COP.N), Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), Norway's Statoil (STL.OL),
Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) and France's Total (TOTF.PA). Their
Orinoco projects are valued at over $30 billion and are capable
of producing around 600,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Venezuelan industry officials, who asked not to be named
while talks were continuing, have said ConocoPhillips and Exxon
are having the toughest talks of the companies involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon is a 41.7 percent partner in the Cerro Negro project
in the region. BP is a 16.6 percent investor in the project,
and state-oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) owns
the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon handed over operation of Cerro Negro to PDVSA in
May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson also said a proposed energy bill in the U.S.
Congress that would eliminate billions of dollars of tax
incentives for oil companies would be devastating for the
American consumer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is nothing in this bill that is going to give the
American consumer any relief in the near term. In fact there's
a good chance its going to make the situation worse," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But while Tillerson was speaking in London, the U.S. Senate
pulled most of the teeth out of the bill -- eliminating $29
billion in extra taxes on the companies that would have funded
incentives for clean energy.

Fibromyalgia can cause debilitating pain and tenderness, sleep problems, stiffness and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Lisa Richwine, editing by Gary Hill; Reuters Messaging: lisa.richwine.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 202 310-5691)) Keywords: PFIZER LYRICA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst projection, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on Wednesday that U.S. health regulators will approve its novel AIDS drug called maraviroc once certain conditions have been met, although the world's biggest drugmaker did not elaborate on what was necessary to obtain outright approval. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer received a so-called approvable letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the twice-a-day pill that is the first drug designed to keep the HIV virus that causes AIDS from entering healthy immune cells. Older AIDS medicines attack the virus itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said it was in discussions with the FDA to address the agency's outstanding questions and finalize the product labeling as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Industry analysts have projected annual maraviroc sales of about $500 million by 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The drug may offer a new option to patients who are not responding to current medicines. An estimated 25,000 to 40,000 U.S. AIDS patients resist treatment with current drugs meant to keep the virus at bay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    To date, more than 2,000 patients worldwide have received or are currently receiving treatment with maraviroc through clinical trials, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    About 45 percent of patients who took maraviroc in Pfizer studies had their HIV suppressed to undetectable levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Maraviroc blocks the CCR5 co-receptor that serves as a main doorway for the HIV virus into immune cells. HIV needs to get into the cells to replicate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Lisa Richwine and Bill Berkrot; editing by Andre Grenon and Deborah Cohen; Reuters Messaging: bill.berkrot.reuters.com@reuters.net +1 646 223 6030)) Keywords: PFIZER AIDS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, June 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N)
has won almost a third of the Gulf Arab advisory business so far
in 2007, which promises to be a record year for mergers and
acquisitions in the region, data provider Dealogic said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's largest investment bank by profit and market
value was adviser on eight MA deals worth about 31 percent of
the $60 billion in transactions announced this year, according
to Dealogic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup Inc. (C.N), the largest U.S. bank, was second with
almost 27 percent followed by Lehman Brother Holdings Inc.
LEH.N with just over 22 percent. UBS (UBSN.VX) was the top
European bank on the list, in fourth place with 17.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreign banks have been scrambling to cash in on a surge in
MA spending by investors in the world's top oil exporting
region, who are scouring the globe to invest windfall revenues
from a tripling in international oil prices since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gulf investors spent more than $76 billion on foreign
mergers and acquisition in the past five years, almost 90
percent of that in 2005 and 2006 as oil prices rallied to record
high in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They look set to break the 2005 record of $35 billion this
year, according to Dealogic, which put total foreign MA
spending so far this year at just over $33 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saudi Basic Industries Corp.'s 2010.SE $11.6 billion
purchase last month of General Electric Co.'s (GE.N) plastics
business is the largest ever made by Gulf Arab investors,
topping Dubai Port World's takeover of British rival PO for 3.9
billion pounds ($7.77 billion) in a deal agreed in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spending on acquisitions of Gulf assets is also surging this
year, the Dealogic data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors spent more than $20 billion buying assets in the
six Gulf oil producers in 2007, a nine-fold increase from the
year-earlier period and the highest on record, according to the
data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three largest deals were together worth almost $18
billion and in each case the buyer was a Gulf Arab investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State-owned Dubai Holding's $7.5 billion deal in March to
increase its stake in Dubai-based Emaar Properties EMAR.DU
topped the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s (OXY.N) purchase in May of U.S.
rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp.'s (APC.N) Qatar assets for $350
million was, at number five on the list, the largest by a
foreign acquirer.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, byline; updates share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Chris Reiter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - Equity Inns Inc. ENN.N,
which owns mid-market hotels, has agreed to be acquired by
Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) real estate fund, Whitehall, in a deal
worth $2.2 billion, including assumed debt, the company said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price of $23 a share represents a premium of 19 percent
over Equity Inns' closing price on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equity Inns, a real estate investment trust, owns more than
130 hotels under brands such as Courtyard, Hilton Garden Inn
and Hampton Inn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These are curiously strong multiples -- almost astounding
-- particularly given that we do not see meaningful embedded
value in Equity Inn's underlying land," said Chris Woronka, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank. "Prospects for a higher bid are
virtually nil."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The purchase price is close to the cost of building the
hotels from the ground up, but the properties' cash flow and
potential to lower costs may make the deal work for the buyers,
Woronka said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hotel industry is in the midst of a multiyear boom as
robust demand has allowed hoteliers to steadily raise rates.
The upbeat market environment, supported by limited
construction of new hotels, has made lodging assets hot
commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust
LGY_u.TO, the biggest lodging REIT in Canada, said it was in
talks with a number of investment groups regarding a possible
takeover and had received nonbinding offers that value the
company's equity at $1.36 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, luxury hotel operator Four Seasons Hotels Inc.
FSH.TO FS.N agreed to a $3.37 billion takeover offer from a
group that included Bill Gates' Cascade Investments LLC and
Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitehall's acquisition of Equity Inns is expected to close
in the fourth quarter, subject to shareholder approval and
other closing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equity Inns focuses on the upscale extended stay, all-suite
and midscale limited-service segments. It has 132 hotels with
15,731 rooms in 35 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equity Inns shares rose $3.42 to $22.78 in morning trade on
the New York Stock Exchange.

nothing to with nationalization talks with the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The sale agreement with Industrias Venoco was made public

oil majors in Orinoco projects valued above $30 billion and
capable of producing 600,000 barrels per day that have until
June 26 to strike a deal with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The others include ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Chevron Corp.

France's Total (TOTF.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government has said Conoco is providing most resistance

projects. Industry sources with knowledge of the talks also say
Exxon's negotiations have been more difficult than those of the
other four companies.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa, the world's largest credit card network, unveiled details of a planned restructuring on Friday as it prepares by early next year to follow smaller rival MasterCard Inc. (MA.N) in becoming a public company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Visa also disclosed financial results for the publicly traded entity to be known as Visa Inc., which will combine Visa USA, Visa International and Visa Canada. The disclosures were in a registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa first outlined plans last October to float a majority of the company, now owned by its member banks, in an initial public offering to be held within 12 to 18 months. Its Visa Europe affiliate will remain a membership association and take a minority stake in Visa Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company intends to use IPO proceeds to fund expansion and an escrow account to help cover potentially hefty legal bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merchants such as Kroger Co. (KR.N), Safeway Inc. (SWY.N) and Walgreen Co. (WAG.N) have accused the card networks of price fixing. Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) Discover card unit and American Express Co. (AXP.N) have also filed antitrust lawsuits against Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the SEC filing, Visa Inc. posted net income of $525.9 million, or 68 cents per share, on operating revenue of $2.36 billion for the six months ended March 31. Visa USA accounted for more than two-thirds of that combined entity's profit and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the same period, MasterCard reported a profit of $255.8 million on net revenue of $1.75 billion. Its shares have more than quadrupled since that company raised $2.4 billion in a May 2006 IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said in a letter to member banks that the restructuring should help Visa compete more effectively, streamline decision-making and better coordinate worldwide operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC filing also shows that Visa USA members will assume responsibility for a variety of litigation, including the merchant antitrust lawsuits. Visa USA recently had some 13,320 member banks that have issued more than 521 million cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saunders was installed as chief executive last month.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, June 22 (Reuters) - U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) has started trading the naphtha market in Asia and aims to expand to gasoline trading, company sources said on Friday.  The firm has hired Amrish Bahadur, a former BP (BP.L) trading analyst, to cover both paper and physical naphtha in Asia's oil trading hub Singapore and is looking at hiring more people in Singapore and London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The bank, which already trades Asian fuel oil paper derivatives, is likely to be looking at leveraging naphtha trade and customer business off growing demand in North Asia for the petrochemical feedstock, used to make plastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are just kicking off naphtha paper trading and will be trading open-spec naphtha as well. We are doing this so we can round out our coverage of the oil barrel and be able to offer the full suite of hedging capabilities to our customers," said Muwaffaq Salti, head of the bank's energy trading in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We will be expanding into gasoline and petrochemical trading next," he told Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    New petrochemical crackers from the Middle East to South Korea, booming car sales and expanding refining capacity across the continent mean higher demand for sales, risk hedging and exports to other regions, though banking competition is growing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The bank joins leader Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in spreading its wings on physical oil markets. Morgan Stanley bought its first cargoes of physical fuel oil in Asia in recent years this month, after entering the physical market earlier this year, making it the only bank trading all physical oil products in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts have said that some Wall Street investment banks may take a more active role in physical markets, shunned in the past as a high-risk, logistic-heavy endeavour, to protect profits on their commodities and energy paper trading businesses, which made them an estimated $7 billion in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan's value-at-risk (VaR) for "commodities and other", an estimate of the maximum amount of money that the company's trading positions could lose in a single day to a probability of 99 percent, rose to $45 million in 2006, from $25 million in 2005 and just $3 million in 2003, company reports show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This was high compared to BP's $29 million and Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) $30 million last year (for details see [nSP338121]). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Booming commodity markets have attracted a flood of competition, from peers such as Merrill Lynch MER.N and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), oil majors like Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and even some hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Firms trading physical oil can exploit price differences between regions, blend low-quality grades into higher-value fuel or store oil to sell later at higher prices in a contango market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    They can also complement forward paper positions by exerting greater influence on benchmark physical prices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Neil Chatterjee, editing by Ramthan Hussain; +65 6870 3861, Neil.Chatterjee@reuters.com)) Keywords: JPMORGAN NAPHTHA/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom Neft now has only 30 percent of the Northern Taiga
NefteGaz venture, set up at the start of this year with the aim
of producing hydrocarbons in West Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom Neft already said it had agreed with Chevron that it
would raise its stake to over 50 percent, but at the outset
Chevron had contributed more to the JV so it had a bigger share.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds FDA comment, background, share movement) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) won  approval to promote the prescription drug Lyrica for treating fibromyalgia, U.S. health officials said on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The medicine is the first approved drug treatment for the chronic disease which can cause debilitating pain and tenderness, sleep problems, stiffness and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer already sells Lyrica for treating neuropathic pain and epileptic seizures. The Food and Drug Administration's approval for fibromyalgia allows Pfizer to market the drug specifically for that use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The approval is an important advance for fibromyalgia "and provides a reason for optimism for the many patients who will receive pain relief with Lyrica," Dr. Steven Galson, director of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.    "However, consumers should understand that some patients did not experience benefit in clinical trials. We still have more progress to make for treatment of this disorder," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer shares gained 21 cents, or 0.8 percent, to close at $25.92 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Lisa Richwine, editing by Tim Dobbyn; Reuters Messaging: lisa.richwine.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 202 310-5691)) Keywords: PFIZER LYRICA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs began coverage of three
European refiners, saying the sector has outperformed European
integrated oils, driven by buoyant refining margins and the
start of the driving season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage initiated coverage of Greece's second largest
oil refiner Motor Oil (MORr.AT) with a "sell" rating based on
valuation and added that the stock screened poorly on the
brokerage's thematic exposure to diesel and looked overvalued
on traditional cash flow multiples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also started Italy's Saras (SRS.MI) and Swiss-based
Petroplus PPHN.S with "neutral", while increasing its price
target on some other refiners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it sees little value in Western European
players in the sector except MOL MOLB.BU, which offers
organic and inorganic growth opportunities without a stretched
valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following is a list of refiners with the brokerage's

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - The Chief Executive of U.S. oil
major Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said Gazprom (GAZP.MM) was just
one potential customer for gas from Exxon's Sakhalin-1 project
off Russia's east coast, despite increased pressure on Exxon to
sell state-controlled Gazprom the gas cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We have been in discussions with Gazprom very much on the
same basis that we're in discussions with any potential
purchaser of the gas," Rex Tillerson told a news conference in
London on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Gazprom currently buys gas from other companies
operating in Russia at prices that are fraction of international
levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, Gazprom asked the Kremlin to block the
Exxon-led project from selling gas to China. Deputy Chief
Executive Alexander Ananenkov said the gas should be sold to
Gazprom to supply the domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Tillerson said Gazprom wanted to use the gas to
underpin an expansion of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export
terminal in the south of Sakhalin Island. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LNG is gas cooled to liquid for export over long distances
in pressurised ships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russian state-controlled Rosneft (ROSN.MM), India's ONGC
(ONGC.BO) and a Japanese consortium, Sodeco, are also
shareholders in Sakhalin-1.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. is hoping a 
fractured fairy tale that swaps Manhattan for a magic kingdom, 
a divorce lawyer for a prince, and roaches and pigeons for 
wholesome forest creatures will turn into its newest film 
franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Enchanted," set for a November 21 release, pokes fun at 
old Disney films such as "Sleeping Beauty" or "Snow White and 
the Seven Dwarfs" where the heroine surrounds herself with 
cuddly creatures or people whistling happy tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result, the movie represents a big risk for the studio 
to turn into a profit-making franchise with numerous sequels, 
such as its "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney would not disclose how much the film cost to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The irony of Disney flaunting the conventions of the very 
films on which the company was built was one idea that excited 
the film's makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's really difficult material," director Kevin Lima told 
Reuters following a news conference on Monday. "What it really 
took is ... someone who understood the heritage, who loved it. 
Someone who wasn't afraid of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney executives knew "the only way this was going to work 
is if we can take the 'Mickey' out of ourselves, so to speak, 
so we can look back at who we are and be able to laugh," Lima 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked whether "Enchanted" could be a franchise film, 
he said, "We all hope," and added that already he was thinking 
about ideas for a sequel featuring the same key characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Enchanted" blends old-style, hand-drawn animation as well 
as live action to turn the idea of fairy tales upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins in the animated world of Andalasia, where 
Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) is preparing to marry her handsome 
Prince Edward (James Marsden), but ends up in the real world of 
Times Square at rush hour after the ubiquitous wicked queen 
(Susan Sarandon) pushes Giselle down an enchanted well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lima, a longtime Disney animator who directed "Tarzan" and 
"101 Dalmatians" and designed characters for "The Little 
Mermaid" and "Aladdin," said he drew on Disney fairy tale 
cliches to come up with the right tone for "Enchanted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney did not disclose whether the actors have signed 
multi-picture contracts to come back for a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa, the world's largest credit card 
network, unveiled details of a planned restructuring on Friday 
as it prepares by early next year to follow smaller rival 
MasterCard Inc. (MA.N) in becoming a public company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; San Francisco-based Visa also disclosed financial results 
for the publicly traded entity to be known as Visa Inc., which 
will combine Visa USA, Visa International and Visa Canada. The 
disclosures were in a registration statement filed with the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa first outlined plans last October to float a majority 
of the company, now owned by its member banks, in an initial 
public offering to be held within 12 to 18 months. Its Visa 
Europe affiliate will remain a membership association and take 
a minority stake in Visa Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company intends to use IPO proceeds to fund expansion 
and an escrow account to help cover potentially hefty legal 
bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merchants such as Kroger Co. (KR.N), Safeway Inc. (SWY.N) 
and Walgreen Co. (WAG.N) have accused the card networks of 
price fixing. Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) Discover card unit and 
American Express Co. (AXP.N) have also filed antitrust lawsuits 
against Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the SEC filing, Visa Inc. posted net income of 
$525.9 million, or 68 cents per share, on operating revenue of 
$2.36 billion for the six months ended March 31. Visa USA 
accounted for more than two-thirds of that combined entity's 
profit and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the same period, MasterCard reported a profit of 
$255.8 million on net revenue of $1.75 billion. Its shares have 
more than quadrupled since that company raised $2.4 billion in 
a May 2006 IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said in a letter to 
member banks that the restructuring should help Visa compete 
more effectively, streamline decision-making and better 
coordinate worldwide operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC filing also shows that Visa USA members will assume 
responsibility for a variety of litigation, including the 
merchant antitrust lawsuits. Visa USA recently had some 13,320 
member banks that have issued more than 521 million cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saunders was installed as chief executive last month. He 
had previously been president of card services at Washington 
Mutual Inc. (WM.N), the largest U.S. thrift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's roots date to 1958 when a Bank of America Corp. 
(BAC.N) predecessor created the blue, white and gold 
BankAmericard, helping pave the way for the modern credit card 
business. That card has evolved into Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, plans to spin off Discover at 
the end of the month. Discover Financial Services will join the 
Standard  Poor's 500 stock index .SPX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bangalore)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is selling its 30.48 percent stake in South Korean cable TV operator CM, valued at $970 million, the Maeil Business Newspaper said on Monday, citing unnamed investment banking and industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup (C.N), which is handling the deal, closed the auction on Thursday, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale may include management rights from the family owners of the country's No. 2 cable TV operator, the daily said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three investment groups have handed in their bids, including South Korean investment fund MBK Partners, a private equity arm run by Australia's Macquarie Bank MBL.AX and South Korea's Shinhan Financial Group (055550.KS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman bought shares in CM in 2004 for 140 billion won ($150.9 million), becoming its second-largest shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the planned stake sale, the U.S. investment bank is likely to earn more than $800 million in capital gains in three years, the report estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CM is the second-largest multi-system cable TV operator in South Korea with 2 million subscribers and the largest in the greater Seoul metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had sought to exit from its investment in CM via a dual Seoul-London listing that was expected to fetch up to $500 million this year, sources had told Reuters last November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the stake sale takes place, the listing plan would be delayed or shelved because of a local securities regulation that stipulates IPO candidates should not change majority shareholders one year before the listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - The potential exit of
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) from
Venezuela would have a more significant effect on
ConocoPhillips, which has more substantial holdings in the
country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; According to two sources close to the talks, both companies
rejected a deal to stay in multibillion-dollar projects on
Monday, increasing the chances they will leave the OPEC
nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four other companies -- Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), Norway's
Statoil (STL.OL), Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) and France's Total
(TOTF.PA) -- plan to sign an accord that will keep them in the
Orinoco oil reserve projects, a Venezuelan government official
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late on Monday, a source close to ConocoPhillips said the
company had decided to leave Venezuela entirely, walking out on
its stakes in two Orinoco projects as well as its interest in
the Corocoro field in the Gulf of Paria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Hugo Chavez has been working to take a majority
stake in four heavy-crude projects in the massive Orinoco oil
reserve away from the foreign oil companies. The projects are
valued at over $30 billion and can produce 600,000 barrels per
day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONOCOPHILLIPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips has stakes in two Orinoco projects -- a 50.1
percent interest in the Petrozuata project and a 40 percent
interest in the Hamaca project. In 2006, the company's share of
production from these two projects was about 101,000 oil
equivalent barrels per day in 2006, or about 4 percent of its
total production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to analysts, the company earned over $800 million
from the Orinoco projects last year, when its total profit was
$15.55 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of December 31, ConocoPhillips had 1.09 billion barrels
of oil equivalent of proved reserves in Petrozuata and Hamaca
out of roughly 11.41 billion barrels of total reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EXXON MOBIL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has a 42 percent stake in the Cerro Negro project in
the Orinoco region. The field produced about 115,000 barrels
per day in 2006; Exxon's share of this production was about
48,000 barrels per day. That is about 1 percent of the
company's total production of more than 4.2 million barrels of
oil equivalent per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon also has a 50 percent stake in the 120,000 acre La
Ceiba block on the south-eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo. The
field is still in development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said that losing its production in Venezuela would
barely be noticeable to Exxon because of its massive earnings
power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon had no immediate comment on Venezuela. It was not
immediately clear what percentage of Exxon's 2006 earnings came
from its Venezuela operations.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats with no changes to headline or text)
 (Adds new details from source close to ConocoPhillips)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Brian Ellsworth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, June 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips
rejected on Monday a deal to stay in multibillion-dollar
projects that Venezuela is nationalizing, increasing the
chances two of the world's top oil companies will leave the
OPEC nation, two sources close to the talks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four other companies -- Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), Norway's
Statoil (STL.OL), Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) and France's Total
(TOTF.PA) -- plan to sign an accord that will keep them in the
massive Orinoco oil reserve projects, a government official
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The officials -- one from the oil industry and the other
from the government -- asked not to be named because the state
oil company PDVSA planned to announce the negotiations'
results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also noted negotiations with Exxon (XOM.N) and
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) could be revived at the eleventh hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But late on Monday, a source close to ConocoPhillips said
the company had decided to leave Venezuela entirely, walking
out on its stakes in two Orinoco projects as well as its
interest in the Corocoro field in the Gulf of Paria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source said the dispute was likely headed to
arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PDVSA said it would sign the deals in a ceremony, which it
originally announced for Monday but later postponed until
Tuesday. It did not specify which foreign companies would sign
to stay on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Hugo Chavez decreed Tuesday as a deadline for the
majors to accept terms for the government to take a majority
stake in four heavy-crude upgrading projects valued above $30
billion. They can produce 600,000 barrels per day in the
Orinoco reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chavez has pushed a nationalization drive this year, taking
over U.S. companies' assets in the telecommunications and
electricity sectors as part of a self-styled socialist
revolution in the fourth-largest exporter of oil to the United
States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and ConocoPhillips would be the most important
companies to be forced out by Chavez's nationalization policies
since he took office in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On May 1, Venezuela seized control of the operations of the
Orinoco projects, which were among the last privately run
fields in the South American nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Chavez also gave the six companies extra time to work
out a deal over the projects' new ownership structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chavez, a staunch opponent of U.S. President George W. Bush
and who has called capitalism an evil, on Friday said some
companies have rejected his government's terms for deals that
hammer out the details for Venezuela to take at least a 60
percent stake in projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOUGH TALKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Takeover talks have been hung up on thorny issues including
asset valuation, compensation for lost value, and
decision-making rules in the future joint ventures, according
to industry officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has taken a hard stance on the government's use of
"book value" to decide how much the company's project is worth,
while the government has harshly criticized ConocoPhillips for
not agreeing to sign a largely symbolic accord recognizing the
nationalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies have also insisted the government give them
certain veto rights when the board of directors of the new
companies make major decisions, according to industry
officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the two companies, ConocoPhillips would take the hardest
hit if forced to leave Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has stakes in two Orinoco projects, which
accounted for about 4 percent of its total production last
year. Its earnings from Venezuela were more than $800 million
in 2006, according to analysts -- about 5 percent of its total
profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Exxon's share of the Cerro Negro project in the
Orinoco region was responsible only for about 1 percent of the
company's production. Analysts said that losing the project
would barely be noticeable because of Exxon's massive earnings
power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chavez's high profile showdown with oil companies has drawn
the cheers of the poor majority that overwhelmingly reelected
him in December, largely because the former soldier has used
billions of dollars in oil revenues to finance social
programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies that agree to stay on in the projects have two
months before a final deal is submitted to the Venezuelan
Congress for approval of a new state-majority joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those that refuse to stay in the projects can leave and
take Venezuela to court or accept a government offer to
negotiate compensation for several months for the nationalized
Orinoco assets, several sources familiar with the talks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Discussions were expected to continue between the
government and companies until Tuesday's deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the industry and government officials said the position
on Monday of Exxon and ConocoPhillips had been clear: they
refused to sign a government proposal for a memorandum of
understanding that commits them to remaining in the projects
with a smaller stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon and Conoco are out," one of the officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Michael Erman in New York)

action against Dollar General Corp. (DG.N), IBM said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dollar General is a client of IBM's Retail Store Solutions
unit, which sells point-of-sale products, IBM said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with Google court filing, new throughout) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Peter Kaplan &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - Google Inc. (GOOG.O) asked a federal judge on Monday to extend the consent decree that settled the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) in order to address competition concerns involving the Windows Vista operating system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Google told the judge overseeing the 2002 consent decree  that even though Microsoft has agreed to modify Vista to address the concerns, "more may need to be done to provide a truly unbiased choice of desktop search products." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The court brief was filed by Google less than a week after Microsoft agreed to modify its Windows Vista operating system in response to a complaint by Google that Vista's computer search function put other potential rivals at a disadvantage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The agreement was announced last week with the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia. Microsoft promised to build into Vista an option to let users select a default desktop search program on personal computers running Windows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Vista function, known as "Instant Search," allows Windows users to enter a search query and get a list of results from their hard drive that contain the search term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Under Microsoft's agreement with the Justice Department, the changes to Vista will be introduced in a service pack, or updated version of Windows Vista software. Microsoft said it anticipates a test version of the Vista Service Pack 1 to be ready by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     On Monday, Google said some of the steps Microsoft has agreed to take are "only vaguely described" and that by the time it goes into effect, the consent decree will have already have expired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The consent decree restricting Microsoft's conduct, which settled the government's antitrust case against the company, is scheduled to expire in November. However, some provisions have already been extended to November 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft spokesman Jack Evans said in a statement on Monday that the company had addressed the concerns raised by Google and opposed the idea of extending the consent decree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The government has clearly stated that it is satisfied with the changes we're making. Google has provided no new information that should suggest otherwise in their filing," Evans said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Google hit a new intraday-high of $534.99 before settling back to trade around $528, up 0.6 percent on the day, in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. Microsoft shares were up 10 cents to $29.59, also on Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Peter Kaplan, editing by Tim Dobbyn; Reuters Messaging: peter.kaplan.reuters.com@reuters.net; email: peter.kaplan@reuters.com; +1 202 898 8463, fax: +1 202 898 8383)) Keywords: GOOGLE MICROSOFT/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, background, byline, updates share price) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Jui Chakravorty &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    DETROIT, June 25 (Reuters) - Shares of General Motors Corp (GM.N) rose to a four-month high on Monday after Goldman Sachs raised its ratings on the automaker, citing the potential for wage and benefit cuts during upcoming talks with the union. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry raised his ratings on the automaker to "buy" from "neutral" and increased his 52-week price target on the stock to $42 from $29. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The upgrade comes after the United Auto Workers reached a tentative deal with GM and its former supplier, bankrupt Delphi Corp DCXGn.DE, ending the union's long effort to keep pay and benefits at the the same level as at GM, which spun off Delphi in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal, the text of which was published by union dissidents, calls for former GM workers to take pay cuts in exchange for one-time bonuses of as much as $105,000 or accept buyouts for as much as $140,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "GM can make a compelling case to UAW members that material wage and benefit cuts are needed," Barry wrote in a research note. "And we suspect members and retirees are increasingly amenable to such cuts." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    GM, along with Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Chrysler Group, is headed into its own negotiations with the union this summer, to replace a contract that expires in July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    All three automakers are expected to ask for major cuts in benefits such as health care. GM alone spent $4.8 billion in health-care expenses in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    GM shares closed up 81 cents, or 2.3 percent, at $36.27 on the New York Stock Exchange. The day's high was $36.84. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Monday's gains in GM's shares took them to their highest level since Feb. 20, when they were at $36.62. The stock gained 23 percent in the last two weeks amid talks of an approaching deal with Delphi and the UAW. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NO STRIKE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    If ratified by UAW members, the agreement would clear the risk of a strike at Delphi, which could have shut down GM's production in North America and forced it to burn through billions of dollars a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The largest U.S. automaker is trying to return to profitability after losing more than $10 billion in the past two years. It is in the middle of a restructuring that includes slashing more than 34,000 jobs and closing 12 plants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Credit rating agency DBRS called the tentative deal a "positive development" for GM. "DBRS has always viewed that any labor disruptions at Delphi have the potential to delay, if not derail, the recovery at GM," the agency said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Reaching a tentative agreement is a positive step to remove the labor issue at Delphi as a major obstacle to the recovery at GM." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    GM has estimated its exposure to the Delphi restructuring at $7 billion and has also said it could take a charge of $1 billion this quarter for a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We had been concerned that GM would extend indefinite wage subsidies to these high-wage workers," Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson said. "Against this, the current structure is a positive," he added, referring to the buyout offers and the "buydowns" -- one-time payments for wage cuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal would also allow Delphi employees hired before October 1999 to flow back to GM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Poornima Gupta) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Gary Hill; Reuters Messaging: jui.chakravorty@reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 313 967 1903)) Keywords: GM STOCK  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
(GS.N) subprime mortgage bonds issued last year are being
downgraded by rating companies at the fastest rate of any
issuer, according to Citigroup Inc. research dated June 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Portions of Goldman's GSAMP-issued bonds, which include
subprime loans from a variety of lenders, have been downgraded
a combined 69 times by Standard  Poor's and Moody's Investors
Service in the year through June 15, analysts at Citigroup
Global Markets said in a weekly note. Sixty of the downgrades
refer to classes from 2006 bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Downgrades are accelerating on mortgage bonds backed by
loans to the riskiest borrowers amid a surge in delinquencies
and foreclosures. Lenders loosened underwriting standards in
the years through 2006, creating loans whose poor quality
became apparent as the U.S. housing slump began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At this point we believe that the fundamentals are going
to be getting worse for quite some time -- another year to two
you're going to keep seeing a steady march of this," Karen
Weaver, Deutsche Bank AG's global head of securitization
research, said on a conference call on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mortgage bond sales and trading has helped boost profit at
Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, who compete for
loans from subprime lenders and package them as home equity
asset-backed securities (ABS) for sale to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was the 15th largest issuer of subprime securities
last year with $12.9 billion sold, up 59 percent from 2005,
according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Countrywide Financial
Corp., the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, was the top seller of
subprime ABS at $38.5 billion sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The downgraded classes of GSAMP issues were concentrated in
two ABS deals, a source familiar with the issues said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael Duvally declined immediate
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares fell 2.5 percent to $216.74 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Downgrades run to the heart of mortgage bonds whose values
are derived using the ratings. Concerns that downgrades will
multiply losses to subprime mortgage investors and spread the
turmoil as suffered by a pair of Bear Stearns hedge funds this
month has pressured prices on existing issues and raised yields
on new bonds, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Contagion to non-housing related markets, such as corporate
debt, is tough to quantify since the economy remains robust,
Merrill Lynch  Co. analyst Guy Moszkowski said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market for credit default swaps has suggested investors
see GSAMP bonds as relatively safe. At the end of May, generic
credit default swap spreads on low-rated GSAMP issues were 485
basis points, compared with more than 500 basis points on Bear
Stearns Cos.' BSC.N BSABS subprime bond issuer and above
1,000 basis points for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s LEH.N
SAIL issuer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch's MER.N First Franklin subprime mortgage
bonds have seen the second highest number of downgrades, though
most of the bonds were issued in 2003, the Citigroup analysts
noted. The downgrades on those bonds may suggest that borrowers
may be unable to refinance adjustable-rate loans, they said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with source confirmation on two bidders, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Kim Yeon-hee &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEOUL, June 25 (Reuters) - Australia's Macquarie Bank MBL.AX and private equity fund MBK Partners are among bidders for Goldman Sachs'(GS.N) stake in South Korea's No. 2 TV cable operator, a source with knowledge of the deal said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman Sachs is selling its 30.48 percent stake in C, valued at $970 million, according to the Maeil Business Newspaper, in the latest sale of Korean assets by foreign investment firms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman bought shares in unlisted C in 2004 for 140 billion won ($151 million), becoming its second-largest shareholder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With the planned stake sale, the U.S. investment bank is likely to earn more than $800 million in capital gains, the newspaper estimated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The daily said the total acquisition value could rise to 3 trillion won if the sale includes management rights from the family owners of the country's No. 2 cable TV operator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman and Macquarie declined to comment on the report, while MBK could not immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The source said the sale was in an early stage, adding that Shinhan Financial Group (055550.KS), South Korea's second-biggest lender, would provide loans to one of the bidders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The daily cited unnamed investment banking and industry sources as saying that Citigroup (C.N), which is handling the deal, closed the auction on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal, if confirmed, comes after U.S. private equity house Lone Star [LS.UL] sold a 13.6 percent stake in Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) 004940.KS and auctioned off two other South Korean units last week for a combined $2.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    C is the second-largest multi-system cable TV operator in South Korea with 2 million subscribers and the largest in the greater Seoul metropolitan area. The company was not available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman had sought to exit from its investment in C via a dual Seoul-London listing that was expected to fetch up to $500 million this year, sources had told Reuters last November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But if the stake sale takes place, the listing plan would be delayed or shelved because of a local securities regulation that stipulates IPO candidates should not change majority shareholders one year before the listing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman has been reaping handsome earnings from South Korean investments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It more than doubled its $500 million investment in 1999 in South Korea's top lender, Kookmin Bank 060000.KS, and made hefty gains from selling spirits maker Jinro Ltd. to South Korea's top brewer, Hite Brewery (000140.KS), for $3.4 billion in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman also sold its controlling stake in builder Dong Ah Construction Industrial Co. Ltd. in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Wall Street bank is likely to offload its 24 percent stake in Korea Express Co. Ltd. (000120.KS), the country's biggest logistics firm, together with an additional stake from other creditors sometime this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Macquarie is the biggest foreign investment bank in South Korea, and MBK, created by former Carlyle Group [CYL.UL] Asia head Michael Kim, is the most active homegrown fund in the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MBK closed a $1.56 billion buyout fund last year, the largest ever for a new private equity firm, and bought South Korea's third-biggest thrift, HK Mutual Savings Bank 007640.KQ, for 117.4 billion won, jointly with Hyundai Capital Services Inc. in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Private equity deals in South Korea have been increasing despite a legal battle over Lone Star's 2003 acquisition of KEB with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Private equity investment reached $579.6 million in South Korea from 231 transactions in 2006, up 29 percent from $448.7 million in 2005, according to Thomson Financial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=927.8 Won) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Sei Chong and Jean Yoon; yeonhee.kim@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: yeonhee.kim.reuters.com@reuters.net;+82-2-3704-5646)) Keywords: GOLDMAN KOREA/  .

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, June 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips
rejected on Monday a deal to stay in multibillion-dollar
projects that Venezuela is nationalizing, increasing the
chances two of the world's top oil companies will leave the
OPEC nation, two sources close to the talks said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Four other companies -- Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), Norway's
Statoil (STL.OL), Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) and France's Total
(TOTF.PA) -- plan to sign an accord that will keep them in the
massive Orinoco oil reserve projects, a government official
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The officials -- one from the oil industry and the other
from the government -- asked not to be named because the state
oil company, PDVSA, planned to officially make the deals
public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PDVSA confirmed it would hold a ceremony, which it
originally announced for Monday but later postponed until
Tuesday. It did not specify which companies would sign to stay
on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Hugo Chavez decreed Tuesday as a deadline for the
majors to accept terms for the government to take a majority
stake in four heavy-crude upgrading projects valued above $30
billion. They can produce 600,000 barrels per day in the
Orinoco reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chavez has been on a nationalization drive this year,
taking over U.S. companies' assets in the telecommunications
and electricity sectors in a nation that is one of the top oil
exporters to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and ConocoPhillips would be the most important
companies to be forced out by Chavez's nationalization policies
since the leftist former army colonel took office in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has already seized control of the operations of the
Orinoco projects, which were among the last privately run
fields in the South American nation. But he also gave the six
companies extra time to work out a deal over the projects' new
ownership structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chavez, a staunch opponent of U.S. President George W. Bush
and who has called capitalism an evil, on Friday said some
companies have rejected his government's terms for deals that
hammer out the details for Venezuela to take at least a 60
percent stake in projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies refusing to stay in the projects can leave and
take Venezuela to court or accept a government offer of
additional time to negotiate compensation for the lost Orinoco
assets, several sources familiar with the talks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, the two officials noted that negotiations with
Exxon (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) could be revived at
the eleventh hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  But they both said the two companies' position had been
clear: they refused to sign a government proposal for a
memorandum of understanding that commits them to remaining in
the projects even as their stake is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon and Conoco are out," one of the officials said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) subprime mortgage bonds issued last year are being downgraded by rating companies at the fastest rate of any issuer, according to Citigroup Inc. research dated June 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 70 of Goldman's GSAMP-issued bonds, which include subprime loans from a variety of lenders, have been downgraded by Standard  Poor's and Moody's Investors Service in the year through June 15, with 60 of those issued in 2006, analysts at Citigroup Global Markets said in a weekly note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downgrades are accelerating on mortgage bonds backed by loans to the riskiest borrowers following an ongoing surge in delinquencies and foreclosures. Lenders loosened underwriting standards in the years through 2006, creating loans whose poor quality became apparent as the U.S. housing slump began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortgage bond sales and trading has helped boost profit at Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, who compete for loans from subprime lenders and package them as home equity asset-backed securities for sale to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael Duvally declined immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for credit default swaps has suggested investors see GSAMP bonds as relatively safe. At the end of May, generic credit default swap spreads on low-rated GSAMP issues were 485 basis points, compared with more than 500 basis points on Bear Stearns Cos.' BSC.N BSABS subprime bond issuer and above 1,000 basis points for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s LEH.N SAIL issuer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co.'s MER.N First Franklin subprime mortgage bonds have seen the second highest number of downgrades, though most of the bonds were issued in 2003, the Citigroup analysts noted. The downgrades on those bonds could suggest that borrowers may be unable to refinance adjustable-rate loans, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), two of the world's top oil companies, have refused to sign a deal to stay in multi-billion dollar Venezuelan projects that are being nationalized, officials said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day before a deadline to accept terms for the government to take a majority stake in four heavy-crude upgrading projects, the companies' decision greatly increases the chances they will leave the OPEC nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four other companies -- Chevron Corp.

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, June 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and
ConocoPhillips (COP.N), two of the world's top oil companies,
have refused to sign a deal to stay in multibillion-dollar
Venezuelan oil projects, officials from the industry and
government said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A day before a deadline to accept the government's terms
for a nationalization that increases Venezuela's stake in
projects to at least 60 percent, the companies' decision
greatly increases the chances they will leave the OPEC nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two officials, who asked not to be named because the
government planned to make the announcement later on Monday,
noted that negotiations could be revived at the eleventh hour
with the oil majors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  But they both said the two companies' position had been
clear: they refused to sign a memorandum of understanding that
commits companies to remaining in the projects even as their
stake is reduced.

&lt;p&gt;DETROIT (Reuters) - Shares of General Motors Corp. (GM.N) rose to a four-month high on Monday after Goldman Sachs raised its ratings on the No.1 U.S. automaker, citing the potential for sizable wage and benefit cuts during talks with the United Auto Workers for a new labor contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman raised its ratings on the struggling automakers to "buy" from "neutral." It also increased the 52-week price target on the stock to $42 from $29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GM can make a compelling case to UAW members that material wage and benefit cuts are needed," Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry said in a research note. "And we suspect members and retirees are increasingly amenable to such cuts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry also said that the "UAW pattern bargaining implies positive read across for Ford (Motor Co.) (F.N)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM shares were up 3.2 percent, or $1.12, at $36.58 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange after reaching a session high of $36.84. Ford shares were up 1.8 percent, or 16 cents, at $9.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday's gains took GM's stock its highest level since Feb 20. The stock has gained 23 percent in the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detroit's three automakers will begin negotiations in mid-July on a new labor contract to replace the current four-year deal that ends September 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM on Friday concluded months of negotiations to reach a tentative deal with the UAW and former parts subsidiary Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK that, if ratified by UAW members, would clear the risk of supply disruption for the automaker. The deal is intended to allow the auto parts maker to cut wages and emerge from bankruptcy, which if filed for in October 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-running impasse at Delphi that had been seen as a major risk to GM since any work stoppage at the parts maker had the potential to shut down production at the automaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM, which spun off Delphi in 1999, has estimated its exposure to the Delphi restructuring at $7 billion and said it could take a charge of $1 billion this quarter for a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - Australia's Macquarie Bank MBL.AX and private equity fund MBK Partners are among bidders for Goldman Sachs'(GS.N) stake in South Korea's No. 2 TV cable operator, a source with knowledge of the deal said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is selling its 30.48 percent stake in CM, valued at $970 million, according to the Maeil Business Newspaper, in the latest sale of Korean assets by foreign investment firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman bought shares in unlisted CM in 2004 for 140 billion won ($151 million), becoming its second-largest shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the planned stake sale, the U.S. investment bank is likely to earn more than $800 million in capital gains, the newspaper estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daily said the total acquisition value could rise to 3 trillion won if the sale includes management rights from the family owners of the country's No. 2 cable TV operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Macquarie declined to comment on the report, while MBK could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said the sale was in an early stage, adding that Shinhan Financial Group (055550.KS), South Korea's second-biggest lender, would provide loans to one of the bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daily cited unnamed investment banking and industry sources as saying that Citigroup (C.N), which is handling the deal, closed the auction on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, if confirmed, comes after U.S. private equity house Lone Star LS.UL sold a 13.6 percent stake in Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) 004940.KS and auctioned off two other South Korean units last week for a combined $2.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CM is the second-largest multi-system cable TV operator in South Korea with 2 million subscribers and the largest in the greater Seoul metropolitan area. The company was not available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had sought to exit from its investment in CM via a dual Seoul-London listing that was expected to fetch up to $500 million this year, sources had told Reuters last November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the stake sale takes place, the listing plan would be delayed or shelved because of a local securities regulation that stipulates IPO candidates should not change majority shareholders one year before the listing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been reaping handsome earnings from South Korean investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It more than doubled its $500 million investment in 1999 in South Korea's top lender, Kookmin Bank 060000.KS, and made hefty gains from selling spirits maker Jinro Ltd. to South Korea's top brewer, Hite Brewery (000140.KS), for $3.4 billion in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also sold its controlling stake in builder Dong Ah Construction Industrial Co. Ltd. in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank is likely to offload its 24 percent stake in Korea Express Co. Ltd. (000120.KS), the country's biggest logistics firm, together with an additional stake from other creditors sometime this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macquarie is the biggest foreign investment bank in South Korea, and MBK, created by former Carlyle Group CYL.UL Asia head Michael Kim, is the most active homegrown fund in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MBK closed a $1.56 billion buyout fund last year, the largest ever for a new private equity firm, and bought South Korea's third-biggest thrift, HK Mutual Savings Bank 007640.KQ, for 117.4 billion won, jointly with Hyundai Capital Services Inc. in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity deals in South Korea have been increasing despite a legal battle over Lone Star's 2003 acquisition of KEB with prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity investment reached $579.6 million in South Korea from 231 transactions in 2006, up 29 percent from $448.7 million in 2005, according to Thomson Financial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=927.8 Won)&lt;/p&gt;

Upon re-initiation of Exubera, lung function changes similar to first time users of Exubera were observed. The studies also showed that patients on an Exubera regimen maintained blood sugar control and generally gained less weight over the three-year period than those on an injected insulin regimen.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 25 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank said it raised the price
targets of General Electric Co. (GE.N), United Technologies
Corp. (UTX.N) and Honeywell International Inc. (HON.N), after
ample evidence of the strength of the aerospace industry was
seen at the Paris Airshow last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said in a research noted dated June 24 that
it came away with more confidence that production capacity
increases over the next few years will see deliveries peak in
the range of 1,150-1,200 by 2010/11 deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said it raised the price target of General
Electric modestly, to $44 from $43, as the aerospace sector
only represents around 10 percent of its earnings. The
brokerage has a "buy" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised the price target of United
Technologies to $79 from $77 and said it reflects the much more
meaningful contribution from aerospace -- about 45 percent of
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
pre-corporate items. The brokerage has a "buy" rating on the
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also raised the price target of Honeywell to $59 from
$57, and maintained its "buy" rating on the stock entering
second quarter 2007 earnings since the company was lapping a
weak prior year quarter which should see organic growth well
above trend.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, June 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N)
looks set to go ahead with its multi-billion dollar
petrochemical project in Singapore, with a major contractor
seeking builders for downstream units, sources close to the
project said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's largest oil company last July appointed a
number of firms to do front-end engineering and design (FEED),
but has yet to announce a final investment decision for a plant
that could double its Singapore ethylene output to nearly 2
million tonnes per year (tpy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foster Wheeler (FWLT.O), charged with planning two units
and associated infrastructure, has met potential
sub-contractors and received initial cost estimates ahead of a
staged bidding process to select sub-contractors to build an
aromatics extraction unit and an oxo-alcohol plant, industry
sources familiar with the process said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are proceeding to obtain sub-contractors as soon as
possible," one industry source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon Mobil spokeswoman said feasibility studies were
"progressing well" and the company expected to make a final
decision "in the near future".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project, due for completion in three to four years on
Jurong Island, is expected to add a further 800,000 to 1
million tonnes of ethylene production capacity to its existing
900,000 tpy Singapore plant, Exxon's largest worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The plan to expand their petrochemical complex... is
almost a done deal," said an analyst at Malaysia's CIMB bank,
who tracks public contractor companies that stand to gain from
the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two new plants, coupled with planned refinery upgrades,
will help utilise more light-end feedstock from the
city-state's nearly 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of
refining capacity, more than half of which is geared toward
export markets that are increasingly demanding cleaner-burning
motor fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although a number of industry sources said they expected
the project to proceed, Exxon Mobil has shown recently its
readiness to pull the plug on projects when soaring
industry-wide costs or economics go against it. In February, it
scrapped plans for a huge gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar after
three years of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THREE STAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foster Wheeler, which together with Australia's Worley
Parsons Ltd. (WOR.AX) was also awarded a coordination and
services contract on the project, must still complete the
three-stage bidding process before making final sub-contract
awards, industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first stage evaluates potential contractor's bids both
technically and commercially. The second fine-tunes costing,
contract scope, and includes interviews to vet key personnel.
The last phase finalises contract scope and costing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We anticipate that contracts are to be awarded to the EPC
contractors sometime between the end of 2007 and mid-2008, if
Exxon Mobil do not change their schedule," said Frankie Tan,
managing director at Singapore's Hiap Seng Engineering
(HSEN.SI), which is bidding for work on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The expansion, known as the Singapore Parallel Train (SPT)
project, includes the construction of a new ethylene cracker,
as well as downstream plants for the production of ethylene and
propylene derivatives, an aromatics extraction unit, an
oxo-alcohol plant and associated infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those involved in the project stand to gain contracts worth
hundreds of millions of dollars, although Exxon Mobil has never
put an estimated investment cost on building the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The investment in the ethylene plant will likely be
$1.0-$1.5 billion. They will also likely build downstream
plants, so the total cost of the investment will be closer to
$2.0-$2.5 billion," said Steve Zinger, a director at chemicals
and downstream market consultancy CMAI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number of industry sources said that Shaw Group Inc.
SGR.N was a front-runner over a joint venture between
France's Technip (TECF.PA) and Japan's Chiyoda Corp. (6366.T)
for design, engineering, procurement and construction work on
the steam cracker, which provides feedstock for the other
units.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Conoco reaction)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Brian Ellsworth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, June 26 (Reuters) - President Hugo Chavez pushed
U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips out of Venezuela
on Tuesday in a nationalization drive the United States said
could hurt its oil supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) quit
their oil operations in the OPEC nation after they failed to
strike a deal to stay in multibillion-dollar projects that the
anti-U.S. leader decreed should be taken over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips said it would have to knock $4.5 billion off
its balance sheet after losing its assets in two Orinoco
ventures and one smaller project, though it had previously said
it believed the assets are worth substantially more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four other oil majors -- Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), Norway's
Statoil (STL.OL), Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) and France's Total
(TOTF.PA) -- signed pacts allowing Venezuela to increase its
stake to as much as percent 83 percent in projects worth $30
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We characterize this ceremony as an act of sovereignty for
our country, for our people," Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez
said after the companies signed the deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The backdrop for the ceremony was a huge poster displaying
Chavez dressed in his signature red with his fist clenched in
the air in the typical salute of his self-styled socialist
revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and ConocoPhillips can now negotiate compensation or
take Venezuela to court for the loss of assets that are part of
four heavy-crude upgrading facilities capable of producing
around 600,000 barrels per day from the vast Orinoco oil belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chavez, who vows to diversify Venezuela's oil customers to
reduce traditional reliance on U.S. oil markets, prides himself
on confronting American "imperialism" even though the United
States is the country's biggest oil importer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington fretted over Tuesday's move by its No. 4 foreign
petroleum supplier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm concerned," U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman told
reporters. When asked if he was worried U.S. oil and product
imports from Venezuela could be reduced with the companies
leaving, he said: "Sure, of course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Driving the U.S. giants out burnishes the anti-U.S.
credentials of Chavez, who can spice his speeches up with the
refrain "Gringos Go Home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, he has squeezed out U.S. telecommunications and
electricity companies in nationalizations. But taking the oil
assets on Tuesday was by far the biggest move he has made
against private property since coming to power in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said it was disappointed to leave Venezuela -- a
country with the world's largest oil reserves outside of the
Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips, which still has a stake in a Venezuelan gas
project, said it is still negotiating with Venezuela over
compensation for its assets. But a source close to the company
said it would leave the country entirely and likely head to
arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although the company is hopeful that the negotiations will
be successful, it has preseved all legal rights including
international arbitration," Conoco said in a statement on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil majors are well-known for withstanding harsh investment
climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total and Statoil agreed to reduce their stakes in their
Orinoco project. BP and Chevron were able to maintain their
share because they were involved in the ventures vacated by
Exxon and ConocoPhillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry officials said the four companies were willing to
stay mainly because crude prices are robust and oil majors are
finding it increasingly difficult to access such large reserves
as are available in the Orinoco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the exit of Exxon and ConocoPhillips highlights how
difficult it can be for foreign companies to do business in a
nation led by a man who calls capitalism an evil and Cuban
leader Fidel Castro his mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chavez depends increasingly on revenue from high oil prices
to maintain the food hand-outs and free doctors visits that
make him popular among the majority poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think this was the right thing to do," said Hilda
Valencia, 50, a bookseller at a kiosk in Caracas. "The natural
resources are for Venezuelans and we can use them as we see
fit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Deisy Buitrago in Caracas, Tom

John Partridge, president of Visa's Inovant LLC affiliate, will become interim president of Visa USA.  Morris will start at Visa Inc. on Sept. 1 and oversee its income-generating businesses. He plans to move to San Francisco from New York and report to Joseph Saunders, Visa Inc.'s chief executive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Morris, 48, has spent his 27-year career at Citigroup and its predecessors. Since November 2002, he has been chief financial officer of Citi Markets &amp; Banking, which includes investment and corporate banking operations. He also sits on Citigroup's operating and management committees.  Citigroup spokesman Daniel Noonan said the largest U.S. bank plans to announce a replacement for Morris soon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Visa first outlined plans last October to float a majority of the company, now owned by its member banks, in an initial public offering to be held within 12 to 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Visa Inc. will combine Visa USA, Visa International and Visa Canada. Its Visa Europe affiliate will remain a membership association and take a minority stake in Visa Inc. The company intends to use IPO proceeds to fund expansion and an escrow account to cover potential legal bills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Smaller rival MasterCard Inc. (MA.N) went public in May 2006, and its shares have since more than quadrupled in value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Saunders became Visa Inc.'s chief executive last month. He had previously been president of card services at Washington Mutual Inc. (WM.N), the largest U.S. thrift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds sellers', analyst comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jeffrey Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta, June 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp.
(XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) want to sell their
combined 18 percent stake in the proposed C$700 million ($654
million) Deep Panuke gas project off Nova Scotia's Atlantic
coast, the broker handling the auction said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The auction spells a shift in the ownership structure for
the long-delayed project shortly before regulators rule on it
and the operator, EnCana Corp. (ECA.TO), makes a decision on
how to get the gas to shore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bids on Exxon Mobil's 12 percent and Shell's 6 percent of
the development are due Aug. 8, IndigoPool, the Houston-based
acquisition and divestiture service, said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The oil majors gained Deep Panuke interests after EnCana,
the operator with a 78 percent interest, drilled on their
acreage to determine the extent of the reserves following the
1998 discovery, EnCana spokesman Alan Boras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 632 billion cubic foot field is 250 km (155 miles)
southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boras declined to say if EnCana might be interested in
bidding for the Exxon Mobil and Shell stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tristone Capital analyst Tom Ebbern said not enough is
known to gauge a rough estimate of the assets' worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would have thought they would just do a one-off deal
with EnCana," Ebbern said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials with Exxon Mobil and Shell said little about why
they are selling out with regulators set to issue a decision on
the project, which could start producing gas that would be
shipped as far as Boston in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil continually evaluates possible divestments and
acquisitions," spokeswoman Margot Bruce-O'Connell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In order to do this we test the interest of other
companies in assets that we think may be of greater value and
strategic fit to others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two oil majors are partners in the nearby Sable gas
project, which started up in 1999 and is still the only
producing project off Nova Scotia despite hundreds of millions
of dollars spent by the industry on exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EnCana had first planned a larger development at Deep
Panuke, but put its first application on hold in 2003, citing
marginal economics. It came back with a slimmed-down proposal
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A regulatory decision for the field, which would produce
300 million cubic feet a day, is expected by the end of the
summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EnCana has been in talks with the Sable partners to
determine if it makes sense to strike a deal to use their
pipeline system to get Deep Panuke gas to shore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.07 Canadian)

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA (Reuters) - A Nigerian court rejected on Tuesday an attempt by the government to amend its case claiming $6.95 billion damages from U.S. drug company Pfizer Inc for a drug trial on children in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government lawyers had tried to add a clause explaining the 11-year delay in bringing the suit, arguing they were waiting for the outcome of the same case in a U.S. court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Babs Kuewumi said they failed to give cogent reasons for the amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The application is hereby struck out," he said, adjourning the start of the substantive trial to July 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government alleges Pfizer failed to obtain regulatory approval and acted unethically when it tested a meningitis drug, Trovan, in the northern Nigerian city of Kano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer says it conducted the tests in the full knowledge of the government and in a responsible and ethical way consistent with its commitment to patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. federal judge in 2005 dismissed a suit accusing Pfizer of not properly warning Nigerian families about the risk of using the drug, saying the case should be heard in a Nigerian court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state government where the tests were conducted has also filed criminal charges and a civil lawsuit seeking $2 billion in damages from Pfizer over the tests, which it alleges caused the deaths of some children and permanent health problems for others. These cases are due to come up early next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said at the time of the meningitis outbreak that Trovan was in late-stage development and had been evaluated in 5,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Trovan for adult use in 1997 but did not approve the drug for use by American children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips rejected on Monday a deal to stay in multibillion-dollar projects that Venezuela is nationalizing, increasing the chances two of the world's top oil companies will leave the OPEC nation, two sources close to the talks said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four other companies -- Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), Norway's Statoil (STL.OL), Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) and France's Total (TOTF.PA) -- plan to sign an accord that will keep them in the massive Orinoco oil reserve projects, a government official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials -- one from the oil industry and the other from the government -- asked not to be named because the state oil company PDVSA planned to announce the negotiations' results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noted negotiations with Exxon (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) could be revived at the eleventh hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But late on Monday, a source close to ConocoPhillips said the company had decided to leave Venezuela entirely, walking out on its stakes in two Orinoco projects as well as its interest in the Corocoro field in the Gulf of Paria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said the dispute was likely headed to arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDVSA said it would sign the deals in a ceremony, which it originally announced for Monday but later postponed until Tuesday. It did not specify which foreign companies would sign to stay on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Hugo Chavez decreed Tuesday as a deadline for the majors to accept terms for the government to take a majority stake in four heavy-crude upgrading projects valued above $30 billion. They can produce 600,000 barrels per day in the Orinoco reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez has pushed a nationalization drive this year, taking over U.S. companies' assets in the telecommunications and electricity sectors as part of a self-styled socialist revolution in the fourth-largest exporter of oil to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and ConocoPhillips would be the most important companies to be forced out by Chavez's nationalization policies since he took office in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 1, Venezuela seized control of the operations of the Orinoco projects, which were among the last privately run fields in the South American nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chavez also gave the six companies extra time to work out a deal over the projects' new ownership structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez, a staunch opponent of U.S. President George W. Bush and who has called capitalism an evil, on Friday said some companies have rejected his government's terms for deals that hammer out the details for Venezuela to take at least a 60 percent stake in projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH TALKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeover talks have been hung up on thorny issues including asset valuation, compensation for lost value, and decision-making rules in the future joint ventures, according to industry officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has taken a hard stance on the government's use of "book value" to decide how much the company's project is worth, while the government has harshly criticized ConocoPhillips for not agreeing to sign a largely symbolic accord recognizing the nationalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies have also insisted the government give them certain veto rights when the board of directors of the new companies make major decisions, according to industry officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the two companies, ConocoPhillips would take the hardest hit if forced to leave Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has stakes in two Orinoco projects, which accounted for about 4 percent of its total production last year. Its earnings from Venezuela were more than $800 million in 2006, according to analysts -- about 5 percent of its total profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Exxon's share of the Cerro Negro project in the Orinoco region was responsible only for about 1 percent of the company's production. Analysts said that losing the project would barely be noticeable because of Exxon's massive earnings power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez's high profile showdown with oil companies has drawn the cheers of the poor majority that overwhelmingly reelected him in December, largely because the former soldier has used billions of dollars in oil revenues to finance social programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that agree to stay on in the projects have two months before a final deal is submitted to the Venezuelan Congress for approval of a new state-majority joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those that refuse to stay in the projects can leave and take Venezuela to court or accept a government offer to negotiate compensation for several months for the nationalized Orinoco assets, several sources familiar with the talks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions were expected to continue between the government and companies until Tuesday's deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the industry and government officials said the position on Monday of Exxon and ConocoPhillips had been clear: they refused to sign a government proposal for a memorandum of understanding that commits them to remaining in the projects with a smaller stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon and Conoco are out," one of the officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michael Erman in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) 
subprime mortgage bonds issued last year are being downgraded 
by rating companies at the fastest rate of any issuer, 
according to Citigroup Inc. research dated June 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Portions of Goldman's GSAMP-issued bonds, which include 
subprime loans from a variety of lenders, have been downgraded 
a combined 69 times by Standard  Poor's and Moody's Investors 
Service in the year through June 15, analysts at Citigroup 
Global Markets said in a weekly note. Sixty of the downgrades 
refer to classes from 2006 bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Downgrades are accelerating on mortgage bonds backed by 
loans to the riskiest borrowers amid a surge in delinquencies 
and foreclosures. Lenders loosened underwriting standards in 
the years through 2006, creating loans whose poor quality 
became apparent as the U.S. housing slump began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At this point we believe that the fundamentals are going 
to be getting worse for quite some time -- another year to two 
you're going to keep seeing a steady march of this," Karen 
Weaver, Deutsche Bank AG's global head of securitization 
research, said on a conference call on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mortgage bond sales and trading has helped boost profit at 
Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, who compete for 
loans from subprime lenders and package them as home equity 
asset-backed securities (ABS) for sale to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was the 15th largest issuer of subprime securities 
last year with $12.9 billion sold, up 59 percent from 2005, 
according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Countrywide Financial 
Corp., the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, was the top seller of 
subprime ABS at $38.5 billion sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The downgraded classes of GSAMP issues were concentrated in 
two ABS deals, a source familiar with the issues said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael Duvally declined immediate 
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares fell 2.5 percent to $216.74 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Downgrades run to the heart of mortgage bonds whose values 
are derived using the ratings. Concerns that downgrades will 
multiply losses to subprime mortgage investors and spread the 
turmoil as suffered by a pair of Bear Stearns hedge funds this 
month has pressured prices on existing issues and raised yields 
on new bonds, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Contagion to non-housing related markets, such as corporate 
debt, is tough to quantify since the economy remains robust, 
Merrill Lynch  Co. analyst Guy Moszkowski said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market for credit default swaps has suggested investors 
see GSAMP bonds as relatively safe. At the end of May, generic 
credit default swap spreads on low-rated GSAMP issues were 485 
basis points, compared with more than 500 basis points on Bear 
Stearns Cos.' BSC.N BSABS subprime bond issuer and above 
1,000 basis points for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s LEH.N 
SAIL issuer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch's MER.N First Franklin subprime mortgage 
bonds have seen the second highest number of downgrades, though 
most of the bonds were issued in 2003, the Citigroup analysts 
noted. The downgrades on those bonds may suggest that borrowers 
may be unable to refinance adjustable-rate loans, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa International said on Wednesday that it has reached a deal to sponsor the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa, owner of the world's largest credit card network, said the 8-year deal with the Federation Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, allows it access to competitions, special events and development programs worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal between Visa and FIFA, soccer's governing body, follows the $90 million settlement on June 21 of a legal fight between FIFA and Visa rival MasterCard Inc. (MA.N), which had sponsored the tournament for 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard had sued FIFA in April 2006 after the soccer group awarded the coveted sponsorship for the next two World Cups to Visa. MasterCard claimed it had right of first refusal on future sponsorship of the tournament, the world's most watched sports event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the settlement MasterCard said it decided to settle for business reasons and that it no longer wanted to work with FIFA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa will pay $170 million for the sponsorship, $10 million less than it had originally bid, FIFA President Joseph Blatter said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look forward to activating our FIFA partnership," said John Elkins, executive vice president at Visa International. "We know first hand how valuable a global sporting property can be in driving business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa, which already sponsors the Olympic Games and the Rugby World Cup, is preparing to combine Visa USA, Visa International and Visa Canada into Visa Inc., which is planning to go public by early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2010 World Cup will be held in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background in last two paragraphs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sophie Taylor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI, June 27 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) is considering
building a chipmaking facility at its plant in southern China to
make advanced semiconductors, two sources familiar with the
situation said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM already has a plant in Shenzhen for servers, and early
this year senior management discussed whether they could make
chips instead of importing them into China to put into their
servers," said a China-based industry source close to IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source did not exclude the possibility that IBM would
sell chips from the facility to outside clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another of the sources said chips made in the prospective
plant may be sold to outside customers such as Huawei
Technologies Co. [HWT.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No comment was immediately available from IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan and investment amount have yet to be finalised, the
sources said, but added that the Shenzhen city goverment was
expected to be a key backer of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp. (INTC.O), the world's largest chipmaker, said in
March it would invest $2.5 billion to build a microchip plant in
northeastern China, which will be its first semiconductor plant
in Asia, with the production of chipsets to begin in 2010.
China's biggest personal computer company, Lenovo Group
(0992.HK), bought out IBM's (IBM.N) PC division in 2005 for $1.25
billion.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Blankfein comments on private equity)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - The world is a less risky
place these days, but that doesn't mean investors should stop
preparing for bad times, Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) Chairman
and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recent troubles in the U.S. mortgage market and fears that
booming corporate lending has become reckless in recent months
has prompted some investors to question whether the market is
getting paid enough for taking risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spread between top grade and junk debt remains thin, as
investors flush with cash snap up every kind of asset around
the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at a Wall Street Journal dealmakers conference,
Blankfein said he remained optimistic about the state of the
global economy and the ability of markets to price risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think the world has become less risky," Blankfein said.
"That doesn't mean that with hindsight we will find that risk
was underappreciated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein, who rose to the top spot at the world's largest
investment bank as a commodities trader, jokes that "nervous is
my resting position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the most important jobs at Goldman, he told Reuters,
is to manage risk and avoid problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But amid a growing chorus of warnings that the recent boom
in financial markets was nearing its peak, Blankfein said his
view of the world was "generally positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman recently reported second-quarter results that show
that it has extended more capital through loans and investments
than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while Blankfein noted that the market sets the price of
options and credit protection, he notes the market isn't always
perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The odds of a hurricane striking doesn't change from day to
day, he said, "but the day after a hurricane the price of
insurance is higher. That's sentiment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added, "There hasn't been a hurricane in the market for
a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With that in mind, Blankfein said Goldman Sachs "is
positioning the organization like the market is undervaluing
risk. We are in a high state of nervousness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PRIVATE EQUITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But by the same token, Blankfein said the prolonged boom in
leveraged buyouts -- deals that have been fueled by aggressive
financing -- won't end any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity firms "shake things up" and prompt
improvements at underperforming companies. Their use of
leverage helps companies boost returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most speculative deals "may go by the boards,"
Blankfein said at the conference, but the LBO trend is not
"going out of style."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to being the top advisor to buyout firms,
Goldman is itself also one of the biggest private equity
investors. The bank recently closed a $20 billion fund, the
largest ever buyout fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buyouts are on pace to exceed last year's record levels by
the end of the third quarter, though in recent weeks there have
been signs that the boom market is flagging. Buyout shops are
facing greater resistance from the debt investors who finance
deals, target company shareholders and more recently Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein said he opposes efforts by some lawmakers to
impose higher taxes on private equity profits, a development
that would zap the high returns these funds can generate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think you have to look at this entire scheme. I'm not
comfortable with the approach I hear about in the papers,"
Blankfein said. "This sense of 'we have to get these guys ...,'
I will say it's very dangerous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity firms and their turnaround of companies play
an important role in keeping the economy growing, he said.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. introduced two new online services to its Windows Live line-up on Tuesday and said it plans to release more Web offerings this year to beef up its Internet strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to take on Web competitors Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc. with its "software plus services" strategy, that aims to leverage its dominant market position for software running on the computer to a new suite of services delivered over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company offers a suite of online services including e-mail and Web search under its Windows Live brand. Microsoft said it will introduce test versions of two new free services: Windows Live Folders and Windows Live Photo Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Jones, Microsoft's corporate vice president, said the company will unveil the next wave of services later this year, but its goal will be to stitch together the disparate Windows Live services and offer a more unified experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Soon we'll begin to offer a single installer which will give customers the option of an all-in-one download for the full Windows Live suite of services instead of the separate installation experience you see today," said Jones in a posting on Microsoft's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Live Photo Gallery is a new version of the photo application found on Microsoft's two most recent operating systems, Windows XP and Windows Vista. It simplifies how people can share photos on their Windows Live Spaces site, Microsoft's social networking platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharing feature of Microsoft's new Photo Gallery is similar to how users can publish pictures from Apple Inc.'s iPhoto application to the company's .Mac online service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it is open to eventually letting users post to other photo sharing sites such as Yahoo's Flickr, if it can establish common protocols and standards with those Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Live Folders will provide up to 500 megabytes of online storage in the United States in a limited test release. Microsoft said it will gauge usage during the test release and possibly add more capacity if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sees Windows Live Folders as a way people can share documents, but not necessarily a place where users can back up all the files on a computer hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has been widely rumored to be working on an online storage service, but the company has remained mum on the issue. However, Google offers a variety of services that include large amounts of free data storage, including Gmail and Docs  Spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - Two senior executives working in
Europe's emerging carbon markets are changing jobs to join
investment banks in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ken Newcombe is joining Goldman Sachs (GS.N) from
London-based Climate Change Capital (CCC), which invests in
carbon offset projects in developing countries. Newcombe had
previously set up the world's first such carbon fund at the
World Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Abyd Karmali will become Global Head of Carbon Emissions at
investment bank Merrill Lynch MER.N, and was formerly a
director at consultants ICF International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carbon markets, centred around a European scheme, allow rich
countries and companies to buy carbon emissions rights from each
other and also from developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This emissions trading system is seen as one policy measure
for fighting climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They got a big boost when the Democratic party took control
of U.S. Congress, signalling the beginning of a shift in U.S.
climate policy which has made a federal U.S. carbon market
likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carbon markets are growing rapidly, on the expectation that
governments will take ever tougher action against climate

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world is a less risky place these days, but that doesn't mean investors should stop preparing for bad times, Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent troubles in the U.S. mortgage market and fears that booming corporate lending has become reckless in recent months has prompted some investors to question whether the market is getting paid enough for taking risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread between top grade and junk debt remains thin, as investors flush with cash snap up every kind of asset around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a Wall Street Journal dealmakers conference, Blankfein said he remained optimistic about the state of the global economy and the ability of markets to price risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the world has become less risky," Blankfein said. "That doesn't mean that with hindsight we will find that risk was underappreciated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who rose to the top spot at the world's largest investment bank as a commodities trader, jokes that "nervous is my resting position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important jobs at Goldman, he told Reuters, is to manage risk and avoid problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But amid a growing chorus of warnings that the recent boom in financial markets was nearing its peak, Blankfein said his view of the world was "generally positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman recently reported second-quarter results that show that it has extended more capital through loans and investments than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Blankfein noted that the market sets the price of options and credit protection, he notes the market isn't always perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odds of a hurricane striking doesn't change from day to day, he said, "but the day after a hurricane the price of insurance is higher. That's sentiment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, "There hasn't been a hurricane in the market for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, Blankfein said Goldman Sachs "is positioning the organization like the market is undervaluing risk. We are in a high state of nervousness."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, share price move, dateline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Wednesday
raised Cytec Industries Inc. (CYT.N) to "buy" and added the
specialty chemicals and materials company to its Americas
investment buy list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares were up 3.8 percent at $63.99 in
midday trading, after having risen as high as $64.90, earlier
in the session on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cytec is poised to benefit from lower fixed costs,
selective pricing increases, along with its aggressive cost
savings and production rationalization initiatives," Goldman
Sachs analyst Robert Koort said in a note to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cytec stock has risen about 12.8 percent over the last
three months, outpacing the Standard  Poor's Chemicals Index
that has risen about 5.1 percent during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said sustained strength in Cytec's franchise
engineered materials business and the management's efforts to
restore operating profit margins in its chemicals businesses
should lead to a higher value over the coming quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Koort, who also raised his price target on the stock to $75
from $66, said the company will also benefit from lower raw
materials costs going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a separate research note, Jefferies  Co. analyst
Laurence Alexander said Cytec might be a likely takeover
candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cytec could prove attractive due to its platforms in
aerospace composites, mining chemicals, and environmentally
friendly coatings," Alexander said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Cyntia Barrera Diaz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, June 28 (Reuters) - With domestic expansion curbed by tight regulation, the cable and Internet unit of Mexican broadcaster Televisa (TV.N)(TLVACPO.MX) has its sights on acquisitions outside the country to boost growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cablevision, which is also expanding into phone services in Mexico next month, sees Argentina and Brazil as natural markets due to the countries' size but does not rule out purchases in other Latin American nations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Those are markets with a strong potential in pay television ... but obviously they are very competitive markets," Cablevision Chief Executive Jean Paul Broc told Reuters on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One of the reasons Cablevision is looking further afield is what it sees as an abundance of regulatory red tape which has slowed down its latest planned acquisitions at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With 530,000 clients in Mexico City and surrounding areas, Cablevision is waiting for regulators to give the go ahead to two purchases that would more than double its television subscriber base while giving the company a grip on wealthy residential areas in the north of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "One of the obstacles has been the limits set by the government. Seeing that there are no options here, we are looking for options elsewhere," said Broc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mexico's Federal Competition Commission (CFC) is reviewing Televisa's planned acquisition of stakes in Monterrey-based cable operators Television Internacional (TVI) and Cablemas. A final decision is expected soon, Broc said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Together the two companies would add at least 700,000 new cable subscribers to Cablevision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cablevision is also preparing to kick off phone services in July, tapping a market led by telecommunications giant Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) TMX.N TELMEXL.MX. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    According to Broc, a phone call using Cablevision's broadband network could be up to 30 percent cheaper than one generated by an existing provider but he declined to offer more details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By the end of 2007, Cablevision expects to have some 10,000 phone customers, just a fraction of Telmex's fixed-line customer base of around 19 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (With additional reporting by Tomas Sarmiento) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Cyntia Barrera Diaz, editing by Tim Dobbyn; Reuters Messaging: cyntia.barrera.reuters.com@reuters.net +52 55 5282-7153)) Keywords: MEXICO CABLEVISION/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Ransdell Pierson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on Thursday its board will invite its largest institutional shareholders to a meeting this fall to review the U.S. drugmaker's governance policies, including executive compensation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, which is struggling with anemic earnings and failure to launch enough important medicines to offset declining sales of older medicines, said the institutional investors invited to the event own about 35 percent of its shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The fact that Pfizer's board is convening with such a large group of its shareholders and intends to make it a regular event would appear to set a precedent" among U.S. companies, said Howard Sherman, chief executive officer of Governancemetrics Intl., a corporate governance research and ratings agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This is truly noteworthy because it is rare for outside shareholders to have any communication with the board of directors," Sherman said. "And on governance matters, it all comes down to the board." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Instead, companies now communicate with shareholders through their investor relations executive, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or corporate governance officer.  Sherman said the planned meetings likely were prompted by shareholder dissatisfaction with the almost $200 million retirement package given Hank McKinnell when he was replaced as Pfizer CEO last summer -- even though Pfizer shares fell 40 percent under his watch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer may also be setting the stage to allow its shareholders to vote on executive compensation packages, a practice that is now common among companies in the United Kingdom following the so-called "Say to Pay" movement there, Sherman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In recent decades, Pfizer has spearheaded other improvements in corporate governance, including its requirement that board members be elected by a majority vote of shareholders and the elimination of its poison pill, a device used to discourage unfriendly takeovers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Prenatal cocaine exposure may have lasting effects on a child's ability to pay attention during the early school years, new study findings suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This study provides further evidence of a subtle but consistent effect on attention through early school-aged years," lead author Veronica Accornero of the University of Miami commented in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies in animals have shown that cocaine exposure before birth leads to problems with selective and sustained attention. In some cases, the cocaine-associated deficits were apparent even in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, cocaine exposure has been linked to arousal and attention problems among infants and toddlers. Few researchers have examined whether such effects are long-lasting, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, Accornero and her colleagues looked at attention and response inhibition test results from 415 children involved in the long-term Miami Prenatal Cocaine Study. About half - 219 children -- were exposed to cocaine before birth and 196 children had not experienced such prenatal cocaine exposure. All of the children completed at least one Continuous Performance Test, which measures vigilance and response inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 5, the children were told to press a switch to identify a target figure out of two figures randomly presented on a computer screen. At the age of 7, they were presented with various bold-faced letters during a certain time period and were told to press the space bar for every letter, except the letter X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children exposed to cocaine in utero had more errors in omission at ages 5 and 7 during their respective tests, the researchers report in this month's Journal of Developmental  Behavioral Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 7-year-old exposed children also took longer to press the space bar than did their non-cocaine-exposed peers, and were less consistent in their responses than were their peers, the report indicates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the cocaine-related deficits in attention processing "are generally persistent across the years bridging the preschool and school-age period," the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the greater attention problems observed among the cocaine-exposed children, however, the "clinical significance is as yet unclear," particularly with regard to these children's school performance in later years, Accornero and her team note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Certainly, attention and the ability to maintain attention is an important skill that supports the development of other skills like language and behavior," she said. "It's possible that because of subtle deficits we may see an effect on academic performance. We just don't know yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOURCE: Journal of Developmental  Behavioral Pediatrics, June 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DRESDEN, Germany (Reuters) - Supercomputing, once the preserve of top scientific and academic institutions which needed entire rooms to house their gigantic machines, can now be had out of a box from Microsoft for $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem for Microsoft is to persuade small companies on a budget and without IT expertise they actually need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the International Supercomputing Conference in Dresden this week, Microsoft -- a tiny player in the $10 billion market -- campaigned to bring high-performance computing (HPC) to the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is on a mission to persuade small companies they need -- and can manage -- affordable HPC systems that run on the familiar Windows system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPC is any type of computing system that uses more than one computer working in parallel or clusters to solve complicated problems in fields such as engineering, meteorology or genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It includes the so-called supercomputers used by the likes of CERN, the world's largest particle-physics lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, Microsoft has about 2 to 3 percent of the market, according to market research firm IDC, with the vast majority of HPC systems running on open-source Linux or its cousin, Unix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kyril Faenov, who is heading Microsoft's HPC drive, is bullish about the company's prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows server has over 60 percent market share in markets where Microsoft is active," he told Reuters. "We're aspiring to the same share as we have in other markets. That's a comfortable target for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO TIME FRAME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to specify a time frame for Microsoft to reach that goal, and admitted: "The hardest thing is delivering the message about where Microsoft brings value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDC technical computing analyst Jie Wu said there was room for Microsoft to make an impact on the market but it would need good business applications to persuade smaller companies they needed more processing power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there are no applications, users don't have anything to play with so there's no incentive," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has teamed up with partners including French software company Dassault Systemes, the MathWorks Inc. and Parallel Geoscience Corp. to build applications running on the Windows cluster server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Wu said so far she saw little appetite in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We talk to companies every quarter and we ask them but so far they're not interested," she said. "But when the timing's right Microsoft is ready to jump on the speedwagon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, whose BlueGene/L computer was confirmed this week as the world's most powerful computer system for the fourth time running, has less interest in the lower end of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not like the iPod market. You're not talking about millions and millions of users. It's still measured in the tens of thousands," IBM's head of deep computing, Dave Turek, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The nature of what HPC is not widely understood," he said, but added: "Microsoft in a way has taken up the baton -- and good for them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDC's Wu said the truth was simply that Microsoft could afford to take the risk. "They are very ambitious because they have deep pockets."&lt;/p&gt;

the duration of the shutdown of the unit which has a name plate capacity of
26,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nair dismissed as inaccurate a recent media report which said that
because of the work other units such as the 110,000 bpd catalytic cracker
or the 126,000 bpd reformer would be partially shut until the repairs are
completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are rumors floating around ... This sounds inaccurate," Nair
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The cat cracker is operating normally but the hydrocracker is
undergoing repairs," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nair declined to give any estimate on product losses due to the
hydrocracker's downtime but added, "We are still able to meet our customer
commitments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shutdown of the unit, which began on Saturday, was originally
expected to last through Monday morning and have a minimal impact on
production, according to a filing by the company with the Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hydrocracker was shut to repair an exchanger leak.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) said on
Thursday its $3.5 billion Tahiti project in the Gulf of Mexico
will be delayed because of problems with the facility's mooring
shackles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company said it had begun the process to order new
shackles that connect components of the mooring line together
and hold the facility to the sea floor.

Additional testing was ordered after Chevron's contractor discovered a metallurgical problem with shackles on a similar installation for another company. Metallurgical problems were subsequently discovered in the Tahiti shackles as well.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeating June 27 story, with no change to text)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Red Hat Inc. (RHT.N) Chief
Executive Matthew Szulik said his company last year held talks
with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) over a patent agreement that broke
down before the software giant signed a deal with Red Hat rival
Novell Inc NOVL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The developer of Linux software, has yet to sign such a
deal which could see Novell, its biggest rival, woo customers
away from Red Hat and work on product development and sales
with the world's No.1 software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview with Reuters, Szulik declined to say
whether his company is now in negotiations with Microsoft over
signing such a patent agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I can't answer the question," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials with Microsoft couldn't be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May of this year, Microsoft made a broad claim that
open-source programs, including Linux programs from Novell and
Red Hat, violate 235 of the world's largest software maker's
patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of their November 2006 business partnership,
Microsoft agreed not to sue Novell customers for any patent
violations that might come up as a result of their use of
Novell's Linux software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has since urged other open-source software
companies to enter into similar patent agreements and signed
deals with at two of them, privately held Xandros Inc. and
Linspire Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Red Hat, a distributor of Linux software for business
computers and the world's largest open-source software company,
were to enter into a patent agreement with Microsoft it would
risk losing the right to distribute key parts of the Linux
operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of the code in its flagship product, Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, is distributed under the terms of a licensing
agreement known as the General Public License, version 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An update to that license, version 3, is about to be
implemented. It will forbid companies from distributing Linux
software if they enter into patent agreements like the ones
that Microsoft signed with Novell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Free Software Foundation, which authored the General
Public License and owns rights to much of the code at the heart
of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, inserted that clause into the
agreement in an effort to discourage other open-source software
developers from signing patent deals with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The authors of that license have said they believe that
such patent deals will help Microsoft back claims that its
intellectual property is being violated by code in Linux and
other open source software, eventually giving the company
ammunition to seek billions of dollars in license fees from
users of open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Linux is the biggest rival to Microsoft Windows and also
the most popular type of open-source software.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, June 28 (Reuters) - Japan's Chiyoda Corp.
(6366.T) has lost its bid to build a billion-dollar
petrochemical unit for Exxon Mobil Corp. in Singapore, a
company official said on Thursday, leaving Shaw's Stone 
Webster as the sole candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A year ago Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) invited bids from the
U.S.-based Shaw Group Inc. SGR.N unit and a joint venture
between France's Technip (TECF.PA) and Chiyoda for engineering,
procurement and construction (EPC) work on the steam cracker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(We are) definitely not doing the EPC work for the steam
cracker... a different contractor will be doing it," Chiyoda's
sales director, Katsuo Nagasaka, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry sources said local contractors have recently
received a written notice from Chiyoda that they will not be
performing the EPC works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One source with a local industry services firm said they
expected an announcement soon to confirm Shaw as the formal
winners of the bid, which would also likely signal Exxon
Mobil's intent to proceed with the project, estimated to cost
over $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon Mobil spokeswoman in Singapore declined to comment
on the contract award, saying only that work on the feasibility
study was progressing well and it expected to make a final
investment decision in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed project, due for completion in three to four
years on Jurong island, is expected to add a further 800,000 to
1 million tonnes of ethylene production capacity to its
existing 900,000 tpy Singapore plant, Exxon's largest
worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the necessary investment would total over $1
billion for the steam cracker, although the winner of the EPC
bid would farm out much of the work to sub-contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The cost to build an 800,000-tonne steam cracker in
Singapore will likely be $1.0-$1.3 billion. Prices have
increased over recent years due to the tightness in engineering
and construction," said Steve Zinger, a director at chemicals
and downstream market consultancy CMAI.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. said on Friday 
it made two changes to its corporate bylaws, including a 
measure allowing the board of directors to adopt a stockholder 
rights plan by a majority vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The new provisions are "part of the whole set of steps we 
have been taking to improve corporate governance," a company 
spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The measure giving the board the ability to adopt a 
stockholder rights plan, which is often referred to as a 
"poison pill" and is used to fend off hostile takeovers, is 
similar to a proposal from a shareholder at the company's most 
recent annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The difference is that the earlier shareholder proposal 
called for 75 percent of the board members to approve a plan 
versus the simple majority as outlined by Friday's 
announcement. At the time of the board meeting, Disney chairman 
John Pepper said the company would consider the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, Disney adopted a change providing that, in 
uncontested elections for board seats, a majority vote was 
needed to elect a board member. Previously only a plurality of 
yes votes was necessary. Disney said back in December it was 
planning on adopting this second change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, context, share price, dateline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO, June 29 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA.O(TEVA.TA) on Friday said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared a generic version of Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE.N) lucrative blood pressure drug, Norvasc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Total annual sales of the drug are about $2.8 billion,  Israel-based Teva said. Once one of Pfizer's biggest selling drugs, an incoming flood of generics is expected to eat dramatically into sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rival generic drugmaker Mylan Laboratories Inc. MYL.N in March launched a generic form of the medicine, known generically as amlodipine, after a federal appeals court declared some of Pfizer's patent claims invalid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mylan has sued U.S. regulators, claiming it is entitled to the standard 180-day marketing exclusivity typically granted to the first generic drug on the U.S. market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In May, privately held drugmaker Apotex Corp. said it launched a generic version of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mylan shares slipped about 1 percent, or 21 cents to $18.16 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Teva shares were flat at $41.03 on Nasdaq. Pfizer shares were off 17 cents, or 0.62 percent, at $25.46 on the NYSE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The drug is approved to treat hypertension, or high blood pressure and certain types of chest pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   (Reporting by Kim Dixon.

&lt;p&gt;DRESDEN, Germany (Reuters) - The next big thing in computing could be systems to save the world from drowning in a rapidly rising sea of data, the head of deep computing at IBM (IBM.N) told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave Turek said powerful new tools were urgently needed to deal with the volume of data now generated by machines such as sensors, RFID systems and medical instruments -- as well as people -- that is threatening to become overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, the world generated, captured and replicated about 161 billion gigabytes -- about 3 million times the information in all the books ever written -- according to market research firm IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDC predicts that number will increase more than six-fold by 2010, as the amount of digital bits churned out by scientific institutions, the financial and medical sectors as well as media file sharing over the likes of YouTube (GOOG.O) accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of the time people talk about what's the next killer application, you know, voice over IP or something like that," Turek said, referring to the sector's constant search for the holy grail that will drive sales of a new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I actually think there is a new class of applications emerging that has the potential to change everything and those are applications that I would put in the category of real-time stream processing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the International Supercomputing Conference in Dresden, Turek said simply storing all the data and then analyzing it later was not a solution, since many industries needed to be able to use them to get fast answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the issue isn't the cost of storage, I think the issue is the volume of data and the requirement to get answers quickly. Because you see if your model is: 'I'm going to generate data and then store it,' you're sort of wasting time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turek cited the examples of financial traders wrestling with multiple data streams while making split-second decisions or high-tech medical institutions needing to make fast decisions on the basis of clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, whose BlueGene/L was confirmed this week as the world's most powerful computer system for the fourth time running, has been researching the problem of real-time analysis for the past four years and has spent hundreds of man-years on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody knows the answers to any of these questions. All I'm saying is that when you ask me about where the future's going, this as a thematic area is going to be a big area, "he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may take two or three years to figure this out but somebody will figure this out and I think this will be a major, major part of what the industry's all about."&lt;/p&gt;

early 2010, bringing the site's capacity to 7 billion cubic
feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron subsidiary Chevron Pipe Line Co. declined to give

connects to the El Paso Natural Gas Line, Transwestern Gas Co.
and Northern Natural Gas Co. pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demand for gas storage has surged in the United States in
recent years, driven largely by a fleet of gas-fired power
plants that operate during high-demand periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The facility's withdrawal capability is 400 million cubic

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Ransdell Pierson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on Thursday its board will invite its largest institutional shareholders to a meeting this fall to review the U.S. drugmaker's governance policies, including executive compensation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, which is struggling with anemic earnings and failure to launch enough important medicines to offset declining sales of older medicines, said the institutional investors invited to the event own about 35 percent of its shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The fact that Pfizer's board is convening with such a large group of its shareholders and intends to make it a regular event would appear to set a precedent" among U.S. companies, said Howard Sherman, chief executive officer of Governancemetrics Intl., a corporate governance research and ratings agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This is truly noteworthy because it is rare for outside shareholders to have any communication with the board of directors," Sherman said. "And on governance matters, it all comes down to the board." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Instead, companies now communicate with shareholders through their investor relations executive, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or corporate governance officer.  Sherman said the planned meetings likely were prompted by shareholder dissatisfaction with the almost $200 million retirement package given Hank McKinnell when he was replaced as Pfizer CEO last summer -- even though Pfizer shares fell 40 percent under his watch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer may also be setting the stage to allow its shareholders to vote on executive compensation packages, a practice that is now common among companies in the United Kingdom following the so-called "Say to Pay" movement there, Sherman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In recent decades, Pfizer has spearheaded other improvements in corporate governance, including its requirement that board members be elected by a majority vote of shareholders and the elimination of its poison pill, a device used to discourage unfriendly takeovers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;BISSAU, June 29 (Reuters) - The former prime minister of Guinea-Bissau said a huge cocaine haul which mysteriously disappeared from police custody several months ago had been burnt on his orders. The seizure in September of the cocaine with an estimated street value of $25 million was the biggest ever drugs bust in the West African country, increasingly used by South American cartels as a staging post into Europe. It generated a scandal less than a month later when a judge freed the two main suspects and the 674 kg (1,486 lb) of cocaine went missing from a state treasury vault. Even senior ministers were at a loss to explain the disappearance of the drugs. Former Prime Minister Aristides Gomes said the disappearance of the cocaine had been used by opposition parties to discredit his government, which was toppled by a no-confidence vote in parliament in March amid allegations he was complicit in drug trafficking. Under pressure from me and my direct order the 674 kg of cocaine were burned in my absence, Gomes, a close ally of President Joao Bernardo Vieira, told a news conference late on Thursday. Anyone who doubts that can take the affair to the courts. In the wake of the drug's disappearance, Vieira dismissed the police chief leading the fight against drug cartels and created a commission to probe high-level government involvement in trafficking. There was no crime committed in this affair and it is not normal for members of my government to be questioned by an inappropriate police institution, Gomes said. Drug trafficking is essentially carried out by foreigners who take advantage of our porous borders. Impoverished Guinea-Bissau, whose economy relies on the export of peanuts, has been devastated by coups and uprisings since independence from Portugal in 1974.  U.N. officials fear its penniless government could fall easy victim to wealthy South American cartels using it as a staging post to Europe unless the international community comes to its aid.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds official statement, market comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Yaw Yan Chong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, June 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) on
Friday began shutting its 309,000 barrels per day (bpd)
Singapore refinery, the larger of its two facilities in the
city state, for a month and a half of routine maintenance, the
company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shutdown of the mainland Singapore plant, planned since
earlier this year, will last for about seven weeks until the
second half of July. Together with Exxon's 296,000-bpd Jurong
Island refinery, the Singapore facility is the world's fifth
largest such complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ExxonMobil Singapore's Refinery (Jurong site) has
commenced the shutdown of several operating units for planned
maintenance beginning 29 June, 2007. The overall duration of
this maintenance is expected to last about seven weeks," the
company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is scheduled maintenance. Shutting the units down
will provide an opportunity for detailed inspection of
equipment normally in continuous operation; routine
maintenance; and installation of facility improvement
projects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry sources said the crude distillation units (CDUs)
and other secondary units at the plant will be taken down in
stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil traders say the turnaround will add support to fuel
prices in Asia's main physical oil product trading hub,
although it comes after the end of the heaviest second-quarter
turnaround season for most South Korean and Japanese refiners,
and Exxon can draw supplies from elsewhere in its global
system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The impact may be greatest on the gas oil market,
particularly for the benchmark 0.5 percent sulphur grade, which
has languished in a discount since end-May as demand waned
after major buyers Indonesia and Vietnam moved to lower-sulphur
grades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuel oil traders saw limited immediate impact, saying the
oil major has already stockpiled enough supplies to meet its
term commitments to the marine fuels and cargo markets to
end-July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The impact will come after the turnaround as the oil major
has started stockpiling its straight-run fuel oil, which
normally would be fed into secondary units, for processing when
the units are back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon would probably have more fuel oil after the
turnaround as the straight-run parcels will be cracked after
the secondary units are back online, adding to its existing
volumes," a Singapore-based Western fuel oil trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Little external impact is also expected in the
light-distillate market, as most of Exxon's gasoline and
naphtha barrels are moved within its own global system, said
traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The major maintenance overhaul of the plant comes nearly
two months after a fire struck Exxon's Jurong Island complex,
forcing the company to close a 125,000-bpd CDU for just over
two weeks.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Cyntia Barrera Diaz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, June 28 (Reuters) - With domestic expansion curbed by tight regulation, the cable and Internet unit of Mexican broadcaster Televisa (TV.N)(TLVACPO.MX) has its sights on acquisitions outside the country to boost growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cablevision, which is also expanding into phone services in Mexico next month, sees Argentina and Brazil as natural markets due to the countries' size but does not rule out purchases in other Latin American nations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Those are markets with a strong potential in pay television ... but obviously they are very competitive markets," Cablevision Chief Executive Jean Paul Broc told Reuters on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One of the reasons Cablevision is looking further afield is what it sees as an abundance of regulatory red tape which has slowed down its latest planned acquisitions at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With 530,000 clients in Mexico City and surrounding areas, Cablevision is waiting for regulators to give the go ahead to two purchases that would more than double its television subscriber base while giving the company a grip on wealthy residential areas in the north of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "One of the obstacles has been the limits set by the government. Seeing that there are no options here, we are looking for options elsewhere," said Broc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mexico's Federal Competition Commission (CFC) is reviewing Televisa's planned acquisition of stakes in Monterrey-based cable operators Television Internacional (TVI) and Cablemas. A final decision is expected soon, Broc said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Together the two companies would add at least 700,000 new cable subscribers to Cablevision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cablevision is also preparing to kick off phone services in July, tapping a market led by telecommunications giant Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) TMX.N TELMEXL.MX. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    According to Broc, a phone call using Cablevision's broadband network could be up to 30 percent cheaper than one generated by an existing provider but he declined to offer more details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By the end of 2007, Cablevision expects to have some 10,000 phone customers, just a fraction of Telmex's fixed-line customer base of around 19 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (With additional reporting by Tomas Sarmiento) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Cyntia Barrera Diaz, editing by Tim Dobbyn; Reuters Messaging: cyntia.barrera.reuters.com@reuters.net +52 55 5282-7153)) Keywords: MEXICO CABLEVISION/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. said on Friday 
it made two changes to its corporate bylaws, including a 
measure allowing the board of directors to adopt a stockholder 
rights plan by a majority vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The new provisions are "part of the whole set of steps we 
have been taking to improve corporate governance," a company 
spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The measure giving the board the ability to adopt a 
stockholder rights plan, which is often referred to as a 
"poison pill" and is used to fend off hostile takeovers, is 
similar to a proposal from a shareholder at the company's most 
recent annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The difference is that the earlier shareholder proposal 
called for 75 percent of the board members to approve a plan 
versus the simple majority as outlined by Friday's 
announcement. At the time of the board meeting, Disney chairman 
John Pepper said the company would consider the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, Disney adopted a change providing that, in 
uncontested elections for board seats, a majority vote was 
needed to elect a board member. Previously only a plurality of 
yes votes was necessary. Disney said back in December it was 
planning on adopting this second change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co.'s animated movie 
"Ratatouille" opens on Friday against strong competition from 
better-known franchise films, drawing early industry skepticism 
that it can match its predecessors' success and posing a 
challenge for Disney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yet, as the film has debuted and positive reviews have 
poured in, the sentiment has seemed to be growing that 
"Ratatouille," about a cuisine-loving rat who risks his life to 
indulge in French cooking, could prove another box office hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney is still proving to investors that last year's 
acquisition of Pixar Animation is worth its $7.4 billion price 
tag, and "Ratatouille" is the first Pixar film to be released 
that was still in production when the Disney-Pixar deal was 
sealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pixar's seven previous films all opened at No. 1 at U.S. 
and Canadian box offices, but "Ratatouille" faces stiff rivalry 
for that headline-grabbing spot from Bruce Willis action film 
"Live Free or Die Hard" and second-weekend audiences of family 
film "Evan Almighty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are in a super-competitive time frame," said Paul 
Degarabedian, president of box office tracker Media By Numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most recent four Pixar movies have generated huge 
opening-weekend ticket sales, ranging from $70.5 million for 
"The Incredibles" in 2004 to $60.1 for "Cars" last year, 
according to Media By Numbers. Predictions for the three-day 
debut of "Ratatouille" vary widely from $50 million to $65 
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But industry and Wall Street analysts said the film could 
perform well in the long run if it could appeal to families and 
stay in theaters longer, giving it "legs" at the box office.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GROWING SENTIMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMH Capital analyst David Miller sees the opening weekend 
of "Ratatouille" slightly surpassing "Cars," with a $65 million 
debut and an ultimate global box office take of $572 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For the CGI (computer-generated image) animated films, we 
are not going to place as much emphasis (on the debut) as the 
global ultimates," Miller said. "Our research shows that 
families of kids will skip the opening weekend," Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank analyst Doug Mitchelson forecast an opening 
"lower than recent Pixar films" at about $50 million, but said 
strong reviews could boost its domestic box office take above 
$200 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Online ticketing site Fandango.com said "Ratatouille" had 
accounted for 50 percent of all ticket sales by midday on 
Friday, pulling ahead of "Live Free or Die Hard" at 10 percent. 
MovieTickets.com showed the film with 13 times the advance 
sales of the animated "Surf's Up," which debuted at $17.6 
million earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics have almost universally praised the film, calling 
it "a high-water mark for everyone at Pixar" and "so advanced, 
so sophisticated, it doesn't feel like it was made for kids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Ratatouille" was directed by Brad Bird, maker of critical 
hit "The Iron Giant" and Pixar's "The Incredibles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Disney were trading up 22 cents or 0.65 percent 
at $34.07 on the New York Stock Exchange, but in a sign of 
growing enthusiasm as the movie has reached theaters, U.S. 
options trading in Disney shares was brisk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the U.S. options market, traders and analysts cited 
strong buying in Disney calls, notably ones giving investors 
the right to buy Disney shares at $35 and $37.50 by mid-August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In late afternoon trading, 26,909 calls versus 6,426 puts 
had traded in Disney, more than five times regular volume, 
according to market research firm Track Data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (With additional reporting by Doris Frankel in Chicago)&lt;/p&gt;
