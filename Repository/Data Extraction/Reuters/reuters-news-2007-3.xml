&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) plans to hand operations of a multibillion-dollar oil project to the Venezuelan state before a May 1 deadline imposed by President Hugo Chavez, industry sources told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Chavez this week signed a decree for the government to take a majority stake in four heavy crude upgrading projects in the Orinoco basin by May 1 as part of a nationalization drive toward Cuba-inspired socialism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move shows Exxon, the world's largest company, complying with Chavez's order to cede control of the Cerro Negro project despite doubts over whether private companies will in fact meet Chavez's ambitious deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy authorities in 2006 extended an initial deadline to take control of oilfields operated by private and foreign oil companies, which operated the fields for three months as negotiations continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil has always been expected to take the toughest line with Venezuela, according to industry analysts, who have cast doubts over whether PDVSA has the technical capacity to run the complex operations valued at an estimated $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon is preparing to hand over operations by May 1, in line with Chavez's instruction that after May 1 Exxon is not the operator of Cerro Negro," said an industry source, who asked not to be named because he was not allowed to speak for the record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another industry source described an internal memo signed by the president of Exxon's Venezuela division saying the company was preparing a transition before May to give state oil company PDVSA control of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cerro Negro is a joint venture between BP Plc (BP.L), PDVSA and Exxon Mobil, which operates the project through a subsidiary. Exxon did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four Orinoco projects provide nearly a quarter of all oil production in Venezuela, according to the United States -- which relies on the South American nation for about 11 percent of oil imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez, a Cuba ally and Washington foe, in January ordered the government to accelerate the takeover of the projects amid a broad nationalization push that led to quick takeovers last month in the telecom and electricity sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGHER NEGOTIATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts say Venezuela faces much tougher negotiations for the Orinoco projects, which turn low-quality tar-like oil into about 600,000 barrels per day of valuable synthetic crude that can be processed by traditional refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other companies involved in the projects, which include Conoco Phillips (COP.N), Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), France's Total (TOTF.PA) and Norway's Statoil (STL.OL), have expressed doubts that they will be able to meet the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have had no meaningful discussions with the Venezuelan leadership," said Conoco Phillips CEO James Mulva on Thursday in conversations with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez has used oil revenues to finance a massive social development program for the nation's poor majority that helped him win a landslide reelection victory last December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But critics say the heavy spending has cut into much-needed investments in the oil sector and insist the takeover of the Orinoco projects could damage the complex operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(With additional reporting by Brian Ellsworth and Saul Hudson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The arrival of a fresh face at the 
helm of Univision may help improve relations between the U.S. 
broadcaster and Mexican partner Televisa after years of 
fighting over royalty rights and management direction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Univision Communications Inc. named advertising industry 
veteran Joe Uva as chief executive on Tuesday, ahead of a 
private equity buyout of the U.S. Spanish-language company next 
month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uva's appointment "opens an opportunity for the 
relationship to start afresh," Jose Cancela, principal at 
consulting firm Hispanic USA in Miami, told Reuters on 
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Relations between Univision and Grupo Televisa have 
deteriorated in recent years amid legal battles over 
Univision's management, content rights and royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2000, Televisa committed to provide Univision with its 
top entertainment and sports shows for a 17-year period. While 
the Mexican company receives royalty payments, last year they 
accounted for less than 5 percent of total sales of 37.932 
billion pesos ($3.5 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's programming has given Univision a competitive 
edge against NBC's Telemundo, but its share of the pie is 
rather small and the company has not been shy about its 
intention to boost its presence among U.S. Hispanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Televisa gives an out-of-proportion value to what it gets 
from the Univision deal," Cancela said. "Univision without 
Televisa is Telemundo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Univision has about 80 percent of the U.S. Spanish-language 
market, and Telemundo most of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Televisa source told Reuters on Tuesday that the Mexican 
company hoped Uva could strengthen links between the two 
broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uva's proven credentials in the advertising world are 
expected to pull in more advertising dollars for Univision 
thanks to the high television ratings it delivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In some key time slots, Univision has notched stronger 
viewership than media giants like ABC, CBS, NBC or Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uva "has got great relationships with the advertising 
community and that's what still going to be needed for 
long-term growth for Univision," said analyst David Joyce with 
Miller Tabak + Co. LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uva, who will take his new post in April, was OMD 
Worldwide's president and CEO. He is also a former president of 
Time Warner Inc.'s Turner Entertainment Group Sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like his predecessor, Jerrold Perenchio, Uva is not a 
Spanish speaker, media reports said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But he speaks the most important language that Univision 
lacks: the access to advertisers who are not currently spending 
in the Hispanic market," Cancela added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uva's appointment is the latest step in a year-long 
shake-up at Univision, which included a bidding war between 
Televisa and other private equity investors, Perenchio's 
announced departure, and the arrival of new owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In September, Televisa threw in the towel in a bidding war 
for Univision after it refused to sweeten a $12.3 billion offer 
from a rival group of equity firms and media mogul Haim Saban. 
The acquisition is to be completed in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After its defeat, Televisa said it was selling its 11 
percent stake in Univision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa local shares were off 13 pesos at 61.03 pesos on 
Wednesday afternoon, while its New York-traded stock rose 11 
cents to $27.34. Univision shares rose 6 cents to $35.96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1 = 11.1635 pesos)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Nielsen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (adds details, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, March 1 (Reuters) - The European Commission warned Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Thursday it faced further fines in its antitrust case for seeking unreasonable prices from software makers for interoperability information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The latest formal charges could lead to new fines against the U.S. software giant, the Commission said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Commission found in 2004 that Microsoft violated European Union antitrust rules by failing to give information to other makers of small-business servers needed to compete with Microsoft's own products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has said it would be charging for interoperability information because it was based on its own innovative work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     "The Commission's current view is that there is no significant innovation in these protocols," European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I am therefore again obliged to take formal measures to ensure that Microsoft complies with its obligations," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has four weeks to reply to the charges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Commission rejected 1,500 pages of information provided by Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It said it is still reviewing whether information submitted earlier to help software makers develop programmes that run smoothly with Microsoft's Windows operating system is complete and accurate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has appealed the original 2004 decision to a European court which is due to decide on the case this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by David Lawsky; editing by William Schomberg; Reuters messaging david.lawsky.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail david.lawsky@reuters.com; +322-287-6811.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, March 1 (Reuters) - Novell Inc. NOVL.O Chief
Financial Officer Dana Russell said that Microsoft Corp. issued
more than $73 million worth of certificates for his company's
Linux software during the fiscal first-quarter.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Novell will book that revenue over one to three years,
depending on the term of each certificate, he said in an
interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft sells Novell's Linux software to its customers in
the form of certificates that they can exchange for Novell
products under the terms of a partnership that was signed late
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Novell's fiscal first quarter, which ended Jan. 31,
revenue from those Microsoft certificates accounted for "a very
small amount" of the sales that Novell booked, Russell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the full year, he said he is "confident" that the
certificates will account for more than $20 million in
revenue.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia plans to start new checks on the 
Exxon Mobil-led Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project at the end of 
March, an environmental watchdog official said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Oleg Mitvol, deputy head of the Russian environmental 
agency RosPrirodNadzor, said the examination of the scheme on 
the Pacific island of Sakhalin would focus on how Exxon and its 
partners fulfill their environmental obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We plan to start the first part of the checks -- the 
paperwork -- on March 28. About a month after that, probably in 
May, the second part -- the checks on the ground -- is to 
begin," Mitvol said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previous inspections, conducted last year by Russia's 
technical standards agency, RosTekhNadzor, delayed full scale 
exports from the project by several months after it said Exxon 
needed to do more work at its Pacific export terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mitvol led inspections of Royal Dutch/Shell's neighboring 
Sakhalin-2 oil and gas scheme last year, and analysts said his 
actions helped persuade the group to sell a controlling stake 
to Gazprom for $7.45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pressure quickly subsided after the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom's Sakhalin-2 deal was one of the latest examples of 
the Kremlin's desire to regain control over all big projects in 
top industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts say a similar outcome is unlikely at 
Sakhalin-1, where the project also includes powerful 
state-controlled Russian company Rosneft as a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's Sakhalin and BP's venture TNK-BP remain the last 
large foreign-led energy projects in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mitvol also said his agency would start another inspection 
of French company Total's Kharyaga oil project in Russia's 
Arctic on March 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Previous checks, conducted last year, discovered some 
problems in fulfilling the licensing agreement, so we will 
check whether they have been settled," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission turned up the pressure on Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Thursday, warning the U.S. software giant of new fines and accusing it of serial defiance of an antitrust ruling made nearly three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Commission said Microsoft has set unreasonably high prices that discourages would-be competitors from making server software, while Microsoft continues to grab market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the 50 years of European antitrust policy, it's the first time we've been confronted with a company that has failed to comply with an antitrust decision," the Commission's competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd said the continuing dispute, almost three years after the Commission found Microsoft abused the dominant market position of its ubiquitous Windows operating system, was solely due to the company's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to look at their attitude faced with other antitrust authorities in other jurisdictions. This is a company that apparently does not like to have to conform with antitrust decisions," Todd told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said the fines and troubles it faced in Europe were unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been complying with antitrust rulings on five continents for 15 years and yet we are not experiencing these kinds of issues or this type of process anywhere else," he told reporters in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has four weeks to reply to the charges and is entitled to a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PATENT PROTECTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2004, the Commission imposed a record 497 million euro ($657 million) fine on Microsoft and ordered it to change its business practices, ruling the company failed to give information to other makers of small-business servers needed to compete with Microsoft's own products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it would charge for interoperability information because it was based on its own innovative work and protected by patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Commission said on Thursday competitors give away such software whether or not it is patented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission's current view is that there is no significant innovation in these protocols," European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am therefore again obliged to take formal measures to ensure that Microsoft complies with its obligations," she said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the Commission was trying "to regulate the pricing of our intellectual property on a global basis and not just within the EU".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said a study showed its prices were 30 percent below the market rate. The assertion in a 1,500-page submission was rejected by the Commission as unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Microsoft rival has bought the interoperability data because it is too expensive, the Commission's Todd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft's market share of small-business server software has grown to 75 percent while it defies the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd said additional daily fines for overpricing the protocols could be backdated to December 16, 2005. Microsoft could face additional fines of hundreds of millions of euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would be in addition to the 280.5 million euros the company was fined last July for failing to give clear instructions on how to use the protocols, and the 2004 fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said it is still reviewing the latest versions of the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has appealed against the original 2004 decision to a European court which is due to decide on the case this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Commission spokeswoman was asked by reporters if the Commission would still work with Microsoft in innovation given its failure to respect EU rules. "I think different aspects you mentioned are not affected by today's decision," she replied.&lt;/p&gt;

"GE is off to a strong start for the year. We are confident in our ability to meet our EPS guidance of $0.43-0.45 for the quarter, up 8-13%, and $2.18-2.23 for the year, up 10-12%." Note consensus EPS for Q1 is $0.44;consensus EPS for2007 EPS is $2.22.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, March 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) was
restarting Hydrocracker No. 1 as it wraps up a two-week
overhaul on the unit at its 563,000 barrel per day (bpd)
refinery in Baytown, Texas, according to a notice filed with

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;WARSAW, March 1 (Reuters) - Polish natural gas monopoly
PGNiG PGNI.WA said on Thursday it would buy a 15 percent stake
in three exploration licenses from ExxonMobil (XOM.N) to gain
access to natural gas off Norway's coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PGNiG's will pay $360 million for the stake, giving the
Polish company partial access to around 35.8 billion square
metres of natural gas deposits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poland's conservative government hailed the deal as the
first step towards reducing Poland's dependence on Russian
supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is good news that we will gain access to gas deposits
and it is also good news from the point of view of diversifying
supplies," Poland's Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski told a
news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PGNiG plans to begin extracting natural gas and crude oil
from the Skarv and Snadd fields in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's share of investment costs will be around $600
million, PGNiG said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British Petroleum (BP.L) is the direct operator of the
fields and other partners include Shell (RDSa.L), Statoil
(STL.OL) and Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PGNiG imports more than half of Poland's 13 billion cubic
metres in annual gas consumption, most of it from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has long sought to diversify supplies, increasing
production from domestic deposits, and it is investing in a
liquefied natural gas terminal on the Baltic coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PGNiG, 85 percent government owned, controls all of Poland's
gas imports and another state monopoly, Gas System, handles gas
distribution.

&lt;p&gt;ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss Re RUKN.VX said General Electric (GE.N) would divest its stake worth around 3.5 billion Swiss francs ($2.9 billion), selling half to Swiss Re and placing the other half in the market.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Swiss Re had waived a lock-up period on the shares, which General Electric had received as part of the payment for its reinsurance units, which it sold for $7.4 billion to the Swiss reinsurer last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this transaction completes ... Swiss Re's stand-alone performance could be evaluated by the market, without any uncertainty about ... a large share placement," finance chief George Quinn told journalists in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A banking syndicate of Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and UBS (UBSN.VX) separately announced the accelerated bookbuilding for the placement to institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bookbuilding was a precondition for Swiss Re's share re-purchase. Swiss Re's repurchase of the shares from GE was part of a wider share buyback program of up to 6 billion francs, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds interview with CEO, background)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; By Louise Heavens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Cazenove, the UK
investment banking joint venture, said on Thursday it expected a
good performance in 2007 after posting a 31 percent jump in
revenues for 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier the bank said total revenues rose 31 percent in 2006
to 446.7 million pounds ($875 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cazenove [CAZ.UL], the UK firm which set up a joint venture
with U.S. investment bank JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), reported
operating profit of 87.4 million pounds from its 50 percent
share of the venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Robert Pickering said activity in the
investment banking sector had been boosted by a combination of a
wave of liquidity from institutions, hedge funds and private
equity, the merger and acquisition ambitions of management teams
and a boom in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While global markets were shaken earlier this week after
Chinese shares dived on regulatory concerns, the outlook
remained positive, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People's view of risk is very subjective and it's largely a
matter of sentiment and as we've seen in the past couple of days
that can shift dramatically," said Pickering in a telephone
interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "2006 conditions were about as good as they get for
investment banking, but 2007 looks being a pretty good year as
well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results come two years on from when Cazenove, one of the
most venerable stockbroking names in the City of London's
financial arena, gave up more than 180 years of independence to
link up with the U.S. investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Responding to a report in The Business magazine that the
joint venture would review the five-year arrangement, Pickering
said: "The option is exercisable in 2010. Anything else is
speculation. We're anticipating carrying on as we are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Cazenove acts as corporate broker to more UK
clients than any other firm, with 35 of the FTSE 100 listed
companies as clients and 80 of the FTSE 250 index of midrange
companies.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds further details on case, Pfizer reaction) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Ben Hirschler &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - Drug wholesalers failed on Friday to block a controversial arrangement making Alliance Boots Plc AB.L the exclusive distributor of medicines from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's biggest drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The high court in London dismissed their application for an injunction to stop the deal coming effect on March 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Lawyers for the wholesalers had argued that implementation of the deal -- which gives UniChem, the wholesaling division of Alliance Boots, the right to supply 15,000 pharmacies, hospitals and dispensing doctors in Britain --- should be put on hold pending a full hearing of their challenge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The British Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers (BAPW) said the arrangement would stifle competition and undermine the country's flexible round-the-clock drug ordering and delivery service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Although Pfizer was entitled to reach the deal it did with UniChem, it should continue to supply other distributors as well, the BAPW said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer says it needs the new system to stamp out counterfeiting, following three cases of bogus versions of its top-selling cholesterol fighter Lipitor turning up in the British distribution chain since mid-2005. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Refusing to grant the wholesalers a temporary block on the new arrangement, Justice David Richards said: "My decision is that I refuse your application for an injunction." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The judge said that he would give his reasons on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    U.S.-based Pfizer, whose drugs account for more than 10 percent of those marketed in Britain, said it was delighted by the decision and the scheme would go live as planned on March 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The company is confident that its new distribution arrangement is in full compliance with all applicable EU and UK laws, and that it will secure the supply chain," a spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Britain's consumer watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading, has also been looking into the Pfizer deal but was not able to reach a decision on whether to open a formal inquiry before the scheme came into effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Critics believe Pfizer's real aim is to fight parallel trade, the legal practice in Europe whereby medicines are imported for resale into places like Britain from countries in southern Europe, where prices are lower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The success of its new arrangement with Alliance Boots is expected to be monitored closely by other big drugmakers, some of which are considering similar exclusive deals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by David Cowell; email: ben.hirschler@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: ben.hirschler.reuters.com@reuters.net; +44 20 7542 5082))   Keywords: PFIZER BRITAIN/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge dismissed Alcatel-Lucent's ALU.PA(ALU.N) patent claim against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) over technology that converts speech into text, the two companies said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ruling made late Thursday comes one week after a jury found that the world's largest software maker infringed on audio patents held by Alcatel-Lucent and ordered the company to pay $1.52 billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Rudi Brewster in San Diego dismissed all of Alcatel-Lucent's claims in a summary judgment, meaning that the jury trial set to begin on March 19 will not take place. Alcatel-Lucent said it plans to appeal the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've made strong arguments supporting our view," said Alcatel-Lucent spokeswoman Joan Campion. "We're comfortable with our chances of success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent are locked in a number of patent disputes including a suit over the video-coding technology in Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This ruling reaffirms our confidence that once there's judicial review of these complex patent cases, these Alcatel-Lucent claims ultimately won't stand up," said Tom Burt, Microsoft's deputy general counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week's $1.52 billion award for Alcatel-Lucent was the largest ever in a U.S. patent case. The award is expected to fuel a push by computer and software makers to overhaul the U.S. patent system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it plans to ask a judge to knock down the award and will appeal if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts throughout, adds details)


 March 2 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. (NDAQ.O) to "neutral" from
"overweight," after the largest U.S. electronic stock market
cut its transaction fees.


 "If Nasdaq's pricing reductions don't help it recover lost
market share, then Nasdaq, with lowered pricing and
profitability, will have little to show for it," the brokerage
said.


 J.P. Morgan also lowered its estimates on Nasdaq to $1.41
from $1.45 for 2007 and to $1.72 from $1.85 for 2008.


 Though it continues to see Nasdaq as attractively valued,
price competition lowers its conviction on its estimates, the
brokerage said.


 The brokerage expects the price reduction to have
unattractive implications for Nasdaq.


 Nasdaq's NYSE trading business may be vulnerable to firms
like BATs and Direct Edge that are now launching listed trading
capabilities, and slowly starting to gain some market share,
J.P. Morgan added.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa's 
Cablevision cable TV unit has pushed back to July plans to 
offer viewers fixed line telephone service, which would 
challenge telecom market heavyweight Telmex, an unnamed source 
at the company said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Cablevision had previously said its new service, which will 
give many of its 500,000 clients in Mexico City an alternative 
to Telmex for the first time, would be launched in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cablevision plans to roll out the service gradually, the 
source, who was not authorized to be quoted by the press, said 
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The network won't be up from one day to another," the 
Televisa source told Reuters. "Cablevision's services always 
grow by stages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not give a reason for the delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa and Telmex, which dominates almost all of Mexico's 
fixed-line and long-distance telecom industry, are scrambling 
to launch bundles of telephone, television and Internet service 
across their lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Telmex owns 18 million Mexico's 21 million fixed telephone 
lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government hopes technology allowing telephone, cable 
and Internet operators to offer services traditionally provided 
by rivals over a single connection, will improve competition in 
Mexico, leading to lower prices and better service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Telmex also is developing expanded services and has already 
launched a handful of video channels, although it is still 
awaiting government permission to offer services comparable to 
cable or satellite television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than half of Mexico's 103 million people lack access 
to basic phone services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Upstart telecom Alestra, a partnership between conglomerate 
Alfa and ATT, offers its services in affluent markets and has 
about 750,000 fixed lines across the country, including parts 
of Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (With additional reporting by Tomas Sarmiento)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with analyst comment, new bond quote)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; By Dena Aubin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service has
raised its ratings on Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and
Washington Mutual Inc. as part of a sweeping review to include
the role government support would play in averting defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The upgrades are among dozens announced by Moody's late on
Friday under a new method being applied to more than 1,000
banks in 90 countries over the next five to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new method drew criticism from some analysts, who said
Moody's ratings will no longer be a true gauge of credit
quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N) was raised by one notch to
"Aa2," the third-highest rating, from "Aa3," while Bank of
America Corp. (BAC.N) was raised one notch to "Aa1," the
second-highest rating, from "Aa2."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan's strong deposit shares, extensive derivatives
operations and role as a major government securities clearer
make government support virtually certain, Moody's said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Due to the importance of these operations to the U.S.
financial system, the potential disruption to the financial
markets from any failure or default by such an institution
would be massive," Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan Bank's ratings were raised to a top "Aaa" level
from "Aa2."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPREADS NOT AFFECTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America's upgrade was based on its stand-alone financial strength, though the likelihood of government
support is also very high because of its No. 1 deposit market
position, Moody's said. Its bank's ratings were raised to a top
"Aaa" level from "Aa1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spreads on JP Morgan's 5.125 percent notes due in 2014
widened by 7 basis points on Monday to 76 basis points over
Treasuries, according to MarketAxess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Theoretically they should tighten in, but considering
what's going on in the markets, it's made it more difficult for
that to happen," said Scott MacDonald, director of research at
Aladdin Capital in Stamford Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's also a lot of skepticism about Moody's' decision
to do what they did," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corporate bond spreads have been widening out overall since
last week after a plunge in Chinese shares touched off selling
in global equities markets worldwide. Corporate bonds opened
weaker again on Monday after European credit markets weakened
with another sell-off in Asian stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts questioned Moody's new ratings approach last
month after it upgraded a swathe of European banks, lifting a
number to triple-A, including Iceland's three major banks.
Those upgrades came just days after rating agency Standard 
Poor's warned Iceland's banks could face a test as the domestic
economy slows and global credit conditions deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's upgrades are a result of its decision to more fully
incorporate "joint default analysis" into its bank ratings to
give them credit for external support from governments, parent
companies or other parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANALYSTS PAN CHANGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fixed-income research service CreditSights said it is
dropping Moody's ratings from its bank research because they
are no longer useful as a gauge of credit worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Moody's has discovered when banks run into difficulties,
most of them are bailed out, usually by the government,"
CreditSights analysts Simon Adamson and John Raymond wrote in a
report on Sunday. "We don't need a rating to tell us that most
banks are too big to fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's has "bank financial strength ratings" that gauge
stand-alone credit quality without support, but market players
will not spend time poring over various ratings to figure out
where a bank's bonds should trade, CreditSights said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think we're doing a service by bifurcating the
components," Moody's regional credit officer Rosemarie Conforte
said in an interview. Though it might take a little more work
to read two rating inputs, "we think the transparency is much
improved by this methodology because you can see exactly how
you get to a credit rating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among other changes, Moody's raised Washington Mutual Inc.
(WM.N) one notch to "A2," the sixth-highest rating, from "A3."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bank of New York was raised by two notches to "Aaa"
from "Aa2." The bank is a major government clearer and has a 95
percent probability of government support, Moody's said. The
senior ratings at the holding company, the Bank of New York Co.
Inc. (BK.N) were unchanged at "Aa3," Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's raised Wachovia Corp.'s WB.N Wachovia Bank NA to
"Aa1," the second-highest rating, from "Aa2," saying its strong
deposit market share gives it a 70 percent chance of government
support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State Street Corp.'s (STT.N) State Street Bank was also
raised to "Aa1" from "Aa2" because its dominance in mutual fund
servicing gives it a 70 percent probability of government
support, Moody's said.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds Exxon, Total comments)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; By Brian Ellsworth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, March 5 (Reuters) - Venezuela advanced its plan to take over
multibillion dollar projects in its Orinoco oil reserve, taking steps on
Monday to nationalize the investments with two of the major oil companies
involved, Exxon Mobil and Total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in a sign of its hard-line negotiating, Energy Minister Rafael
Ramirez warned the companies that Venezuela, the No. 4 crude exporter to
the United States, would compensate them for seizing a majority stake in
their projects in oil -- not cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Hugo Chavez, who is on a nationalization drive this year
after a landslide reelection, has decreed that the foreign oil companies
running four crude upgrading projects in the Orinoco must hand their
operations to the state by May 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has not been clear how the companies would comply with the order,
but, on Monday, Exxon (XOM.N), the world's largest company, said it had
agreed to hand over its operations in the Orinoco by the OPEC nation's
deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And French giant Total (TOTF.PA) said it held talks with Ramirez over
its stake in another project in the Orinoco, which is one of the world's
largest heavy oil reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previously companies had said there had been no serious negotiations
with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In Total, we have made a commitment to the minister in the sense that
we are going to act in good faith to carry on our work in (the Orinoco) in
the future," Total's Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said at
a ceremony in Caracas to sign a deal over compensation for a previously
seized field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Undoubtedly, for Total and the rest of the partners, the Orinoco
represents a high priority," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For years, Chavez, who declares himself an enemy of capitalism, has
squeezed foreign oil investments with nationalization moves and taken over
some assets in other industries, but the major oil companies' Orinoco
investments are the largest he has taken on since coming to power in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With an estimated value of more than $30 billion, the four Orinoco
projects have a production capacity of around 600,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other companies whose investments are targeted for takeover in the
reserve include Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), Conoco Phillips (COP.N), Norway's
Statoil (STL.OL) and Britain's BP Plc (BP.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While they have to cede operations by May 1, they also have several
more months to negotiate final terms of any deal over their ownership
stakes in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Ramirez repeated a threat that if the companies do not reach
an agreement over the terms of the projects, the state will take control.

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, March 5 (Reuters) - Two oil majors took the first clear steps
on Monday to reach an agreement with the leftist government of Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez over his plan to nationalize multi-billion dollar
projects in the Orinoco belt.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, the world's largest company, has agreed to cede its
operations in the Orinoco project it runs by May 1 in compliance with a
presidential decree, Venezuela's energy minister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He later said Venezuela would compensate the oil majors in crude,
instead of cash, in the nationalization of their multibillion dollar
holdings in projects in the Orinoco reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The chief executive officer of French giant Total (TOTF.PA) also said
he held "frank and open" talks on Monday in Caracas with the minister,
Rafael Ramirez, over Venezuela's plan to take a majority stake in the
Orinoco project it is involved in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since a December landslide re-election, Chavez has been on a
nationalization drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After buying controlling stakes in utility companies in recent weeks,
he has now begun to take concrete steps to fulfill his pledge to take over
the much larger foreign investments in the Orinoco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon (XOM.N) was due later on Monday to attend a ceremony marking the
company's decision to create a "transition committee" that would work to
hand over its operations of the Cerro Negro heavy crude upgrading project
in the Orinoco by May 1, Ramirez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies involved in the Orinoco, which also include Chevron (CVX.N),
ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Statoil (STL.OL) and BP (BP.L), have to cede
operations by May 1 although they have several more months to negotiate
final terms of any deal over their ownership stakes in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry sources told Reuters last week Exxon had agreed to hand its
operations over by the May 1 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramirez said if companies do not reach an agreement over the terms of
the projects in four months, then the state will simply take over their
control.

Dutch manufacturing business for around $900 million, including
the remaining 31 percent of the 400,000 barrel a day Nerefco

Chevron's stake in Netherlands Refining Co (Nerefco) as well as
its 31 percent stake in the jointly-owned wind farm located at

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - Cost inflation in the energy
industry that has forced delays to new oil projects will help
support forward oil prices despite a sell-off in global equity
markets, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; "While equity markets plunged last week with SP 500 selling
off 3.5 percent on Tuesday, the energy markets were remarkably
unaffected," the U.S. investment bank said in its latest weekly
energy note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The equity market slide continued on Monday, with European
shares, for example, down nearly two percent on Monday after
sharp falls in Asian markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices for nearby delivery have fallen back in response
to the equity market downturn. U.S. crude prices were down more
than $1 at $60.63 a barrel on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite this retreat, nearby oil prices are still near their
highest in two months and above a 20 month low in mid-January of
just under $50 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long-dated oil prices, in particular, have proved especially
resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This resilience has been rooted in the strong support from
the ongoing cost inflation in the energy industy, which
continues to raise the cost of bringing energy on-stream and
sustains higher oil prices," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said longer-dated prices for U.S. crude oil
continued to climb above $67 a barrel last week despite the
turmoil in world stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But despite this resilience, forward oil prices are, in
fact, not high enough to encourage sufficient investment in the
energy sector to bring new production onstream, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A levelling off in forward prices, plus the cost inflation
has put pressure on the balance sheets of oil companies making
it tough for firms to foot the bill for new production projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cost overruns and new field start-up delays continue to hit
the news," Goldman said. "As well as the perception that
expanding capacity and reserves via upstream MA, as opposed to
field investments, is increasingly the most appealing option for
oil companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said higher oil prices were needed to accommodate
these rising costs and support production expansion that has so
far been lacklustre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Expensive alternative energy sources and technologies such
as fuel ethanol, oil sands...will increasingly be needed to
relieve demand pressure on oil supply, lending further support
to long-dated oil prices."

&lt;p&gt;Co announces the signing of an agreement to sell its Netherlands manufacturing business and other assets to BP (BP). These businesses comprise interests in several joint-venture companies operating in the Rotterdam area, including a 31% interest in the Netherlands Refining co's 400,000 barrel-per-day Nerefco Refinery, a 22.8% interest in a crude oil storage facility, various associated proprietary pipelines and a 31% interest in the 22.5 megawatt wind farm located onsite at the refinery. BP currently owns the remaining 69% interest in the Nerefco Refinery and the adjoining wind farm, but holds no interests in the other operations. The sale, which is valued at about $900 mln plus working capital and hydrocarbon inventory, is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2007, subject to regulatory approval.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - After 2-   years of slashing
costs and plowing money into key businesses, J.P. Morgan Chase
 Co.'s (JPM.N) top executive, James Dimon, must convince
investors at a meeting on Tuesday that those efforts can pump
up revenue growth and profitability in everything from retail
branches to bond trading, according to a report in The Wall
Street Jounral.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Investors are also likely to question him on the
possibility of acquisitions, an issue Dimon addressed at the
end of January, the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon is well aware of the longstanding criticism that the
bank hasn't shown consistent internal growth. The pressure to
do so comes amid tougher conditions this year in the banking
industry, where profits are likely to be hurt by weakening
credit quality, fierce competition for deposits and loans and a
difficult interest-rate environment, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon and the top bosses of the bank's key businesses on
Tuesday are expected to provide some fresh details about how
they plan to fatten the bank's bottom line, the Journal said.
They might fine-tune some targets for the bank's operations but
aren't expected to disclose any big new strategies for the
bank, the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will be J.P. Morgan's first daylong meeting with
investors since Dimon, who was named chief executive officer of
J.P. Morgan last year, also became chairman after the recent
retirement of William Harrison.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) is set to launch a blistering attack on rival Google Inc. (GOOG.O) on Tuesday for what the software giant argues is the Web search leader's "cavalier" approach to copyright protection.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In prepared remarks to be delivered to the Association of American Publishers, Microsoft Associate General Counsel Thomas Rubin argues that Google's move into new media markets has come at the expense of publishers of books, videos and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft attorney's comments echo arguments at the heart of a 16-month-old copyright lawsuit against Google brought by five major book publishers and organized by the Association of American Publishers, an industry trade group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Companies that create no content of their own, and make money solely on the backs of other people's content, are raking in billions through advertising revenue and IPOs," says Rubin, who oversees copyright and trade secret law at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google takes the position that everything may be freely copied unless the copyright owner notifies Google and tells it to stop," said Rubin, noting that Microsoft takes the position of seeking the copyright owner's consent before they copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition is heating up this year between Google, the world's dominant provider of Web search services, and software giant Microsoft, which recently entered the Web search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Google has recently expanded into the business software market with a set of Web-based subscription services it sees as a major revenue generator which could chip away at Microsoft's 15-year dominance of computer software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubin invokes criticism that Google has faced since its acquisition late last year of YouTube, which has come under fire from several major media companies for allowing widespread copyright infringement of professionally produced video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In essence, Google is saying to you and to other copyright owners: 'Trust us - you're protected. We'll keep the digital copies secure, we'll only show snippets, we won't harm you, we'll promote you,'" Rubin argues in his speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But Google's track record of protecting copyrights in other parts of its business is weak at best," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Drummond, Google's senior vice president for corporate development and its chief legal officer, said in response that Google works with more than 10,000 publishing partners to make books searchable online and has recently added the BBC and NBA basketball league as YouTube video partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do this by complying with international copyright laws, and the result has been more exposure and in many cases more revenue for authors, publishers and producers of content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubin cites anecdotal media reports that a handful of Google sales people were caught encouraging advertisers to capitalize on the demand for pirated software on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubin sides with publishers in criticizing Google's ambitious plan to scan millions of published works in the world's great libraries and make them available to consumers via its Google Book Search system. He said by scanning copies of published works without first seeking copyright holders' permission, Google opens the door to massive infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorney also says Google's defense of 'fair use' is overly broad. "Concocting a novel "fair use" theory, Google bestowed upon itself the unilateral right to make entire copies of copyrighted books," Rubin argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drummond replied: "The goal of search engines, and of products like Google Book Search and YouTube, is to help users find information from content producers of every size."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publishers' lawsuit against Google, filed in October 2005 in the U.S. District for the Southern District of New York, remains in the discovery process with no trial date set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move bears parallels to an attack five years ago by the Redmond, Washington-based company on so-called "open source" software, which has emerged over the past decade as the biggest alternative to Microsoft's Windows software franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft argued then that open source software jeopardized property rights and threatened to undermine the software industry as it argued in favor of "shared source" software that reinforced intellectual property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) Chairman Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that regional bank consolidation in the United States presents such a big opportunity for an acquisition that he feels no pressure to rush into any deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Dimon, who runs the third-largest U.S. bank, said his executive team is "acquisition capable" and no longer preoccupied with digesting past acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Dimon made his remarks at JPMorgan's investor day in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Some Wall Street analysts expect JPMorgan to buy a large regional bank to expand the company's retail branch footprint in the U.S. South or West, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Dimon didn't say anything to discourage that thinking. As he has said previously, Dimon expects further consolidation among regional banks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The opportunity looks so large," Dimon said, that he didn't feel any pressure "to do anything." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For now, Dimon and his team say they are happy to improve productivity and efficiency while generating internal growth in businesses that include investment banking, mortgage lending, credit cards and asset management. He said JPMorgan's franchise in these areas would be hard to duplicate today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Tim McLaughlin, editing by Gary Hill, Reuters messaging: tim.mclaughlin.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6033)) Keywords: JPMORGAN ACQUISITIONS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N)
said on Tuesday it shrank its corporate footprint by 4 million
square feet last year as the third-largest U.S. bank sold real
estate and consolidated office space.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said its corporate real estate fell to 67.4
million square feet from 71.4 million square feet at the end of
2005, JPMorgan executive Frank Bisignano said at a conference
for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the net reduction was the equivalent of getting rid
of JPMorgan's Manhattan tower at 270 Park Avenue four times
over. The tower remains a crown jewel among JPMorgan's real
estate holdings, but the company has moved thousands of workers
out of Manhattan to other sites in New Jersey and Brooklyn, for
example, Bisignano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a work in progress forever," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In mid-Manhattan, JPMorgan owns 3.3 million square feet of
office space, down from 4.6 million in 2005, Bisignano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, JPMorgan shed 7 million square feet of space,
but added back 3 million square feet, investing in new retail
branches and data centers while acquiring square footage in its
acquisition of branches from the Bank of New York.

&lt;p&gt;DOHA, March 6 (Reuters) - SasolChevron remains interested in
projects to boost capacity at a gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant in
Qatar and to build another, even though costs are rising as the
company awaits the government's go-ahead for new gas schemes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; "It's still the plan," said Patrick Butcher, Qatar country
manager for SasolChevron, a joint venture between South Africa's
Sasol (SOLJ.J) and U.S. company Chevron Corp. (CVX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The costs are going up. We can't help that," he said on the
sidelines of an energy conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butcher said the costs for SasolChevron to boost capacity at
the Oryx GTL plant, from 34,000 barrels per day to around
100,000 bpd by 2009, would now be much higher than the initial
estimate of around $1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to give a new estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GTL plants produce clean-burning fuels such as diesel,
demand for which is rising as governments tighten emissions
regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SasolChevron also still has plans to build a second, larger
GTL plant with capacity of 130,000 bpd. That plant had an
initial price tag of $4.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The schemes are two out of four GTL plants that are on hold
after Qatar declared a moratorium on new projects from its
massive North Field gas reservoir in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Qatar does not expect to complete a study of the North
Field, the world's largest reservoir of pure gas not associated
with oil, until 2009. Only then will it decide whether to give
the go-ahead for any more liquefied natural gas (LNG) or GTL
projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORATORIUM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the projects remain on the drawing board, potential
costs have spiralled due to rapid inflation in the global oil
and gas industry as the sector strains to bring online new
projects to meet rapidly rising energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, rising costs forced ExxonMobil (XOM.N) to drop
its plans -- which were not subject to the moratorium -- to
build the world's largest GTL plant in Qatar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is forging ahead with its Qatar
Pearl GTL plant, despite costs rocketing to as much as $18
billion. The initial cost of the project was $5 billion in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our projects depend on the results of the moratorium," said
Butcher. "But it's a great opportunity for us here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Exxon dropped its project, some questioned the
viability of GTL technology. Butcher said that he had confidence
in it and the technology had not achieved industry-wide
recognition simply because so few plants exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SasolChevron would build more GTL plants elsewhere, even if
the Qatar plants were scrubbed, he said. It has another scheme
under way for a 34,000 bpd plant in Nigeria. Algeria, Australia
and Russia were other potential targets for GTL plants, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One country will be advantaged by our growing experience in
GTL," he said. "I hope it is here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $1 billion Oryx plant is currently starting up. It will
take 9-12 months to reach full production, the plant's technical
manager Lowrens Jacobs said in a presentation on Tuesday at the
same energy event. The plant expects to make its first shipment
of diesel by the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sasol has a 49 percent stake in the Oryx plant, while
state-owned Qatar Petroleum owns the remaining 51 percent.

&lt;p&gt;March 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Station

Gaming International Corp. PGIC.O to "sell" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, however, upgraded Bally Technologies Inc.

Station Casino was based on the likelihood that it will be
bought by privately held Fertitta Colony Partners LLC within
the next six to nine months. It has a price target of $90 on
the casino operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The brokerage lowered its price target on Progressive
Gaming International Corp. to $7 from $9. It said key risks for
the supplier of branded slot machines are that too much of its
growth is dependent on new, unproven products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Bally Technologies, the brokerage said it was removing
it from the Americas investment sell list following the slot
machine maker's strong showing in its 2007 slot survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman added that it was raising its price target on the
company to $22 from $19, based on the brokerage's higher 2008
estimates.

&lt;p&gt; The U.S.-based bank is initially seeking roughly 10 deals

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) is set to launch a blistering attack on rival Google Inc. (GOOG.O) on Tuesday for what the software giant argues is the Web search leader's "cavalier" approach to copyright protection.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In prepared remarks to be delivered to the Association of American Publishers, Microsoft Associate General Counsel Thomas Rubin argues that Google's move into new media markets has come at the expense of publishers of books, videos and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft attorney's comments echo arguments at the heart of a 16-month-old copyright lawsuit against Google brought by five major book publishers and organized by the Association of American Publishers, an industry trade group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Companies that create no content of their own, and make money solely on the backs of other people's content, are raking in billions through advertising revenue and IPOs," says Rubin, who oversees copyright and trade secret law at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google takes the position that everything may be freely copied unless the copyright owner notifies Google and tells it to stop," said Rubin, noting that Microsoft takes the position of seeking the copyright owner's consent before they copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition is heating up this year between Google, the world's dominant provider of Web search services, and software giant Microsoft, which recently entered the Web search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Google has recently expanded into the business software market with a set of Web-based subscription services it sees as a major revenue generator which could chip away at Microsoft's 15-year dominance of computer software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubin invokes criticism that Google has faced since its acquisition late last year of YouTube, which has come under fire from several major media companies for allowing widespread copyright infringement of professionally produced video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In essence, Google is saying to you and to other copyright owners: 'Trust us - you're protected. We'll keep the digital copies secure, we'll only show snippets, we won't harm you, we'll promote you,'" Rubin argues in his speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But Google's track record of protecting copyrights in other parts of its business is weak at best," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Drummond, Google's senior vice president for corporate development and its chief legal officer, said in response that Google works with more than 10,000 publishing partners to make books searchable online and has recently added the BBC and NBA basketball league as YouTube video partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do this by complying with international copyright laws, and the result has been more exposure and in many cases more revenue for authors, publishers and producers of content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubin cites anecdotal media reports that a handful of Google sales people were caught encouraging advertisers to capitalize on the demand for pirated software on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubin sides with publishers in criticizing Google's ambitious plan to scan millions of published works in the world's great libraries and make them available to consumers via its Google Book Search system. He said by scanning copies of published works without first seeking copyright holders' permission, Google opens the door to massive infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorney also says Google's defense of 'fair use' is overly broad. "Concocting a novel "fair use" theory, Google bestowed upon itself the unilateral right to make entire copies of copyrighted books," Rubin argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drummond replied: "The goal of search engines, and of products like Google Book Search and YouTube, is to help users find information from content producers of every size."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publishers' lawsuit against Google, filed in October 2005 in the U.S. District for the Southern District of New York, remains in the discovery process with no trial date set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move bears parallels to an attack five years ago by the Redmond, Washington-based company on so-called "open source" software, which has emerged over the past decade as the biggest alternative to Microsoft's Windows software franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft argued then that open source software jeopardized property rights and threatened to undermine the software industry as it argued in favor of "shared source" software that reinforced intellectual property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa's 
Cablevision cable TV unit has pushed back to July plans to 
offer viewers fixed line telephone service, which would 
challenge telecom market heavyweight Telmex, an unnamed source 
at the company said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Cablevision had previously said its new service, which will 
give many of its 500,000 clients in Mexico City an alternative 
to Telmex for the first time, would be launched in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cablevision plans to roll out the service gradually, the 
source, who was not authorized to be quoted by the press, said 
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The network won't be up from one day to another," the 
Televisa source told Reuters. "Cablevision's services always 
grow by stages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not give a reason for the delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa and Telmex, which dominates almost all of Mexico's 
fixed-line and long-distance telecom industry, are scrambling 
to launch bundles of telephone, television and Internet service 
across their lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Telmex owns 18 million Mexico's 21 million fixed telephone 
lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government hopes technology allowing telephone, cable 
and Internet operators to offer services traditionally provided 
by rivals over a single connection, will improve competition in 
Mexico, leading to lower prices and better service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Telmex also is developing expanded services and has already 
launched a handful of video channels, although it is still 
awaiting government permission to offer services comparable to 
cable or satellite television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than half of Mexico's 103 million people lack access 
to basic phone services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Upstart telecom Alestra, a partnership between conglomerate 
Alfa and ATT, offers its services in affluent markets and has 
about 750,000 fixed lines across the country, including parts 
of Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (With additional reporting by Tomas Sarmiento)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds regional perspective, market impact)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; By Yaw Yan Chong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, March 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N)
will shut the larger of its two refining facilities in
Singapore for a 45-day regular maintenance from mid-June,
refining sources said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 309,000 barrels per day (bpd) plant on mainland
Singapore will be shut until second-half July, with its crude
distillation units (CDUs) as well as other secondary facilities
taken down in stages, the sources added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With this shutdown, the total regional capacity lost during
June-July is about 8 percent less than in the year-ago period,
which could pressure refining margins that turned positive in
January after being in the red for about three months amid a
weak middle distillates market, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is Exxon Mobil's second big one in two years. After
this, there shouldn't be any major ones, other than routine
jobs on secondary units, for a while," a refining source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When contacted, a spokesman for the U.S. oil major declined
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last March, the Exxon Mobil shut down its other plant, the
296,000-bpd facility on Jurong Island off the west coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is not known if Singapore's two other refineries --
Shell's 458,000-bpd complex and Singapore Refining Co.'s
285,000-bpd plant -- will be taken down this year as both
underwent major turnarounds last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IMPACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil's turnaround comes at the end of the
second-quarter Asian maintenance season, which sees several
regional refineries, including in South Korea, Japan and the
Middle East, undergoing routine maintenance during the
June-July period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The total regional capacity that will be lost during
June-July is about 938,000 bpd with the Exxon Mobil shutdown,
compared to about 1.02 million bpd in the same period last
year.
 In addition, Saudi Aramco will shut its 550,000-bpd Ras Tanura
refinery from late-April till June.
 The capacity loss during the April-June turnaround season in
the Asia-Pacific region this year, excluding the Exxon Mobil
shutdown, will be 1.076 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is 5 percent less than for the same period in 2006,
when many regional plants were forced to shut for maintenance
after being optimised to meet increased demand a year earlier
in the wake of the devastating hurricanes that hit the U.S.
Gulf Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There will be some impact on the market but it won't be a
big, rapid change in demand-supply patterns," a Singapore-based
Western fuel oil trader said. "For example, I would expect
differentials to show a steady state, subject to other
short-term market forces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simple margins for Asia were at $2.17 a barrel on Tuesday,
Reuters data show, down from a recent peak of $3.30 on Jan. 12,
and rebounding from a brief dip into the red about a week ago.
 Differentials for the benchmark 0.5 percent sulphur gas oil
grade have stayed below a premium of 50 cents a barrel to
Singapore spot quotes since last July, mostly in discount, due
to poor demand following a warmer-than-usual winter in North
Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Exxon Mobil shutdown could also increase fuel oil
volumes, supporting the market at a time when supplies are
seasonally low due to the peak summer demand season in the
Middle East, which typically sees exports from that region
reduced by half, traders said.

A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payne's departure takes place at a time when Microsoft continues to struggle against Google in Internet search even though the company has tried to overhaul its search site with a new look and features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google captured 47.5 percent of the online search market share in January with 3.3 billion queries compared to 10.6 percent for Microsoft with 733 million queries, according to data from research firm comScore Networks Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's share in January was a slight improvement from 10.5 percent in December, but a decline from 11 percent in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payne, who rejoined Microsoft in 2001 after a three-year stint at Amazon.com (AMZN.O), played a key role in persuading the company to develop its own search engine instead of relying on Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Amazon, Payne spent 8 years at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's late start in search put the company at a disadvantage to Google and Yahoo. Those companies made billions selling advertising tied to search results while Microsoft scrambled to build a business of its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payne would become the second executive from Microsoft's Internet arm in the last week planning to leave the company . Blake Irving, a Microsoft vice president who oversees the company's AdCenter system that sells ads next to search results, plans to retire, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates said on Wednesday he feels "deep anxiety" about the state of U.S. competitiveness and called for education, immigration and research funding reforms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"When I reflect on the state of American competitiveness today, my immediate feeling is not only one of pride, but also of deep anxiety. Too often we as a society are sacrificing the long-term good of our country in the interest of short-term gain," Gates told a Senate committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said government needs to invest more money in education and training, especially in high school math and science, as well as in job training programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our high schools are no longer a path to opportunity and success, but a barrier to both," Gates told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, chaired by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While most students enter high school wanting to succeed, too many end up bored, unchallenged and disengaged from the high school curriculum -- 'digital natives' caught up in an industrial-age learning model," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates urged higher state math curriculum standards, more support for teachers, and reauthorization of the federal "No Child Left Behind" legislation, which uses testing to measure student progress and holds schools accountable for standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommended that the nation set a goal of doubling the number of science, technology and math graduates by 2015, and to recruit 10,000 new science and math teachers annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates urged Congress to find ways to keep foreign students here and to expedite the path to permanent resident status for highly skilled workers to help retain talent, instead of forcing employers to send development work offshore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it "makes no sense" that foreign students who apply for a U.S. student visa must prove that they do not intend to remain in the country once they receive their degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we are going to invest in educating foreign students ... why drive them away just when this investment starts to pay off for the American economy?" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see the negative effects of these policies every day at Microsoft," Gates said, referring to the giant software company he founded. Scientists and engineers from India and China routinely wait more than five years to obtain a U.S. green card, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America's ability to remain a technological powerhouse will depend in large part on federal government investment in basic research, Gates said. He urged increased funding for basic science research and permanent extension of the RD tax credit, which expires at the end of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As federal research priorities expand into new areas, we should seek to increase funding for basic research by 10 percent annually over the next seven years," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Congress should consider other "innovative" ideas, such as new research grants for outstanding early-career researchers, as well as ensuring research projects are communicated to the private sector so companies can collaborate more effectively with recipients of public research funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) is
not planning any new investment in Venezuela, Chief Executive
Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Venezuela is attempting to strip majority control of
multibillion-dollar heavy oil projects in the country's Orinoco
region from some of the world's biggest oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the conditions down there at this time and the
uncertainty around how our current holdings are going to be
dealt with, we are not contemplating any new investment in
Venezuela," Tillerson said, speaking at a meeting with analysts
in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil said on Monday it was in talks with the
Venezuelan government over President Hugo Chavez's plan for
state oil company PDVSA to take at least a 60 percent stake in
the multibillion-dollar Cerro Negro heavy oil project. Exxon
Mobin said it is negotiating on issues including value,
compensation and contract sanctity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil is a 41.7 percent partner in Cerro Negro and
operates the project through a subsidiary. BP Plc (BP.L) is a
16.6 percent investor in the project, and PDVSA owns the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil has already agreed to transfer operatorship to
PDVSA by May 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson said the company has already pulled some workers
out of Venezuela, calling it a "fairly normal transition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Russia, Exxon's huge Sakhalin-1 project is being closely
watched after Gazprom (GAZP.MM) took the majority stake in
Sakhalin-2, the Sakhalin Island project led by Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSa.L). Many analysts believe the takeover amounts
to a renationalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson said he has no anxiety about an upcoming
environmental inspection of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said the company looks forward to "finding
something else to do in Russia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Exxon Mobil has "no changes planned on an imminent
basis" on the leverage of the company.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stock rose on on
Wednesday, boosted by a rise in shares of Exxon Mobil Corp.

was flat amid concerns about economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 47.26

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to early afternoon)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were flat on
Wednesday as concerns about economic growth and a diminished
appetite for risk kept investors cautious, but higher crude oil
prices lifted shares of energy companies such as Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors scoured the market for beaten-down shares after
the past week's sell-off. The February jobs report from the
Labor Department, due on Friday, may shed light on the
economy's health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were also lingering concerns about rising loan
defaults in the mortgage market for borrowers with sketchy
credit profiles, with shares of Accredited Home Lenders Holding
Co. LEND.O down 4.7 percent on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Boeing Co. (BA.N) were the Dow's biggest
advancer, up 1.4 percent, at $89.01 on the New York Stock
Exchange, but their climb was countered by a 1.5 percent drop
in shares of No. 4 U.S. credit card issuer American Express Co.
(AXP.N), to $55.53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil shares rose 1.5 percent to $72.07 on the NYSE
as crude for April delivery jumped 1.7 percent, or $1.02, to
$61.70 after a government report showed a surprise drawdown in
U.S. crude supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federal Reserve President Michael Moskow said on Wednesday
the risk of high inflation was greater than the risk of lower
U.S. economic growth, meaning more interest rate increases
could still be needed. For more details, see [ID:nNAT002498]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 9.85 points,

&lt;p&gt;The company said its current project inventory is expected to produce 24 billion oil-equivalent barrels over the life of the projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Senior Vice President Stuart McGill said the company plans to start production at seven new projects in 2007 that will add about 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to the company's base volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The projects the company plans to bring on line this year include four projects in Europe, two projects in Angola, and a liquefied natural gas (LNG) unit at its RasGas project in Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It plans to startup 18 additional projects over the course of 2008 and 2009, including the company's Thunder Horse joint venture with BP Plc (BP.L), several projects in Qatar and West Africa, and three LNG terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it has more than 30 other major projects it plans to start up in 2010 or later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive, also said he expects the company's capital spending to be around $20 billion a year through 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I expect very active levels of investment beyond the end of the decade," Tillerson, speaking at the company's analyst meeting in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the Irving, Texas-based company were up 30 cents at $71.30 in late morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Euan Rocha and Michele Gershberg)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. sees the shift by business organizations to Web-based phone systems running on its software to generate "billions" of dollars in revenue for the company, a top executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The move to Web-based phone systems will gain momentum during the next three years and Microsoft's new server software will transform the telecommunication systems industry the way its Windows operating system changed the computer industry, said Jeff Raikes, president of Microsoft's business division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're going to see history repeat itself," said Raikes in an interview ahead of a keynote speech at VoiceCon Spring 2007, an industry conference for Web-based telephony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's strategy in addressing the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) business market differs from that of Cisco Systems Inc. which is selling fully-integrated systems incorporating its network equipment with its own software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand Microsoft aims to create a distributed business model like the PC industry with its software at the center. Last year Microsoft and Nortel agreed on a broad alliance to address the VoIP market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software segment of a transformation to VoIP will grow to a $35 billion to $40 billion market, according to Raikes, and Microsoft plans to get a piece of the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, it will mean billions," said Raikes, who is one of the company's three division presidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of businesses are adopting VoIP technology in some form, mainly to save costs. Yankee Group's Zeus Kerravala estimates that around 82 percent of U.S. companies use VoIP somewhere in their network, although only 8 percent have fully incorporated the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, Cisco, Microsoft and Avaya Inc. are basically the main three companies in enterprise VoIP," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high cost of implementation deters many companies from making a full switch to VoIP systems, but Raikes said the cost of a Web-based phone system will come down by 50 percent within three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sees its Office business software suite at the center of a new unified communications push that aims to simplify communications for workers bogged down with e-mail, instant messaging, Web and wireless telephony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office suite, which includes Outlook e-mail, Word documents and Excel spreadsheets, is already one of the world's most widely used software applications. It incorporated a "presence" feature within Office 2007 to allow workers to see the availability of another worker for a call or message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any time a worker's name shows up on a document or e-mail, there is a icon that allows people to initiate a phone call with one click. This feature, according to Raikes, will save time and improve business processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft predicts over 100 million business users -- twice the size of the current VoIP business user market -- will have the ability to make VoIP phone calls through Office within three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it plans to start public testing of its Office Communications, or its unified communications, server and accompanying desktop software later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) Chairman Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that regional bank consolidation in the United States presents such a big opportunity for an acquisition that he feels no pressure to rush into any deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Dimon, who runs the third-largest U.S. bank, said his executive team is "acquisition capable" and no longer preoccupied with digesting past acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Dimon made his remarks at JPMorgan's investor day in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Some Wall Street analysts expect JPMorgan to buy a large regional bank to expand the company's retail branch footprint in the U.S. South or West, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Dimon didn't say anything to discourage that thinking. As he has said previously, Dimon expects further consolidation among regional banks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The opportunity looks so large," Dimon said, that he didn't feel any pressure "to do anything." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For now, Dimon and his team say they are happy to improve productivity and efficiency while generating internal growth in businesses that include investment banking, mortgage lending, credit cards and asset management. He said JPMorgan's franchise in these areas would be hard to duplicate today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Tim McLaughlin, editing by Gary Hill, Reuters messaging: tim.mclaughlin.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6033)) Keywords: JPMORGAN ACQUISITIONS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

Some are ready to be incorporated into existing products, while others are years away from finding the right application to utilize the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The map-search technology required Microsoft to get millions of street-level pictures of Seattle's buildings and landmarks. Those pictures were added to a database and indexed by distinguishing features that can be cross referenced to pictures sent in by users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly sophisticated mobile phones are becoming a popular device to search for maps, directions and other local information and Microsoft said the service is a logical next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you are using a mobile phone, then inputting text can sometimes be difficult. So we decided to make the camera the input," said Xing Xie, a Microsoft researcher who was demonstrating the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service is still being tested at Microsoft and releasing the product on a wide scale could prove challenging since the company would need databases full of pictures of buildings in every city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other interesting demonstrations included a new Web security application that prevents automated computers from exploiting Internet sites with a quiz to distinguish whether the animal in a picture is a cat or a dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would replace current verification systems that require users to look at an image of garbled text and type out a word or a series of numbers and letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft researcher John Doucher said it is easy for humans to decipher a cat from a dog, but computers running image-reading software often have trouble. This application is ready for use and available for Web developers at asirra.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also showed off a new type of answering machine. Instead of a conventional machine that displays the number of messages, Microsoft's "Bubble board" displays the messages in floating bubbles on a touch-screen monitor with the caller's picture inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike current answering machines that play messages in chronological order, the Bubble board allows the user to choose whose message to hear first by touching the caller's message bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp.
(XOM.N) has transferred its minority stake in a planned
multibillion dollar liquefied natural gas plant in Angola to
state-run Sonangol, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Exxon has granted Sonangol its 13.6 percent stake in
Angola's LNG plant at Soyo, which is expected to cost as much as
$5 billion to construct.
"Due to recent commercial developments the company has
elected to assign its interest to affiliates of Sonangol EP,"
the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil will continue to pursue development
opportunities in Angola that will increase shareholder value and
support the country's growth objectives," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the transaction, Sonangol's stake is equal to that of
Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) 36.4 percent share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other shareholders include Total (TOTF.PA) and BP (BP.L),
each with 13.6 percent.

&lt;p&gt;Co announces that the FDS has approved Lipitor Tablets to reduce the risk of nonfatal heart attacks, fatal and non-fatal strokes, certain types of heart surgery, hospitalization for heart failure, and chest pain in patients with heart disease. Lipitor is the first cholesterol-lowering medication to receive FDA approval for the reduction of the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. This new approval expands the use of Lipitor to patients at high risk for cardiovascular events because of established heart disease such as prior heart attack, prior heart surgery, or chest pain with evidence of clogged arteries. Previously, Lipitor was approved to reduce cardiovascular events in patients without heart disease. The approval is based on results from the landmark TNT trial and supported by findings from the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering trial. The five-year TNT study involved 10,000 patients with both heart disease and elevated LDL levels.

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Shareholders of the Walt Disney Co. 
(DIS.N) resoundingly reelected the 11-member board but did not 
pass a "poison pill" proposal on Thursday at the entertainment 
company's annual meeting in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Investors also voted down a shareholder proposal to 
strengthen precautions against unsolicited takeover threats, or 
so-called "greenmail." The company has adopted some of the 
measures on its own over the past three years, according to 
Disney board Chairman John Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A shareholder proposal that would require the board to 
adopt a "poison pill" to foil hostile takeovers received yes 
votes from a majority of those who voted but just 43 percent of 
the shares outstanding -- short of the two-thirds it needed to 
pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The board had recommended that shareholders reject the plan 
as lacking in flexibility, but Pepper said directors would give 
"prompt and serious consideration to the matter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposal would have required the board and shareholders 
to ratify the adoption of a poison pill every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has not had a poison pill, also known as a 
stockholders rights plan, since 1999 and was not considering 
adopting such a plan, the company's proxy statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on Thursday, Disney investors approved an amended 
version of the company's 2005 stock incentive plan, which 
increases the number of shares that can be issued by 31 million 
to 58 million. They also reauthorized a 2002 executive 
performance plan, which needs approval every five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An estimated 400 shareholders attended the meeting at the 
Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger chose the location, 
saying he wanted to show the company's support for the city as 
it recovers from the damage suffered in Hurricane Katrina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Thursday U.S. oil giants ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) have agreed to cede by May 1 operations of multibillion-dollar projects in the Orinoco heavy crude belt.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In compliance with a decree issued last month by President Hugo Chavez, the companies will form transition committees to oversee the handover of their projects' operations to state oil company PDVSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) has already agreed to pass control of its operations to PDVSA by the tight May Day deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez, who is pressing a raft of nationalizations since a December landslide re-election, wants the state to take at least 60 percent of the projects that develop tarry crude in the OPEC nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he set the May deadline for PDVSA to take the operational helm, he is allowing the foreign investors until almost September to finalize the terms of their stakeholding in the projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDVSA director Eulogio del Pino said in a company statement the committees were being formed "so that the nationalization of these businesses should be finalized by May 1 and that the operations should be transferred from the foreign firms to the Venezuelan state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four Orinoco projects, valued at more than $30 billion, turn tar-like oil into around 600,000 barrels per day of lighter synthetic crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Chavez, who declares himself an enemy of capitalism, has squeezed foreign oil investments with nationalization moves and taken over some assets in other industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the major oil companies' Orinoco investments are the largest he has taken on since coming to power in 1999. The pace of the takeovers and the absence of open opposition from the companies have surprised political and economic analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been no word on whether the Sincor heavy crude project, involving France's Total (TOTF.PA) and Norway's Statoil ASA (STL.OL), will transfer to PDVSA control in the Orinoco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Total's chief executive said this week his company regards the Orinoco as a priority and promised to work "shoulder to shoulder" with Venezuela over its investments in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Del Pino also said Conoco agreed to set up a transition body for the May 1 handover of operations in a natural gas field, Corocoro, which is covered by last month's decree too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, March 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is set
to open a bank in Brazil next week to trade local securities
and capture a piece of the booming market for equity
underwriting, a source close to the bank said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Goldman Co-President Gary Cohn will come to Sao Paulo for
the opening, the firm's biggest move in Brazil since talks
broke down to buy local investment bank Pactual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohn will be joined by Jim O'Neill, the Goldman economist
who coined the term BRIC to describe the importance of Brazil,
Russia, India and China in the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Goldman in New York declined to comment on
two reports in the Brazilian press on Thursday that said the
expansion would be announced next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman opened its first office in Brazil in 1995, focusing
on merger and acquisitions advisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm has led the MA ranks the past years, but with a
Brazilian banking unit Goldman can venture into the lucrative
market for trading local securities. Trading of fixed income,
currencies and commodities make up most of Goldman's revenue
globally and generate most of its profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The opening of Goldman's bank follows a record year of
share offerings in Brazil in 2006, when companies sold 31.2
billion reais ($14.8 billion) worth of stock. Stock sales have
broken record volumes yearly since 2004, when they totaled 9.15
billion reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far in 2007, nine companies have sold 7.13 billion reais
worth of stock, putting share sales on pace to rise 35 percent
from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman held talks for more than a year to buy a stake in
Brazilian firm Pactual, but Swiss firm UBS AG (UBSN.VX) snapped
up Pactual in May 2006 for about $2.5 billion.
  ($1 = 2.108 reais)

&lt;p&gt;March 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said the U.S. real estate
investment trust (REIT) industry is suffering from a "temporary
hangover" flowing a influx of short-term capital, adding
investors should take a defensive stance in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; The brokerage downgraded the apartment sector to
"underweight" and raised strip centers to "market weight", in
line with its recommendation that investors focus on sectors
with longer average lease terms and low rollover over the next
few years, such as retail and office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman raised ratings on retail REITs Kimco Realty Corp.
(KIM.N) and Taubman Centers Inc. (TCO.N) to "buy" from
"neutral" to reflect its more optimistic near-term view on the
sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It downgraded apartment REITs Archstone-Smith Trust
(ASN.N)
 to "neutral" from "buy" and Equity Residential (EQR.N) to
"sell" from "neutral", reflecting its more cautious stance on
the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said the fundamental drivers of REIT share prices
remain in place but with the U.S. economy slowing, REITs with
shorter average lease terms will be the first to experience
deteriorations in cash flow growth.

&lt;p&gt;The projects will add about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD) to its base volumes when they reach their peak, Exxon Mobil said. The company was producing about 4.2 million BOEPD at the end of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the company's projected oil and gas production capacity toward the end of the decade is lower than last year's estimate due to delayed projects, divestments and changes to production sharing agreements at some of its projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, speaking at the company's analyst meeting in New York, said he expects company capital spending to be at around the $20 billion level a year through 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I expect very active levels of investment beyond the end of the decade," Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil's capital spending in 2006 was about $19.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon posted the largest corporate profit in U.S. history in 2006 thanks to record high crude oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil industry's costs also have climbed, as high oil prices have fueled demand for drilling rigs, steel and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said the company has seen a 9 to 10 percent increase in drilling costs over the past year or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rig rates are not likely to abate until some of the new rigs that are being built come out of the yard," which should happen over the next two or three years, he said, speaking to reporters after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costs seem "to maybe have reached a plateau. We're not going to see the same year over year increase," Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil prices rose nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, pushing up energy stocks. Exxon's shares rose nearly 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $71.64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEVEN NEW PROJECTS IN 2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Senior Vice President Stuart McGill said the company plans to start production at seven new projects in 2007 that will add about 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to the company's base volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The projects the company plans to bring on line this year include four projects in Europe, two projects in Angola, and a liquefied natural gas (LNG) unit at its RasGas project in Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It plans to start up 18 additional projects over the course of 2008 and 2009, including the company's Thunder Horse joint venture with BP Plc (BP.L) in the Gulf of Mexico, several projects in Qatar and West Africa, and three LNG terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it has more than 30 other major projects it plans to start up in 2010 or later. It said its current project inventory is expected to produce 24 billion oil-equivalent barrels over the life of the projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said it expects its production capacity to rise to less than 5 million BOEPD in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the company had projected its 2010 production capacity would be close to 5 million BOEPD. Several of the companies projects have since been delayed, including Thunder Horse and the huge Kashagan oil field in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Euan Rocha and Michele Gershberg)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;March 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Securities upgraded the
European investment banks sector to "neutral" from
"underweight," saying the sector's exposure to the US sub-prime
mortgage problem is limited, among other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said French banks offers attractive valuation
as they are least exposed to the sub-prime mortgage meltdown on
the brokerage's estimates, and are resilient to a capital
markets slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  J.P. Morgan raised BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) to "overweight"
from "neutral," saying the stock looks highly resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also upgraded Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) to
"neutral" from "underweight" due to low mortgage originator
lending facility exposure, a constructive credit market and an
attractive valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan said it continued to prefer French
Wholesale/Investment banks to traditional investment banks as
the former has a better risk-reward.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, March 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Leighton
Holdings Ltd. (LEI.AX) and Singapore Power are among parties
shortlisted to bid for Australian energy infrastructure group
Alinta AAN.AX, sources familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Alinta, which is looking to flush out rival offers to a
management buyout proposal, expects to call for final bids by
the end of March but no dates have been set, sources told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Alinta hopes to have something happening by the end of the
month," one of the sources said, adding Alinta did not want to
be tied down to a particular date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least three groups -- Australian investment bank Babcock
 Brown Ltd. BNB.AX in partnership with Singapore Power, U.S.
investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Australian engineering
contractor Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI.AX) -- were conducting
due diligence, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd's (1038.HK) Spark
Infrastructure (SKI.AX), which has said it may be interested in
some Alinta assets, was not involved, one source said. A Spark
spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number of proposals from other parties were rejected by
Alinta's advisers because they "did not stack up", one of the
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perth-based Alinta put itself up for sale in January after
receiving a controversial buyout proposal from its top five
executives. It said last month it had received expressions of
interest from several partie,s but no firm bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alinta shares rose on Monday following a Bloomberg report
which said the Babcock-Singapore Power team planned to bid A$9
billion ($7 billion) for Alinta. Babcock later said the report
was unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources said Thursday a bid at $9 billion Singapore dollars
($5.9 billion), or about A$15.20 per share, was more credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Babcock and Singapore Power were still conducting
due diligence and there were no figures on the table, another
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The buyout proposal, which saw former adviser Macquarie
Bank Ltd. MBL.AX also advising the management buyout group,
became mired in controversy due to potential conflicts of
interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alinta sacked Macquarie as its adviser in February and laid
down conditions for the bank's continued role in advising the
buyout group. Macquarie agreed to the terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company bought infrastructure assets from energy
retailer AGL Energy Ltd. AGL.AX last year. It operates a
network of gas pipelines and gas-fired power stations and gas
transmission pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan and Carnegie Wylie are advising Alinta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alinta shares were trading 0.7 percent firmer at A$14.57 a
share by 0352 GMT in a slightly easier overall market.

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - For Walt Disney Co. chief Robert 
Iger, the decision to hold the entertainment giant's annual 
shareholder meeting in New Orleans on Thursday 18 months after 
Hurricane Katrina was as much personal as professional.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Among the thousands who lost homes when the devastating 
storm struck the historic Gulf Coast city on August 29, 2005,

toured storm-damaged areas shortly after arriving on Wednesday 
and viewed rebuilding efforts, including those of his

said the California-based company's decision to stage the 
annual meeting in New Orleans "was not only a professional

which caused massive flooding and killed about 1,300 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We thought it would be a great signal to send that New 
Orleans is important, that we believe in New Orleans and in a 
way it was our means of not only expressing some appreciation 
but of giving back," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company announced at its annual meeting that its new

Quarter of New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger said it was "pretty devastating" seeing the lingering 
damage from Katrina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You can't appreciate the level of devastation until you 
see it up close, and I was almost shocked at that," Iger said. 
"It's also disturbing to see entire city blocks, blocks of 
houses that are completely empty or in some areas, people 
living in FEMA trailers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On the other hand, you see new houses, new trees, fresh 
flowers cropped up and signs of life in a lot of places that a 
year ago you never could have expected that to happen."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) Chairman and Chief Executive E. Neville Isdell received $7 million in salary and performance-based pay in 2006, nearly 17 percent more than he was paid a year earlier, the world's largest soft drink company said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Isdell's salary was unchanged at $1.5 million but his $5.5 million in incentive compensation for 2006 was $1 million higher than 2005, according to Coke's proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including awards of stock, options, pension value, deferred compensation and all other benefits, Isdell's total 2006 compensation under new SEC disclosure requirements was $32.3 million, compared to an estimated $26.1 million in 2005, if the new rules had been in effect at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isdell, 63, was named to Coca-Cola's top job in June 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He received $12.1 million worth of stock awards and $7.3 million worth option awards in 2006, after receiving $7.3 million in stock awards and $10.8 million in option awards in 2005, Coke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the larger total compensation figure stems from the amount Coke accrued for Isdell's pension, which the company had not previously disclosed. Coke said it accrued nearly $5.4 million for the pension in 2006, up from $1.4 million in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isdell's compensation actually received for 2006, excluding items such as stock awards which have not been paid out yet, was $7.5 million. Under the old rules, Isdell's 2005 compensation was about $6.5 million, Coke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compensation committee kept Isdell's base salary unchanged after deciding that it was at a competitive level and that any adjustments to his 2006 compensation should focus on long-term responsibilities, the company said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke said Isdell's incentive award was based on the company's strong performance during 2006, including results at the top end of its long-term volume and profit goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's unit case volume and net income each rose 4 percent in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlanta-based Coke said it plans to hold its annual meeting on April 18 in Wilmington, Delaware. At the meeting, shareholders will vote on whether to reelect the company's 11 board members, approve a performance incentive plan and vote on five shareholder proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board recommended that shareholders vote against all five of the shareholder proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Coke, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, rose 43 cents to $47.58 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola trades at about 16.8 times expected 2008 earnings, compared with a multiple of 17.2 for rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP.N), according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, closing share prices) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. court has ruled that Dell Inc. DELL.O personal-organizer products did not infringe a patent held by Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA(ALU.N), according to a court document filed online on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The court also ruled in the summary judgment that Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) would not be liable for indirect infringement of the patent, according to a filing at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The decision is the latest in a larger group of patent cases Alcatel-Lucent has taken against the companies. Microsoft has said it would appeal a digital music patent case after a jury told it in February to pay Alcatel-Lucent $1.52 billion.  The summary judgment filed Thursday related to Dell's Axim personal digital assistant products and an Alcatel-Lucent patent for the use of a stylus to control notebook computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Many hand held organizers and mobile phones let users navigate through menus or dial a number by tapping a stylus onto the device's screen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It is part of a group of four patent cases, related to user interface technology, scheduled to go to trial in May. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Alcatel-Lucent spokeswoman Joan Campion said the court still plans go ahead with a patent trial related to tablet computers, which use a stylus to control computer functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The court has thrown out two other patent claims tied to the case including one related to Web coding technology and is expected to rule on a fourth patent in April, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Dell representative said the company's policy was to decline comment on pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Alcatel-Lucent shares closed up 26 cents, or about 2 percent, at $12.12 on the New York Stock Exchange. Microsoft stock slid 29 cents, or more than 1 percent, to $27.32 on Nasdaq, where Dell fell 4 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $22.26. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Sinead Carew, editing by Richard Chang; Reuters  Messaging: sinead.carew.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1-646-223-  6186)) Keywords: DELL ALCATELLUCENT/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

from "neutral".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glaxo faces major challenges through 2007, including the
loss of U.S. patents for four products, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sanofi, Goldman said it expected improving pipeline
visibility at the company over 2007. It said Sanofi's
share-price correction was overdone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage added Roche (ROG.VX) and Ipsen (IPN.PA) to

&lt;p&gt;March 9 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities raised its 2007 earnings outlook on Alcoa Inc. (AA.N), the world's biggest aluminum maker, by almost 18 percent to reflect primarily the brokerage's new forecast on aluminum price. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage now expects the company to earn $3.12 a share for the year, compared with its previous view of $2.65.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, March 11 (Reuters) - Japanese insurer Millea
Holdings Inc. (8766.T) will set up a reinsurance company
jointly with JP Morgan (JPM.N), financial daily Nikkei said on
Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; The new firm, which will have start-up capital of about 10
billion yen ($84.56 million), with Millea owning a majority,
will offer reinsurance services to cover the risk faced by life
insurers offering variable annuity policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nikkei said Millea is likely to be the first Japanese
insurer to reinsure against the risk in variable annuity
contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A formal announcement on the venture is expected on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Variable annuity policyholders receive different amounts of
money at maturity depending on the performance of their
investment trusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the majority of products sold recently guarantee the
policyholders' full premium payments even if returns fall short
of the investment amount, with the insurers covering the
shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 20 domestic and foreign-owned life insurance
companies currently offer variable annuities in Japan, with the
value of contracts in force amounting to 12.45 trillion yen at
the end of September 2006, rising nearly 10 trillion yen in the
last three and a half years.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, March 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) introduced a new product on Monday that incorporates features of its mainstay Office applications in a bid to gain share in the enterprise market dominated by Oracle Corp. ORCL.O and SAP (SAPG.DE). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest software maker aims to use people's familiarity with Office applications to spread the reach of its Microsoft Dynamics business software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The new products, Microsoft Dynamics Client for Microsoft Office, are designed to drive growth at its enterprise software segment, which generated $900 million in sales in its fiscal year ended in June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The new products are targeted at workers who do not have access to information and data contained within enterprise software, Microsoft said. According to a study cited by Microsoft, about 85 percent of workers do not have direct access to enterprise software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One of the 12 new applications available in the new software is a project time and expense system, which allows workers to log the amount of time spent on a project through Outlook e-mail and calendar systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft's high-end enterprise software licenses can cost as much as $4000 per seat, but the Office versions cost $195 a seat for standard computers or $395 a seat for servers running its SharePoint collaboration software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Microsoft were up 4 cents to $27.33 in midday trade on the Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi, Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 206 652 2326; editing by Jane Baird)) Keywords: MICROSOFT OFFICE/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Toni Clarke &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, March 12 (Reuters) - Schering-Plough Corp. SGP.N is betting it can successfully develop an experimental schizophrenia drug recently cast off by Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N), but analysts are skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The drug, asenapine, was acquired by Schering-Plough as part of its $14.4 billion purchase of Organon BioSciences, and constituted an important part of the transaction, which was announced on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We think this is a very well-tolerated agent and we think it will be competitive," said Fred Hassan, Schering-Plough's chief executive, on a conference call with analysts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But industry experts are less sure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This really offers us nothing new or better than currently available treatments and it may have some less favorable qualities," said Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, chairman of psychiatry at Columbia University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last November Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, ended a collaboration with Organon, the pharmaceuticals division of Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS), after results of late-stage clinical trials of asenapine proved mixed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But Hassan said that of the five late-stage experimental compounds acquired with the acquisition of Organon, asenapine is one of the most attractive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We see this as a promising central nervous system compound and one that will allow us to become a major player in this market," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Asenapine is one of a class of drugs known as 5HT/D2 antagonists which include Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ.N) Risperdal and Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s (LLY.N) Zyprexa. They work by suppressing excess levels of the brain chemicals serotonin and dopamine, thought to be associated with some of the so-called "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The $10-billion-plus market for antipsychotic drugs is competitive and crowded but characterized by much switching between products as no drug works well for all patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Even so, analysts are not convinced asenapine will realize the promise many had once held out for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Pfizer pulling out doesn't mean the drug is hopeless, it could still do quite well, but it's not likely to be the huge blockbuster that Pfizer thought it would be," said  Nitasha Manchanda, an analyst at market research firm Decision Resources. "The trial results so far are not encouraging." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer has said it withdrew from the partnership for commercial reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Hassan said Schering-Plough has a different view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Every company makes its own judgments," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Toni Clarke; editing by Deborah Cohen; Reuters Messaging, toni.clarke.reuters.com@reuters.net, 617-367-4165)) Keywords: SCHERINGPLOUGH/ASENAPINE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, March 12 (Reuters) - EMC Corp. (EMC.N) and
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM.N) posted the
fastest revenue growth in data-storage computers in the fourth
quarter, market researcher IDC said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; EMC held the No. 1 market spot in IDC's quarterly survey of
data-storage vendors, with 22.1 percent of the $4.8 billion
market, up from 21.3 percent a year earlier. IBM had 18.6
percent of the market, up from 17.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EMC's revenue from storage grew 10 percent in the fourth
quarter. IBM's revenue grew 15.5 percent, the fastest of the
major vendors, IDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hewlett-Packard Co.'s (HPQ.N) market share slipped to 13.7
percent from 15 percent, giving it the No. 3 spot in the
ranking, and Dell Inc. DELL.O fell to 8.1 percent from 9.5
percent of the market. Dell's storage revenue fell 8.8 percent,
the most of any major vendor, according to IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall market sales were driven by demand for network
storage systems between $15,000 and $149,999, a "sweet spot"
for vendors in 2006, IDC research manager Natalya Yezhkova said
in a statement. Such systems grew at a double-digit percentage
rate and outsold the higher-priced segment during all four
quarters of last year.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is
relocating investment banker John Waldron to London from New

another signal of the sector's growing significance in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Waldron will work with Richard Campell-Breeden starting
April 1, Goldman Sachs said on Monday, to broaden the bank's
relationships with private equity firms, which are among the top
fee-generating clients for deal advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity firms, which borrow large sums of money to
help finance takeovers of publicly listed companies, have been
increasingly targeting deals in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A group of four buyout firms is contemplating a 10 billion

Boots on the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Waldron joined the bank in 2000 to work on media and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) said on Tuesday its developing oil and natural gas projects could produce about 1.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2011, but surging costs may threaten some of the ventures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company raised cost estimates for several of its huge projects and pulled previously disclosed cost projections for many others, as it evaluates those projects to see which are viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The projects that are still in the evaluation phase are clearly going to be impacted by higher costs and we have to make choices," Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly said at the company's analyst meeting in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not going to invest in projects unless we can create value from them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil industry costs have soared in recent years as booming crude oil prices have fueled demand for drilling rigs, steel and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company raised its cost projections for projects including its Athabasca oil sands project expansion in Canada, as well as projects in Indonesia and Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It declined to give projections for 11 projects expected to start production by the end of 2012. One project for which it pulled a cost forecast was the Gorgon gas field offshore Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Chevron forecast that the project would cost the company $10.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly said the company was reevaluating the Gorgon project due to the costs, but is confident that Chevron will eventually have a project there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE THAN 3 PCT PRODUCTION GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said production from its developing projects will give the company average annual output growth of at least 3 percent through 2010. It is making progress on more than 30 oil and gas development projects in which it is investing at least $1 billion each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those projects would contribute to an average proved reserves replacement rate of more than 100 percent for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron has a great slate of projects, but it is going to be very challenging to bring them all on line," said independent analyst Kurt Wulff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's total capital spending for 2007 is still expected to be $19.6 billion, with 39 percent of that in North America, 25 percent in Africa, 19 percent in Asia-Pacific, 7 percent in the Caspian region, and 10 percent in the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wulff pointed out that Chevron is spending nearly as much as its much larger rival Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), which plans to shell out about $20 billion in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors can expect more growth from Chevron," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also plans to keep exploration spending high in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending on exploration would be "at a higher level than it's been in the past," Bobby Ryan, vice president for global exploration, told analysts, although the estimated $2 billion in spending for 2007 would be less than in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its refining operations, Chevron is seeking to add flexibility to its plants to process heavier and higher-sulphur crude oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it plans to selectively divest assets, which will give it a more focused footprint with a strong presence in fewer locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron fell 99 cents, or 1.4 percent, to close at $67.84 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday as oil prices dipped about 1.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Matt Daily)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, March 13 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N)
said on Tuesday it is dropping plans for a liquefied natural
gas terminal off the Baja California coast of Mexico, near the
U.S. border.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; The oil major canceled three permits with Mexican officials
because the project no longer fits Chevron's business needs,
said Margaret Cooper, a Chevron spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The project was originally developed with the intent that
(the terminal) could receive supply from Chevron's share of LNG
from the proposed Gorgon project off Australia," Cooper said.
"But Chevron has found supply agreements for the majority of
our (share of Gorgon) with three customers in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those three customers are Chubu Electric Power Co.
(9502.T), Osaka Gas Co. (9532.T) and Tokyo Gas Co. Ltd.
(9531.T). Each signed 25-year deals in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chubu Electric's deal begins in 2010 and is for 1.5 million
tonnes per year, Osaka Gas is to get 1.5 million tonnes
annually starting in 2011, and Tokyo Gas has signed on for 1.2
million tonnes per year starting in 2010, Chevron has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The canceled $650 million, 1.4 billion-cubic-feet-per-day
terminal was to be located off the Coronado Islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LNG terminals on the West Coast face stiff environmental
opposition. The Chevron terminal would have been near the site
of six threatened or endangered species of seabirds as well as
plants that are not found elsewhere on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron will operate the Gorgon project off northwest
Australia, in which it has a 50 percent stake. Chevron said
three years ago the cost to develop the field, estimated to
have about 12.9 trillion cubic feet of gas, is $11 billion.
Chevron's partners in the project are Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N)
and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cooper said Chevron's decision was not because of competing
LNG gas terminals proposed for the U.S. West Coast, including
Sempra Energy's (SRE.N) Energia Costa Azul LNG terminal, due to
open in 2008. Sempra said last month construction of the
terminal was 65 percent complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LNG is natural gas that is cooled to extreme temperatures
and then shipped via tankers. It is vaporized back to a natural
gas state at receiving terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a meeting with financial analysts in New York on
Tuesday, Chevron Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly said it was
reevaluating the Gorgon project due to its cost, but it is
confident that Chevron will eventually have a project there.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) is in talks to buy Tellme Networks Inc., the privately owned voice recognition technology company, two sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A deal could value Tellme at more than $800 million, one of the sources said. A second source said the two sides were close to a deal, which could be announced later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, and Tellme declined comment. The talks were first reported by technology news Web site CNET News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tellme is a dot-com survivor that has built up a major presence in the U.S. directory assistance market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tellme was founded in 1999 by Mike McCue, previously vice president of technology at Netscape, according to Tellme's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tellme relies on speech recognition technology from a variety of suppliers including Nuance Communications Inc. (NUAN.O). However, Microsoft has recently been promoting its own speech recognition technology, which it sells for both computer users and customer call centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuance's shares closed down 4.5 percent to $13.39, while Microsoft fell 2.6 percent at $26.72, both on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tellme is privately owned by its employees and investors that include venture capital firms Benchmark Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, according to the investors' Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tellme's voice recognition technology allows users to gather information from the Internet over the telephone. The Mountain View, California-based company also offers services to businesses looking to automate directory assistance and other phone functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company provides automated phone services for companies, including Merrill Lynch, Cingular and Federal Express, serving over 40 million people every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sources said Tellme would be especially appealing to Microsoft in the area of wireless search, or search using a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software giant sees mobile phone searches as a relatively untapped market where it can compete more favorably with Google Inc. (GOOG.O), the dominant leader in computer-based searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the hurdles to mobile search has been how best to enter the information sought by a user. Tellme's voice recognition capabilities could be added to Microsoft's Windows Mobile operating system for cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, comment) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Joseph A. Giannone &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) posted its best quarterly earnings ever on Tuesday, trouncing expectations as record trading and banking results showed that recent mortgage woes and stock volatility had little impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Still Goldman shares were off on a day when the broader U.S. stock market was down 1 percent, as investors pulled out of riskier investments amid persistent worries that subprime mortgage woes would spread to other markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The largest investment bank by market value said net earnings rose 29 percent to a record $3.20 billion, or $6.67 a share, in the fiscal first quarter that ended Feb. 23, up from of $2.48 billion, or $5.08 a share, a year ago. Net revenue rose 22 percent to a record $12.73 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The results exceeded the average analyst forecast of $4.97 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "While upside surprises have been the norm for Goldman, we believe the magnitude was probably better than the market expected," Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    After Wall Street firms delivered a third year of record profit in 2006, analysts and bank executives cautioned that the industry faced a more uncertain environment. Those fears were fanned last month when a slump in Chinese stocks triggered a sell-off worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Meanwhile subprime lenders are going under as loan defaults rose and as financiers, including Goldman, cut off funding. New Century Financial (NEWC.PK), the largest independent subprime lender, is teetering near bankruptcy and investors worry rivals won't be far behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman shares were off $1.46, or 0.7 percent, at $201.14. Shares of Lehman Brothers Holding Corp. LEH.N, which reports its results on Wednesday, fell $2.80, or 3.7 percent to $73.75. Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which announces its earnings next week, fell 3.2 percent to $73.63 a share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SO FAR, SO GOOD &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar played down the subprime concerns, noting fears about the impact on Goldman's business so far have been overblown. Fixed income trading rose across the board during the quarter, he said, and the firm has not yet seen signs that subprime woes have spread to other debt markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Even our mortgage business was up despite the obviously more challenging subprime market," Viniar said. "Mortgage is a strategically important business to Goldman Sachs, but it's still modest in size compared with the overall firm." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts also note that the stock market swoon and the accelerating demise of subprime lenders have taken place after the close of Goldman's quarters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For the fiscal first quarter, fixed-income currency and commodity trading generated a record $4.6 billion in net revenue, with strong performance across credit, interest rate, commodity and mortgage markets. Equities trading posted revenue of $3.09 billion, up 26 percent to a record. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The strength of the results should help to calm investor concerns about the resiliency of global capital markets activity levels," said Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeff Harte, who has a "buy" rating on Goldman shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Daily value-at-risk across Goldman's trading businesses rose to $127 million from $106 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase in proprietary risk-taking and more active trading activity, Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The quarter also enjoyed a boost from principal investment gains, which surged to $1.73 billion thanks to stakes in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK), Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T) and $500 million in gains related to a new accounting policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    PIPELINES FULL &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Investment banking posted a record quarter, with revenue rising 17 percent to $1.72 billion on record M and debt underwriting fees. Goldman this year leads the industry in announced M transactions worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Viniar noted that the backlog of pending merger and underwriting business grew during the quarter to its highest level since 2000, after the peak of the 1990s bull market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One disappointment came in asset management, where revenue fell 28 percent to $1.07 billion following poor performance in Goldman's giant Global Alpha hedge fund last year. Overall managed assets grew 26 percent to a record $719 billion, though analysts noted fund flows to alternative investments slowed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Viniar didn't comment on outlook, but noted "conditions that have fueled the growth of our business in these past few years remain very much intact," citing economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates and tight credit spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Additional reporting by Christian Plumb) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Dave Zimmerman; Reuters messaging: joseph.giannone.reuters.com@reuters.net;+1 646 223 6184)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: GOLDMAN RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MADRID, March 13 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Europe's largest phone operator, has hired JPMorgan (JPM.N) to look for a buyer for its Spanish unit ya.com, sources close to the process said on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "They have sent us the sale prospectus and it seems like they're in a hurry", one of the possible interested buyers told Reuters.    Another source familiar with the proceedings told Reuters that JP Morgan had already given the sales documentation to Jazztel (JAZ.MC), Spain's number-two broadband provider, and to mobile-phone operators Orange FTE.PA and Vodafone (VOD.L). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Deutsche Telekom is considering selling the Spanish broadband provider, but has not made a decision yet and may keep the business, a spokesman said, declining to say whether the company had mandated a bank to find a buyer. JP Morgan also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The German phone company is reviewing the sale of several assets, including ya.com, which it bought for 550 million euros &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($725 million) in 2000, as Chief Executive Rene Obermann seeks to revive profitability at the former state company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Obermann had to slash the group's earnings forecasts for last year and for this year as the company lost clients to cheaper competitors in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Other assets it may sell include Internet companies in France and radio towers in Germany as well as the United States, it said March 1. Ya.com is Spain's fourth-largest broadband provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Robert Hetz, editing by Elisabeth O'Leary, editing by Quentin Bryar; Reuters Messaging: elizabeth.oleary.reuters.com@reuters.net; +34 91 585 2160;madrid.newsroom@reuters.com)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.7585 Euro)   Keywords: D.TELEKOM YA.COM/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp.'s (CVX.N)
plans for future investment in Venezuela depend on the outcome
of talks with the country's government over its stake in a
heavy oil project, Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our appetite very much depends on how we're treated in the
current negotiations," he said, speaking at the company's
analyst meeting in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Venezuela is attempting to strip majority control of
multibillion dollar heavy oil projects in the Orinoco region
from some of the world's biggest oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron owns a 30 percent stake of the Hamaca project in
Orinoco and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) owns 40 percent of the
venture. Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA holds the remaining 30
percent, but leftist President Hugo Chavez has said he plans
for the state to control at least 60 percent of the Orinoco
projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly said Chevron intends to comply with the Venezuelan
government's request to turn over operations at its Hamaca
heavy oil joint venture in the Orinoco region to state oil firm
PDVSA by a May 1 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is still a period of early negotiation going on --
we don't know how its going to turn out," O'Reilly told
reporters after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The only thing I can say is that our production is very,
very low," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron produces about 37,000 barrels per day at Hamaca, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Venezuelan government has warned that it will not pay
in cash for the takeovers. It wants to compensate the companies
with payments in oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly said it was too early to speculate whether the
company would accept oil as compensation for any changes to its
stake in the project.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) said on Tuesday its new oil and natural gas projects will produce about 1.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2011, and it will keep exploration spending high in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The production from those projects will give the company average annual output growth of at least 3 percent through 2010, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are making progress on more than 30 oil and gas development projects that represent a Chevron investment of at least $1 billion each," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave O'Reilly said in a statement issued as part of a Chevron presentation to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those projects would contribute to an average proved reserves replacement rate of more than 100 percent for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had said in February its 2007 production would drop to an average of 2.6 million barrels per day from 2.67 million in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending on exploration would be "at a higher level than it's been in the past," Bobby Ryan, vice president for global exploration, told analysts, although the expected $2 billion in planned spending for 2007 would be less than the 2006 level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total capital expenditures for 2007 are still expected to be $19.6 billion, including affiliate spending, with 39 percent of that in North America, 25 percent in Africa, 19 percent in Asia-Pacific, 7 percent in the Caspian region, and 10 percent in the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its refining operations, Chevron is seeking to add flexibility to its plants to process heavier and higher-sulphur crude oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it plans to selectively divest assets, which will give it a more focused footprint with a strong presence in fewer locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Speaking at the company's analyst meeting in New York,
Kirkland also said he expects production in the Caspian region

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) Chief Financial Officer David Viniar on Tuesday said the firm's backlog of pending merger advisory and underwriting business rose to its highest point since 2000, when the 1990s bull market peaked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The backlog of pending M, debt and equity underwriting all rose during the fiscal quarter that ended Feb. 23. Viniar, in a briefing with reporters, also said its subprime mortgage business is a relatively modest part of its overall business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    At the same time, though, he noted that subprime mortgages remains a good business and will survive the current shakeout, albeit smaller than it was before the recent downturn. Viniar said that as of right now, problems in the subprime segment have not spread to other markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Investors had sold off Goldman shares in recent weeks amid worries that a sell-off in stocks and growing loan defaults in the subprime mortgage market would crimp revenue. Instead, the investment bank reported record revenue and a 29 percent jump in profit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Joseph Giannone, editing by Gerald E.

of several snags California refineries ran into last week,

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Fossil fuels will continue to play a 
key role in global energy supply until at least 2030 and carbon 
emissions will keep rising significantly unless there is a 
worldwide effort to cut them, oil major ExxonMobil said on 
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; David Mclean, ExxonMobil's director of European 
transmission and regulation, said the job of reducing carbon 
emissions could not be done by only industrialized nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is not one where risks and potentially mitigating steps 
can be reassigned to either developed or developing countries," 
Mclean told a gas industry conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A global approach is needed that ensures wide deployment 
of emissions reducing technologies and introducing effective, 
market-based policies," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These policies, to be effective, will ensure a uniform and 
predictable cost of reducing carbon emissions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil has in the past played down the impact of 
climate change and opposed moves to impose limits on greenhouse 
gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the company recently begun talks with 20 other 
companies on ways the United States could regulate emissions, 
signaling a possible shift in its stance on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite European efforts to increase the role of renewable 
energy in supplies, there is little chance of fossil fuels 
losing their key role through to 2030, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The European energy mix will not fundamentally change," 
Mclean said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds more Exxon comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; By Christian Oliver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, March 14 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Wednesday it has not decided whether to take a stake in an
Orinoco oil project it currently operates after Venezuela takes
majority ownership in a nationalization drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has said it will comply with a Venezuelan decree to
hand over by May 1 the operation of the multibillion dollar
Cerro Negro crude upgrading project in the Orinoco reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But President Hugo Chavez has also given the U.S. company
several months to negotiate the terms of any future
participation in the project, in which Britain's BP (BP.L) is
also a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said it is in talks with the government on the
takeover including issues such as value, contract sanctity and
compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chavez, who has taken over utility companies this year, has
also started moving to nationalize four oil projects valued at
more than $30 billion in the OPEC country's vast Orinoco
reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While some companies such as France's Total (TOTF.PA) have
signaled a willingness to work with the government over the
takeover, industry analysts have singled out Exxon as the
company most likely to reject Chavez's moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon agreed to comply with Chavez's decree on its
operations, but there was some interpretation in the Venezuela
media that the company is set to stay in the project even after
Venezuela takes a majority ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon on Wednesday made clear it has made no such
decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Transfer of operations does not impact (our) decision to
migrate to a 'mixed enterprise' structure," Richard Bailey, a
spokesman for Exxon in Venezuela said in a written statement
sent in response to questions from Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the company "remains open to resolving these issues
amicably," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other companies with stakes in targeted Orinoco projects
are ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Chevron (CVX.N), and Norway's
Statoil (STL.OL).

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it will buy privately held Tellme Networks Inc., a speech technology company, to bolster its communications push and enhance searches over mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Microsoft expects to complete the purchase in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday the two companies were in talks for a deal that could value Tellme at more than $800 million, making it Microsoft's biggest acquisition since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tellme, based in Mountain View, California with 320 employees, allows people to use speech to find information on local businesses, driving directions, sports scores, stock quotes, weather and news from the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, sees mobile phone searches as a relatively untapped market where it can compete more favorably with Google Inc.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds byline, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, March 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said
on Wednesday it will buy privately held Tellme Networks Inc., a
speech technology company, to bolster its communications push
and enhance searches over mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Microsoft
expects to complete the purchase in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday
the two companies were in talks for a deal that could value
Tellme at more than $800 million, making it Microsoft's biggest
acquisition since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme, based in Mountain View, California with 320
employees, allows people to use speech to find information on
local businesses, driving directions, sports scores, stock
quotes, weather and news from the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, sees mobile
phone searches as a relatively untapped market where it can
compete more favorably with Google Inc. (GOOG.O), the dominant
leader in computer-based searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Mobile search is going to be a huge market," said
Morningstar analyst Toan Tran. "Search on mobile phones is
still up for grabs and Microsoft is a big believer in voice
being an interface for mobile phones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also aims to combine Tellme's experience in
offering voice services like automated directory services with
its large customer base as part of its push to offer Web-based
phone systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme, founded in 1999 by former Netscape executive Mike
McCue, provides automated phone services to companies including
Merrill Lynch and Federal Express and serves over 40 million
people every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's Office Communications server already allows
workers to access and make changes to calendars within the
Outlook e-mail system through voice commands or call someone
with a click of a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme's voice services could take those capabilities to
the next step and change how people interact with the
telephone, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think telephone numbers are an artifact of
technological innovation," said Jeff Raikes, president of
Microsoft's business division in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme already generates a profit, McCue said on a

investigated partnerships for a while, but talks for an
acquisition intensified around December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse analyst Jayson Maynard, who estimates that
Microsoft paid more than $1 billion for the acquisition, said
in a note to clients that the company is cash-flow positive and
has annual revenue of more than $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme is privately owned by its employees and investors
that include venture capital firms Benchmark Capital and
Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROAD AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in his 1995 book "The Road
Ahead" predicted that humans would one day talk to their
computers rather than have to type and Tellme fits with his
vision of expanding input to more natural ways than typing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also has worked on handwriting and touch
technology for tablet notebook PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme said its paid directory assistance service is
currently the most common way for people to search for
information from their mobile phones. Tellme handles about half
of directory assistance calls in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The business model for mobile search is evolving from a

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Toni Clarke &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, March 14 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK.N) are taking different approaches to drug licensing as pharmaceuticals companies race to snap up new products to bolster their pipelines of experimental drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, the world's biggest drug company, is battling to offset generic competition to some of its biggest products, and is eager to acquire new products. But it is cautious about those in early-stage, or Phase I, development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Clearly there's a higher degree of risk the earlier you go, and we often find that a compound that a small company brings into Phase 1 may not have done all the tests that we would have done," said John LaMattina, Pfizer's president of global research and development, at a Cowen &amp; Co. conference in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Merck, by contrast, has a keen interest in early products, even those which have not yet entered clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I actually think that the sweet spot for licensing is in late-stage preclinical or in Phase I before proof of concept," said Mervyn Turner, Merck's senior vice president, worldwide licensing and external research, in a separate session at the same conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's very hard to find compounds that are in Phase II, or really have clinical proof of concept, at a valuation which really works for Merck shareholders," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, which is in the midst of a corporate and cultural shake-up, says it aims to expand it presence in the vaccines business and in biologic-based drugs known as monoclonal antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In one early-stage deal, Pfizer last year paid an undisclosed sum to acquire PowderMed, based in England, to forge ahead in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Another area of interest to Pfizer is insomnia, said David Shedlarz, Pfizer's vice chairman. He said Pfizer would also be looking for new technology platforms that can underlie the development of multiple drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Even so, he said Pfizer would take a "very cautious" approach to early-stage products, though the company does not rule out any promising opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We will be looking for interesting deal structures," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Merck recently introduced Gardasil, the first vaccine against cervical cancer, and diabetes drug Januvia. Pfizer's newer products include a smoking cessation drug, Chantix, and diabetes treatment Exubera. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Merck, which restructured its operations and cut thousands of jobs after its withdrawal of painkiller Vioxx in 2004, has dramatically increased investment in early-stage products and technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It recently paid $1.1 billion for Sirna Therapeutics, a developer of technology that "silences" genes and prevents them from producing proteins linked to disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Merck, which took a beating for the Vioxx affair, are up about 35 percent since the start of 2005, while Pfizer is down 8 percent. The American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index .DRG has risen 6 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Braden Reddall; Reuters Messaging, toni.clarke.reuters.com@reuters.net +1-617-367-4165)) Keywords: PFIZER MERCK &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, quotes, changes dateline)    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) agreed to pay $2 million to settle accusations that it failed to detect customers' illegal short sales of stock in companies just before those companies completed public offerings, U.S and industry regulators said on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Securities and Exchange Commission and NYSE Regulation, which oversees trading on the New York Stock Exchange, said they both settled enforcement actions against the company's  Goldman Sachs Execution and Clearing LP unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The SEC and NYSE said the unit violated regulations that require brokers to accurately mark sales, either long or short, and to restrict stock loans on long sales. The settlement involves a series of trades between March 2000 and May 2002. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "If Goldman had instituted and maintained appropriate procedures, it could have discovered through its own records the customers' illegal activity," the SEC said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying any wrongdoing and it declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The SEC said it had previously brought a settled civil injunction action against two of Goldman's customers who it said had engaged in illegal short sales and who agreed to pay more than $1 million to settle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman Sachs Execution was originally a part of Speer, Leeds &amp; Kellogg, a trading firm acquired by Goldman in October 2000. Regulators in January 2005 enacted rules governing short sales, holding brokers responsible for ensuring trading customers properly flagged long and short sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The regulators alleged that Goldman customers carried out the illegal short-selling scheme by placing sell orders through the firm's automated trading platform, REDI System, and falsely marking them "long." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Because the customers had sold the securities short and did not have the securities at settlement date, Goldman delivered shares to brokers so that purchasers could settle the customers' purported "long" sales, the regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Direct access does not obviate a broker's own responsibilities under the commission's short sale rules, and it certainly does not allow a broker to ignore apparent discrepancies indicating illegal trading by its customers," said Linda Thomsen, the SEC's enforcement division director. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The NYSE, in its decision, also found Goldman failed to reasonably supervise its business activities in the matter. The regulators noted Goldman has already taken steps to make its systems compliant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Joe Giannone in New York) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Julie Vorman and John Poirier, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. took its fight against so-called "cybersquatters" overseas, seeking a payment of damages from five UK companies for registering Web site domain names that infringe on its trademarks and brand, Microsoft said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker filed lawsuits against U.S. cybersquatters in August in an attempt to curb the illegal registration of Web site domains containing trademark Microsoft phrases or common brand name misspellings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past six months, Microsoft said it reclaimed more than 1,100 infringing domain names set up to target Web users who type in a non-Microsoft address like "wiindowsvista.com" in search of genuine information about the company's new Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With every ad hyperlink clicked, a registrant or ad network harvests cash at the trademark owner's expense," Aaron Kornblum, a senior attorney at Microsoft, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it contacted those five UK companies through a legal representative and asked them to comply with various terms including an injunction to halt any similar activities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it reached a settlement with Dyslexic Domain Company Ltd. and received a monetary payment from the UK-based company which, according to Microsoft, has registered over 6,000 domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An attempt to contact Dyslexic Domain was unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also filed three new lawsuits in the United States and amended one suit filed in August to include the names of "John Doe" defendants, whose identities were hidden at the time. It also settled two lawsuits in Utah and California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Internet is fertile ground for domain name speculators," Jonathan Robinson, chief operating officer of NetNames, said in a statement. NetNames is a company that manages domain names for other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a number of professional organizations out there making a fortune out of registering variations and misspellings of popular brand names," Robinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said registering trademarked Microsoft names violates the 1999 Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, a U.S. law that calls for a fine of up to $100,000 for anyone who registers a domain name that is identical, similar or derived from an existing trademark with an intent to profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the law has been on the books for seven years, the growing use of pay-per-click advertising has raised the stakes for trademark and brand owners by giving illegitimate operators more avenues with which to trick consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is targeting people who register those domain names, but not the online advertising providers who act as middlemen, which include rivals Yahoo Inc. and Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's own advertising system, MSN AdCenter, only allows advertisers to place ads along its own Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds reaction from Chevron)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, March 14 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N)
rejected a comment made by a U.S. government official on
Wednesday that it was investing around $1 billion in Gazprom
Neft, the oil unit of Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron's billion-dollar scale investment in Gazprom Neft
(CVX.N) over the last few months is a positive development,"
U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary Clay Sell told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not elaborate, except to say the figure was "around a
billion" dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Chevron spokesman Michael Barrett said the investment
was not so big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In October 2006, Chevron signed a framework agreement with
OAO Gazprom Neft, establishing a Russian joint venture for
exploration and development activities focused in the
Yamal-Nenets region of Western Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron will hold a 49 percent joint-operated interest in
the venture. This is a long term venture with expenditures paced
accordingly," he said in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year Chevron and Gazprom Neft formed the
Northern Taiga NefteGaz joint venture to explore for oil in
Noyabrsk in the oil-rich Yamal-Nenets region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom has said Chevron as a 70 percent stakeholder would
make the most investment at earlier stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apart from the exploration venture, Chevron has been
repeatedly named as one of Gazprom's possible partners at
upcoming assets auctions of bankrupt oil firm YUKOS YUKO.MM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has never confirmed the reports but said it would
look at long-term investment opportunities in Russia. The firm's
Moscow's press office declined to make immediate comments on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We may well have concerns on how these assets may be sold
off, but I'm not aware of any U.S. company being interested in
these assets," Sell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron was also among five foreign companies rejected by
Gazprom last year as possible partners in developing the huge
Shtokman gas field in Russia's Arctic Barents Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom said earlier this month it had begun a new round of
talks with potential Shtokman participants, including Chevron's
rival ConocoPhillips (COP.N), but the terms would be new and the
Russian firm would not share equity stakes in Shtokman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly said on Tuesday his
company would not be interested in taking on a contractor role
at Shtokman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sell said he was aware a second effort to attract foreign
firms into Shtokman was underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Gazprom officials indicated they can provide terms that
will be attractive to international oil companies. Time will
tell," Sell said.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday said its Live online service, which has attracted 6 million Xbox 360 console gamers, will be open in May to PC gamers who use its new Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The move comes nearly a year after Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said the company's vision was for "anywhere" gaming that would link video game consoles, cell phones and computers, and is a key step toward reaching that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PC version of Live will debut on May 8 with the launch of the Windows Vista version of "Halo 2," Microsoft's popular alien shooter game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Microsoft Game Studios will release "Shadowrun," the first game where Live will support competition between players on the Xbox 360 and PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live members will need just one account, whether they play on the Xbox 360, the PC, or both machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft offers two Live subscription levels. Silver membership is free and the Gold level, which includes cross-platform play and other multiplayer features, costs about $50 per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's online gaming service has been a key selling point for its Xbox 360 video game console, which was released in November 2005 and competes with Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and other
major shareholders of Sanyo Electric could sell some of their
$2.6 billion worth of preferred stock that the loss-making
electronics maker issued last year, but are unlikely to do so,
sources close to the matter said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Instead, Sanyo 6764.T is expected to buy back some of the
preferred shares from Goldman and Daiwa Securities, which will
prompt the electronics maker to step up its asset sales, the
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hit by price competition and earthquake damage to its
microchip plant, Sanyo issued 300 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in
preferred shares to Goldman, Daiwa Securities SMBC and Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp. last year to pay for restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the total preferred shares, those with voting rights,
worth 128 billion yen, became convertible to the common stock on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The remaining 172 billion yen worth of shares without voting
rights have been convertible since last year, but the
shareholders could not sell them without Sanyo's consent. That
restriction was also lifted on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Daiwa Securities SMBC, a venture between Daiwa
Securities Group (8601.T) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
(SMFG) (8316.T), each bought 125 billion yen worth of shares,
giving them both a 24.5 percent stake in terms of voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sumitomo Mitsui, Sanyo's main bank and an SMFG unit, bought
50 billion yen worth, mostly of non-voting shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The most likely exit option is that we let Sanyo buy back
the preferred shares," a source at one of the three major
stakeholders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concerns that any sale by the top shareholders could disrupt
trading in the company's stock would likely discourage such
sales, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, existing shareholder agreements that allow only
gradual sales of Sanyo shares are making substantial stake sales
unrealistic, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We won't take such a step as selling (Sanyo shares) into
the market," another source at one of the three top shareholders
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Sanyo, which is widely believed to be seeking a
buyer for its microchip operations, closed down 3.7 percent at
183 yen, underperforming the Tokyo stock market's electrical
machinery index .IELEC.T, which fell 2.84 percent.

&lt;p&gt;LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia, the world's third biggest cocaine producer, should redesign its coat of arms to include coca leaves, according to one group of delegates to an assembly rewriting the constitution.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Outside of the Andean region, coca is known as the main ingredient for cocaine, but in Bolivia it is a treasured herb and mild stimulant used in traditional medicines to stave off hunger and altitude sickness. It is also used in religious ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Laurel and olive branches should be replaced by branches of sacred ancient coca leaf, as a symbol of perseverance and the people's economy," says a proposal before the assembly that is overhauling Bolivia's constitution to guarantee more rights for the poor and the Indian majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal says the laurel and olive branches are European symbols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca would join a llama and a condor, animals native to the Bolivian Andes, on the coat of arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leftist, indigenous president Evo Morales came to political prominence as a leader of rebellious coca farmer groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He aims to crack down on cocaine production while scaling back programs to eradicate coca crops and promoting legal commercial uses for the leaf in everything from toothpastes and candies to balms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department says Morales' policy had contributed to an expansion in coca growing and that it threatened to undermine advances made in the 1990s in U.S.-backed coca-eradication programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. reached an agreement with Lenovo Group Ltd. to pre-load Lenovo computers with a toolbar of Microsoft's Windows Live online services including Web search, the two companies said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The agreement between Lenovo, the world's third-largest PC maker, and Microsoft, replaces a similar deal the Chinese computer maker had with Google Inc. to pre-load the Web search leader's toolbar on its desktop and notebook computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement will set live.com, Microsoft's customizable news, information and search engine site, as the default homepage for Lenovo PC users and add a Windows toolbar inside the PC's Internet Explorer browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users will be able to change the settings, but many people tend not to change default settings. The agreement aims to increase traffic to Microsoft's Web services at a time when Google's search engine has become a first-stop for many Web visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's commanding lead in the Web search lures more advertisers and money to its query results. Microsoft's Windows Live search ranks third behind Google and Yahoo Inc. with a 11 percent market share, according to data from research firm conScore Networks Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo, which bought International Business Machines Corp.'s PC unit in 2005, is the first computer manufacturer to strike an agreement with Windows Live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Megan Davies and Daisuke Wakabayashi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE, March 13 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) is in talks to buy Tellme Networks Inc., the privately owned voice recognition technology company, two sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A deal could value Tellme at more than $800 million, one of the sources said. A second source said the two sides were close to a deal, which could be announced later this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, and Tellme declined comment. The talks were first reported by technology news Web site CNET News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tellme is a dot-com survivor that has built up a major presence in the U.S. directory assistance market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tellme was founded in 1999 by Mike McCue, previously vice president of technology at Netscape, according to Tellme's Web site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tellme relies on speech recognition technology from a variety of suppliers including Nuance Communications Inc. (NUAN.O). However, Microsoft has recently been promoting its own speech recognition technology, which it sells for both computer users and customer call centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nuance's shares closed down 4.5 percent to $13.39, while Microsoft fell 2.6 percent at $26.72, both on Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tellme is privately owned by its employees and investors that include venture capital firms Benchmark Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, according to the investors' Web sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tellme's voice recognition technology allows users to gather information from the Internet over the telephone. The Mountain View, California-based company also offers services to businesses looking to automate directory assistance and other phone functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company provides automated phone services for companies, including Merrill Lynch, Cingular and Federal Express, serving over 40 million people every month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One of the sources said Tellme would be especially appealing to Microsoft in the area of wireless search, or  search using a mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The software giant sees mobile phone searches as a relatively untapped market where it can compete more favorably with Google Inc. (GOOG.O), the dominant leader in computer-based searches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One of the hurdles to mobile search has been how best to enter the information sought by a user. Tellme's voice recognition capabilities could be added to Microsoft's Windows Mobile operating system for cell phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in New York) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Megan Davies and Daisuke Wakabayashi    Editing by J.S.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Elzio Barreto &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, March 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N), the biggest U.S. securities firm by market value, is building up its team of research analysts and trading business in Brazil as it gears up for a growing business in the country, a senior executive said on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The firm has been operating a full bank in Brazil since December, when it received its license from the central bank. The new bank marked Goldman's biggest move in Brazil since talks broke down in late 2005 to buy local investment bank Pactual. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman, which had no equity research analysts focused on Brazilian companies, has hired a team of eight people to increase its presence in the country's booming equity market, said Eduardo Centola, co-head of Latin America for Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The move follows a surge in stocks sales in Brazil, a business dominated by Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) and UBS (UBSN.VX). Share offerings reached a record 31.2 billion reais ($14.9 billion) in 2006 and have broken record volumes yearly since 2004, when they totaled 9.15 billion reais. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    So far in 2007, nine companies have sold 7.13 billion reais worth of stock, putting share sales on pace to rise 35 percent from last year. Another 25 companies have filed to sell shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This is an extraordinary business in Brazil given the timing of the market," Centola told Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last year, Goldman worked on the initial public offering of electricity company Terna Participacoes TRNA11.SA and on the secondary offering of Internet retailer Submarino SUBA3.SA. The firm was also hired to prepare the IPO of the Sao Paulo stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    AGGRESSIVE MOVE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman opened its first office in Brazil in 1995, focusing on merger and acquisitions advisory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The firm has led the M ranks the past years, but with the full banking license Goldman will be able to offer a wide range of broker-dealer services and venture into the profitable business of trading local securities, Centola said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Trading of fixed income, currencies and commodities make up most of Goldman's revenue globally and generate most of its profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman has already moved part of its proprietary trading business to Brazil and may have around 120 traders at the local unit solely focused on that, said a source with knowledge of the plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In a letter to shareholders in its 2006 annual report, Goldman said it is "moving aggressively to build a significant sales and trading operation." The company put Brazil among the main regions for growth, together with Russia, India and the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "There is a commitment by our CEO to our shareholders to focus growth in these places and Brazil is one of them," Centola said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman held talks for more than a year to buy a stake in Brazilian firm Pactual, but Swiss firm UBS AG snapped up Pactual in May 2006 for about $2.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   ($1 = 2.09 reais) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Reporting by Elzio Barreto, editing by Martin Golan; Reuters Messaging: elzio.barreto.reuters.com@reuters.net; Tel. +55 11 5644-7725)) Keywords: GOLDMAN BRAZIL &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LA PAZ, March 15 (Reuters) - Companies such as Coca-Cola
Co. could be barred from using the word "coca" in their brand
names under a measure endorsed by a panel that is helping
rewrite the Bolivian constitution.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; The Coca Committee of the assembly that is overhauling the
constitution has accepted a proposal by coca leaf farmers
introducing language that bans foreign companies from "using
the name of the sacred leaf in their products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca is the main ingredient of cocaine, but Bolivians have
used it for centuries as a mild stimulant that reduces hunger
pangs and altitude sickness. Bolivian indigenous groups also
use the leaves in religious ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bid to recognize coca as something inherently Bolivian
is similar to measures that restrict the use of names such as
champagne, tequila, feta and parmesan outside of certain
regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margarita Teran, head of the Coca Committee, told daily
newspaper La Razon she was dismayed that Coca-Cola (KO.N) can
sell soft drinks worldwide without restrictions while Bolivia
is barred from exporting products made with coca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A 1961 U.N. convention bans the international trade of
products made with coca and places it in the same category as
opium and cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leftist President Evo Morales is carrying out an
international campaign to convince the United Nations to allow
Bolivia, the poorest country in South America, to export
products made with coca like toothpastes, face creams and
herbal teas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morales rose to prominence as the leader of the coca leaf
growers' union, known for its ability to bring the country to a
standstill with protests demanding an end to the forced
eradication of coca fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. State Department says Morales' coca policy has
contributed to a rise in coca growing and threatens to
undermine advances made during the 1990s as a result of the
U.S.-backed coca-eradication programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bolivia is the world's third biggest producer of cocaine
after Colombia and Peru. The United States is the biggest
market for the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, hopes the
assembly, which is scheduled to finish its work in July this
year, will empower the poor indigenous majority and help him
cement his leftist reforms.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)


 March 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs updated its earnings
estimates and target prices for the integrated oil and refining
sector, saying it has "increased confidence" in a bullish
outlook for the rest of 2007.


 The brokerage said its crude oil demand and supply analysis
showed "OPEC will likely need to raise production over the
remainder of the year, if meaningful further declines in
inventories are to be avoided - a bullish scenario".


 Goldman added that in terms of refining, its outlook for
2007 was more positive cross the United States and in
particular the U.S. Midwest.


 Goldman upgraded Frontier Oil Corp. FTO.N and Marathon
Oil Corp. (MRO.N), citing the improved outlook for U.S. Midwest
refining margin strength, while downgrading ConocoPhillips
(COP.N) and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC.N).


 In its research note, the brokerage said it downgraded
ConocoPhillips to "neutral" from "buy" and Anadarko Petroleum
to "sell" from "neutral." Goldman upgraded Marathon Oil to
"buy" from "sell" and Frontier Oil to "neutral" from "sell."


 Following are the revised price targets:


 Company Name              Current      Previous


 ConocoPhillips              $74          $75

Microsoft expects to complete the purchase in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday the two companies were in talks for a deal that could value Tellme at more than $800 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tellme, based in Mountain View, California, answers phone calls from people seeking local businesses, driving directions, sports scores, stock quotes, weather and news, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, of Redmond, Washington, said the acquisition will help it expand in speech technologies, an area in which the software maker has "only scratched the surface of what is possible," according to a company statement. Speech recognition will complement the company's existing technologies involving touch and handwriting recognition, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Microsoft were up 29 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $27.01 in midday trading on Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Michele Gershberg in New York and Philipp Gollner in San Francisco, editing by J.S.

&lt;p&gt;March 15 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded
Continental Airlines Inc. CAL.N to "neutral," saying with a
renewed bullishness for many airline equities, it can no longer
justify an "underweight" rating for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, however, said Continental's peer-leading
valuation and continued role as the industry's high-cost
producer prevents it from rating the stock above "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage noted that the shares of Continental traded
as low as $35.22 on Wednesday, meeting the price target of $35
as identified in its late-January note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan removed its target on the No. 4 U.S. carrier
and also dropped it from its focus list, saying that the shares
have achieved the brokerage's near-term price objective.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Toni Clarke &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, March 14 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK.N) are taking different approaches to drug licensing as pharmaceuticals companies race to snap up new products to bolster their pipelines of experimental drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, the world's biggest drug company, is battling to offset generic competition to some of its biggest products, and is eager to acquire new products. But it is cautious about those in early-stage, or Phase I, development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Clearly there's a higher degree of risk the earlier you go, and we often find that a compound that a small company brings into Phase 1 may not have done all the tests that we would have done," said John LaMattina, Pfizer's president of global research and development, at a Cowen &amp; Co. conference in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Merck, by contrast, has a keen interest in early products, even those which have not yet entered clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I actually think that the sweet spot for licensing is in late-stage preclinical or in Phase I before proof of concept," said Mervyn Turner, Merck's senior vice president, worldwide licensing and external research, in a separate session at the same conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's very hard to find compounds that are in Phase II, or really have clinical proof of concept, at a valuation which really works for Merck shareholders," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, which is in the midst of a corporate and cultural shake-up, says it aims to expand it presence in the vaccines business and in biologic-based drugs known as monoclonal antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In one early-stage deal, Pfizer last year paid an undisclosed sum to acquire PowderMed, based in England, to forge ahead in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Another area of interest to Pfizer is insomnia, said David Shedlarz, Pfizer's vice chairman. He said Pfizer would also be looking for new technology platforms that can underlie the development of multiple drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Even so, he said Pfizer would take a "very cautious" approach to early-stage products, though the company does not rule out any promising opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We will be looking for interesting deal structures," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Merck recently introduced Gardasil, the first vaccine against cervical cancer, and diabetes drug Januvia. Pfizer's newer products include a smoking cessation drug, Chantix, and diabetes treatment Exubera. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Merck, which restructured its operations and cut thousands of jobs after its withdrawal of painkiller Vioxx in 2004, has dramatically increased investment in early-stage products and technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It recently paid $1.1 billion for Sirna Therapeutics, a developer of technology that "silences" genes and prevents them from producing proteins linked to disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Merck, which took a beating for the Vioxx affair, are up about 35 percent since the start of 2005, while Pfizer is down 8 percent. The American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index .DRG has risen 6 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Braden Reddall; Reuters Messaging, toni.clarke.reuters.com@reuters.net +1-617-367-4165)) Keywords: PFIZER MERCK &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on 
Wednesday it will buy privately held Tellme Networks Inc., a 
speech technology company, to bolster its communications push 
and enhance searches over mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Microsoft 
expects to complete the purchase in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday 
the two companies were in talks for a deal that could value 
Tellme at more than $800 million, making it Microsoft's biggest 
acquisition since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme, based in Mountain View, California with 320 
employees, allows people to use speech to find information on 
local businesses, driving directions, sports scores, stock 
quotes, weather and news from the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, sees mobile 
phone searches as a relatively untapped market where it can 
compete more favorably with Google Inc. (GOOG.O), the dominant 
leader in computer-based searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Mobile search is going to be a huge market," said 
Morningstar analyst Toan Tran. "Search on mobile phones is 
still up for grabs and Microsoft is a big believer in voice 
being an interface for mobile phones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also aims to combine Tellme's experience in 
offering voice services like automated directory services with 
its large customer base as part of its push to offer Web-based 
phone systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme, founded in 1999 by former Netscape executive Mike 
McCue, provides automated phone services to companies including 
Merrill Lynch and Federal Express and serves over 40 million 
people every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's Office Communications server already allows 
workers to access and make changes to calendars within the 
Outlook e-mail system through voice commands or call someone 
with a click of a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme's voice services could take those capabilities to 
the next step and change how people interact with the 
telephone, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think telephone numbers are an artifact of 
technological innovation," said Jeff Raikes, president of 
Microsoft's business division in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme already generates a profit, McCue said on a 
conference call with reporters. Raikes said the two companies 
investigated partnerships for a while, but talks for an 
acquisition intensified around December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse analyst Jayson Maynard, who estimates that 
Microsoft paid more than $1 billion for the acquisition, said 
in a note to clients that the company is cash-flow positive and 
has annual revenue of more than $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme is privately owned by its employees and investors 
that include venture capital firms Benchmark Capital and 
Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROAD AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in his 1995 book "The Road 
Ahead" predicted that humans would one day talk to their 
computers rather than have to type and Tellme fits with his 
vision of expanding input to more natural ways than typing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also has worked on handwriting and touch 
technology for tablet notebook PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellme said its paid directory assistance service is 
currently the most common way for people to search for 
information from their mobile phones. Tellme handles about half 
of directory assistance calls in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The business model for mobile search is evolving from a 
pay-to-call model of directory assistance to one subsidized by 
advertising similar to how companies like Google and Yahoo Inc. 
(YHOO.O) make money off Web searches, Tellme's McCue said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft closed up 68 cents, or 2.54 percent, at 
$27.40 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Michele Gershberg in New York and

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An investigation by Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) found that Pixar Animation Studios had backdated some employee stock options before it was acquired by Disney, Chairman John Pepper said in a statement on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pepper said the probe found no one currently associated with the company had engaged in deliberate misconduct, a statement that appeared to clear Disney-Pixar Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter and Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Steve Jobs who sits on Disney's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board decided that Disney should pay any additional taxes owed by employees who hold backdated Pixar stock options, Pepper said, adding that he expected no impact to financial statements as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar, founded by Jobs, had awarded stock options to Lasseter when share prices were within a dollar of the annual low in 2000, according to securities filings. Pixar was acquired by Disney last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement from the Disney board chairman on Friday appeared to lay to rest speculation that the company faced potential liability stemming from an informal government inquiry into stock options practices at Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement also appears to include options held by Disney-Pixar President Ed Catmull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued a safety alert over Pfizer Inc.'s antibiotic Zyvox after a clinical trial found a higher chance of death in seriously ill patients given the drug.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The study, which compared Zyvox to three other antibiotics, looked at patients with bloodstream infections related to catheters, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zyvox, also known as linezolid, is approved in the United States to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including pneumonia and skin infections as well as those resistant to other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Pfizer on Friday had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the trial, Zyvox was compared to three rival drugs vancomycin, oxacillin and dicloxacillin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patients treated with linezolid had a higher chance of death than did patients treated with any comparator antibiotic, and the chance of death was related to the type of organism causing the infection," the FDA said on its Web site here .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on their type of outer membrane, bacteria can be considered either gram-negative or gram-positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zyvox patients infected with gram-negative bacteria, both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, or who were infection-free when they entered the study saw a greater risk of death. Those with only gram-positive bacteria infections did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on
Friday said it cut ratings on nine classes of subprime bonds
sold by securities units of UBS AG (UBSN.VX) and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS.N), and cited potential cuts on dozens more from
other issuers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; The issues, sold by UBS's MASTR Second Lien Trust and
Goldman's GSAMP Trust and backed by second-lien mortgages,
suffered from weaker-than-anticipated performance and erosions
of underlying credit support, Moody's said in statements. They
were mostly originated in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UBS deals were backed by loans made by subprime lenders
Accredited Home Lenders Holdings Co. LEND.O, New Century
Financial Corp. (NEWC.PK) and American Home, Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's bonds are supported by second-lien loans from New
Century, Fremont General Corp. FMT.N and Washington Mutual
Inc.'s (WM.N) Long Beach Mortgage Co., it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subprime loan delinquencies have soared since early 2006 as
the slowing U.S. housing market pinched borrowers who obtained
loans under loose underwriting standards, analysts said. The
rapid drop in the value of loans has resulted in losses,
closures, and bankruptcies at some two dozen lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second-lien, or "piggyback" loans are among the biggest
causes of the delinquencies since they push borrower's total
loan balances to as much as 100 percent the home's value. Since
those borrowers have little stake in their homes they have been
more likely to default, especially on a second-lien loan, said
Moody's analyst Nicolas Weill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The steady increase in the riskiness of loans made to
subprime borrowers in recent years and the recent slowing in
home price appreciation have been major contributors" to weak
performance of subprime loans overall, Moody's analysts said in
a recent report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's said it may lower ratings on another six classes of
bonds from the UBS and Goldman issues, and eight more from 2006
second-lien bonds issued by Fremont's own securities unit and
Deutsche Bank AG's (DBKGn.DE) ACE Securities Corp. Home Equity
Loan Trust. Deutsche's bonds were backed by loans from Long
Beach and Fremont, Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rating company in separate statements later said it may
downgrade three classes of bonds issued by Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.'s LEH.N Structured Asset Securities Corp.
Trust, backed by 2006 second-lien loans. Three classes of 2006
second-lien bonds sold by Lehman's Structured Asset Securities
Corp. Trust were also placed on review for downgrade, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's also said it may cut five classes from a New
Century 2006 second-lien issue and three classes from a Long
Beach Mortgage Loan Trust 2006 deal.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Friday it will handle a visa request from Iran's president to appear at the United Nations quickly and hoped he would use any trip to open talks with the West on Iran's nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The United States suspects Iran is using its civilian nuclear program as a cover to develop weapons. It has offered to open talks if Iran first suspends uranium enrichment, which can produce fuel for nuclear power plants or for bombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran, which says its program is for power generation, is seeking a U.S. visa for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak at the U.N. Security Council, which may vote next week on a second resolution imposing sanctions over Iran's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to do everything that we can in accordance with our host country responsibilities to expedite the issuing of any such visas," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of U.S. law, he could not say whether a visa would be issued but stressed "we have in the past issued visas for him as well as his traveling party when they have gone to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.N."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- along with Germany have agreed to impose new U.N. arms and financial sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A draft resolution has been introduced for the full Security Council to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would hope that President Ahmadinejad, when he comes before the Security Council, would take that opportunity and that moment to say that Iran has accepted the hand which has been extended in the form of the ... offer to negotiate with Iran," McCormack said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. spokesman said he hoped Ahmadinejad would not use any appearance to launch "a screed against the Security Council or the worthlessness of Security Council resolutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new draft resolution follows one adopted in December that imposed trade sanctions on Iran's nuclear materials and technology, and froze the assets abroad of some Iranian individuals and companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran ignored a February 21 deadline to suspend enrichment or face further action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new text puts an embargo on Iranian arms exports, as well as a freeze on assets of an expanded list of individuals and companies involved in Tehran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also calls for nations and institutions to bar new grants or loans to Iran except for "humanitarian and developmental" purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a statement provided by John Pepper, Chairman Of The Board, The Walt Disney Company: "The Audit Committee and the Board of The Walt Disney Company have completed their investigation into stock option practices at Pixar prior to the date of its acquisition by Disney. The Committee and Board have concluded that while options were backdated at Pixar prior to the acquisition, no one currently associated with the Company engaged in any intentional or deliberate acts of misconduct. The Board further determined that Disney should address the additional income tax liability issues facing Pixar employees who hold such options, including participating in programs established by the IRS and the State of California to facilitate the payment of such taxes on behalf of employees. The Company expects that the impact associated with remedying these tax issues will not be material to the Disney financial statements."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO.O) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) often describe themselves as partners, but they increasingly look like rivals as they compete to bundle e-mail, phones and other communication tools into a single system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While both companies are leaders in their respective fields of network equipment and software, Cisco and Microsoft separately announced this week significant acquisitions that show they are gearing for a fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco said on Thursday it planned to buy online video conferencing company WebEx Communications Inc. WEBX.O for $2.9 billion. A day before, Microsoft said it will buy Tellme Networks Inc., a privately held speech-technology company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both acquisitions are aimed at bolstering their product line of so-called "unified communications", which are systems that integrate wired and wireless phones, Web-based phone services, e-mail, instant messaging and Web conferencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such systems allow officer workers, for example, to see on a computer screen where a colleague is and click on a phone number to make a call, or switch from a mobile to desktop phone while in the middle of a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have no doubt that we'll see more acquisitions and more partnerships as the two companies keep trying to get ahead of each other in this whole unified communications space," said Jan Dawson, vice president of U.S. enterprise practice at technology research and consulting company Ovum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rivalry became apparent after Microsoft and network equipment maker Nortel Networks NT.TO announced a broad alliance in unified communications last year. They are set to sell more products together in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco, in the meantime, has been expanding its alliance with IBM (IBM.N) to develop unified communications system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do see Microsoft, with Nortel, being more formidable in the second half of 2007," said Kenneth Muth, an analyst at Robert W. Baird  Co. "I think the evidence will be more prominent in 2008,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Gotta, an analyst at the Burton Group, said successful sales from the Microsoft-Nortel alliance may threaten Cisco, although he predicted any impact would likely take a few years. "I really see 2009 and 2010 as the tipping point," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NETWORK VERSUS SOFTWARE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco's advantage is its network expertise. The company is the world's top maker of routers, which direct Internet traffic, and recently expanded into Web-based video technology, as well as consumer-oriented products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, on the other hand, is the world's largest software maker and its Windows and Office are the most ubiquitous software in most companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said Microsoft had the upper hand as software evolves more rapidly than networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst Brantley Thompson, however, said he was not too worried about the Microsoft threat as Cisco had wide distribution channels and broad technology expertise, which includes wireless technology and Web security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of collaboration is network intensive and I think they're going to have an ability to integrate a lot of things across the network," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts said it was too early to predict any impact of increased competition on share prices. Cisco shares are up more than 20 percent from a year earlier, while Microsoft shares are flat. Both companies are trading at around 16 times consensus earnings estimates for 2008, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives of both companies played down their rivalry, emphasizing instead their relationship as partners. The two companies integrate each others' products to ensure they run together smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe Microsoft and Cisco are largely complementary," said Cisco Chief Development Officer Charles Giancarlo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Akers, general manager of Microsoft's Unified Communications Group, said there was customer demand for the companies to work together. "Obviously there will be places where we compete, and where we partner," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Refiles to fix headline) By Walker Simon LIMA, March 15 (Reuters) - The Peruvian government suspended the eradication of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine, in a northern region hit by growers' protests, the agriculture minister said on Thursday. Juan Jose Salazar told Canal N television he signed an accord with coca growers to halt the eradication for at least 10 days in  Tocache, a longtime target of U.S.-backed programs to eradicate the crop. Peru is the world's No. 2 producer of coca leaf and cocaine, after Colombia. The United States has earmarked nearly $500 million in anti-narcotics aid to the country in the past five years. Under the accord, Peru would suspend the eradication in a coca crop area of about 17,000 acres (7,000 hectares) as the government mapped out the plots legally entitled to grow coca for approved uses, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. The agreement specified the growers would lift roadblocks on a key highway in Tocache, about 350 miles (600 km) north of Lima, Salazar told a news conference late on Thursday. He noted there had been a commotion in the region potentially endangering people's lives. Press reports said there had been a two-day strike on on Wednesday and Thursday shutting down many Tocache businesses. A growers' march was shown on television. In the news conference, Prime Minister Jorge del Castillo said he endorsed Salazar's decision to suspend eradication, but stressed it did not mark a setback in the government's anti-narcotics program. Reflecting Tocache's importance to Washington, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Randall Tobias visited the town two weeks ago for a look at aid projects forming part of a wider plan to reduce coca crops in the region, the Upper Huallaga Valley. 'CRUSH PIT' AREAS EXEMPTED Exempted from the eradication suspension would be plots found in the vicinity of crush pits, Salazar said, referring to sites using kerosene and other household chemicals to make raw cocaine paste for processing into cocaine elsewhere. In his interview on Canal N, Salazar said he did not consult President Alan Garcia on his decision to halt eradication for 10, 12 days or perhaps even longer. I think when a policy doesn't show results, it's necessary to stop, reflect, evaluate and see what corrections need to be made, he said. In the last 10 years ... how many millions of dollars have we spent? Salazar added. Has that reduced the violence or the area under cultivation? No. It has grown. Peru grows about 123,500 acres (50,000 hectares) of coca leaf, less than a tenth of which is destined for legally approved uses, the ministry's spokesman said, referring to its use for food processing, medicine and indigenous leaf chewers. Last year, Peruvian forces eradicated about 25,000 acres(10,000 hectares)  of coca leaf farms, the Interior Ministry said. A further 7,500 acres (3,000 hectares) of coca leaf areas were replaced by other crops under programs deemed voluntary.  (Additional reporting by Marco Aquino)

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, March 19 (Reuters) - Gazprom (GAZP.MM) has been in
talks with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) for possible tie-ups
between the U.S. major's Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2, in which the
Russian gas monopoly took the majority stake last year, a
Japanese daily reported on Monday citing Gazprom's CEO.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; "Sakhalin-2 can expand business to building new (LNG)
facilities and procuring gas produced at neighbouring gas
fields," Gazprom Chief Executive Alexei Miller told the Nikkei
business daily in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom was interested in improving the business efficiency
of Sakhalin-1, rather than directly investing in the project,
Miller told the Nikkei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said Sakhalin-1 should also supply gas to domestic
customers in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pressure on Sakhalin-1 to shift to LNG from pipeline gas has
been mounting. Exxon Mobil-led Sakhalin-1 prefers to export
natural gas via a pipeline to China, but it has not been able to
find a customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, Sakhalin-2 has sold almost all of its LNG under
long-term contracts with Japan, South Korea and United States
and the exports are expected to start in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The governor of Sakhalin in Russia's Far East, Japanese
government officials and Exxon Mobil's project partner India's
ONGC (ONGC.BO) have said it would make more sense for Sakhalin-1
to sell gas to an LNG plant in the island's south, which is
being built by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) as part of the
Sakhalin-2 project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom took over control of the project in December, buying
50 percent of it from Royal Dutch Shell and Japan's Mitsui  Co.
(8031.T) and Mitsubishi Corp. (8058.T), after months of pressure
from Moscow.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued a safety alert over Pfizer Inc.'s antibiotic Zyvox after a clinical trial found a higher chance of death in seriously ill patients given the drug.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The study, which compared Zyvox to three other antibiotics, looked at patients with bloodstream infections related to catheters, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zyvox, also known as linezolid, is approved in the United States to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including pneumonia and skin infections as well as those resistant to other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Pfizer on Friday had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the trial, Zyvox was compared to three rival drugs vancomycin, oxacillin and dicloxacillin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patients treated with linezolid had a higher chance of death than did patients treated with any comparator antibiotic, and the chance of death was related to the type of organism causing the infection," the FDA said on its Web site here .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on their type of outer membrane, bacteria can be considered either gram-negative or gram-positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zyvox patients infected with gram-negative bacteria, both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, or who were infection-free when they entered the study saw a greater risk of death. Those with only gram-positive bacteria infections did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has approved a visa for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to enable him to address the U.N. Security Council over Tehran's nuclear program, the State Department said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the United States had so far approved visas for 39 Iranian officials -- 13 diplomats and 26 security guards. He said Iran requested visas on Monday for 33 air crew members that were being processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not going to be in any way hindering the ability of President Ahmadinejad to appear before the Security Council," the spokesman told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is at loggerheads with Iran over its nuclear program and Ahmadinejad wants to address the Security Council in New York before it votes on a resolution imposing new arms and financial sanctions against Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A draft resolution introduced to the council last week would ban all Iranian arms exports, but not imports, and freeze financial assets abroad of 28 individuals, groups and companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure also requires Iran to halt uranium enrichment and the processing of nuclear fuel within 60 days after passage or face the possibility of additional sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tehran argues that its nuclear plans are for peaceful power generation purposes while the United States and others say the main object of the program is to build a nuclear bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCormack said he hoped the Iranian president would use his time at the United Nations to seek dialogue rather than confrontation with the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He urged Ahmadinejad to accept an offer by the permanent five members of the U.N. Security Council, as well as Germany, to give up uranium enrichment and start negotiations with them over its nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could be an important moment to accept that offer," said McCormack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - U.S. and Panamanian authorities have seized 19.4 metric tons of cocaine on board a ship in the Pacific, making what is thought to be one of the world's biggest maritime drug busts, Panama said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;U.S. anti-drug officials and Panamanian police found the narcotics hidden in the cargo area of a Panama-registered ship off the Central American nation's coast on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Panama and the United States had seized 11 metric tons of cocaine in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found 19.4 tonnes and have arrested 14 people, Panamanians and Mexicans," a Panamanian government spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to give the street value of the haul but cocaine typically sells at about $10,000 a pound ($20,000 a kg) in the United States, Central American and U.S. anti-drug officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2001, the U.S. Coast Guard found 13 metric tons of cocaine aboard a Belize-registered vessel off Mexico's Pacific coast. Until Monday's announcement, it was the largest maritime drug seizure on record, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central America and Mexico are the main transit points for South American cocaine destined for U.S. markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO, March 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
(GS.N) said on Monday it has signed on as an additional
investor in a proposed $3.4 billion investment plan to support
auto parts maker Delphi Corp.'s DPHIQ.PK emergence from
bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Goldman has agreed to buy up to 642,857 shares of common
stock directly allotted to the investor group led by Cerberus
Capital Management LP and Appaloosa Management LP under the
planned equity agreement, Goldman said in a federal regulator
filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, Goldman could acquire more than 6.4 million shares
in a reorganized Delphi under the agreement depending on how
heavily current stockholders participate in a proposed rights
offering, Goldman said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Appaloosa said earlier in March that unidentified investors
had agreed to participate in the equity purchase agreement and
the investor group could sell more than 70 percent of its
common stock stake to those additional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group led by Cerberus and Appaloosa includes Harbinger
Capital Partners, Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. MER.N and UBS
Securities LLC (UBSN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group would hold a controlling stake in Delphi under
the investment proposal, which remains contingent on Delphi
reaching deals with its unions and former parent General Motors
Corp. (GM.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investor group has agreed to buy 6.3 million shares of
common stock and 34.3 million shares of preferred stock at $35
per share for a minimum $1.4 billion investment in Delphi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group also has agreed to buy any shares left over from
a 56.7 million share rights offering to current stockholders,
guaranteeing Delphi another $2 billion to support its revival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which holds a 3.5 percent stake in Delphi totaling
more than 19.5 million shares, has agreed to acquire up to 5.79
million shares from the rights offering, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, plans
to cut 21 of 29 U.S. union plants, four-fifths of its U.S.
union work force and thousands of salaried workers worldwide.
It also plans to exit several businesses.

Its rivals, including Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), have already set up brokerage ventures in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "JPMorgan is eager to get a local partner for brokerage business, while Bohai also has a strong desire to boost its capital and reputation," said the source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan declined comment. Bohai Securities was not immediately available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The sources said JPMorgan might get Beijing's support for the potential deal, partly because the government was now making efforts to boost Tianjin as its new regional economic centre by offering special financial policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bohai Securities, with a registered capital of 2.32 billion yuan, has 31 branches in China, including 15 in Tianjin alone, according to its Web site (www.ewww.com.cn). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Although JPMorgan and Bohai have yet to reach any agreement on price or stake size, the sources expected JPMorgan would take a stake of between 20 and 25 percent, making it the second largest shareholder of Bohai, controlled by TEAD Group 000652.SZ -- the investment arm of the Tianjin government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last week, TEDA said in a statement that Bohai was not planning a backdoor listing, and it had no comment on local media reports that Bohai was seeking foreign partners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Global investment banks are keen to tap China's capital markets, particularly as Beijing has been encouraging its largest companies to issue shares domestically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Beijing has put a freeze on approving new brokerage joint ventures, but there is no lack of interest from players like Citigroup (C.N) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), which have expressed strong interest in setting up their own ventures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's an open secret in the industry that it is unlikely that CSRC will give its approval to a new brokerage joint venture after the UBS deal last year," said the first source, referring to China Securities Regulatory Commission.  "That means if you want government approval, you have to lobby top leaders at the State Council, such as Premier Wen Jiabao, for special permission," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Late last year, UBS (UBSN.VX) won initial official approval to invest $200 million in state-owned Beijing Securities for a 20 percent stake and de facto management control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In late 2005, JPMorgan was in talks to buy a controlling stake in Liaoning Securities. The talks did not go ahead due mainly to a lack of official support, sources have said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Jean Yoon; george.chen@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: george.chen.reuters.com@reuters.net; +86 21 6104 1795)) Keywords: JPMORGAN CHINA/BOHAI  .

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds shareholder lawsuit, CEO pay in paragraphs 3-8) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters) - Gadfly shareholder Evelyn Davis, who has railed against excessive executive compensation for decades, wants investors to bar Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) from ever again granting stock options to its executives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Davis' proposal, included in an amended shareholder proxy filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, urges Goldman shareholders to approve a proposal "so that no future new stock options are awarded to anyone." It also seeks to bar renewing or re-pricing current stock options, unless called for under an existing contract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Separately, Goldman was the target of a shareholder lawsuit filed on Friday that contends the bank's top executives were overpaid last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The suit, brought by individual stockholder Jeffrey Bader in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, seeks an injunction blocking Goldman's upcoming annual meeting from going ahead as planned or the voiding of its board of directors' elections if no injunction is granted before the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The annual meeting is scheduled for March 27 at a Goldman office building in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The lawsuit accuses Goldman's officers and board of undervaluing stock options awarded to Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and other executives. It says pay information was not properly disclosed in the company's Feb. 21 proxy materials, which the lawsuit contends was a breach of the board's duty to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The purpose of a proxy statement is to inform the stockholders, not to challenge their critical wits," the lawsuit says. "As a result, the proxy statement renders the stockholders unwitting agents of self-inflicted damage."  Blankfein last year received more than $54.3 million in cash, stock and options, a record for Wall Street pay, after leading the investment bank for only six months. In 2006, the bank's profits jumped 70 percent to a record $9.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe the lawsuit is entirely without merit and we will contest it vigorously," Goldman spokeswoman Andrea Rachman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The shareholder proposal put forth by Davis, a frequent critic of corporate America's pay and business practices, targets the company's option awards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The proposal argues that these grants "have gone out of hand in recent years, and some analysts might inflate earnings estimates because earnings affect stock prices and stock options." There "are other ways to 'reward' executives and other employees, including giving them actual stock instead of options," Davis wrote in the proposal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman recommended shareholders vote against the proposal, saying it is too restrictive and potentially harmful to the investment bank. Goldman should continue to have the ability to grant stock options to employees and directors as one form of compensation, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The board of directors believes that stock options, as an element of compensation, can align the interests of management with the interests of Goldman Sachs' shareholders," the bank wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Eliminating options, which are used by rivals, also "could place Goldman Sachs at a disadvantage in retaining, motivating and recruiting employees," the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Joseph Giannone and Martha Graybow, editing by Maureen Bavdek; Reuters messaging: joseph.giannone.reuters.com@reuters.net;+1 646 223 6184)) Keywords: GOLDMAN PROXY/OPTIONS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) Chief
Executive David O'Reilly reaped more than $17 million from
exercising stock options and stock awards in 2006, adding to a
compensation package worth nearly $13.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Earnings at the second largest U.S. oil and gas company
rose about 22 percent to $17.14 billion in 2006 as soaring oil
prices  boosted earnings and stock prices across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly, 60, cleared about $9.3 million from exercising
487,200 previously awarded stock options and $7.8 million from
stock awards during the year, Chevron said in a filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those benefits augmented a compensation package that
included $1.6 million in salary, $3.5 million of incentive
awards and $8.1 million of stock and option awards. O'Reilly's
2006 pay package also included a total of $228,617 for employee
savings plans, life insurance and perks such as use of the
company plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The value of O'Reilly's retirement and deferred
compensation also increased by $6.3 million in 2006.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has approved a visa for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to enable him to address the U.N. Security Council over Tehran's nuclear program, the State Department said on Monday&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"We received the applications and have processed them," said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack. Asked if that meant the visa had been approved, he said, "Yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is at loggerheads with Iran over its nuclear program and Ahmadinejad wants to address the Security Council in New York before it votes on a resolution imposing new arms and financial sanctions against Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A draft resolution introduced to the council last week would ban all Iranian arms exports, but not imports, and freeze financial assets abroad of 28 individuals, groups and companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure also requires Iran to halt uranium enrichment and the processing of nuclear fuel within 60 days after passage or face the possibility of additional sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tehran argues that its nuclear plans are for peaceful power generation purposes while the United States and others say the main object of the program is to build a nuclear bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCormack said he hoped the Iranian president would use his time at the United Nations to seek dialogue rather than confrontation with the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He urged Ahmadinejad to accept an offer by the permanent five members of the U.N. Security Council, as well as Germany, to give up uranium enrichment and start negotiations with them over its nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could be an important moment to accept that offer," said McCormack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued a safety alert over Pfizer Inc.'s antibiotic Zyvox after a clinical trial found a higher chance of death in seriously ill patients given the drug.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The study, which compared Zyvox to three other antibiotics, looked at patients with bloodstream infections related to catheters, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zyvox, also known as linezolid, is approved in the United States to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including pneumonia and skin infections as well as those resistant to other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Pfizer on Friday had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the trial, Zyvox was compared to three rival drugs vancomycin, oxacillin and dicloxacillin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patients treated with linezolid had a higher chance of death than did patients treated with any comparator antibiotic, and the chance of death was related to the type of organism causing the infection," the FDA said on its Web site here .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on their type of outer membrane, bacteria can be considered either gram-negative or gram-positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zyvox patients infected with gram-negative bacteria, both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, or who were infection-free when they entered the study saw a greater risk of death. Those with only gram-positive bacteria infections did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on Tuesday a U.S. court upheld the three main patents covering its Celebrex arthritis treatment, winning a challenge by generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA.O &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The decision by the U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey bars Israel-based Teva from launching a competitor drug in the U.S. until December 2015, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer had filed suit against Teva in February 2004 after the generic drugmaker asked U.S. regulators for permission to sell a copycat version of Celebrex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Celebrex, which was approved in 1998 and had sales last year of $1.57 billion, is in the same class of medicines as Merck &amp; Co's (MRK.N) withdrawn Vioxx pain and arthritis treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The pill works by blocking a protein called COX-2 that is linked to inflammation. Although designed to treat pain with a smaller risk of gastrointestinal problems than far less-expensive conventional painkillers, Celebrex has not proven such a safety advantage in clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Ransdell Pierson; editing by Gunna Dickson; Reuters Messaging: Lewis.Krauskopf.reuters.com@reuters.net; lewis.krauskopf@reuters.com; 646-223-6082)) Keywords: PFIZER TEVA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds background, details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission said on Tuesday it agreed to investigate a patent infringement complaint filed by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) against Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA(ALU.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The ITC said it had agreed to institute an investigation based on a complaint that Microsoft filed in February, which seeks to ban imports of some Alcatel-Lucent products that allegedly infringe several Microsoft patents, the ITC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The patents cited by Microsoft cover technology used to integrate telephone systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The ITC complaint is part of a larger battle over patents between Microsoft and Alcatel. The two companies are locked in a number of patent disputes including a suit over the video-decoding technology in Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In February a federal jury found that Microsoft infringed digital music patents held by Alcatel-Lucent and should pay $1.52 billion in damages.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO, March 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) said on Monday it has signed on as an additional investor in a proposed $3.4 billion investment plan to support auto parts maker Delphi Corp.'s DPHIQ.PK emergence from bankruptcy.    Goldman has agreed to buy up to 642,857 shares of common stock directly allotted to the investor group led by Cerberus Capital Management LP and Appaloosa Management LP under the planned equity agreement, Goldman said in a federal regulator filing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Overall, Goldman could acquire more than 6.4 million shares in a reorganized Delphi under the agreement depending on how heavily current stockholders participate in a proposed rights offering, Goldman said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Appaloosa said earlier in March that unidentified investors had agreed to participate in the equity purchase agreement and the investor group could sell more than 70 percent of its common stock stake to those additional investors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The group led by Cerberus and Appaloosa includes Harbinger Capital Partners, Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. MER.N and UBS Securities LLC (UBSN.VX). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The group would hold a controlling stake in Delphi under the investment proposal, which remains contingent on Delphi reaching deals with its unions and former parent General Motors Corp. (GM.N) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The investor group has agreed to buy 6.3 million shares of common stock and 34.3 million shares of preferred stock at $35 per share for a minimum $1.4 billion investment in Delphi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The group also has agreed to buy any shares left over from a 56.7 million share rights offering to current stockholders, guaranteeing Delphi another $2 billion to support its revival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman, which holds a 3.5 percent stake in Delphi totaling more than 19.5 million shares, has agreed to acquire up to 5.79 million shares from the rights offering, if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, plans to cut 21 of 29 U.S. union plants, four-fifths of its U.S. union work force and thousands of salaried workers worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;SAN ANTONIO, March 21 (Reuters) - A $1.5 billion project to
boost the heavy crude processing capacity of Chevron
Corp.'s(CVX.N) joint venture refinery in Yeosu, Korea, is on
schedule for completion by the end of the year, the company's
global refining chief said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The 650,000 barrel per day (bpd) GS Caltex refinery will
able to process an additional 55,000 bpd of heavy crude into
light and midgrade diesel when the construction is complete and
the machinery on-line, said Jeet Bindra, president of Chevron
Global Refining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GS Caltex is a 50-50 joint-venture between GS Holdings
Group and Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron continues talks with Indian refiner Reliance
Industries to expand Chevron's investment from 5 per cent to 29
percent of Reliance Petroleum Ltd., which will operate a
580,000 bpd refinery under construction next to Reliance
Industries' 650,000 bpd refinery in Jamnagar, India, Bindra
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new refinery is scheduled to begin operating in
December 2008 and Chevron likely won't make a final decision on
the additional investment until sometime in the first half of
2009, he said during an interview at Hart's World Refining and

decision after the refinery has started up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal between the two companies would include joint
upstream and downstream projects, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which is based in San Ramon, Calif., also is
weighing a 200,000 bpd expansion of its 330,000 bpd refinery in
Pascagoula, Mississippi, Bindra said. A decision on the
expansion is expected next year.

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA, March 21 (Reuters) - Colombia's Navy captured six tonnes of cocaine while on patrol in the Pacific ocean in the Andean country's largest illegal drug haul so far this year, authorities said on Wednesday. Colombia remains the world's top producer of cocaine despite receiving billions of dollars in U.S. military and counter-narcotics aid to fight left-wing rebels and the illegal drug trade. A little more than six tonnes of cocaine was captured, with a price of around $150 million, said Adm. Orlando Malaver, commander of the naval forces on the Pacific coast. He gave no further details. Colombia produces more than 600 tonnes of cocaine each year with most of it shipped through Mexico and Central America to the United States and also to European markets. Washington has pumped more than $4 billion into Colombia since 2000 in an effort to stem the flow of cocaine, combat insurgents and reduce the cultivation of coca leaf used to manufacture the illicit white drug.

It will also gain control of Leao Junior's three bottling plants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The transaction, which has to be approved by antitrust authorities, is Coca-Cola's latest attempt to widen its product line in Brazil beyond traditional carbonated soft drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In August 2005, Coca-Cola snapped up local juice maker Sucos Mais for about 100 million reais ($48.4 million). And in December of last year, it teamed up with Mexican bottler Coca-Cola Femsa SA (KOF.N) to buy Jugos del Valle, whose Brazilian unit is the country's leading juice maker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Founded in 1901, closely held Leao Junior is Brazil's No. 1 producer of bottled teas. The company rang up 158.9 million reais ($76.9 million) in sales last year, an 18.2 percent increase over 2005. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ($1 = 2.065 reais) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Todd Benson; editing by Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: todd.benson.reuters.com@reuters.net +55 11 5644 7703)) Keywords: COCACOLA BRAZIL/ACQUISITION &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday said it is actively investigating reports of "fraudulent behavior and theft" on its Xbox Live online video gaming service, which has more than 6 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Recently, there have been reports of fraudulent activity and account theft taking place on the Xbox Live network," Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 11, an Xbox Live user posted a message on a Microsoft Xbox forum complaining about a hacked account and stolen credit card information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security is a major concern for Microsoft, whose operating system is a favorite target for hackers, and for online commerce sites such as eBay Inc., which has an entire team devoted to online security and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

raised its ratings on Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N), citing cyclical

growth in ratings and advertising at its ABC Broadcasting
unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney also has had success in "leveraging its content

several years," Fitch said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch raised Disney's senior unsecured debt one notch to

outlook is stable, indicating an additional rating change is
not anticipated over the next one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, "while credit metrics have improved from already
strong levels, share repurchase activity has been aggressive
and would be a more meaningful concern if sustained at similar

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on Tuesday a U.S. court upheld the three main patents covering its Celebrex arthritis treatment, winning a challenge by generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA.O &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The decision by the U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey bars Israel-based Teva from launching a competitor drug in the U.S. until December 2015, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer had filed suit against Teva in February 2004 after the generic drugmaker asked U.S. regulators for permission to sell a copycat version of Celebrex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Celebrex, which was approved in 1998 and had sales last year of $1.57 billion, is in the same class of medicines as Merck &amp; Co's (MRK.N) withdrawn Vioxx pain and arthritis treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The pill works by blocking a protein called COX-2 that is linked to inflammation. Although designed to treat pain with a smaller risk of gastrointestinal problems than far less-expensive conventional painkillers, Celebrex has not proven such a safety advantage in clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Ransdell Pierson; editing by Gunna Dickson; Reuters Messaging: Lewis.Krauskopf.reuters.com@reuters.net; lewis.krauskopf@reuters.com; 646-223-6082)) Keywords: PFIZER TEVA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI, March 21 (Reuters) - India's fifth-largest mobile
phone firm, Idea Cellular Ltd. (IDEA.BO), signed a 10-year pact
on Wednesday to outsource some of its operations to IBM (IBM.N)
in a deal valued at up to $800 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Indian unit of IBM will manage and support Idea's
information technology infrastructure, and other services
including billing and customer management on a revenue-sharing
basis, the cellular operator said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It gives us business focus, apart from cost being
contained," Sanjeev Aga, managing director of Idea Cellular,
said at a news conference. He gave no details on the savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM had signed a 10-year, $750 million revenue-sharing deal
in 2004 with top mobile firm Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BRTI.BO) to
manage its core IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That deal is now estimated to have gone up to more than
$1.5 billion, helped by robust growth in Bharti's subscribers
and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Idea Cellular, part of metals-to-insurance conglomerate
Aditya Birla Group, provides mobile services on the widely
prevalent GSM platform in 13 of the 23 zones that make up
India's telecom circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It had 13.6 million subscribers at end of February, way
behind Bharti's 35.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Idea has not taken a decision yet to spin off its telecoms
towers business into a separate subsidiary, Aga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bigger rivals Bharti and Reliance Communications Ltd.
(RLCM.BO) have announced plans to move their towers operations
to subsidiaries in what analysts say will help unlock value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have just begun to evaluate the issue," he said. "It
will take another two-three months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Idea, which listed on the stock exchanges earlier
this month, ended down 0.85 percent at 93.05 rupees in a Mumbai
market that rose 1.9 percent.
 ($1 = 43.5 rupees)

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - When Disney releases a

invade stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The studio has pegged just 14 animated feature films for 
"Platinum Edition" treatment, and "Jungle Book" is No. 10. As 
with the other DVDs in the high-end series, the movie has been 
restored and includes such new features as a suite of games, 
deleted scenes and songs, as well as a retrospective feature 
with Bruce Reitherman, the voice of Mowgli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DVD release will be accompanied by an array of "Jungle 
Book"-themed consumer products so that big retailers will be 
able to create "Jungle Book" sections in their stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each March and again in October, a new two-disc Platinum 
Edition DVD of an animated classic is shipped to retailers. 
Invariably, it tops the sales chart and sells millions of 
copies, often beating a hot new feature film fresh from a 
profitable theatrical run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This month, the Platinum Edition of "Pinocchio," which 
debuted in theaters in 1953, gave "Borat" a serious run for its 
money in stores when both titles came out the same day. In 
October, the Platinum Edition of "The Little Mermaid," a 
big-screen hit in 1989, sold 4 million copies in a single week. 
In October 2003, "The Lion King" sold 3 million DVDs in two 
days; in October 2001, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," the 
first Platinum Edition DVD, became the first DVD to sell 1 
million units in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. will test a "watch-and-chat" feature next week on its ABC Family Channel Web site that lets groups of viewers watch TV shows on the Internet and chat about them at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney, whose ABC broadcast network was the first to offer free streaming videos of its prime-time shows on the Web, now hopes to build buzz around its ABC Family cable shows through the social networking feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC Family will test the feature on the season finale of its prime-time show "Wildfire" on Monday night. The streaming video of the show will go live on abcfamily.com an hour after it airs on cable, and will be available through April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature lets groups of up to 10 people set up "screening rooms" to watch the episode on laptops and write a running commentary that will appear on one side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each screening room host can pause, rewind and fast-forward video while they watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Lee, president of ABC Family Channel, said "Wildfire" was chosen for the test because its audience of predominantly 14- to 28-year-old females is "the most passionate audience of any show on the network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a new generation here .... They are changing the way people watch TV or use other technology," Lee said. "When you link (social networking) to TV programming, it's almost like word of mouth on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network will poll screening room attendees at the conclusion of the test to gauge response, Lee said. If the feature is well received, the network will extend it to other shows as early as this summer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature was developed by Lycos Inc., a subsidiary of Korea's Daum Communications Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disney test is the first use of watch-and-chat outside of Lycos' multiuser video on demand service, cinema.lycos.com, and its content playlist creator, lycos.mix.com, Lycos Chief Operating Officer Brian Kalinowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application feeds on a growing tendency of young audiences toward "spending, day-to-day, more time in their online social circles than in their physical social circles," Kalinowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You may be more apt to join me in a chat while we are watching this than if I send you a link saying, 'Watch this.' It extends word-of-mouth ability," Kalinowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has had success building audiences for its cable content -- such as its Disney Channel blockbuster "High School Musical" -- with multi-platform marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - When Disney releases a 
two-disc DVD of "The Jungle Book" on the animated classic's 
40th anniversary October 2, expect an army of shoppers to 
invade stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The studio has pegged just 14 animated feature films for 
"Platinum Edition" treatment, and "Jungle Book" is No. 10. As 
with the other DVDs in the high-end series, the movie has been 
restored and includes such new features as a suite of games, 
deleted scenes and songs, as well as a retrospective feature 
with Bruce Reitherman, the voice of Mowgli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DVD release will be accompanied by an array of "Jungle 
Book"-themed consumer products so that big retailers will be 
able to create "Jungle Book" sections in their stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each March and again in October, a new two-disc Platinum 
Edition DVD of an animated classic is shipped to retailers. 
Invariably, it tops the sales chart and sells millions of 
copies, often beating a hot new feature film fresh from a 
profitable theatrical run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This month, the Platinum Edition of "Pinocchio," which 
debuted in theaters in 1953, gave "Borat" a serious run for its 
money in stores when both titles came out the same day. In 
October, the Platinum Edition of "The Little Mermaid," a 
big-screen hit in 1989, sold 4 million copies in a single week. 
In October 2003, "The Lion King" sold 3 million DVDs in two 
days; in October 2001, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," the 
first Platinum Edition DVD, became the first DVD to sell 1 
million units in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The World Bank has told an Exxon Mobil-led consortium to take corrective action to fully compensate farmers in southern Chad who lost land and their livelihoods as the U.S. company expands its search for oil in the Doba basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank's private-sector lender, the International Finance Corp., has insisted Exxon (XOM.N) reassess its compensation plans after an independent survey found that expanded drilling is destroying already-scarce land that families live off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon operates the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline development project, including Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) and Malaysia's state-run Petronas PETR.UL, which the IFC agreed to help finance on condition profits from the oil benefited the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Rashad Kaldany, the IFC's director for oil, gas and mining, said despite cash compensation by an Exxon affiliate, Esso Chad, families would be worse off in the long term if their livelihoods were not properly restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have had extensive discussions with Esso and really urged them to take this very seriously and we have agreed on the principles," Kaldany told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are committed to doing things right, but getting to finalizing an action plan and disclosing it is something we are still working on with them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaldany said the consortium had agreed to issue a plan within the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will build on what they have done before, including cash compensation, but may include new approaches to either restore their livelihoods, or help them develop new livelihoods with training," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report, commissioned by Esso at the IFC's request, found that Esso miscalculated its land requirements and through incremental acquisitions have exceeded original estimates by 65 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said exploration and drilling had fragmented cultivated land and left some areas unfit for farming, while villagers had abandoned growing cotton, a vital cash crop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXXON: AFFECTED PEOPLE BETTER OFF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 1,640 families, or about 12,000 people, affected, most had lost between 20 percent to all of the use of their land, the report said, adding that Exxon significantly underestimated the number of people that would be affected, especially those who would be suffer due to the loss of land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families who received cash for land used the money to improve homes, pay debts and buy cattle and farm equipment, but they also wasted it on alcohol, bride purchases and prostitution, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our aim is to ensure long-term positive impacts and this is why we have been urging Esso to reassess compensation, which they are willing to do," Kaldany said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an e-mailed response, Exxon-Mobil said it had been "developing and implementing mitigation plans to address issues identified" in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The project believes that the compensation and resettlement plan has generally worked well," it said, adding the study "shows in clear and quantifiable terms that the people affected are better off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian Gary, a policy advisor for development group Oxfam who closely follows the pipeline project, praised the IFC for stepping in but said it had acted too slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the IFC pushed hard enough on Exxon and pushed as early as they should of," said Gary, whose organization was among the aid and environmental groups briefed by the IFC this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pipeline project has long been a thorn in the side of the World Bank, which was criticized from the start for getting involved in oil projects that had done more harm than good in impoverished African countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz halted loans to Chad in 2005 after the government made a grab for the oil revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the bank has renegotiated the deal with the government, which promised to allocate 70 percent of budgetary spending in 2007 for programs to help the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Bill Berkrot &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - Doctors and investors will scour the wreckage of Pfizer Inc.'s spectacularly failed cholesterol medicine for clues that might exonerate similar drugs in development by other companies when clinical trial data are unveiled at one of the year's major heart meetings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tens of thousands of heart doctors and researchers will gather in New Orleans as the convention center that was a scene of horrors during Hurricane Katrina hosts the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting from March 24-27 at which the latest research in medicines and devices to treat heart disease and its causes will be presented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One trial called COURAGE has heightened anxiety levels among investors in companies that rely on the lucrative coronary stent business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The large, long-term study of stable angina patients with coronary artery disease aims to determine if increasingly used angioplasty and stenting plus intensive medical therapy provides any benefit over the medicinal therapy alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts figure the patient population in the study represents roughly 40 percent of those receiving stents in the United States and Europe, so the results could impact stent usage and medical practice going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer's (PFE.N) torcetrapib, the most expensive experimental drug failure in history, will be the subject of three studies, although not the halted trial that ended development of the drug in December due to unacceptably high death rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Still, the data to be presented are expected to shed light on whether the dangers of torcetrapib are specific to that compound or could indicate problems with the entire class known as CETP inhibitors designed to raise levels of HDL -- the so-called good cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Several drugmakers, including Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX), will be looking for answers from torcetrapib trials as they decide whether to push ahead with their own CETP drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The results will be pretty interesting. They won't do much for torcetrapib but they will help people understand where to go next in heart disease," Pfizer research and development chief John LaMattina said at a recent conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "There will still be a lot of questions that need answering," he said. "Is it a class effect? Is HDL overrated?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The importance of and various approaches to raising HDL in treating or preventing heart disease will be a hot topic among cardiologists and researchers at the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Clinical studies of already marketed drugs that have been dogged by safety concerns, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ.N) heart failure medicine Natrecor, will be presented with the potential to to allay such fears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Some companies, such as AtheroGenics Inc. AGIX.O and CV Therapeutics Inc. CVTX.O have already tipped Wall Street that their drugs failed to meet primary goals of closely watched trials, sending their share prices plunging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But the devil is in the details and in each case the companies suggested that full data to be presented in New Orleans would contain positive news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The AtheroGenics trial was a high stakes late-stage study of an arterial plaque reduction drug known as AGI-1067 that was tipped to become a multibillion-dollar medicine if it achieved an extremely difficult goal of significantly reducing major adverse events such as death, heart attack and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said it achieved secondary goals, and just how strong the data are could determine whether AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) maintains its partnership on the drug and by how much AtheroGenics shares might recover from a 60 percent swoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe the ACC meeting data will provide some encouraging findings on the drug's effect," said Needham analyst Mark Monane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In addition to the COURAGE stent trial, the tiny mesh tubes used to prop open cleared arteries will be focus of several other studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Abbott Laboratories Inc. (ABT.N) has a trio of stent studies being presented at ACC, including the pivotal trial that will likely determine if the Xience drug coated stent it acquired from Guidant Corp. will gain U.S. approval. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Bill Berkrot, editing by Richard Chang; Reuters Messaging: bill.berkrot.reuters.com@reuters.net phone 646 223-6030)) Keywords: HEART MEETING  Keywords: HEART MEETING  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States risks losing its global technology edge because tighter visa rules since 2001 have made it too hard for foreigners to visit, U.S. business and educational groups said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're telling a whole generation of foreigners that they're not welcome here -- as businessmen, as employees, as students, as tourists. And we're doing that at precisely the time that competition for talent is the most intense globally," said Bill Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, whose members include such big U.S. companies as Boeing and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He warned the world's largest economy could lose its lead as a center of global innovation over the next 20 years because U.S. entry requirements are discouraging foreigners from visiting the United States and encouraging companies to relocate operations overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's going to be a tragedy for us," Reinsch said. "If you can't get your engineers here, you build your lab in Shanghai" or some other foreign location, said Reinsch, a former U.S. Commerce Department official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was speaking at a briefing with other proponents of U.S. visa program reform, including the Association of International Educators, the Heritage Foundation, the Coalition for Employment Through Exports and the Alliance for International Educational and Cultural Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandatory interview requirements have produced lengthy waits for many foreigner to obtain visas. Potential visitors often have to travel long distances to a U.S. consulate in their country before winning approval to visit the United States, the groups said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many foreign travelers also are mistreated at the point of entry into the United States and discover they have been erroneously listed as a security threat because of their name or physical appearance, Reinsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it happens five or six times (to the same individual), you wonder why the government can't get its act together and figure this out," Reinsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groups urged a number of reforms they said would make it easier for foreigners to visit the United States without jeopardizing national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those include expanding the number of countries whose citizens can visit the United States for up to 90 days without a visa from the current 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress also should reverse a 2004 law and give U.S. consulates the discretion to waive the personal interview requirement, based on a risk assessment, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another proposal would create a "trusted traveler" program to expedite approval for frequent visitors willing to submit to extensive background checks in advance, the groups said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Generic forms of Pfizer Inc.'s blockbuster Norvasc blood pressure drug will likely be launched by next week -- six months earlier than expected -- after a U.S. appeals court decided Pfizer's patent on the drug is invalid, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Thursday reversed a lower court patent decision that had favored Pfizer (PFE.N) in its bid to prevent Canadian drugmaker Apotex Inc. from launching a generic form of Norvasc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling reversed a decision made by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said the lower court "erred" when it disagreed with Apotex and when it found the discovery process for the patent was a unique process undertaken by Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analyst Jami Rubin said the biggest immediate beneficiary of the ruling will be Mylan Laboratories Inc. MYL.N because it was the first company to seek U.S. approval for generic Norvasc, and is therefore entitled to launch its copycats before Apotex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We understand that the decision applies to Mylan, therefore we would expect Mylan to launch a generic (Norvasc) tablet on March 25th," Rubin said in a research report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares edged down 0.4 percent to $25.76 in late afternoon trade, while shares of Mylan rose 5 percent to $20.52, also on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECOND-BIGGEST PFIZER PRODUCT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norvasc is Pfizer's second-biggest product, with global sales last year of $4.87 billion. Wall Street has been expecting it to face generic competition in September in the United States, where the drug's sales were $2.5 billion in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer is reviewing the decision and is considering all its options, including seeking reconsideration" of the court decision, the world's biggest drugmaker said in a statement. Officials of Mylan and Apotex could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prudential analyst Tim Anderson said he expects generic Norvasc to be introduced "as soon as next week," and predicted its early arrival will cost Pfizer about $1 billion in sales this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did not anticipate this ruling, but it will probably only have a muted impact on Pfizer, which is already a washed-out, low valuation name," Anderson said in his research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, whose revenue growth has stalled due to generic competition for other big drugs and its inability to develop new blockbuster products, is relying on big job cuts to deliver earnings growth in 2007 and 2008 in the high single-digit percentage range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Anderson said an early launch of Norvasc generics would hurt Pfizer's earnings by 10 cents per share this year. That would strip away about half the company's hoped-for profit growth. Analysts, on average, expect Pfizer to earn $2.21 per share in 2007, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mylan in October 2005 won final U.S. approval for three dosage strengths of generic Norvasc, but held off launching the copycats as it continued to wage its own patent battle with Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer last month won the federal patent case in Pennsylvania against Mylan, in a decision that blocked Mylan from launching its generics until September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Terrence McVerry, of the Western District of Pennsylvania, had upheld Pfizer's patent covering the active ingredient in Norvasc. He found the patent is valid, enforceable and would be infringed by Mylan's product, Pfizer said then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mylan, which appealed the ruling, could have faced heavy damages if it started selling its product and then lost the patent trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - The Federal Communications
Commission on Thursday gave approval to Citadel Broadcasting
Corp. CDL.N to acquire 24 Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) radio
stations on the condition that Citadel divest 11 of its
currently-owned stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The approval came more than a year after Las Vegas-based
Citadel offered to buy Disney's ABC radio assets in a deal
worth $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition will give Citadel a foothold in the
country's biggest radio markets, including New York, Los
Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal did not include ESPN Radio and Radio Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To comply with FCC radio-ownership rules, Citadel agreed to
transfer control of 11 of its stations in seven markets including
Oklahoma and Albuquerque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commissioner Robert McDowell, a Republican, said
competition will be improved by Citadel's divestiture and
called it a "terrific buying opportunity" for new entrants to
get into the radio market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Democratic Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein also cited
Citadel's commitment to seek out qualified women and minority
owners along with its promise of business reforms to make
negotiations between radio stations and music companies more
transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier in March, Citadel along with Clear Channel
Communications Inc. (CCU.N), CBS Corp. (CBSa.N) and Entercom
Communications Corp. (ETM.N) agreed to pay $12.5 million to
settle investigations by the FCC into whether they received
secret payments to play certain songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The four big U.S. radio station owners did not admit to any
wrongdoing, but agreed to set aside 4,200 hours of free radio
time for independent musicians.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   (Adds background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By David Lawsky &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    BRUSSELS, March 22 (Reuters) - The European Union's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, told the European Parliament on Thursday that U.S. software giant Microsoft (MSFT.O) continued to gain market share through abusive behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The European Commission found three years ago that Microsoft had illegally abused the dominance of its Windows operating system in the work group server market. It slapped on a record fine and demanded that the firm change its business practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft is constantly gaining market share and that is what is worrying me in the work group server operating market," she said, referring to office servers used to print, share files and allow users to sign in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "As a consequence of your abusive behaviour you are getting positive results for the company -- that's not acceptable in my opinion." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Commission said Microsoft had a 35-40 percent share of the work group server market in 1999 when the EU executive began to investigate the firm. Between 2001 and 2003 that grew to 60 percent and now Microsoft has 70 to 75 percent of the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Work group servers connect to Windows desktop computers, and the Commission found Microsoft products work far more smoothly than the servers of competitors, giving Microsoft an edge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The edge exists only because Microsoft refuses to share information with competitors, the Commission has held. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Although Microsoft said it is now willing to share the information, the Commission said in March Microsoft wants to charge too much for it and warned that it could face further fines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft says that the interconnect information contains valuable intellectual property making the charges reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It has also challenged the Commission's original 2004 decision and both sides are awaiting a decision by the Court of First Instance in that case. Kroes said she hopes the court will rule this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Reporting by David Lawsky; Editing by David Cowell; Reuters messaging david.lawsky.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail david.lawsky@reuters.com; +322-287-6811.

&lt;p&gt;STAR CITY, Russia (Reuters) - Former Microsoft software guru Charles Simonyi said on Thursday he was more nervous about public appearances than blasting off for a trip to the International Space Station aboard a Russian rocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simonyi, a U.S. billionaire who helped develop Microsoft's Word and Excel applications, will take off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on April 7 with Russian cosmonauts Fyodor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov as part of a six-month mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am nervous about public appearances and press conferences but I think that about the flight I am not nervous at all," Simonyi told reporters at Star City, a Soviet-era training base for cosmonauts near Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's perfectly safe and with the excellent crew I have been training with, I have no problems about the flight itself," said Simonyi who paid Space Adventures travel agency about $25 million for the 11-day space trip and months of intensive physical, theoretical and Russian-language training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After joining a start-up company called Microsoft in 1981, Hungarian-born Simonyi made a fortune developing some of Microsoft's most profitable applications. He now heads his own software firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Life aboard the station...(is) the result of a long road each of us has walked," Kotov said. "(Simonyi) is a fully fledged member of the crew and we can rely on him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cosmonauts, who will carry out medical and scientific research, will take with them photographs and mementos of home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Space ... is paradise, and in paradise you want to be with your family and friends," Yurchikhin said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L)
has hired Eric Capp from JP Morgan (JPM.N) as a managing
director and head of its leveraged capital markets team, a
spokeswoman for the British bank said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The team covers both high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.
The leveraged loan market has seen huge growth in recent years
as private equity firms have taken aim at ever bigger targets
and as ever more investors have been drawn to the high returns
and relative stability of the asset class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spokeswoman said Capp would take up his new position in
mid-June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capp was previously head of European high-yield capital
markets at JP Morgan.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts throughout, adds details)

 March 22 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK.L) and
Anglo-Swedish drug maker AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) to
"underweight" from "neutral", saying both companies will be
hurt by the patent expiries of their key drugs.

 The brokerage upgraded Danish pharmaceuticals group Novo
Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) , however, saying unlike most big cap pharma
companies with looming patent expiries, it expects Novo Nordisk
to have sustained cash flow from its current business though
the next decade.

 "Novo Nordisk is one of the few pharmaceutical companies
well placed to navigate the strategic gap that exists in the
pharma industry between patent expiries and the introduction of
innovation," the brokerage said in its research note.

 It raised its price target for Novo to 550 Danish crowns
from 470 Danish crowns and its rating to "overweight" from
"neutral".

 The brokerage said 2007 marks the beginning of a
particularly tough time for Glaxo's U.S. business as its six
blockbuster drugs, critical for its U.S. business, will lose
patent protection over the next six years.

 J.P. Morgan said even with healthy expectations from the
pipeline, Glaxo's earnings growth will be at the low end of the
large cap peer group with only Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) showing
substantially slower growth.

 The brokerage said AstraZeneca will be similarly hurt by
the inability of its pipeline to replace its three key
products, Seroquel, Nexium and Crestor.

 The Anglo-Swedish firm's operations are ex-growth with
little chance of a near-term recovery.

The brokerage cut its price target on AstraZeneca to 2,740
pence from 2,950 pence and on Glaxo to 1,380 pence from 1,425
pence.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The World Bank has told a consortium 
led by Exxon-Mobil Corp. to properly compensate farmers in 
southern Chad for land the U.S. company has acquired as it 
expands its search for oil in the Doba basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank's private-sector lender, the International Finance 
Corp., told Exxon to reassess its compensation plans after a 
independent report found the expansion of wells is affecting 
the livelihoods of families who live off the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon operates the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline development 
project, including Chevron Corp. and Malaysia's state-run 
Petronas, which the IFC helped to finance on condition that oil 
revenues would benefit the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview, Rashad Kaldany, the IFC's director for 
oil, gas and mining projects, said despite cash compensation by 
an Exxon affiliate, Esso Chad, families would be worse off in 
the long term if livelihoods were not restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have had extensive discussions with Esso and really 
urged them to take this very seriously and we have agreed on 
the principles," Kaldany told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are committed to doing things right, but getting to 
finalizing an action plan and disclosing it is something we are 
still working with them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaldany said the consortium had agreed to issue a 
corrective action plan within the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It will build on what they have done before, including 
cash compensation, but may include new approaches to either 
restore their livelihoods, or help them develop new livelihoods 
with training," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report, commissioned by Esso at the IFC's request, 
found the consortium underestimated its land requirements and, 
through incremental acquisitions, had exceeded original 
estimates by 65 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said exploration and drilling had fragmented cultivated 
land and left some areas unfit for farming, while villagers had 
abandoned growing cotton, a vital cash crop.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EXXON: AFFECTED PEOPLE BETTER OFF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the 1,640 families affected, about 480 lost use of 20 to 
50 percent of their land, while 430 lost half to all, the 
report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cash paid to farmers for land was used to improve homes, 
pay debts and buy cattle and farm equipment but was also wasted 
on alcohol, bride purchases and prostitution, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our aim is to ensure long-term positive impacts and this 
is why we have been urging Esso to reassess compensation, which 
they are willing to do," Kaldany said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an e-mailed response, Exxon-Mobil said it had been 
"developing and implementing mitigation plans to address issues 
identified" in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The project believes that the compensation and 
resettlement plan has generally worked well," it said, adding 
the study "shows in clear and quantifiable terms that the 
people affected are better off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ian Gary, a policy advisor for development group Oxfam who 
has closely followed the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project, 
praised the IFC for stepping in but said it acted too slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think the IFC pushed hard enough on Exxon and 
pushed as early as they should of," said Gary, who was part of 
aid and environmental groups briefed by the IFC this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pipeline project has long been a thorn in the side of 
the World Bank, which was criticized from the start for getting 
involved in oil projects that had done more harm than good in 
impoverished African countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz halted loans to Chad in 
2005 after the government made a grab for the oil revenues, by 
changing a law that ensured the petrodollars would go to 
projects that benefit the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, the bank has renegotiated the agreement with 
the government, which promised to set aside 70 percent of all 
budgetary resources in 2007 for pro-poor programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, updates with new Microsoft comment) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, March 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it found no evidence of a security breach on Bungie.net or its Xbox Live online video game network following reports of fraudulent behavior and theft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We want to reassure all of our 6 million Xbox Live members that we have looked into the situation and found no evidence of any compromise of the security of Bungie.net or our Live network," Microsoft said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's biggest software maker said there have been a few isolated incidents where malicious users have attempted to get personal information from unsuspecting users and to use that information to get access to the victim's Live accounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, maker of the Xbox 360 video game console and the popular "Halo" game franchise, said earlier Wednesday it was investigating the reports of fraud. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Security has been a major concern for Microsoft, whose operating system is a favorite target for hackers, and for online commerce sites such as eBay Inc.

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, March 21 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co.

&lt;p&gt;UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad canceled his visit to New York to address the U.N. Security Council because of delays in granting visas to his entourage, Tehran's U.N. ambassador said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahmadinejad had wanted to address the council before it votes on imposing new sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program. The meeting is expected to be held on Saturday, although it has not yet been officially scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No sooner was the announcement made than Iran and the United States entered into a spat on when and to whom visas had been issued. Tehran said the visas were issued too late and the State Department said completed applications were not received in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States issued visas in two batches on Friday at its embassy in Berne, Switzerland, but Iran's U.N. Ambassador Javad Zarif said that was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no time for the visas to be sent to Tehran in time for the president to be able to fly to New York," Zarif told Reuters. But he said Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, who received his visa early on Friday, would take a commercial flight to New York to address the council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Berne, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said some 38 visas had been issued early on Friday, including one for Ahmadinejad, and an additional 40 for the entourage late in the day once all the paper work had been completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Zarif said the later batch, which included air crew, was not issued until 5:45 p.m. local time, which did not leave enough time to get the passports back to Tehran in time for the president's plane to take off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, the State Department said the reasons for the cancellation were a ruse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rather, it would appear that he is unwilling to stand before the Council and take the heat for his continued defiance of the international community," said spokesman Tom Casey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey said the visas were issued late Friday afternoon "despite the fact that the completed applications for many of them were not received until this morning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at the United Nations, the American representative, Alejandro Wolff said, "I think this is all a pretext. The visas were issued in ample time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Tehran, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini was quoted on television as saying, "Due to the obvious negligence in issuing a visa for members of the Iranian delegation accompanying the president and the plane crew, American officials stopped the president from attending the Security Council's meeting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Edmund Blair in Tehran and Sue Pleming in Washington)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors, including pension funds and 
endowments, plan to put more money into hedge funds this year 
and expect to keep paying the loosely regulated portfolios' 
high fees, a poll released on Friday shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Investors polled by Goldman Sachs Prime Brokerage in early 
2007 said they expect to see a 24 percent growth in assets 
invested in hedge funds over the next year. While that is 
slightly less than in 2006, it is higher than it was at the end 
of 2003, Goldman said after polling 556 investor groups that 
put money into hedge funds directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assets in the hedge fund industry have more than doubled to 
roughly $1.9 trillion in the last three years, industry 
analysts have said, and investors tend to use the lightly 
regulated portfolios to help dampen volatility in portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedge funds differ from mutual funds because they can use 
trading techniques like selling securities short, or betting 
prices will fall, which can help hedge funds earn money in all 
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also charge performance fees on top of a management 
fee that is also charged by mutual funds. They are therefore 
considered to be very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However investors seem more willing than ever to pay the 
fees that often start with a 1 percent management fee and a 20 
percent performance fee. The survey found that 81 percent of 
the respondents said hedge fund fees will remain unchanged. In 
2006, 75 percent said they would stay unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which manages roughly $32.5 billion in hedge funds 
and ranks among the world's five biggest hedge fund managers 
said investors based in Europe expect the highest growth rate 
while investors based in Asia expect the lowest growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also the survey shows that investors increasingly want to 
put their money with the industry's biggest funds, with roughly 
37 percent of global hedge fund assets invested with funds that 
manage $10 billion or more. Funds that have $3 billion or less 
manage roughly 30 percent of the industry's assets, down from 
41 percent at the end of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The surprise exclusion of Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) from the list of underwriters for Blackstone Group's planned $4 billion IPO -- one of the year's most highly coveted deals -- has left many on Wall Street scratching their heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, in addition to being top underwriters, Goldman and JPMorgan happen to be two of Blackstone's biggest clients, routinely advising the private equity firm on multibillion dollar takeover deals or handling the debt sales which are crucial to its highly leveraged transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackstone, which last year did more than $101.7 billion in deals, excluding acquired debt, more than any other buyout firm, filed on Thursday to take about 10 percent of itself public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bragging rights for the offering, expected to price in under three months on the New York Stock Exchange, go to Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Citigroup (C.N), who were listed as the lead bookrunners. Merrill Lynch MER.N, Credit Suisse Group (CSGN.VX), Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE)also won coveted spots in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, JPMorgan and Blackstone are declining to comment on why the two banks were left out. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Lehman also declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that Goldman agreed to be an underwriter but disagreed with Blackstone over its hefty valuation, said Lawrence White, a professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, the deal is expected to value the entire company at $40 billion. Blackstone last year earned $2.27 billion, according to its filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAST FRICTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question is 'How come?' Is Blackstone unhappy? Did they get rubbed the wrong way? This sounds odd," White said. "This is a big deal. The first of the major private equity guys going public."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other observers have speculated that Goldman may be loathe to price Blackstone above its own valuation, seeing as the two are growing more similar in appearance. Blackstone has an MA advisory business, and manages a half dozen investment funds, including private equity and hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and JPMorgan also could have recused themselves because they were working with a rival private equity client on a similar offering, some analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there have also been some conflicts between Blackstone and the two banks at various times. One instance involved Blackstone rebelling against Goldman's bid to compete with it in some large deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's private equity arm, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, is expected to raise a $19-billion buyout fund, not far behind Blackstone's bid to raise $20 billion in what would be the largest buyout fund over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erick Maronak, head of research for growth funds at Victory NewBridge, a firm managing $60 billion in assets, speculated that the banks who did get on the underwriter list all have big balance sheets they could commit for Blackstone deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is rightly viewed as publicly traded hedge fund. They're fishing in the same oceans," said Erick Maronak, head of research for growth funds at Victory NewBridge, a firm managing $60 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very competitive and this will be a high profile deal. Whoever runs the books gets to crow about it," Maronak said. "There aren't too many deals where the negotiating powers are not in the hands of Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for JPMorgan, another close Blackstone client, some on Wall Street believe that friction between the two surfaced during Blackstone's $23 billion takeover of U.S. office landlord Equity Office Properties Trust -- at the time, the second-largest leveraged buyout ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was not involved in that deal, and later led a counter-offer by Vornado Realty Trust, which failed but led to Blackstone raising its bid. Sources say that it was Vornado that approached J.P. Morgan about a counter-bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could be the people at Blackstone are upset at JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs and therefore didn't include them," said veteran banking analyst Richard Bove of Punk Ziegel  Co. "It doesn't have significance for Goldman longer term. They don't win every deal, but they're in most offerings."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. will test a 
"watch-and-chat" feature next week on its ABC Family Channel 
Web site that lets groups of viewers watch TV shows on the 
Internet and chat about them at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney, whose ABC broadcast network was the first to offer 
free streaming videos of its prime-time shows on the Web, now 
hopes to build buzz around its ABC Family cable shows through 
the social networking feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC Family will test the feature on the season finale of 
its prime-time show "Wildfire" on Monday night. The streaming 
video of the show will go live on abcfamily.com an hour after 
it airs on cable, and will be available through April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The feature lets groups of up to 10 people set up 
"screening rooms" to watch the episode on laptops and write a 
running commentary that will appear on one side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each screening room host can pause, rewind and fast-forward 
video while they watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Lee, president of ABC Family Channel, said "Wildfire" 
was chosen for the test because its audience of predominantly 
14- to 28-year-old females is "the most passionate audience of 
any show on the network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a new generation here .... They are changing the 
way people watch TV or use other technology," Lee said. "When 
you link (social networking) to TV programming, it's almost 
like word of mouth on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The network will poll screening room attendees at the 
conclusion of the test to gauge response, Lee said. If the 
feature is well received, the network will extend it to other 
shows as early as this summer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The feature was developed by Lycos Inc., a subsidiary of 
Korea's Daum Communications Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Disney test is the first use of watch-and-chat outside 
of Lycos' multiuser video on demand service, cinema.lycos.com, 
and its content playlist creator, lycos.mix.com, Lycos Chief 
Operating Officer Brian Kalinowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The application feeds on a growing tendency of young 
audiences toward "spending, day-to-day, more time in their 
online social circles than in their physical social circles," 
Kalinowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You may be more apt to join me in a chat while we are 
watching this than if I send you a link saying, 'Watch this.' 
It extends word-of-mouth ability," Kalinowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has had success building audiences for its cable 
content -- such as its Disney Channel blockbuster "High School 
Musical" -- with multi-platform marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   (Adds details of Pfizer generic launch)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Mylan Laboratories Inc.
MYL.N said on Friday it launched generic versions of Pfizer
Inc.'s (PFE.N) blockbuster Norvasc blood-pressure drug, a day
after a federal court ruled a Pfizer patent was invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In response, Pfizer said its plans to launch its own
generic version of the drug, which had U.S. sales of about $2.7
billion last year and is Pfizer's second-biggest selling
product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mylan said it has triggered a 180-day period for which it
will have exclusive rights to sell its generic forms of Norvasc
in the United States. Mylan said it launched three dosage forms
of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it will continue to pursue all available legal
remedies to protect the market for Norvasc through a six-month
pediatric exclusivity period that expires in September 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Norvasc will also remain on the market, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on
Thursday reversed a lower court patent decision that favored
Pfizer in its bid to prevent Canadian drugmaker Apotex Inc.
from launching a generic form of Norvasc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apotex said on Thursday that no company would have
exclusivity over Norvasc generics -- putting it in conflict
with Mylan's position on Friday. The Canadian company said on
Thursday it expects to launch the product "in the very near
future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apotex did not immediately return calls for comment on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generic drugmakers can gain a cash infusion from such
exclusivity periods, which federal lawmakers created as an
incentive for companies to challenge weak patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mylan in October 2005 won final U.S. approval for its
generic Norvasc, but held off launching its product as it
continued to wage its own patent battle with Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch analyst Gregg Gilbert said in a research note
on Thursday that, while Mylan had final approval, Apotex was
among several generic drugmakers that have only tentative
approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mylan shares closed down 25 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$20.30 on the New York Stock Exchange, after jumping 5 percent
on Thursday. Pfizer shares fell 13 cents to $25.66.

&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas, March 23 (Reuters) - Los Angeles wholesale
gasoline prices jumped 25.75 cents on Friday after Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM.N) cut production at its 150,000 barrel per day
(bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery to minimum output following a
Thursday sulfur recovery unit shutdown, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A refinery spokeswoman declined to says how many barrels
per day of crude the refinery was processing, but said Exxon
would be able to meet its contractual obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wholesale gasoline traded as high 53 cents per gallon over
NYMEX RBOB gasoline on Friday in Los Angeles, traders said. On
Thursday, gasoline finished trade at 27.25 cents over the
NYMEX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SRU that shut on Thursday was restarted 12 days ago. A
second SRU at the refinery is shut as part of a two-month
overhaul of several refinery units that began in February.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, March 23 (Reuters) - Whether Exxon Mobil Corp.
(XOM.N) decides to maintain operations in Venezuela after the
nationalization of its heavy oil project "depends on them," the
OPEC nation's oil minister told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez said Exxon had not told
authorities whether it would stay on in Venezuela after state
oil company PDVSA takes control of four Orinoco heavy crude
projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is not known -- it depends on them," Ramirez said when
asked if the company would pull out, adding he had received no
communication on the issue from the Texas oil giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in February decreed the
nationalization of four extra-heavy oil projects operating in
the Orinoco basin as part of his drive to give the government
greater control over the country's natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decree requires PDVSA to hold a majority stake in the
four projects, but outside investors can stay on as minority
partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, one of the world's largest companies, is a
partner with BP (BP.L) and state oil company PDVSA in the Cerro
Negro heavy oil project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company recently said it still had not decided whether
to take a stake in the project following the nationalization. It
is expected to take a hard line in the negotiations and has
urged the Chavez government to respect its contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The four extra-heavy oil projects, with an estimated value
of more than $30 billion, turn tar-like Orinoco oil into around
600,000 barrels per day (bpd) of lighter synthetic oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other partners in the Orinoco Projects include Chevron Corp.
(CVX.N), Conoco Phillips (COP.N), France's Total (TOTF.PA) and
Norway's Statoil ASA (STL.OL).

&lt;p&gt;Iran said Washington had so far failed to give a visa to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad so he could address the U.N.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said it believes it exceeded

day refinery in Torrance, California, as a response to flaring on Thursday,
according to a report filed with state regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

company said emissions of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide were visible,
and it believes it exceeded mandated levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Torrance refinery continues to operate at reduced rates due to

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little
changed on Friday before the release of data that could shed
light on the housing outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a $4 billion initial public offering by private equity
firm Blackstone Group offered the market some support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude oil prices rose, lifting energy stocks, after news

Britain said the incident occurred in Iraqi waters. For more

(PFE.N) in its bid to prevent Canadian drugmaker Apotex Inc. from launching a generic form of its blockbuster Norvasc blood-pressure drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The ruling reversed a decision made by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The appeals court said the lower court "erred" when it disagreed with Apotex and when it found the discovery process for the patent was a unique process undertaken by Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Norvasc is Pfizer's second-biggest product, with global sales last year of $4.87 billion. Wall Street has been expecting the drug to face generic competition later this year in the United States, where the drug's sales were $2.5 billion in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of U.S. drugmaker Mylan Laboratories Inc. MYL.N, which in October 2005 won approval to sell generic forms of Norvasc in the United States, rose as much as 6.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mylan won final U.S. approval for three dosage strengths of generic Norvasc, but held off launching the copycats as it continued to wage its own patent battle with Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer last month won the federal patent case in Pennsylvania against Mylan, in a decision that blocked Mylan from launching its generics until September. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Judge Terrence McVerry, of the Western District of Pennsylvania, had upheld Pfizer's patent covering the active ingredient in Norvasc. He found the patent is valid, enforceable and would be infringed by Mylan's product, Pfizer said then. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mylan, which appealed the ruling, could have faced heavy damages if it started selling its product and then lost the patent trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mylan on Thursday could not immediately be reached for comment and it was not clear whether or how the Apotex ruling would affect Mylan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Apotex and Pfizer representatives were also not immediately available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mylan shares were up $1.05, or 5.4 percent, at $20.59 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, where they earlier rose as high as $20.80. Pfizer shares were off 18 cents, or less than 1 percent, at $25.67. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, Ransdell Pierson and Martha Graybow, editing by Deborah Cohen; Reuters Messaging: Lewis.Krauskopf.reuters.com@reuters.net; lewis.krauskopf@reuters.com; 646-223-6082)) Keywords: PFIZER APOTEX/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran said on Friday the United States had so far failed to give a visa to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad so he could address the U.N. Security Council in New York when it meets to vote on new sanctions against Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Council members are due to meet on Friday to review a revised draft of a U.N. resolution to impose additional measures on Iran for its refusal to halt uranium enrichment, a process the West says Iran is using to build atomic bombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vote could take place on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Iranian Foreign Ministry official Abbas Araghchi, in a faxed statement, "expressed his regret over the lack of cooperation and making barriers for issuing a visa for Iran's president and his delegation by the American government".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department said on Monday it had approved the visa for Ahmadinejad. He insists Iran's plans are purely peaceful and has said Tehran will not reverse course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite passing all the bureaucratic stages and despite all the promises American officials gave through the media for issuing the visa for the Iranian presidential delegation, until this moment, the visas of Iran's president and his accompanying delegation have not been issued," Araghchi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This behavior is against consulate rules of the United Nations and it is a prejudiced policy toward Iran's peaceful atomic program," he was quoted as saying in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revised draft to be reviewed on Friday, and which was obtained by Reuters, rejects nearly all the amendments South Africa had proposed that would have stripped the text of most provisions on weapons and financial bans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the negotiators provided a requested explanation of why each name on a list of 28 Iranian individuals, companies and institutions should be subject to an assets freeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, South Africa's ambassador, Dumisani Kumalo, this month's council president, expressed dismay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new text is a follow-up to one adopted in December banning trade in sensitive nuclear materials and ballistic missiles as well as freezing assets of individuals and institutions associated with atomic programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian officials have brushed off the impact of the existing sanctions and any new penalties imposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Liberty Media Holding Corp.'s Starz 
Entertainment cable network said on Thursday it is suing a unit 
of Walt Disney Co. for allowing other movie download services 
to sell titles while they were exclusively licensed to Starz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
was brought by Starz against Disney's Buena Vista Television, 
which this year signed deals to sell movies on Apple Inc.'s 
iTunes online store and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s new movie 
download site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the lawsuit, Disney is barred under a 2005 
licensing agreement with Starz from selling some of its films, 
such as the blockbuster "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's 
Chest," for transmission over the Internet before and during a 
period of exclusivity agreed upon for Starz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Starz has paid over $1 billion for the exclusive rights to 
Disney films since 1993, according to the lawsuit. It also has 
the right to offer the films on its subscription Internet 
download service, Vongo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our issue is that the contract has a clear prohibition 
from them doing this and we gave them notice, had a number of 
exchanges and had meetings and they denied our request for 
relief," Starz Entertainment Chairman and Chief Executive 
Robert Clasen told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are absolutely adamant in protecting our contractual 
rights and licenses," Clasen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement, Buena Vista Television said it believes 
that "Starz misreads its agreement ... and its claim is without 
merit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "BTV retained and has the right to sell its motion pictures 
in a wide range of mediums," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger has named technology, 
including the electronic distribution of content, as one of the 
company's business priorities as its expands in the global 
marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney was the first major Hollywood studio to offer its TV 
shows and movies for sale through Apple's iTunes. Disney and 
the other major studios struck deals to sell movies on the 
newly launched walmart.com last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said in December 
that Disney expects to reap $25 million from movie sales on 
iTunes the first year of the offering, which began in September 
of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clasen said the lawsuit may seek as damages all revenue 
collected by Disney, Apple and Wal-Mart for the disputed movie 
sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Disney rose 0.4 percent, or 14 cents per share, 
to $35.30 at mid-afternoon. Shares of Liberty Media were down 
0.2 percent, or 25 cents per share, at $110.11 on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Bill Berkrot &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - Doctors and investors will scour the wreckage of Pfizer Inc.'s spectacularly failed cholesterol medicine for clues that might exonerate similar drugs in development by other companies when clinical trial data are unveiled at one of the year's major heart meetings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tens of thousands of heart doctors and researchers will gather in New Orleans as the convention center that was a scene of horrors during Hurricane Katrina hosts the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting from March 24-27 at which the latest research in medicines and devices to treat heart disease and its causes will be presented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One trial called COURAGE has heightened anxiety levels among investors in companies that rely on the lucrative coronary stent business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The large, long-term study of stable angina patients with coronary artery disease aims to determine if increasingly used angioplasty and stenting plus intensive medical therapy provides any benefit over the medicinal therapy alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts figure the patient population in the study represents roughly 40 percent of those receiving stents in the United States and Europe, so the results could impact stent usage and medical practice going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer's (PFE.N) torcetrapib, the most expensive experimental drug failure in history, will be the subject of three studies, although not the halted trial that ended development of the drug in December due to unacceptably high death rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Still, the data to be presented are expected to shed light on whether the dangers of torcetrapib are specific to that compound or could indicate problems with the entire class known as CETP inhibitors designed to raise levels of HDL -- the so-called good cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Several drugmakers, including Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX), will be looking for answers from torcetrapib trials as they decide whether to push ahead with their own CETP drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The results will be pretty interesting. They won't do much for torcetrapib but they will help people understand where to go next in heart disease," Pfizer research and development chief John LaMattina said at a recent conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "There will still be a lot of questions that need answering," he said. "Is it a class effect? Is HDL overrated?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The importance of and various approaches to raising HDL in treating or preventing heart disease will be a hot topic among cardiologists and researchers at the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Clinical studies of already marketed drugs that have been dogged by safety concerns, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ.N) heart failure medicine Natrecor, will be presented with the potential to to allay such fears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Some companies, such as AtheroGenics Inc. AGIX.O and CV Therapeutics Inc. CVTX.O have already tipped Wall Street that their drugs failed to meet primary goals of closely watched trials, sending their share prices plunging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But the devil is in the details and in each case the companies suggested that full data to be presented in New Orleans would contain positive news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The AtheroGenics trial was a high stakes late-stage study of an arterial plaque reduction drug known as AGI-1067 that was tipped to become a multibillion-dollar medicine if it achieved an extremely difficult goal of significantly reducing major adverse events such as death, heart attack and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said it achieved secondary goals, and just how strong the data are could determine whether AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) maintains its partnership on the drug and by how much AtheroGenics shares might recover from a 60 percent swoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe the ACC meeting data will provide some encouraging findings on the drug's effect," said Needham analyst Mark Monane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In addition to the COURAGE stent trial, the tiny mesh tubes used to prop open cleared arteries will be focus of several other studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Abbott Laboratories Inc. (ABT.N) has a trio of stent studies being presented at ACC, including the pivotal trial that will likely determine if the Xience drug coated stent it acquired from Guidant Corp. will gain U.S. approval. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Bill Berkrot, editing by Richard Chang; Reuters Messaging: bill.berkrot.reuters.com@reuters.net phone 646 223-6030)) Keywords: HEART MEETING  Keywords: HEART MEETING  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, March 23 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Chemical has
completed the expansion of its steam cracker in Singapore by
75,000 tonnes per year (tpy) to more than 900,000 tpy, later
than its original plan by end-2006, the firm said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The expansion means about 20,000 tonnes of additional
naphtha consumption a month, helping lift the Asian
petrochemical feedstock market where a series of expansions and
new units set up this year by Northeast Asian crackers would
raise naphtha demand by near 500,000 tonnes a month, traders
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For a list of Asian ethylene expansion: [ID:nSIN316036])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naphtha's premium against Brent crude hit a record-high of
$210 a tonne early last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We already have fed feedstock into the expanded plant,
receiving commercial products of ethylene," said an official at
Exxon Mobil Asia Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the official said its second cracking complex plan in
Singapore was undergoing a feasibility study, after an
engineering and design contract was awarded in mid-2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said such expansions would use naphtha to make
petrochemical building blocks to meet growing Asian demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) was also building a new
petrochemical complex in Singapore by the end of the decade,
putting the size of the ethylene cracker at 800,000 tpy.
[ID:nSP20110]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ethylene is a basic building block for a variety of
chemicals and plastics, such as polyethylene, which is used in
applications such as plastic containers and bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil Chemical, an affiliate of global major Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM.N), operates petrochemical manufacturing
and/or marketing operations in more than 150 countries around
the world. The Singapore Chemical Plant, ExxonMobil Chemical's
single largest investment in the world, started up in 2001.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors, including pension funds and 
endowments, plan to put more money into hedge funds this year 
and expect to keep paying the loosely regulated portfolios' 
high fees, a poll released on Friday shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Investors polled by Goldman Sachs Prime Brokerage in early 
2007 said they expect to see a 24 percent growth in assets 
invested in hedge funds over the next year. While that is 
slightly less than in 2006, it is higher than it was at the end 
of 2003, Goldman said after polling 556 investor groups that 
put money into hedge funds directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assets in the hedge fund industry have more than doubled to 
roughly $1.9 trillion in the last three years, industry 
analysts have said, and investors tend to use the lightly 
regulated portfolios to help dampen volatility in portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedge funds differ from mutual funds because they can use 
trading techniques like selling securities short, or betting 
prices will fall, which can help hedge funds earn money in all 
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also charge performance fees on top of a management 
fee that is also charged by mutual funds. They are therefore 
considered to be very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However investors seem more willing than ever to pay the 
fees that often start with a 1 percent management fee and a 20 
percent performance fee. The survey found that 81 percent of 
the respondents said hedge fund fees will remain unchanged. In 
2006, 75 percent said they would stay unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which manages roughly $32.5 billion in hedge funds 
and ranks among the world's five biggest hedge fund managers 
said investors based in Europe expect the highest growth rate 
while investors based in Asia expect the lowest growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also the survey shows that investors increasingly want to 
put their money with the industry's biggest funds, with roughly 
37 percent of global hedge fund assets invested with funds that 
manage $10 billion or more. Funds that have $3 billion or less 
manage roughly 30 percent of the industry's assets, down from 
41 percent at the end of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad cancelled his visit to New York to address the U.N. Security Council because of delays in granting visas to his entourage, Tehran's U.N. ambassador said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahmadinejad had wanted to address the council before it votes on imposing new sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program. The meeting is expected to be held on Saturday, although it has not yet been officially scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No sooner was the announcement made than Iran and the United States entered into a spat on when and to whom visas had been issued. Tehran said the visas were issued too late and the U.S. State Department said completed applications were not received in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States issued visas in two batches on Friday at its embassy in Berne, Switzerland, but Iran's U.N. Ambassador Javad Zarif said that was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no time for the visas to be sent to Tehran in time for the president to be able to fly to New York," Zarif told Reuters. But he said Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, who received his visa early on Friday, would take a commercial flight to New York to address the council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Berne, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said some 38 visas had been issued early on Friday, including one for Ahmadinejad, and an additional 40 for the entourage late in the day once all the paper work had been completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Zarif said the later batch, which included air crew, was not issued until 5:45 p.m. local time, which did not leave enough time to get the passports back to Tehran in time for the president's plane to take off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, the U.S. State Department said the reasons for the cancellation were a ruse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rather, it would appear that he is unwilling to stand before the Council and take the heat for his continued defiance of the international community," said spokesman Tom Casey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey said the visas were issued late Friday afternoon "despite the fact that the completed applications for many of them were not received until this morning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at the United Nations, the American representative, Alejandro Wolff said, "I think this is all a pretext. The visas were issued in ample time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Tehran, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini was quoted on television as saying, "Due to the obvious negligence in issuing a visa for members of the Iranian delegation accompanying the president and the plane crew, American officials stopped the president from attending the Security Council's meeting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Edmund Blair in Tehran and Sue Pleming in Washington)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. will test a 
"watch-and-chat" feature next week on its ABC Family Channel 
Web site that lets groups of viewers watch TV shows on the 
Internet and chat about them at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney, whose ABC broadcast network was the first to offer 
free streaming videos of its prime-time shows on the Web, now 
hopes to build buzz around its ABC Family cable shows through 
the social networking feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC Family will test the feature on the season finale of 
its prime-time show "Wildfire" on Monday night. The streaming 
video of the show will go live on abcfamily.com an hour after 
it airs on cable, and will be available through April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The feature lets groups of up to 10 people set up 
"screening rooms" to watch the episode on laptops and write a 
running commentary that will appear on one side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each screening room host can pause, rewind and fast-forward 
video while they watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Lee, president of ABC Family Channel, said "Wildfire" 
was chosen for the test because its audience of predominantly 
14- to 28-year-old females is "the most passionate audience of 
any show on the network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a new generation here .... They are changing the 
way people watch TV or use other technology," Lee said. "When 
you link (social networking) to TV programming, it's almost 
like word of mouth on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The network will poll screening room attendees at the 
conclusion of the test to gauge response, Lee said. If the 
feature is well received, the network will extend it to other 
shows as early as this summer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The feature was developed by Lycos Inc., a subsidiary of 
Korea's Daum Communications Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Disney test is the first use of watch-and-chat outside 
of Lycos' multiuser video on demand service, cinema.lycos.com, 
and its content playlist creator, lycos.mix.com, Lycos Chief 
Operating Officer Brian Kalinowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The application feeds on a growing tendency of young 
audiences toward "spending, day-to-day, more time in their 
online social circles than in their physical social circles," 
Kalinowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You may be more apt to join me in a chat while we are 
watching this than if I send you a link saying, 'Watch this.' 
It extends word-of-mouth ability," Kalinowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has had success building audiences for its cable 
content -- such as its Disney Channel blockbuster "High School 
Musical" -- with multi-platform marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors, including pension funds and 
endowments, plan to put more money into hedge funds this year 
and expect to keep paying the loosely regulated portfolios' 
high fees, a poll released on Friday shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Investors polled by Goldman Sachs Prime Brokerage in early 
2007 said they expect to see a 24 percent growth in assets 
invested in hedge funds over the next year. While that is 
slightly less than in 2006, it is higher than it was at the end 
of 2003, Goldman said after polling 556 investor groups that 
put money into hedge funds directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assets in the hedge fund industry have more than doubled to 
roughly $1.9 trillion in the last three years, industry 
analysts have said, and investors tend to use the lightly 
regulated portfolios to help dampen volatility in portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedge funds differ from mutual funds because they can use 
trading techniques like selling securities short, or betting 
prices will fall, which can help hedge funds earn money in all 
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also charge performance fees on top of a management 
fee that is also charged by mutual funds. They are therefore 
considered to be very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However investors seem more willing than ever to pay the 
fees that often start with a 1 percent management fee and a 20 
percent performance fee. The survey found that 81 percent of 
the respondents said hedge fund fees will remain unchanged. In 
2006, 75 percent said they would stay unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which manages roughly $32.5 billion in hedge funds 
and ranks among the world's five biggest hedge fund managers 
said investors based in Europe expect the highest growth rate 
while investors based in Asia expect the lowest growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also the survey shows that investors increasingly want to 
put their money with the industry's biggest funds, with roughly 
37 percent of global hedge fund assets invested with funds that 
manage $10 billion or more. Funds that have $3 billion or less 
manage roughly 30 percent of the industry's assets, down from 
41 percent at the end of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - The non-profit group that owns rights to much of the Linux operating system says it will seek to undermine a controversial deal between Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) and Novell Inc. NOVL.O through a new software licensing agreement to be unveiled on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies announced a business partnership in November that included a cross-patent protection agreement that some critics say implies Microsoft has legal rights to Linux, the cooperatively developed software that is gaining ground with corporate users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to make sure such deals don't make a mockery of the goals of free software," Peter Brown, executive director of the Free Software Foundation, said in an interview with Reuters late on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free software, which is also known as open-source software, refers to computer programs that are available to the general public to be used, revised and shared. Proeducts from companies like Microsoft are considered proprietary and their code generally cannot be revised and shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While open-source software is free, it also has become big business. An industry of consultants and other services supports it, and corporations contribute heavily to open-source development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux runs on more than 20 percent of global server computers, compared with well over 60 percent of such powerful machines running Windows, according to recent Gartner data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Novell say their deal lets powerful server computers running Windows and Linux systems communicate better. They announced the deal in November as part of a broad sales, marketing and development partnership that brought Novell $348 million in upfront payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the free software community attacked the patent deal, particularly an agreement by Microsoft not to sue Novell's Linux customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say its existence implies that Microsoft holds patents it could one day claim are being infringed upon by Linux users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Free Software Foundation will seek to undermine the Microsoft-Novell patent deal by incorporating language that will accomplish that goal into the new license agreement that will cover rights to much of the code in Linux, Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown declined to discuss details of the changes in advance of publication of a draft of the agreement on Wednesday, though he said the foundation was committed to preventing Microsoft from claiming rights to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They found a way to effectively proprietize free software by offering patent promises to Novell," Brown said. "Whenever a new method comes along to effectively turn free software into proprietary software, we will adjust the license."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation will seek public comments on the draft for 60 days before finalizing the new license agreement, which will go into effect from June 26. It will only apply to upgrades to Linux operating system code controlled by the foundation that are made from that date, Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novell will be able to continue to distribute its current Linux products without violating the new license. But financial analysts have said that it will need to upgrade that software to remain competitive with rivals such as Red Hat Inc. (RHT.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novell spokesman Bruce Lowry declined to comment on the foundation's plan, saying he hadn't seen its draft. Microsoft also declined to comment before seeing the draft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux is distributed under the terms of a license that was written in 1991, the General Public License version 2, or GPLv2. The new license will be known as GPLv3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novell and Red Hat make money selling Linux bundled with service contracts that include technical support along with regular maintenance and upgrades to their software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Snoop Dogg, who has been denied a visa 
to enter Britain on a European tour, is seeking to have the 
decision overturned, a spokeswoman said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The 35-year old, arrested during a disturbance at London's 
Heathrow airport last year, had been due to perform with fellow 
rapper Sean "Diddy" Combs, at Wembley Arena in London on 
Tuesday, followed by gigs in Cardiff, Manchester, Glasgow, and 
Nottingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Snoop still sincerely hopes that the British Government 
will reconsider their decision and UK shows will be allowed to 
go on as planned," his spokeswoman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Many routes are being explored to the prime minister to 
have the decision reversed," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's Home Office said it would not comment on 
individual cases, but added that the government had the power 
to refuse entrance to individuals whose presence in the country 
would "not be conducive to the public good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dogg was previously prevented from entering Britain in May, 
2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not the first problem the rapper has encountered on 
his European tour. Earlier this month, Stockholm police 
arrested him and a woman in her early 20s for suspected 
narcotics use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, had been 
performing concerts with Combs, once his bitter rival in a 
notorious feud between the east and west coast U.S. hip-hop 
scenes in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They feel strongly that the uniting message of the One 
Love Peace Tour will need to be shared with fans no matter what 
and discussions are underway with production teams so that 
Snoop can still be involved in the show," his spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments from the company, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, March 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Monday that it sold more than 20 million Windows Vista licenses in the first month since the operating system's general debut on Jan. 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's biggest software maker said the pace of Vista adoption is at more than twice the rate of its predecessor, Windows XP, which had sold 17 million licenses after its first two months of release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's a little bit better than what we were expecting," said Bill Mannion, a director in the Windows marketing group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The numbers released by Microsoft follow mixed messages from the company about the pace of adoption for Windows Vista, the company's first major operating system upgrade in more than five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Prior to Vista's general release, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer had predicted that consumers would move to Vista faster than past Windows upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    However, several weeks after the release, Ballmer tempered expectations by saying analysts' forecasts for revenue from Windows Vista in fiscal 2008 -- Microsoft's next business year starting in July -- were "overly aggressive." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft said it was surprised by how many Vista customers were choosing to buy the premium, or more expensive, versions of Vista. The sales figures represent licenses sold to computer manufacturers, copies of upgrades and boxed software sold to retailers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Also, more retailers were stocking computers loaded with the premium versions of the operating system, which comes with the "Media Center" digital entertainment system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Windows franchise is the centerpiece of Microsoft's business, because the company makes more than 75 cents in operating profit for every dollar of sales. The cash flow generated by Windows allows Microsoft to make investments in new businesses like digital music players and online services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Windows operating systems run on more than 95 percent of the world's computers and represent the company's biggest profit driver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft stock was down 19 cents at $27.83 in afternoon Nasdaq trading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi, editing by Maureen Bavdek; Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 206 652 2326)) Keywords: MICROSOFT VISTA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (New throughout, change dateline, previous NEW YORK) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, March 26 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) on Monday said it has developed a tiny chip capable of transmitting an entire high-definition movie in a single second, a breakthrough that could make computers faster and more energy efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The chip was made using existing production methods and works by converting electrical signals to laser light, allowing it to transmit 160 gigabits of data per second, enough to handle telephone traffic for all of New York City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have worked out a way to ship almost inconceivable quantities of data at extremely low power," said Bernie Meyerson, chief technologist for International Business Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The chip is not expected to be used for entertainment or telephone networks anytime soon but could find its way into the powerful processors that run server computers in three to five years, Meyerson said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The chip also promises energy savings since it uses just 2.5 watts of power, about one-third the amount used by a night light, and covers only 17 square millimeters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The amount of data you can generate on a chip is skyrocketing with the advances in the architecture and the technology itself," Meyerson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "You are being gated not necessarily by your ability to generate data but in your ability to move the data on and off the chip," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Scott Hillis, San Francisco Newsroom, e-mail: scott.hillis@reuters.com, +1 415 677 2505; editing by Jane Baird)) Keywords: IBM CHIP/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc.'s abandoned experimental heart drug, torcetrapib, failed to arrest clogging of arteries and was linked to a jump in blood pressure and serious cardiac events, even as it sharply raised "good" HDL cholesterol in a trio of clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results, described on Monday at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) scientific meeting in New Orleans, suggest the dangers of torcetrapib outweigh its ability to raise HDL levels by more than 60 percent over Lipitor alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trials raised stronger doubts about the future of similar drugs being developed by other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in December ended the most expensive clinical drug development program in history after a different large study showed the drug raised the risk of death among heart patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had hoped that torcetrapib would reduce or at least halt progression of plaque within coronary arteries and within the main artery to the brain. The drug is designed to boost HDL, the "good" form of cholesterol that removes "bad" LDL cholesterol from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the studies tested it in combination with Pfizer's widely used LDL-lowering drug Lipitor versus Lipitor alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Torcetrapib's overall performance widely missed the mark, said Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic who led the coronary artery study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether this failure represents a problem unique to torcetrapib or suggests a lack of efficacy for the entire class of similar drugs remains to be determined," Nissen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings demonstrate the great difficulty in developing therapies to interrupt the atherosclerosis process," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO BENEFICIAL EFFECTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been widely speculated that a demonstration of the drug's ability to slow or halt progression of artery-clogging plaque might have been a potential indication of the viability of the entire class of the drugs called CETP inhibitors that are designed to raise HDL levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all three studies presented Monday, however, torcetrapib showed no beneficial effects on plaque clogging the arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two studies of the drug's effect on the carotid artery -- the main conduit of blood to the brain -- there was actually some worsening of the disease in the torcetrapib group, while the Lipitor-only group had some plaque regression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a near doubling of adverse cardiac events with torcetrapib in the carotid studies, and all three trials saw a jump in blood pressure with torcetrapib, often by significant amounts, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure is itself a major risk factor for heart attacks and strokes, although many doctors have expressed skepticism that the blood pressure increase seen in many torcetrapib trials could account for the unacceptably high death rate in the study that scuttled the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAPING HOLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer spent an estimated $800 million on late-stage testing of torcetrapib with the hope that it would eventually replace its $13 billion-a-year cash cow, Lipitor, a member of the statin class of drugs that is expected to go off patent as soon as 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had been planning to pair torcetrapib with Lipitor for a potent cholesterol therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Torcetrapib's sensational failure blew a gaping hole in Pfizer's developmental pipeline and left investors and other drugmakers to wonder whether the entire class should be abandoned or the deadly effects seen in the earlier study were specific to torcetrapib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roche Holding AG and partner Japan Tobacco Inc., as well as Merck  Co., are close to having to decide whether to push forward into expensive final-stage clinical testing of their own CETP inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many people are trying to figure out how do we progress to the next stage -- or is this the end -- and it's really not clear, but it's not very encouraging at this point," said Dr. Christopher Cannon, a prominent cardiologist from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nissen, the outgoing ACC president, said that clinical work on other CETP inhibitors should continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this point obviously the drug is dead, but my view is we can't slam the door on the class," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world's No. 2 computer services company, will offer technology to help process mortgage applications, automating the complexities of collecting documents to complete loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, which will base the new business in Charlotte, North Carolina, will sell software, hardware and consulting services to large lenders that will use them in their own computer centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new business will also offer a mortgage processing service where it will take full responsibility for processing a loan after the application is completed, collecting and reviewing all paperwork that an underwriter needs before deciding whether to make a loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing a mortgage generally takes at least a month as lenders gather myriad documents ranging from original loan applications to real estate appraisals, credit reports and flood certifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's products use digital imaging, optical character recognition and other computer technologies to pull those records into one package that underwriters can review when deciding whether to approve loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit will also offer smaller lenders the option of running those products off of computers in IBM's own data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM will also offer outsourced loan processing services, where its own employees will handle the processing of a mortgage from the time a loan application is completed until all the necessary documents are compiled into a package that is ready for consideration by an underwriter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Christopher Kaufman in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, researcher comment, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Bill Berkrot &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW ORLEANS, March 26 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE.N) abandoned heart drug torcetrapib failed to show any benefit in halting the build-up of plaque in the main artery that controls blood flow to the brain and significantly raised blood pressure, according to a pair of studies of patients with high cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    While the drug that was designed to significantly boost levels of HDL, or good cholesterol, did just that, researchers found that the experimental medicine not only failed to show any reduction of plaque clogging the carotid artery, but that the disease had progressed while patients were on torcetrapib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    There were also almost double the number of serious adverse cardiac events among patients taking torcetrapib in the studies presented at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in New Orleans on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer in December halted development of torcetrapib after a different large study showed it raised the risk of death among heart patients taking it, ending the most expensive clinical drug development program in history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The studies presented on Monday tested a combination of torcetrapib and Pfizer's top-selling Lipitor -- a member of the statin class of drugs that lower levels of bad LDL cholesterol &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- versus Lipitor alone. -- versus Lipitor alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Researchers actually found some plaque regression in the Lipitor-only patients, suggesting that the dangers of torcetrapib far outweigh its ability to raise HDL levels more than 60 percent over Lipitor alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It has been widely speculated that a demonstration of plaque regression or halting of plaque progression by torcetrapib might bode well for other experimental medicines from the same class called CETP inhibitors being developed by other drugmakers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It is not known whether the high death rate seen in the torcetrapib trial that was halted in December and the safety issues raised with these other studies represents a problem specific to that drug or dangers that could scuttle the entire class of CETP medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The addition of torcetrapib to statin therapy has no benefit at all on atherosclerosis progression, but it remains to be investigated whether this is a consequence of the molecule torcetrapib or whether the concept of CETP inhibition is a flawed hypothesis," Dr. John Kastelein, lead investigator of the studies, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Kim Dixon) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Maureen Bavdek; Reuters Messaging: bill.berkrot.reuters.com@reuters.net phone 646 303-6294)) Keywords: HEART TORCETRAPIB/CAROTID  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, March 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its quarterly outlook on Monday for eBay Inc. (EBAY.O), saying that gains in how much money the online auctioneer makes, on average, per auction listing, is powering further growth.  EBay's stock rose 59 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $32.42 in Nasdaq trading, resisting a general decline among U.S. Internet sector stocks. The AMEX Internet Index was off $1.02 at $203.91 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analyst Anthony Noto said in a note to clients that he had  raised his revenue estimate to $1.755 billion, the high end of the range of Wall Street forecasts for the first quarter ending this week, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He also boosted his first-quarter earnings per share estimate to 31 cents, the high end of forecasts, excluding one-time items, which range between 29 cents and 31 cents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Noto said that with revenue per listing rising for the third consecutive quarter, it now appears that weakness in eBay's core U.S. auction market bottomed during the second quarter of last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Maureen Bavdek, reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco; Telephone: +1 415 677 3919; E-mail: eric.auchard@reuters.com)) Keywords: EBAY RESEARCH/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 March 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it lowered its
price targets for UAL Corp UAUA.O and five other airline
companies, adding that the cuts reflect a weaker revenue
outlook, as demand continues to soften and capacity additions
look set to be higher.

 The brokerage said its revised numbers are now below
consensus but it expects estimates to fall as Wall Street
revises fuel cost assumptions upward and lowers unit revenue
forecasts.

 Goldman said UAL Corp and JetBlue Airways (JBLU.O) remained
its top picks in airlines and it liked the carriers' larger
margin expansion opportunities.

 The following are the price target changes:

 COMPANY                       PRICE TARGET

                               Current      Prior

 UAL Corp UAUA.O             $44          $56

 Alaska Air Group Inc (ALK.N)  $43          $47

 JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) $14          $16

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS, March 26 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc.s (PFE.N)
abandoned heart drug torcetrapib failed to show any benefit in
halting the build-up of plaque in the main artery that controls
blood flow to the brain and significantly raised blood
pressure, according to a pair of studies of patients with high

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS, March 26 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's abandoned
experimental drug torcetrapib failed to arrest clogging of

in a clinical trial, raising questions about the future of
similar drugs being developed by other companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer (PFE.N) in December halted development of
torcetrapib, then its most important experimental drug, after a

had hoped to demonstrate the drug's ability to slow or halt
progression of artery-clogging plaque, a potential indication
of the viability of the entire class of drugs called CETP
inhibitors designed to raise HDL levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite its ability to greatly boost good cholesterol and
cut the bad variety, torcetrapib's overall performance widely
missed the mark, said Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at the
Cleveland Clinic who led the study.

&lt;p&gt;March 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its 2007 and 2008

weak processor pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which has a neutral rating on the stock, cut

$1.10, and that for 2008 to $1.20 from $1.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The recent deterioration in DRAM pricing is likely to have
very negative consequences for the semiconductor production
equipment makers in the second half, Goldman said in its
research note dated March 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, however, expects Intel to continue to gain market
share due to a superior product line-up and a significantly
stronger balance sheet/PL relative to Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. (AMD.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consequently, Goldman expects Intel to emerge from the
current price war with a better market position.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)

 March 26 (Reuters) - Shares of Dell Inc. DELL.O rose as
much as 3.4 percent in early electronic trade, after Goldman
Sachs raised the world's second-largest maker of personal
computers to "buy," saying it sees a string catalysts over the
next 12-to-18 months.

 The brokerage, which previously had a "neutral" rating on
the stock, identified the catalysts as renewed communication,
buybacks and the company's ability to finally file its
financials.

 Other catalysts include multiple measures to reduce
expenses or expense ratios, combined with a series of other
steps to improve revenue growth, it added.

 The combination of improving revenue growth and expense
cuts should allow Dell to begin the process of closing in on
more normalized operating margins by the end of 2008, Goldman
said.

 Goldman however reduced its near-term estimates on Dell as
it expects the company to experience more friction this year as
it executes its turnaround plan.

 "Although we know we are early and that there will be
inevitable backsteps, the history of turnarounds suggests that
a good part of the stock rise comes in the first 12 months,"
Goldman said.

 The brokerage said it expects Dell's valuation multiples to
pick up as well. Recent turnarounds such as Hewlett-Packard
(HPQ.N) and Sun Microsystems SUNW.O highlight how the market
attributes more favorable valuation multiples on improving
operating results, it noted.

 Goldman, which has a price target of $28 on the stock, said
its discounted cash flow analysis suggests that fair value for
Dell is actually closer to $35.

 Dell shares were up 2.7 percent at $23.48 in electronic
composite trading.

&lt;p&gt;RIYADH, March 26 (Reuters) - Saudi state oil giant Aramco,
U.S. major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and China's Sinopec (0386.HK)
will hold on Friday a formal signing ceremomy for a
multi-billion dollar joint-venture in China's Fujian province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The three announced they had finalised the deal to triple
the capacity of the Fujian oil refinery in February, pending
government approval in both Saudi Arabia and China. When it was
agreed in 2005, the project had a price tag of $3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The signature of the partnership accord for the Fujian
joint-venture project ... strengthens the solid strategic
economic partnership between the kingdom and China," Aramco said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi and Aramco CEO Abdullah Jumah
will attend the signing ceremony in Beijing with senior Sinopec
and Exxon executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saudi Arabia is the main supplier of crude to China, the
world's second largest energy consumer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal gives Aramco and Exxon a foothold in China's
insular refining sector, dominated by state giants Sinopec and
PetroChina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would triple Fujian refinery's capacity to 240,0000
barrels per day (bpd). The expanded refinery will start up in
early 2009, Aramco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery will process Aramco's heavy crude, which 
Chinese refineries find difficult to handle. By investing in the
refinery upgrade, Aramco will boost the potential market for its
heavier oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal provides for the construction by the three firms of
a petrochemical complex to produce plastics and gasoline
blending components, which will include an 800,000
tonne-per-year ethylene cracker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aramco, Exxon and Sinopec will also set up a fuel marketing
venture that will manage 750 service stations and a network of
terminals in Fujian province. That gives Aramco and Exxon access
to China's protected retail sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aramco and Exxon will each have 25 percent of the refinery
and petrochemical joint venture. The Fujian Petrochemical
Company Limited (FPCL) will hold the remaining 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinopec and the Fujian Provincial Government each hold 50
percent of FPCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinopec owns 55 percent of the fuel marketing venture, while
Exxon and Aramco will each own 22.5 percent.

January and February. JPMorgan Chase reaffirmed its 10 percent
forecast but said the balance of risks was on the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said in a report that its proprietary index of
Chinese economic activity registered 13.0 percent growth in
January and February from a year earlier, accelerating from 9.9
percent in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's leading indicator pointed to momentum staying
strong. It came in at 102.81 in February and 102.96 in January,
higher than the fourth-quarter average of 100.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said Chinese policy makers were likely to respond to
the stronger growth by tightening policy further heading into the
second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With aggregate demand likely to slow in response in the
second half of this year, the bank said it was keeping its 2008
GDP growth forecast unchanged at 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The risks of a more blunt policy tightening would increase if
there was further acceleration in coming months in credit and
money supply growth, fixed-asset investment and inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it had raised its forecast for year-average
consumer price inflation in 2007 to 2.6 percent from 2.4 percent
but had kept its 2008 projection unchanged at 1.8 percent.
Inflation last year averaged 1.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun at Lehman also expects another round of tightening
measures soon. But he queried how effective they would be in
rebalancing the economy, given that steps taken last year to cool
investment and output growth had achieved only temporary results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fact that these policies have failed again raises the
risk that, if the government continues only slowly carrying out
the promised reforms, the unbalanced growth could be prolonged
indefinitely and could make the longer-term outlook much more
risky," Sun wrote in the bank's economic weekly.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nestle (NESN.VX) and Coca-Cola Co. 
(KO.N) said on Tuesday that each company will have more room to 
develop its own bottled tea business in the United States due 
to an agreement to change their Beverage Partners Worldwide 
joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The agreement, which is subject to regulatory approvals and 
is expected to close by April 30, revises a deal that the 
world's largest food company and the world's largest drinks 
company announced in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The November version freed the companies to pursue their 
own strategies for all ready-to-drink coffee and tea beverages 
not covered by the joint venture, whose main products are the 
Nestea line of black teas and Enviga sparkling green tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The revised agreement extends that freedom to black teas, 
which are the most popular in the United States, because the 
joint venture will now focus on markets besides the United 
States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're free to develop or acquire new brands in the United 
States so we can move aggressively," said Coca-Cola spokesman 
Dana Bolden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola, which sells ready-to-drink tea under the brands 
Gold Peak and Fuze -- which it acquired this month -- is still 
free to sell drinks under the Nestea and Enviga brands, the 
companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a big deal because tea is one of the fastest-growing 
categories," said John Sicher, publisher of industry newsletter 
Beverage Digest. "The two growth stars are PepsiCo Inc. (PEP.N) 
and Arizona, and Coke needs to really jump-start its tea 
business in the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sicher said the development was not a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seemed hard to understand how you could split up the 
tea category between black and non-black teas," Sicher said. 
"This change makes perfect sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beverage Partners Worldwide, a 50-50 joint venture between 
Nestle and Coca-Cola, was created in 2001, following a period 
of 10 years during in which Nestle and Coca-Cola cooperated in 
a joint venture called Coca-Cola and Nestle Refreshments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Sam Cage in Zurich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Snoop Dogg, who has been denied a visa 
to enter Britain on a European tour, is seeking to have the 
decision overturned, a spokeswoman said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The 35-year old, arrested during a disturbance at London's 
Heathrow airport last year, had been due to perform with fellow 
rapper Sean "Diddy" Combs, at Wembley Arena in London on 
Tuesday, followed by gigs in Cardiff, Manchester, Glasgow, and 
Nottingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Snoop still sincerely hopes that the British Government 
will reconsider their decision and UK shows will be allowed to 
go on as planned," his spokeswoman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Many routes are being explored to the prime minister to 
have the decision reversed," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's Home Office said it would not comment on 
individual cases, but added that the government had the power 
to refuse entrance to individuals whose presence in the country 
would "not be conducive to the public good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dogg was previously prevented from entering Britain in May, 
2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not the first problem the rapper has encountered on 
his European tour. Earlier this month, Stockholm police 
arrested him and a woman in her early 20s for suspected 
narcotics use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, had been 
performing concerts with Combs, once his bitter rival in a 
notorious feud between the east and west coast U.S. hip-hop 
scenes in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They feel strongly that the uniting message of the One 
Love Peace Tour will need to be shared with fans no matter what 
and discussions are underway with production teams so that 
Snoop can still be involved in the show," his spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds other news from annual meeting)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone and Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
(GS.N) seeks to raise the largest corporate buyout fund ever,
even as the Wall Street bank deflects reports that its growing
clout as an investor has private equity firms on edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein on Tuesday said the
firm expects to bring in around $19 billion to $20 billion for
its next buyout fund, a target that exceeds the amount raised
so far by its biggest private-equity clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It might be a little more, it might be a little less,"
Blankfein told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in
New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's ambitious fund-raising target comes at a time
when some of the biggest buyout shops grumble, privately, about
the Wall Street bank's growing clout as an investor and its
heavy-handed role in some recent deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rival bankers claim Goldman lost its chance for a coveted
spot on Blackstone Group's IPO in part because it is viewed as
too much of a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in an interview before the annual meeting, Blankfein
told Reuters: "We have very good relationships with our
financial sponsor clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein also observed during the meeting that Goldman
advised Blackstone in its record-setting $32 billion purchase
of Equity Office Properties and provided financing, proof the
bank remains on good terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, Blankfein told Reuters, is not about to change its
approach to the business just because it was excluded from the
Blackstone IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Based on the public statements from some of our
competitors, they look at our business model and they try to
emulate it," Blankfein said. "We are not abandoning our
approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman does miss out on, or takes a pass on some deals due
to "business selection," or due to conflicts with other
transactions, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We happen to have, as a firm, a terrific relationship with
Blackstone and we are not going to be, as much as we'd like to
be -- it would be impossible for us to be -- in every piece of
business," Blankfein told shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BIGGEST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's buyout fund would allow it to buy companies worth
tens of billions of dollars. It also increases the chances that
Goldman will compete with Blackstone and other prized private
equity clients for large takeover targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund would leapfrog the $18.1 billion Blackstone has
raised so far for its next fund, according to the prospectus
for Blackstone's pending initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity firms dole out billions of dollars in fees
to Wall Street every year, and most investment banks abandoned
their private equity business or shrunk it rather than risk
driving these lucrative clients away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Wall Street backed off the business, Goldman expanded
it, buying companies alongside other private equity bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman reaped enormous gains from its investments, while
maintaining its position as the world's top merger adviser,
encouraging rivals to jump back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is targeting a buyout fund of around
$6 billion for deals in the United States and Europe, according
to sources. Merrill Lynch MER.N and Lehman Brothers LEH.N
also have increased their investing activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein's comments on Tuesday echo his comments to
investors in November, when he said Goldman's strategy is not
just to advise on deals, but also to provide financing and
invest capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think those elements merely co-exist: I think they
are necessary," Blankfein said. "If you're going to be a strong
adviser in today's world, you have to be a very strong
financier and a capable investor. That is what's called for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman buyout deals include the $14.6 billion management
buyout of energy pipeline giant Kinder Morgan and the purchase
of fast food chain Burger King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other meeting news, shareholders rejected proposals
seeking full disclosure about the firm's charitable donations
and its policies regarding economic and environmental
sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both proposals, critical of Goldman's 2002 donation of
680,000 acres in Chile's Tierra del Fuego to the Wildlife
Conservation Society, received less than 7 percent of votes
cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also extended voting until April 11 for a third
proposal, submitted by corporate gadfly Evelyn Davis, calling
for a ban on stock options. The proposal had mistakenly been
left out of the bank's original proxy statement, prompting
Goldman to issue an amended proxy and mailing new forms to
investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein apologized to Davis during the meeting.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer announced today that Lipitor Tablets (80 mg) lowered hospitalization costs by significantly reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with heart disease, according to two separate economic analyses. The data were presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology. This new analysis of patients with acute coronary syndrome is consistent with the health economic findings of the overall IDEAL trial of 8,888 patients. Additionally, in a separate analysis of a large U.S. managed care database that was recently presented, Lipitor patients achieved a significant additional 14% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events compared with patients taking simvastatin, even after adjustments for expected differences of LDL lowering based on dose.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
(GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said on Tuesday the
investment bank expects to raise around $19 billion to $20
billion for its next private equity fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "It might be a little more, it might be a little less,"
Blankfein told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in
New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That amount would make the fund much larger than those
being raised by its prized private equity clients, increasing
the chances that Goldman will compete with them on deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reports of the projected size of Goldman's fund surfaced
last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's fund would be bigger than that of private equity
firm The Blackstone Group [BG.UL], a major Goldman client that
has raised $18.1 billion so far for its next fund, according to
the prospectus for Blackstone's pending initial public
offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's fund would also exceed the $14 billion raised
last year by another private equity client, Texas Pacific Group
[TPG.UL], and the roughly $16 billion expected to be raised by
client Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co. [KKR.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another client, Carlyle Group [CYL.UL], is said to be
targeting $15 billion for its next fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The megafund will allow Goldman to take part in large
leveraged buyouts that its private equity clients compete for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity firms dole out billions of dollars in fees
to Wall Street every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's approach to private equity investing is unique
because all other investment banks have shrunk or spun off
their buyout arms, fearing that they would interfere with LBO
clients. Morgan Stanley (MS.N), for example, is targeting a
buyout fund of around $6 billion, according to sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity funds buy companies by borrowing most of the
money. Then they restructure the businesses and sell them
later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's buyout arm, known GS Capital Partners, has been
hugely successful in its private equity investments, with
recent deals including the purchase of oil and gas pipeline
company Kinder Morgan.

&lt;p&gt;INGELHEIM, Germany (Reuters) - The chief executive of independent German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim said on Tuesday that a merger and acquisitions strategy, as pursued by U.S. pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer, was not the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Pfizer model is a failure," Alessandro Banchi told Reuters on the sidelines of its annual results briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unlisted company, which is controlled by the Boehringer family, had net sales of 11 billion euros last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer (PFN.N) has grown to be the world's biggest drugmaker following a series of acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its stock has nearly halved in value in the past six years following a series of high-profile product setbacks that have heightened concerns about its ability to find enough new medicines to keep the business growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banchi said it was not impossible that top drug makers like Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) could one day be split into smaller independent companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the news conference, Boehringer's finance head Marbod Muff also said the Pfizer's model seemed to have come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer bought first products, operations and they bought companies, and now Pfizer over the past couple of years has been growing negatively, and now they are laying off staff," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boehringer shrugged off concerns that the family-controlled drug maker had slipped into the number two spot in Germany after rival Bayer BAYG.DE acquired Schering last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banchi said Boehringer's independence allowed it to focus on research and development without worrying about the market's profit expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't buy sales. We buy RD. For the present, we have enough growth coming from existing products. Why should we spend our money to add sales we don't need," Banchi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned about the future. That's where we put the money," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Boehringer said its 2006 net profit rose 14 percent to 1.72 billion euros ($2.3 billion), driven by three blockbuster drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler in London)&lt;/p&gt;

percent from a pending acquisition, and other organic growth

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats story first published on Monday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, March 26 (Reuters) - The non-profit group that owns
rights to much of the Linux operating system says it will seek
to undermine a controversial deal between Microsoft Corp.
(MSFT.O) and Novell Inc. NOVL.O through a new software
licensing agreement to be unveiled on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies announced a partnership in November that
included a cross-patent protection agreement that some critics
say implies Microsoft has legal rights to Linux, the
cooperatively developed software that is gaining ground with
corporate users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We need to make sure such deals don't make a mockery of
the goals of free software," Peter Brown, executive director of
the Free Software Foundation, said in an interview with Reuters
late on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Free software, which is also known as open-source software,
refers to computer programs that are available to the general
public to be used, revised and shared. Products from companies
like Microsoft are considered proprietary and their code
generally cannot be revised and shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While open-source software is free, it also has become big
business. An industry of consultants and other services
supports it, and corporations contribute heavily to open-source
development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Linux runs on more than 20 percent of global server
computers, compared with well over 60 percent of such powerful
machines running Windows, according to recent Gartner data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and Novell say their deal lets powerful server
computers running Windows and Linux systems communicate better.
The pact is part of a broad sales, marketing and development
partnership that brought Novell $348 million in upfront
payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Members of the free software community attacked the patent
deal, particularly an agreement by Microsoft not to sue
Novell's Linux customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say they object to it because they believe its
existence implies that Microsoft holds patents that it could
one day claim are being infringed upon by users of Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Free Software Foundation will seek to undermine the
Microsoft-Novell patent deal by incorporating legal language
into the terms of the new license agreement that controls
distribution of much of the code in Linux, Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brown declined to discuss details of the changes in advance
of a draft of the agreement to be published on Wednesday,
though he said the foundation was committed to preventing
Microsoft from claiming rights to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They found a way to effectively proprietize free software
by offering patent promises to Novell," Brown said. "Whenever a
new method comes along to effectively turn free software into
proprietary software, we will adjust the license."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The change to the license will be effective from June 26,
though it will only apply to upgrades to Linux operating system
code controlled by the foundation that are made from that date,
Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novell will be able to continue to distribute its current
Linux products without violating the terms of the new license.
But financial analysts have said that it will need to upgrade
that software to remain competitive with rivals such as Red Hat
Inc. (RHT.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novell spokesman Bruce Lowry declined to comment on the
foundation's plan, saying he hadn't seen a draft of the new
license agreement. Microsoft also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Linux is distributed under the terms of a license that was
written in 1991, the General Public License version 2, or
GPLv2. The new license will be known as GPLv3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novell and Red Hat make copies of their software available
at no charge over the Internet. They generate revenue and
profits from versions sold with service contracts that include
technical support along with regular maintenance and upgrades
to their software.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on 
Monday it elected Reed Hastings, the chairman and chief 
executive of Netflix Inc., (NFLX.O) to its board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hastings, 46, becomes the 10th member of Microsoft's board. 
He was appointed to the board's finance committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He founded online DVD rental company Netflix in 1997 and 
took the company public in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's board was scaled back to nine members last 
year, when former U.S. Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin Korologos 
retired at its annual shareholder meeting in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hastings, who also founded one of the world's 50 largest 
software companies, Pure Software, becomes the only 
representative on Microsoft's board from an Internet-based 
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, plans to tap 
into Hastings' consumer and technology knowledge, the company's 
chairman Bill Gates said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The addition of Hastings comes as Microsoft tries to beef 
up its Web services business to better compete with rivals like 
Google Inc. (GOOG.O) and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - Online advertising firm DoubleClick Inc. is exploring a sale and is in talks with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) and other potential suitors, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    DoubleClick is using investment bank Morgan Stanley to help explore its options, including a possible stock market listing, according to the report, which quoted people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The advertising company is majority-owned by San Francisco private equity firm Hellman &amp; Friedman, which is seeking at least $2 billion for DoubleClick, one person briefed on the situation told the Journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Such a price tag could amount to a hefty return for the private equity firm, which took DoubleClick private in mid-2005 in a deal worth $1.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Founded in 1996, DoubleClick's shares suffered when the dot-come bubble burst in 2000 and 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company saw prices for its services squeezed as advertisers, paying steeper prices to appear on highly trafficked Internet sites and for producing splashier online ads, looked for lower costs when it care to the technology backing those ads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In October 2004 DoubleClick hired Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to explore the sale of part or all of its operations, which were mainly split between its Internet advertising management services and a more traditional database marketing division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Journal, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported that New York-based DoubleClick had about $150 million in revenue last year. More than $100 million came from serving ads for publishers to their Web pages and delivering the ads to be served on behalf of advertisers, it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    DoubleClick and Hellman &amp; Friedman could not immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Mark Porter and Megan Davies in New York   editing by John Wallace;    Reuters Messaging    rm://megan.davies.reuters.com@reuters.net    Telephone: +1 646 223 6112)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available    for: * 3000 Xtra: visit    topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on    Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: DOUBLECLICK/SUITORS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds shares) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS, March 28 (Reuters) - NicOx (NCOX.PA) said on Wednesday its U.S. partner Pfizer (PFE.N) had begun a clinical trial with an experimental drug aiming to treat eye disease glaucoma, yielding a milestone payment for the French biotech company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NicOx will receive 1 million euros ($1.3 million) from Pfizer, bringing the total it received following their partnership agreement in 2004 to 5 million euros. NicOx said it could receive an extra 32 million euros plus royalty payments if in the end the drug can be sold successfully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NicOx shares rose as much as 6.9 percent before easing to a gain of 5.8 percent to 19.04 euros by 0959 GMT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer will begin the first of several clinical studies with PF-03187207 testing its safety and tolerability and possibly giving a first indication of its efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause impaired vision and ultimately blindness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The payments NicOx receives from Pfizer will be on top of research and milestone payments from a second agreement signed last year giving Pfizer exclusive rights to use NicOx's technology in opthalmology, NicOx said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Caroline Jacobs, editing by Will Waterman and David Holmes; paris.equities@news.reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: caroline.jacobs.reuters.com@reuters.net; +33 1 49 49 53 43)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.7534 Euro)   Keywords: NICOX PFIZER/GLAUCOMA  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - "M" is coming to the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, not the famed fictional head of British intelligence from the James Bond series. Retailer Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N said on Wednesday it plans to adopt "M" as its stock symbol when shareholders approve its proposed name change to Macy's Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the name change on May 18 and the stock symbol change would go into effect on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retailer proposed the change of its symbol to reflect the change of its business. Ninety percent of Federated's sales now come from the Macy's brand, the company said. In recent years the company changed the names of many regional department stores it owns to Macy's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federated management originally planned to ask shareholders to change the name to Macy's Group Inc., but simplified that to Macy's Inc. when it found it could have the coveted single-letter stock symbol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While "M" may be best known as the name of James Bond's boss in Ian Fleming's novels and the many blockbuster movies, in the financial world, "M" was seen as part of a different plot -- real or imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Stock Exchange was long thought to be saving the "M" symbol to lure Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) away from rival Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That has been a matter of speculation, something we have not had to address," New York Stock Exchange spokesman Christiaan Brakman said. "'M' will be for Macy's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symbol "M" has been unused since 1989, when it represented Texas bank holding company M Corp., which went under that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the symbol "M" gone, 10 single letters remain available: G, I, J, L, N, P, U, V, W, and Z.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-letter symbols have been seen as carrying considerable cachet. Among the long-time holders of such symbols are Ford Motor Co. (F) (F.N) and U.S. Steel Corp. (X)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (X.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is another important opportunity to reinforce the recent expansion of the Macy's brand," Terry Lundgren, Federated Chairman and Chief Executive, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federated shares closed on Tuesday at $46.23 on the New York Stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and for James Bond fans, sorry -- "Q" is already taken. Not by a gadget maker, but by regional phone company Qwest Communications International Inc. (Q.N)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financing consists of a five-year unsecured note convertible into Vyyo common stock at $10 per share, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction, to be closed within the week, will result in $17.5 million in new funding and an additional $17.5 million to pay off the aggregate of notes issued to Goldman Sachs in 2006, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vyyo said it will use the funding to accelerate deployment of its spectrum overlay and business services for the cable industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which is the second largest stakeholder in the company, will have a 14.8 percent stake in Vyyo at the closing of this funding, a company spokesman said from Norcross, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Vyyo were trading up over 20 percent at $8.99 in late morning trade on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bhaswati Mukhopadhyay in Bangalore)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We have cut by a third the output at our Fos-sur-Mer

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) seeks 
to raise the largest corporate buyout fund ever, even as the 
Wall Street bank deflects reports that its growing clout as an 
investor has private equity firms on edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein on Tuesday said the 
firm expects to bring in around $19 billion to $20 billion for 
its next buyout fund, a target that exceeds the amount raised 
so far by its biggest private-equity clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It might be a little more, it might be a little less," 
Blankfein told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in 
New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's ambitious fund-raising target comes at a time 
when some of the biggest buyout shops grumble, privately, about 
the Wall Street bank's growing clout as an investor and its 
heavy-handed role in some recent deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rival bankers claim Goldman lost its chance for a coveted 
spot on Blackstone Group's IPO in part because it is viewed as 
too much of a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in an interview before the annual meeting, Blankfein 
told Reuters: "We have very good relationships with our 
financial sponsor clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein also observed during the meeting that Goldman 
advised Blackstone in its record-setting $32 billion purchase 
of Equity Office Properties and provided financing, proof the 
bank remains on good terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, Blankfein told Reuters, is not about to change its 
approach to the business just because it was excluded from the 
Blackstone IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Based on the public statements from some of our 
competitors, they look at our business model and they try to 
emulate it," Blankfein said. "We are not abandoning our 
approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman does miss out on, or takes a pass on some deals due 
to "business selection," or due to conflicts with other 
transactions, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We happen to have, as a firm, a terrific relationship with 
Blackstone and we are not going to be, as much as we'd like to 
be -- it would be impossible for us to be -- in every piece of 
business," Blankfein told shareholders.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BIGGEST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's buyout fund would allow it to buy companies worth 
tens of billions of dollars. It also increases the chances that 
Goldman will compete with Blackstone and other prized private 
equity clients for large takeover targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund would leapfrog the $18.1 billion Blackstone has 
raised so far for its next fund, according to the prospectus 
for Blackstone's pending initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity firms dole out billions of dollars in fees 
to Wall Street every year, and most investment banks abandoned 
their private equity business or shrunk it rather than risk 
driving these lucrative clients away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Wall Street backed off the business, Goldman expanded 
it, buying companies alongside other private equity bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman reaped enormous gains from its investments, while 
maintaining its position as the world's top merger adviser, 
encouraging rivals to jump back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is targeting a buyout fund of around 
$6 billion for deals in the United States and Europe, according 
to sources. Merrill Lynch MER.N and Lehman Brothers LEH.N 
also have increased their investing activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein's comments on Tuesday echo his comments to 
investors in November, when he said Goldman's strategy is not 
just to advise on deals, but also to provide financing and 
invest capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think those elements merely co-exist: I think they 
are necessary," Blankfein said. "If you're going to be a strong 
adviser in today's world, you have to be a very strong 
financier and a capable investor. That is what's called for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman buyout deals include the $14.6 billion management 
buyout of energy pipeline giant Kinder Morgan and the purchase 
of fast food chain Burger King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other meeting news, shareholders rejected proposals 
seeking full disclosure about the firm's charitable donations 
and its policies regarding economic and environmental 
sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both proposals, critical of Goldman's 2002 donation of 
680,000 acres in Chile's Tierra del Fuego to the Wildlife 
Conservation Society, received less than 7 percent of votes 
cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also extended voting until April 11 for a third 
proposal, submitted by corporate gadfly Evelyn Davis, calling 
for a ban on stock options. The proposal had mistakenly been 
left out of the bank's original proxy statement, prompting 
Goldman to issue an amended proxy and mailing new forms to 
investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein apologized to Davis during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No government to government business will be transacted on any other issue," the official said, adding that British government support for other bilateral events such as trade missions to Iran would also be put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Tuesday it will begin selling a new version of its Xbox 360 console that transmits high-definition video and comes with a larger hard drive in its latest effort to position the video game machine as a digital media hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new Xbox 360 Elite, with a 120-gigabyte hard drive and High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) port, will be available on April 29 in the United States and Canada for $479.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hard drive on the new machine is six times bigger than the current high-end Xbox 360 model, which retails for $399.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the Elite hard drive has space to hold a library of arcade games and thousands of songs, as well as high-definition TV shows and movies downloaded from the company's Xbox LIVE online service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's games and entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content," said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for the Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will sell the Elite alongside existing Xbox 360 systems and it will offer the detachable 120 gigabyte hard drive for $179.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MULTIFRONT WAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released the Xbox 360 a full year ahead of Sony Corp.'s new PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s Wii, grabbing an early lead in the new, three-way video game console war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360 and PS3 are also battling on the home entertainment front with each shooting to take control of the digital living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter said Microsoft is making a play for a niche market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Very few consumers will care," he said, noting that most gamers can probably get by with a 20-gigabyte hard drive while owners of pricey high-definition televisions are still a small percentage of the overall audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony's PS3 includes a next-generation, high-definition, Blu-ray DVD player that is slowly gaining popularity with movie buffs. Microsoft did not put a competing high-def DVD player in its console, but with the Elite, the world's biggest software maker is making its own assault on the living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said earlier this year it would offer an Xbox 360 that would double as a set-top box for Internet Protocol TV, or IPTV. Telephone carriers and cable companies provide set-top boxes to pipe high-definition movies and television into homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives at Sony, whose $600 high-end PS3 has racked up fewer sales than the Xbox 360 and Wii, said Microsoft's new console does not seem to address any consumer need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're scratching our heads. They're fragmenting their product offering and fragmenting their consumer base," said Peter Dille, a Sony Computer Entertainment America senior vice president of marketing, who said Sony has no current plans to increase the size of its 60 gigabyte hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARIS, March 28 (Reuters) - NicOx (NCOX.PA) said on
Wednesday its U.S. partner Pfizer (PFE.N) had begun a clinical
trial with an experimental drug aiming to treat eye disease
glaucoma, yielding a milestone payment for the French biotech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; NicOx will receive 1 million euros ($1.33 million) from
Pfizer, bringing the total it received following their
partnership agreement in 2004 to 5 million euros. NicOx said it
could receive an extra 32 million euros plus royalty payments if
in the end the drug can be sold successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer will begin the first of several clinical studies with
PF-03187207 testing its safety and tolerability and possibly
giving a first indication of its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause impaired
vision and ultimately blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The payments NicOx receives from Pfizer will be on top of
research and milestone payments from a second agreement signed
last year giving Pfizer exclusive rights to use NicOx's
technology in opthalmology, NicOx said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NicOx shares closed at 18 euros on Wednesday.

venture, much more than originally planned, they said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; When the project in southeastern Fujian province was first
agreed in 2005, estimated investment for the refining and
petrochemicals plants was $3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Production is expected to start in early 2009, the companies
said in a joint statement released at an inauguration ceremony
held in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Aramco spokesman declined immediate comment on the reasons
for the increase or how much of the investment was going to the
marketing venture, which will manage around 750 service stations
and a network of terminals in Fujian.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co.'s animated movie "Meet the Robinsons" debuts on Friday with modest box office expectations in the first major test of Pixar's creative influence on Disney's struggling animation studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film was extensively reworked by John Lasseter, the creative chief behind Pixar Animation Studios blockbusters like "Finding Nemo," "The Incredibles" and "Monsters Inc." who now heads both studios' animation programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasseter took over last year when Disney bought Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock deal, and is widely perceived as the heir to company founder Walt Disney's animation vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investor eyes will be on 'Meet the Robinsons' as this is the first Disney animated film that will have the direct influence of John Lasseter," BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeff Logsdon wrote this week in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts pegged the film's opening weekend box office at $20 million to $30 million, well below last year's $68 million record for the weekend set by "Ice Age: The Meltdown" or Pixar's "Cars," which debuted last June with $60 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sander Morris Harris analyst David Miller estimated the film cost Disney about $52 million to make and $65 million to market and distribute. He said a $30 million opening weekend should guarantee a profit over the life of the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time you will see Pixar's influence on a story that had already been done," Miller said. "If the film is successful it will prove to the Street that the $7.4 billion that Disney paid for Pixar is a damn good deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO. 1 IN PRE-SALES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Meet the Robinsons," which is opening in 3,413 U.S. and Canada theaters, was No. 1 in advance ticket sales on Thursday at Fandango.com, the largest U.S. movie ticketing service with access to more than 15,000 screens, said Fandango spokesman Harry Medved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, "Robinsons" accounted for about 31 percent of ticket sales, compared with 23 percent for the No. 2 film, "Blades of Glory" and 18 percent for "300," Medved said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Box office grosses also may get a boost from premium ticket prices charged at roughly 700 screens that will show three-dimensional versions of the film, in the largest-ever release of a modern 3D film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reviewers generally praised the film's cutting-edge animation, they had mixed opinions of its story and characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated Press reviewer Christy Lemire described the digital 3D effects as "pretty spectacular" and "eye candy," but added that "it's hard to feel too emotionally engaged by any of this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entertainment Weekly reviewer Lisa Schwarzbaum rated the film as average with a grade of "C," calling it "one bumpy ride."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Fandango.com columnist Richard Horgan saw "Lasseter's fingerprints all over this thing because it pops the way a Pixar film does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It just has that bounce in its narrative step," Horgan told Reuters. "It's a great heralding of the Disney-Pixar era. It's just really encouraging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quote, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, March 29 (Reuters) - Mexico's Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N), the world's largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said on Thursday it sold its minority interest in U.S. broadcaster Univision Communications Inc. for $1.094 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A group of private investors said earlier they had completed their $12.3 billion purchase of Univision UVN.N, the largest U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster, which Televisa had earlier hoped to buy.  "All of Televisa's shares and warrants, with exercise prices below the per share merger consideration, in Univision have been converted into cash," Televisa said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Relations between Univision and Grupo Televisa had deteriorated in recent years amid legal battles over Univision's management, content rights and royalties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In 2000, Televisa committed to provide Univision with its top entertainment and sports shows for a 17-year period. While the Mexican company receives royalty payments, last year they accounted for less than 5 percent of total sales of 37.932 billion pesos ($3.5 billion). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Mexico City newsroom; +52 55 5282-7153)) Keywords: MEXICO TELEVISA/UNIVISION  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Manhattan federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N) investors who accused the third-largest U.S. bank of helping Enron Corp. hide fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs had alleged they bought JPMorgan stock based on the New York bank's reputation for integrity and financial discipline, when in fact the company was helping Enron, a major client, hide billions of dollars of debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 26-page ruling released on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein said the plaintiffs failed to show that JPMorgan deceived or intended to deceive them by downplaying its exposure to Enron, or overstating its own integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stein dismissed the five-year-old case with prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs cannot raise their claims again. He had dismissed an earlier complaint in March 2005, but allowed the plaintiffs to refile their case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This version of the complaint ... suffers from the same flaws as the first," the judge wrote. "If plaintiffs' allegations are borne out, it would be not they but the shareholders of Enron -- the real victims of the energy giant's collapse -- who would have been defrauded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stein also rejected claims that William Harrison, JPMorgan's former chairman and chief executive, should be held liable in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately return a call seeking comment. JPMorgan spokesman Adam Castellani declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed in June 2005 to pay $2.2 billion to settle its part of a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of former Enron investors against the energy trader's former banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total payouts in that case topped $7 billion, including about $2.4 billion by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM.TO) and $2 billion by Citigroup Inc. (C.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the JPMorgan class-action case, the plaintiffs had argued that the bank defrauded them from November 1999, when the shares traded as high as $58.25, to July 2002, when they were as low as $18.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 2, 2001. JPMorgan agreed in 2005 to pay $350 million in separate litigation brought by Enron's liquidators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed on Thursday up 51 cents at $48.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online advertising firm DoubleClick 
Inc. is exploring a sale and is in talks with Microsoft Corp. 
and other potential suitors, the Wall Street Journal reported 
on its Web site on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; DoubleClick is using investment bank Morgan Stanley to help 
explore its options, including a possible stock market listing, 
according to the report, which quoted people familiar with the 
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The advertising company is majority-owned by San Francisco 
private equity firm Hellman  Friedman, which is seeking at 
least $2 billion for DoubleClick, one person briefed on the 
situation told the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such a price tag could amount to a hefty return for the 
private equity firm, which took DoubleClick private in mid-2005 
in a deal worth $1.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Founded in 1996, DoubleClick's shares suffered when the 
dot-come bubble burst in 2000 and 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company saw prices for its services squeezed as 
advertisers, paying steeper prices to appear on highly 
trafficked Internet sites and for producing splashier online 
ads, looked for lower costs when it care to the technology 
backing those ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In October 2004 DoubleClick hired Lazard Freres  Co. to 
explore the sale of part or all of its operations, which were 
mainly split between its Internet advertising management 
services and a more traditional database marketing division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Journal, citing a person familiar with the matter, 
reported that New York-based DoubleClick had about $150 million 
in revenue last year. More than $100 million came from serving 
ads for publishers to their Web pages and delivering the ads to 
be served on behalf of advertisers, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DoubleClick and Hellman  Friedman could not immediately be 
reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Visa USA sees cell phones as the best way to expand electronic payments, Chief Executive John Philip Coghlan said at the CTIA wireless show, where he also revealed ties with several wireless technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireless transactions are common in some countries, such as Japan, where shoppers with mobile phones can pay with a wave of a handset instead of a swipe with a credit card, but the market is in its infancy in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. mobile service providers see mobile payments as a way to increase customer loyalty while payment companies such as Visa view phones as the key to winning over American consumers, who use cash and checks for 46 percent of their spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the mobile device is simply the most promising new form of payment system available today," Coghlan said during his CTIA keynote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 57 percent of U.S. consumers are interested in using cell phones for purchases and 64 percent would consider leaving a wireless service provider that did not offer mobile payments, Coghlan said, citing a Visa survey of 800 people in mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said on Wednesday that it would become an investor in Web venture dotMobi, which is promoting use of the .mobi Internet domain address -- instead of .com, for example -- for mobile Web browsing. It did not disclose the size of the investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa also said it was working with wireless chip developer Qualcomm Inc on bringing technologies to market to allow the consumer to make credit card-like transactions with a phone and a reading device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm is the dominant supplier of chips based on the CDMA wireless technology widely used in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said that handset maker Kyocera Wireless had agreed to support the Visa mobile payments platform in its phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's announcements came a day after ATT Inc's mobile unit Cingular announced plans to let consumers manage their bank accounts and pay bills on mobile phones through agreements with several banks including Wachovia Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts believe mobile payments could become a big market in the United States, but Forrester Research analyst Charles Golvin said it would not happen any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the long term, more than five years out, I think mobile payments will be significant," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

(IBM.N) in a deal that could be valued at up to $1.6 billion, the Economic Times reported on Thursday, quoting sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The scope of the deal would depend on the growth of India's fourth-ranked mobile services provider, the paper said, adding the deal would be the largest outsourcing contract signed by an Indian operator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "As operations ramp up, the deal size and scope is also likely to increase," unnamed sources told the paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last month, Hong Kong's Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd. 2332.HK agreed to sell its majority stake in Hutchison Essar, India's fourth-largest mobile services provider, to Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L) for $11.1 billion. The deal is yet to be approved by Indian authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Quoting sources, the paper said the outsourcing deal had been discussed with Vodafone chief executive Arun Sarin. Last year, Vodafone outsourced key IT functions to IBM, the world's largest computer services company, and Electronic Data Systems Corp. EDS.N. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sources told the paper an official announcement of the deal was still a few months away because of regulatory hurdles before the Vodafone deal to buy into Hutch Essar was approved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Officials at Hutchison Essar could not immediately reached for a comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In a separate report, the newspaper reported IBM's Indian unit had secured a $29 million order from unlisted real estate firm DLF to manage IT infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Hiral Vora, editing by John Mair; Reuters Messaging: hiral.vora.reuters.com@reuters.net; +91-22-6636 9244)) Keywords: HUTCHISONESSAR IBM/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Half of structured credit
investors believe a meaningful turn in the credit cycle may
still be over 12 months away, a survey conducted by JP Morgan
showed on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Only 8 percent of over 200 investors surveyed at the U.S.
investment bank's structured credit conference in Paris last
week believe the credit cycle has already turned, while 42
percent believe it is in the process of turning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't disagree with the 50 percent of respondents who
see a turn in the credit cycle being at least 12 months away,"
JP Morgan's credit strategists wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the credit cycle turns, riskier borrowers find it more
difficult to obtain financing, which may push up defaults as
some companies become unable to refinance the debts they have
taken on. By contrast, bankers and analysts have said the easy
availability of funding in recent years has helped the default
rate to remain at record lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only 13 percent of respondents said the risk of turmoil in
the U.S. subprime mortgage market turning into a credit crunch
was the biggest source of market risk, a result the strategists
said was "interesting ... given the level of media hysteria
going into the conference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, 42 percent say the biggest risk is a U.S. economic
slowdown, while 30 percent say it is the way in which the market
has taken "too much" exposure to default risk via synthetic and
other structured credit products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Idiosyncratic risk however may be more relevant, at least in
the near term, than systemic risk, with nearly 58 percent of
respondents saying "event risk" -- like mergers and acquisitions
or changes in a company's capital structure -- posed the biggest
negative for high-grade credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forty-four percent of investors said private equity firms --
which often load the balance sheets of the companies they buy
with debt -- as the biggest source of idiosyncratic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We shouldn't be surprised by this given the extent of LBO
speculation in the marketplace," the strategists wrote. "We're
not sure that we will actually see the pipeline of large-cap P2Ps
(public-to-private deals) that investors seem to fear, at least
in Europe, given a growing political backlash."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news that private equity firms are looking at big
British names such as grocer J. Sainsbury Plc (SBRY.L) and drug
retailer and distributor Alliance Boots AB.L has led to a
growing public debate about the role of private equity firms and
the way they run the companies they acquire.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    (Recasts, adds byline, details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Rafael Nam &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEOUL, March 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) on Thursday said it hired Steve Park from rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) to head the U.S. investment bank's securities unit in South Korea, as foreign banks push further into the country's trading market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Foreign investment banks expect overseas investors to return to South Korea, a market that many of them deserted last year as returns were lacklustre, particularly compared to booming markets in China and India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Credit Suisse has built up its Seoul operations in recent years under Park, with the latest data by the Financial Supervisory Commission showing it earned the fourth-biggest net profit in the March-December period of 2006 among foreign brokerages in South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Morgan Stanley (MS.N) reported the biggest net profit in the first three quarters of the brokerages' fiscal year, according to the data, followed by UBS (UBSN.VX) and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Park had been Credit Suisse's country co-manager. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Top Asian investment bankers and country heads have been playing musical chairs in the first three months of 2007, as this is the traditional time of year for dealmakers to switch jobs after getting their bonus payouts in January and February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Other moves this year have included Citigroup's (C.N) hiring of Jin Sool Joo as the new chairman and chief executive of its South Korean global markets business. He was poached from rival Barclays (BARC.L) where he had been country head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On the investment banking side, South Korea has been dwarfed by China and India in terms of stock underwritings, with the exceptions of a couple major deals such as the $3.5 billion London and Seoul listing of retailer Lotte Shopping (023530.KS) that was co-managed by Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But South Korea has been more active in corporate debt issuance, such as last year's $1 billion convertible bond sale by power provider Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760.KS), with Credit Suisse landing a spot as one of the four managers for that deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Keiron Henderson; Reuters Messaging: rafael.nam.reuters.com@reuters.net; Email: rafael.nam@reuters.com; Tel: +822 3704 5644)) Keywords: GOLDMAN KOREA/MOVE  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co.'s animated 
movie "Meet the Robinsons" debuts on Friday with modest box 
office expectations in the first major test of Pixar's creative 
influence on Disney's struggling animation studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The film was extensively reworked by John Lasseter, the 
creative chief behind Pixar Animation Studios blockbusters like 
"Finding Nemo," "The Incredibles" and "Monsters Inc." who now 
heads both studios' animation programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lasseter took over last year when Disney bought Pixar for 
$7.4 billion in an all-stock deal, and is widely perceived as 
the heir to company founder Walt Disney's animation vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investor eyes will be on 'Meet the Robinsons' as this is 
the first Disney animated film that will have the direct 
influence of John Lasseter," BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeff 
Logsdon wrote this week in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts pegged the film's opening weekend box office at 
$20 million to $30 million, well below last year's $68 million 
record for the weekend set by "Ice Age: The Meltdown" or 
Pixar's "Cars," which debuted last June with $60 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sander Morris Harris analyst David Miller estimated the 
film cost Disney about $52 million to make and $65 million to 
market and distribute. He said a $30 million opening weekend 
should guarantee a profit over the life of the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is the first time you will see Pixar's influence on a 
story that had already been done," Miller said. "If the film is 
successful it will prove to the Street that the $7.4 billion 
that Disney paid for Pixar is a damn good deal."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NO. 1 IN PRE-SALES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Meet the Robinsons," which is opening in 3,413 U.S. and 
Canada theaters, was No. 1 in advance ticket sales on Thursday 
at Fandango.com, the largest U.S. movie ticketing service with 
access to more than 15,000 screens, said Fandango spokesman 
Harry Medved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, "Robinsons" accounted for about 31 percent of 
ticket sales, compared with 23 percent for the No. 2 film, 
"Blades of Glory" and 18 percent for "300," Medved said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Box office grosses also may get a boost from premium ticket 
prices charged at roughly 700 screens that will show 
three-dimensional versions of the film, in the largest-ever 
release of a modern 3D film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While reviewers generally praised the film's cutting-edge 
animation, they had mixed opinions of its story and characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Associated Press reviewer Christy Lemire described the 
digital 3D effects as "pretty spectacular" and "eye candy," but 
added that "it's hard to feel too emotionally engaged by any of 
this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Entertainment Weekly reviewer Lisa Schwarzbaum rated the 
film as average with a grade of "C," calling it "one bumpy 
ride."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Fandango.com columnist Richard Horgan saw "Lasseter's 
fingerprints all over this thing because it pops the way a 
Pixar film does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It just has that bounce in its narrative step," Horgan 
told Reuters. "It's a great heralding of the Disney-Pixar era. 
It's just really encouraging."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds company declines comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, March 30 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) began
restarting units on Friday at its 243,000 barrel per day (bpd)
San Francisco Bay refinery in Richmond, California, after an
extended overhaul, according to notices filed with California
environmental regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The restart triggered minor flaring at the refinery when
the restart began shortly after midnight PDT (0700 GMT),
according to a notice filed with California Office of Emergency
Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A refinery spokeswoman declined to discuss operations at
the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Richmond refinery overhaul began in early February and
was originally planned to last six weeks, but Chevron extended
the work by three weeks to repair damage to a crude
distillation unit from a fire shortly before the overhaul
began.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details about former chairman's benefits)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N)
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's compensation rose 23 percent to
$27 million in 2006 when net income at the third-largest U.S.
bank surged 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said there were improved financial results in
2006, "but with opportunity for more to be done in 2007."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon received $1 million in salary and $26 million in
bonus and restricted stock, the bank disclosed in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Dimon also realized a
gain of $40.1 million from exercising previously awarded
options as the company's stock soared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also paid about $375,000 for Dimon's use of
company aircraft, including flights between New York, where the
company is based, and his home in Chicago. Dimon and his family
plan to relocate to New York later this year after his children
complete high school, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In December, Dimon succeeded William Harrison as the
company's chairman. Harrison's pay in 2006 was $22 million,
mostly in the form of a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harrison was not paid any severance when he retired, but
this month the company entered into an agreement that will
provide him office space and administrative support, carrying
an estimated annual cost of $267,0000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, the company also will provide Harrison access to
a car and driver for business and personal use and will
maintain his current home security arrangements. Those costs
are estimated at $682,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In January, Harrison forfeited 259,696 shares of restricted
stock, which didn't vest because JPMorgan's average share price
didn't equal or surpass $52 over 10 consecutive trading days.
The stock would have been worth about $13.5 million had it
vested at the target price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's co-chiefs of investment banking, Steven Black
and William Winters, received compensation of $21 million and
$21.1 million respectively, the company said.

"neutral" and lifted its six-month price target on the stock to
$9.25 from $7.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said there is an increased probability Emmis

balance sheet could stretch to support another go-private bid
without the sale of assets, or an outside equity partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even without a bid, Goldman still sees a challenging
revenue outlook and further fundamental deterioration
preventing any meaningful share appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emmis rose more than 5 percent to $8.46 in morning Nasdaq
trade.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco and U.S. giant ExxonMobil 
Corp.'s first big Chinese downstream oil venture has grown to 
$5 billion, much more than planned, the firms said on Friday as 
they closed the books on 12 years of talks.&lt;/p&gt;

$3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, the partners have added a marketing venture 
with 750 filling stations and a network of terminals, while 
refinery costs have risen worldwide because of a tight 
contractor market and escalating prices for raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking after a ceremony to commemorate final approval of 
the deal, Sinopec Corp.'s President Wang Tianpu told Reuters 
the cost difference was due entirely to the retail and 
wholesale operation. Aramco and Exxon Mobil declined immediate 
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is a coup for Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), the world's 
biggest publicly traded firm, which gets a rare and coveted 
foothold in the second-largest oil market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also gives the top oil exporter Saudi Arabia a 
guaranteed customer for its future output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it may also mark the end of an era of cooperation with 
major Western oil companies and clear preference for deals with 
major resource nations, leaving firms without any downstream 
ties like Chevron (CVX.N) or ConocoPhillips (COP.N) in the 
cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This (deal) was one of the few survivors from China's 
previous round of foreign cooperation," said Yan Kefeng, of 
Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The message is very clear now: new JVs will be geared 
toward such resource players like Venezuela, Russia, Kuwait."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China, an oil exporter 15 years ago, is increasingly 
anxious about its dependence on imports, now near the halfway 
point. Saudi Arabia supplies about 16 percent of its imported 
crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year it pledged a host of deals with Russian firms. 
Earlier this week Venezuela, which hopes eventually to sell 
more than 1 million barrels a day to China, agreed to open its 
oilfields to Chinese investment and to help build new 
refineries.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHINA DOMINANCE IN FUEL MARKETING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a flurry of interest in the 1990s, oil majors have 
also been slow to move in due to China's tight hold on domestic 
fuel distribution and retail prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fujian sales venture was only finally agreed after new 
rules opened the sector to foreign competition from 2007, Exxon 
Mobil's China head P.C. Tan told Reuters last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The changes were part of commitments China made when it 
joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinopec's dominance is evident in its 55 percent stake in 
the Fujian sales firm. Exxon and Aramco each holds 25 percent 
of the refinery and petrochemical projects but a smaller 22.5 
percent each in the marketing venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Sinopec has called off talks with Exxon for joint fuel 
distribution in Guangdong, China's wealthiest province despite 
a preliminary alliance agreed in 2000 when Exxon bought into 
Sinopec's IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon sold its 3.7 percent stake in Sinopec in early 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is no further plan for another joint venture with 
Exxon. The Guangdong venture has been called off," Sinopec 
Chairman Chen Tonghai told Reuters at the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he said talks were ongoing for a second joint venture 
refinery in eastern China's Shandong province with Aramco, 
expected to get about 25 percent stake in the 200,000 bpd 
plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fujian project will upgrade and triple the capacity of 
the existing Fujian oil refinery to 240,000 barrels per day 
(bpd) and build a facility to unload supertankers. It is due to 
start production in early 2009, processing primarily sour 
Arabian crude, a joint statement by the three companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They will also build an 800,000 tonnes per year (tpy) 
ethylene cracker and associated chemical units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details throughout, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Jonathan Stempel &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - A Manhattan federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) investors who accused the third-largest U.S. bank of helping Enron Corp. hide fraud. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The plaintiffs had alleged they bought JPMorgan stock based on the New York bank's reputation for integrity and financial discipline, when in fact the company was helping Enron, a major client, hide billions of dollars of debt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In a 26-page ruling released on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein said the plaintiffs failed to show that JPMorgan deceived or intended to deceive them by downplaying its exposure to Enron, or overstating its own integrity.  Stein dismissed the five-year-old case with prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs cannot raise their claims again. He had dismissed an earlier complaint in March 2005, but allowed the plaintiffs to refile their case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This version of the complaint ... suffers from the same flaws as the first," the judge wrote. "If plaintiffs' allegations are borne out, it would be not they but the shareholders of Enron -- the real victims of the energy giant's collapse -- who would have been defrauded." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Stein also rejected claims that William Harrison, JPMorgan's former chairman and chief executive, should be held liable in the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately return a call seeking comment. JPMorgan spokesman Adam Castellani declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan agreed in June 2005 to pay $2.2 billion to settle its part of a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of former Enron investors against the energy trader's former banks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Total payouts in that case topped $7 billion, including about $2.4 billion by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM.TO) and $2 billion by Citigroup Inc. (C.N) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the JPMorgan class-action case, the plaintiffs had argued that the bank defrauded them from Nov. 1999, when the shares traded as high as $58.25, to July 2002, when they were as low as $18.25. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, 2001. JPMorgan agreed in 2005 to pay $350 million in separate litigation brought by Enron's liquidators.  JPMorgan shares closed on Thursday up 51 cents at $48.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Carol Bishopric; Reuters Messaging: jon.stempel.reuters.com@reuters.net, 646 223 6317)) Keywords: JPMORGAN ENRON/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.
