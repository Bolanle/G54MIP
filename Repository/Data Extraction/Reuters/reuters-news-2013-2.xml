&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Elisse Walter said Friday she is unsure how long she will stay at the agency after Mary Jo White is confirmed by the Senate as the SEC's new chief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I will certainly be here until the new chairman gets confirmed and comes onboard," Walter told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of the SEC's Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies. "I have sort of decided not to think about it right now. That may be a very short time. It may be a very long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I want to think about is what work I have to do when I get up in the morning. The other is something I will leave as a decision for later," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter took the helm of the SEC in December after Mary Schapiro stepped down as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is able to continue serving at the SEC as a commissioner until the end of the year. Were she to stay longer, the U.S. Senate would need to reconfirm her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter has never publicly discussed her future ambitions, though it was widely believed she was among those being considered by the White House as a longer-term candidate to chair the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, however, President Barack Obama announced that he was nominating White, a former federal prosecutor, to head the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White, who as U.S. Attorney for Manhattan prosecuted terrorists and mob bosses as well as white-collar criminals, does not have much SEC policy experience. But she spent her recent years in private practice representing some major players in the financial crisis, and her husband, John White, previously served as the director of the SEC's corporation finance division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White's nomination has so far drawn little opposition, likely meaning that she will be speedily confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until White is confirmed, Walter said, the SEC would press forward on a number of initiatives, including an agreement on reforms for the money market fund industry, a proposal for how over-the-counter derivatives rules will apply overseas, and a rule to lift a long-time ban on general advertising in private placements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the sidelines of Friday's meeting, SEC Republican Commissioner Daniel Gallagher said the agency is making progress on money market fund reforms and that commissioners are reviewing a "term sheet," or an early-stage document outlining a potential course of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there is a path forward developing," Gallagher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Sarah N.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/5bk8j6/securities) has announced the
addition of the "Securities Brokerages" report to their offering. 

The securities brokerage industry in the US includes about 7,500 companies with
combined annual revenue of about $145 billion. Major companies include Charles
Schwab, Edward Jones, and brokerage units of large financial services companies
such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup. The industry is highly
concentrated: the top 50 companies account for more than 80 percent of revenue. 

Many large US-based brokers, particularly those affiliated with major banks and
financial services companies, operate internationally from offices in the UK and
China, among other places. Top global securities brokers include Deutsche Bank
(Germany), Macquarie Group (Australia), and Credit Suisse and UBS AG
(Switzerland). 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Demand is driven by the returns of securities markets relative to alternative
investments. The profitability of individual companies depends on efficient
operations and good marketing. Large companies have economies of scale in
operations and high name recognition. Small companies can compete effectively by
offering better customer service. The industry is capital-intensive; average
annual revenue per employee is more than $500,000. 

The traditional brokerage industry that sold stocks to individual investors has
largely evolved into companies that either broker large stock trades for
institutional investors or sell a variety of investment products to individuals.
Instead of buying individual securities, many individuals now invest in mutual
funds.

&lt;p&gt;By Christopher Swann&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2012 may be as good as it gets for Exxon Mobil. America&#8217;s largest oil company pumped out a near-record profit and its best earnings per share ever. But Exxon, like Chevron, is spending huge sums &#8211; almost $40 billion last year  to find and extract reserves. Holding output steady is tough enough. Unless oil prices jump, Exxon may have peaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big boost to the bottom line for America&#8217;s two top oil titans didn&#8217;t come from their main exploration and production divisions, but from processing and refining. That&#8217;s because the oil and gas needed to run this side of the business was cheap and plentiful in the United States, driving down costs. That helped Exxon as a whole generate $44.9 billion of net income  within a whisker of 2008&#8217;s $45.2 billion record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topping this feat in the future won&#8217;t be easy. Earnings from its refining and chemical operations account for just a third of Exxon&#8217;s profit and a tenth of Chevron&#8217;s. What would move the needle is an improvement in their two main businesses  both companies suffered a decline in production last year despite years of escalating outlays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversing that trend looks hard, though. Oil-rich nations are becoming more protective of their natural resources, so the likes of Exxon have to resort to drilling for more expensive oil trapped in rocks, the ocean depths or the frigid Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That requires spending much more money, which helps explain why Exxon&#8217;s capital spending has jumped by almost a quarter since 2010. Worse, in some instances costs are running ahead of expectations &#8211; by 10 percent at its oil-sands project in Canada, the company admitted on Friday. That&#8217;s a rare embarrassment for a company obsessed with operational discipline. Chevron&#8217;s spending, meanwhile, leapt by 17 percent last year  in large part due to ramping up its liquefied natural gas operations in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting its operations Down Under online should at least provide some relief for Chevron. Exxon, though, has no spurt in output in sight. Aggressive share buybacks may keep earnings-per-share performance high. But boosting net income will require higher oil prices. With global growth tepid, that looks too much for shareholders to hope for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Renewed strength in refining and chemicals led to higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings for Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the two largest U.S. oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flood of oil produced from U.S. shale formations has pushed refining margins higher for many companies with plants in the United States, while chemical producers are benefiting from the low price of natural gas, a key feedstock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Youngberg, energy company analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis, said bigger-than-expected refining earnings "were a common theme for this quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's overall profit was $9.95 billion, or $2.20 per share, compared with $9.4 billion, or $1.97 per share, in the same period a year earlier, as its refining arm's earnings quadrupled to $1.77 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we look at just our U.S. Gulf coast refining circuit, we have more than tripled the processing of advantaged North American crude over the last couple of years," David Rosenthal, Exxon's investor relations executive, told analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's refining margins were also boosted by cheaper Canadian crude oil, Rosenthal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chief Executive John Watson said its refineries in Utah and British Columbia had been processing low-priced North American crude, though transporting it to its Mississippi plant or to its two West Coast refineries had been a bigger challenge so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have moved a little bit there, but it is a longer haul so it is not clear that we will be able to take advantage of it in that way," Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, reported a rise in net income to $7.2 billion, or $3.70 per share, from $5.1 billion, or $2.58 per share, a year earlier - though the latest profit included a $1.4 billion one-time gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's refining operations made a profit of $925 million, compared with a loss of $61 million a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing output from the wellhead, on the other hand, has been a struggle in the past year for big oil companies. Shares of ConocoPhillips (COP.N) fell on Thursday after its production outlook disappointed investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust and a Chevron shareholder, noted Conoco was struggling while its spun-off refining arm, Phillips 66 (PSX.N), did well in what remains a highly cyclical business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The refining side can be a two-edged sword, being a tailwind as well as a headwind," Cecilia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's oil and gas output fell 5 percent to 4.29 million barrels oil equivalent per day (bpd). Chevron managed an increase to 2.67 million bpd after a year of underperformance, and predicted 2013 average output of 2.65 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the full year, Exxon's output fell 5.9 percent, or about 1 percent below the company's projections for the year, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stem the output decline, Exxon is investing heavily in projects like the Kearl oilsands in Alberta and the Bakken shale formation in North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon also has an ambitious joint venture with Russia's state oil company Rosneft (ROSN.MM) to use horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to explore for oil in Western Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Exxon spent a record $40 billion, a figure that includes $3 billion in acquisitions, Rosenthal told analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's Watson responded to concerns about its large cash balance by saying it would fall over the next few years due to capital investments and returns of money to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the crippled Richmond refinery on San Francisco Bay, Watson said it was on track to start its crude unit back up this quarter once it does internal checks and gets a nod from worker safety regulator Cal/OSHA -- which just issued a record fine to Chevron for the August fire at Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon were unchanged at $89.97 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Chevron shares rose 0.7 percent to $115.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Anna Driver and Braden Reddall; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Alden Bentley)&lt;/p&gt;

balance by saying it would fall over the next few years due to
capital investments and returns of money to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the crippled Richmond refinery on San Francisco Bay,
Watson said it was on track to start its crude unit back up this
quarter once it does internal checks and gets a nod from worker
safety regulator Cal/OSHA -- which just issued a record fine to
Chevron for the August fire at Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon were unchanged at $89.97 in midday trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, while Chevron shares rose 0.7
percent to $115.98.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported today that Bruno Iksil, the credit trader nicknamed &#8216;the London Whale&#8217; for the outsized positions he took in the small market for the CDX Index, warned his bosses a year ago that the size of his desk&#8217;s positions had gotten &#8220;scary.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan admitted as much in the internal report it released to the public on Jan. 16, but kept Iksil&#8217;s name out of emails quoted in the report, supposedly to protect UK privacy laws. The Journal got confirmation that Iksil was indeed the author of the emails, and that he made a presentation expressing his worries to the bank&#8217;s chief investment officer, Ina Drew, on Feb. 3, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to JPMorgan&#8217;s report, Drew &#8220;appeared not to be overly concerned&#8221; when Iksil told her that the portfolio with the CDX positions could lose up to $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could that be the key to why JPMorgan had to restate its first quarter earnings report after admitting in July that the losses the chief investment office incurred on the CDX trades were bigger than it expected? If Drew had listened to Iksil, she would perhaps have been able to warn her bosses before then-CFO Doug Braunstein signed off on the first-quarter earnings report released in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Journal has demonstrated, JPMorgan&#8217;s report is richer with news than it may first have appeared to be. Specifically, the timing of the first alarms CIO employees raised about the CDX positions deserves some closer scrutiny. How was buzz of fear inside the CIO able to be contained, when other aspects of the losses, such as Iksil&#8217;s complaint to JPMorgan&#8217;s compliance department that the CIO was being squeezed by the investment bank, were not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan&#8217;s top managers knew sooner than April about the CIO&#8217;s enormous CDX positions and the storm they were causing in the CDX market, the bank could have a harder time fending off shareholder claims and smoothing things over in Washington. Iksil&#8217;s alert also makes it hard to believe he would have tried to cover up losses by marking the CDX positions at a higher value than they deserved, as a JPMorgan report last summer suggested he and others might have done. The U.S. criminal investigation into that matter is still underway. Anyone looking for culpability would have to admit that in this case, timing is everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And maybe the traders in the London CIO office werent as much the reckless cowboys the bank has made them out to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 1 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co's six-month
power trading ban will not affect existing contracts the bank
has already sold, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said
in a filing on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank had asked FERC to clarify whether the
ban on selling electricity at market-based rates in some U.S.
markets, which is due to start on April 1, would apply to
electricity contracts it has already sold for that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where the Commission has previously suspended a seller's
market-based rate authority upon finding or presuming that a
seller has market power," FERC said, "the contractual
obligations entered into by the seller prior to the suspension
have remained in effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the six months from April 1, JP Morgan will only be
allowed to make physical electricity sales at cost. Market-based
rate authority allows a company to trade power at whatever price
the market will bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC imposed the suspension on JP Morgan Ventures Energy
Corp's, the bank's power trading arm, back in November, saying
it had failed to disclose information in an investigation into
market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC has not accused the U.S. bank of market manipulation.
JP Morgan has said it will fight the sanction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JP Morgan spokeswoman declined to comment on the FERC
ruling on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC is currently debating whether to grant the bank a

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's government and state oil company PDVSA are in urgent talks over a long-expected $6 billion in loans from China and U.S. energy giant Chevron that would help relieve the nation's strained finances, sources close to the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said this week that PDVSA had no plans to issue any more dollar-denominated bonds, confounding widespread speculation that one was planned to address a chronic shortage of dollars for local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has left the government in the OPEC member seeking other forms of financing, amid pressure to order a devaluation of its currency that would ease the pressure on its cash flow by providing more bolivars for every dollar of oil sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its top priority is a deal agreed last year with China Development Bank for a $4 billion loan this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela has borrowed $36 billion from China in recent years - repaid with oil shipments - making Beijing the single biggest foreign source of funding for the country's socialist government, according to finance ministry data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a source close to the talks told Reuters that the Chinese team wanted to toughen the terms of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Chinese have introduced a clause that the Venezuela team decided to reject," the source said, without describing the proposed change. "That was holding things up until recently, but they are coming to an agreement on the amendment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a PDVSA team is negotiating a private loan of $2 billion with U.S. oil company Chevron (CVX.N), the source said, adding that the proposed credit is intended to be used to increase crude production at the two companies' joint venture, Petroboscan, in western Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source with knowledge of those discussions said PDVSA had proposed to Chevron that the deal reached in 2012 - a 13-year repayment term with an interest rate of Libor plus 4.5 points - be substantially revised. That suggestion met strong resistance from Chevron, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDVSA and the government declined to comment on the talks, and Chevron didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The Chinese embassy in Caracas did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRESSURE ON PARTNERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of investment, especially in western regions of South America's biggest crude exporter, has led to falling output at the mature fields since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the end of 2010, the government has been putting pressure on partners in some 20 joint ventures to find extra funding to raise output, and threatening to cancel their permits if they fail. Petroboscan is 60 percent controlled by PDVSA and pumps 115,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current debt negotiations may be more fraught than they would have been, due to the uncertainty around the absence of President Hugo Chavez, who has not been seen since having cancer surgery in Cuba on December 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDVSA and the government declined to comment on the talks, and Chevron didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The Chinese embassy in Caracas did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Venezuela and PDVSA issued a combined $17.5 billion in global bonds, adding to the high-performing notes that are among the world's most widely-traded emerging market debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But issuance dropped to $3 billion last year as Venezuela boosted sales of local-market bonds and lawmakers voted to double the arrangement with China Development Bank so that the government could borrow up to $8 billion at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan business leaders complain about growing economic imbalances that they say have been caused by insecurity, bad policies and the uncertainty surrounding Chavez's absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many argue that a currency devaluation is long overdue, to make exports more competitive and spur domestic industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vice President Nicolas Maduro said last weekend that Chavez had taken a series of major economic decisions "to strengthen exports", feeding rumors that a devaluation was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the government has unveiled a series of moves that boost the amount of dollars available to the central bank, as well as make it easier for local businesses to access the hard currency they need to buy imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Daniel Wallis; Editing by Kieran Murray and W Simon)&lt;/p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that its former animal health business
unit, now a standalone company named ZoetisTM, began trading on the New York
Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "ZTS." 

"This is a proud moment for all Zoetis and Pfizer employees," said Ian Read,
chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer. "With the Zoetis initial public
offering, we are creating the largest standalone company fully devoted to animal
health medicines and vaccines. For Pfizer, we are better positioned to focus on
our core business as an innovative biopharmaceutical company, by unlocking value
from the animal health business that will return value to Pfizer shareholders." 

Building on a 60-year history as the animal health business of Pfizer, Zoetis
discovers, develops, manufactures and markets veterinary vaccines and medicines
for livestock and companion animals. Pfizer announced in 2012 that it would
pursue an initial public offering (IPO) of a minority ownership stake in its
animal health business unit as part of its long-term strategy to focus on the
company`s core biopharmaceuticals business. 

Serving health needs across eight animal species, including farm animals such as
cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and fish, and companion animals such as dogs, cats
and horses, Zoetis` diversified portfolio of more than 300 product lines spans
five categories: vaccines, parasiticides, anti-infectives, medicated feed
additives, and other pharmaceuticals for veterinarians and livestock producers. 

"Since 1952, our animal health business has served the needs of those who raise
and care for animals with high quality medicines and vaccines. Now, as Zoetis,
it is well positioned to pursue the growth strategies that will enhance its
global reach and drive further commercial success. We congratulate our Zoetis
colleagues on this important milestone," said Read.

an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or
jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior
to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any state or

EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED: 

"Energy is fundamental to economic growth and improved living
standards.ExxonMobil`s strong financial performance enables continued investment
in new energy supplies, which creates jobs and supports economic expansion.

"Fourth quarter 2012 earnings were over $9.9 billion, up 6% from the fourth
quarter of 2011.Full year 2012 earnings were $44.9 billion, up 9% from 2011,
with record earnings per share of $9.70.

"Capital and exploration expenditures were a record $39.8 billion in 2012 as we
continue pursuing opportunities to find and produce new supplies of oil and
natural gas to meet global demand for energy.

"In 2012, the Corporation distributed over $30 billion to shareholders through
dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding."

FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

* Earnings of $9,950 million increased $550 million or 6% from the fourth
quarter of 2011. 
* Earnings per share (assuming dilution) were $2.20, an increase of 12% from the
fourth quarter of 2011. 
* Gains from asset sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 were nearly $600 million,
down $800 million from the prior year. 
* LIFO inventory gains were over $300 million for the fourth quarter of 2012,
similar to the 2011 level. 
* Capital and exploration expenditures were $12.4 billion, up 24% from the
fourth quarter of 2011. 
* Oil-equivalent production decreased 5% from the fourth quarter of 2011.
Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production decreased 2%. 
* Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $14.0 billion, including
proceeds associated with asset sales of $0.8 billion. 
* Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $5 billion. 
* Dividends per share of $0.57 increased 21% compared to the fourth quarter of
2011. 
* ExxonMobil commenced start-up operations at one of the world`s largest
ethylene steam crackers, the centerpiece of the company`s multi-billion dollar
expansion at its Singapore petrochemical complex. Powered by a new 220-megawatt
cogeneration plant, the expansion adds 2.6 million tonnes per year of new
finished product capacity. 
* As announced on January 4, 2013, ExxonMobil will develop the Hebron oil field
offshore the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador using a
gravity-based structure that will recover more than 700 million barrels of oil,
an increase versus earlier estimates. Capital cost for the project, which is
expected to begin oil production around the end of 2017, is estimated at $14
billion. The platform is being designed for daily production of 150,000 barrels
of oil.

Fourth Quarter 2012 vs. Fourth Quarter 2011

Upstream earnings were $7,762 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, down $1,067
million from the fourth quarter of 2011. Lower liquids realizations, partially
offset by improved natural gas realizations, decreased earnings by $70 million.
Production volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $400 million. All other
items, including over $500 million of lower gains from asset sales, decreased
earnings by a net $600 million. 

On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 5.2% from the fourth quarter of
2011. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production decreased 2.1%. 

Liquids production totaled 2,203 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 47 kbd
from the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes,
OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was down 1.4%, as field
decline was partially offset by project ramp-up in West Africa and lower
downtime. 

Fourth quarter natural gas production was 12,541 mcfd (millions of cubic feet
per day), down 1,136 mcfd from 2011. Excluding the impacts of entitlement
volumes and divestments, natural gas production was down 2.8%, as field decline
was partially offset by higher demand and lower downtime. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,604 million, $420 million higher
than the fourth quarter of 2011. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $6,158 million,
down $1,487 million from the prior year. 

Downstream earnings were $1,768 million, up $1,343 million from the fourth
quarter of 2011. Stronger refining-driven margins increased earnings by $1.2
billion, while volume and mix effects contributed an additional $80 million. All
other items increased earnings by about $80 million. Petroleum product sales of
6,108 kbd were 385 kbd lower than last year's fourth quarter due mainly to the
Japan restructuring and divestments. 

Earnings from the U.S. Downstream were $697 million, up $667 million from the
fourth quarter of 2011. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $1,071 million were $676
million higher than last year. 

Chemical earnings of $958 million were $415 million higher than the fourth
quarter of 2011. Higher margins, mainly commodities, increased earnings by $330
million. All other items increased earnings by $90 million. Fourth quarter prime
product sales of 5,901 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 370 kt lower than last
year's fourth quarter due mainly to the Japan restructuring. 

Corporate and financing expenses were $538 million for the fourth quarter of
2012, up $141 million from the fourth quarter of 2011, due mainly to tax
impacts. 

During the fourth quarter of 2012, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 59 million
shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $5.3 billion.
These purchases included $5.0 billion to reduce the number of shares
outstanding, with the balance used to acquire shares in conjunction with the
company`s benefit plans and programs. Share purchases to reduce shares
outstanding are currently anticipated to equal $5 billion in the first quarter
of 2013. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated
transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time
without prior notice. 

Full Year 2012 vs. Full Year 2011

Earnings of $44,880 million increased $3,820 million from 2011. Earnings per
share increased 15% to $9.70. 

FULL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS

* Earnings were $44,880 million, up 9%. 
* Earnings include $9.9 billion of divestment and restructuring gains, mainly
Japan of $6.5 billion. 
* Earnings per share increased 15% to $9.70. 
* Oil-equivalent production was down 6% from 2011. Excluding the impacts of
entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was down 2%.

* Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $63.8 billion, including
proceeds associated with asset sales of $7.7 billion. 
* The Corporation distributed over $30 billion to shareholders in 2012 through
dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. 
* Capital and exploration expenditures were a record $39.8 billion. 
* The Corporation participated in three major liquids project start-ups in West
Africa in 2012 with capacity of 350 thousand gross barrels of oil per day.

Upstream earnings were $29,895 million, down $4,544 million from 2011. Lower
liquids realizations, partly offset by improved natural gas realizations,
decreased earnings by about $100 million. Production volume and mix effects
decreased earnings by $2.3 billion. All other items, including higher operating
expenses, unfavorable tax items, lower gains on asset sales, and unfavorable
foreign exchange effects, reduced earnings by $2.1 billion. 

On an oil-equivalent basis, production was down 5.9% compared to 2011. Excluding
the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments,
production was down 1.7%. 

Liquids production of 2,185 kbd decreased 127 kbd from 2011. Excluding the
impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids
production was down 1.6%, as field decline was partly offset by project ramp-up
in West Africa and lower downtime. 

Natural gas production of 12,322 mcfd decreased 840 mcfd from 2011. Excluding
the impacts of entitlement volumes and divestments, natural gas production was
down 1.9%, as field decline was partially offset by higher demand and lower
downtime. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2012 were $3,925 million, down $1,171
million from 2011. Earnings outside the U.S. were $25,970 million, down $3,373
million. 

Downstream earnings of $13,190 million increased $8,731 million from 2011.
Stronger refining-driven margins increased earnings by $2.6 billion, while
volume and mix effects increased earnings by about $200 million. All other items
increased earnings by $5.9 billion due primarily to the $5.3 billion gain
associated with the Japan restructuring and other divestment gains. Petroleum
product sales of 6,174 kbd decreased 239 kbd from 2011 due mainly to the Japan
restructuring and divestments. 

U.S. Downstream earnings were $3,575 million, up $1,307 million from 2011.
Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $9,615 million, an increase of $7,424 million
from last year. 

Chemical earnings of $3,898 million were $485 million lower than 2011. Margins
decreased earnings by $440 million, while volume effects lowered earnings by
$100 million. All other items increased earnings by $50 million, as a $630
million gain associated with the Japan restructuring and favorable tax impacts
were mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects and higher operating
expenses. Prime product sales of 24,157 kt were down 849 kt from 2011. 

Corporate and financing expenses were $2,103 million, down $118 million from
2011. 

Gross share purchases for 2012 were $21.1 billion, reducing shares outstanding
by 244 million shares.

Cautionary statement

Statements relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are
forward-looking statements.Actual results, including project plans, costs,
timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource
recoveries; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors
including: changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting
Future Results" in the "Investors" section of our website and in Item 1A of
ExxonMobil's 2011 Form 10-K.We assume no duty to update these statements as of
any future date.

Frequently used terms

Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both earnings
excluding special items and earnings per share excluding special items.Both are
non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of
base business performance across periods.Reconciliation to net income
attributable to ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.The release also includes
cash flow from operations and asset sales.Because of the regular nature of our
asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors
to consider proceeds associated with the sales of subsidiaries, property, plant
and equipment, and sales and returns of investments together with cash provided
by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the
business and financing activities.A reconciliation to net cash provided by
operating activities is shown in Attachment II.References in this release to
barrels of oil include amounts that are not yet classified as proved reserves
under SEC definitions but that we believe will ultimately be produced.Further
information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and
other terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available
through the "Investors" section of our website at exxonmobil.com.

The term "project" as used in this release does not necessarily have the same
meaning as under SEC Rule 13q-1 relating to government payment reporting.For
example, a single project for purposes of the rule may encompass numerous
properties, agreements, investments, developments, phases, work efforts,
activities and components, each of which we may also informally describe as a
"project."

&lt;p&gt;Feb 1 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp posted a rise in
quarterly profit on Friday as its refining arm managed to
improve earnings despite the crippling of the company's oldest
refinery last August by a fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil producer said fourth-quarter net
income rose to $7.2 billion, or $3.70 per share, from $5.1

asset exchange. Including that gain, earnings in the oil and gas
production business rose 20 percent to $6.9 billion, and
refining operations posted a profit of $925 million, compared
with a loss of $61 million a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Oil and gas reserves replacement reaches 112 percent for the year
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today reported earnings of $7.2 billion ($3.70
per share - diluted) for the fourth quarter 2012, compared with $5.1 billion
($2.58 per share - diluted) in the 2011 fourth quarter. Results in the 2012
period included a gain of $1.4 billion from an upstream asset exchange. 

Full-year 2012 earnings were $26.2 billion ($13.32 per share - diluted), down 3
percent from $26.9 billion ($13.44 per share - diluted) in 2011. 

Sales and other operating revenues in the fourth quarter 2012 were $56 billion,
down from $58 billion in the year-ago period, mainly due to lower crude oil
volumes.

"Chevron delivered another very strong year in 2012," said Chairman and CEO John
Watson. "Our upstream portfolio continues to produce excellent results. We`ve
now led the industry in earnings per barrel for over three years. Our downstream
businesses also delivered highly competitive earnings per barrel." 

"Strong cash flows allowed us to invest aggressively in our major capital
projects and to acquire several important, new resource opportunities. We also
raised the dividend on our common shares for the 25th consecutive year and
continued our share repurchase program, both of which demonstrate our commitment
to providing near-term, top-tier returns to our shareholders." 

Watson continued, "We made significant progress on our Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG
projects in Australia in the past year. At the same time, we announced six
additional natural gas discoveries offshore Australia, and completed an asset
exchange that increased our interests in Carnarvon Basin fields. These results
support future expansion opportunities for these two projects." 

"We also expanded our global exploration resource acreage in 2012," Watson
noted, "including entries into five new countries, the addition of significant
new acreage in the United States, and the recently announced acquisition of a 50
percent operated interest in a western Canada LNG project." 

Watson commented that the company added approximately 1.07 billion barrels of
net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2012. These additions, which are subject
to final reviews, equate to 112 percent of net oil-equivalent production for the
year. The largest additions were for the Gorgon Project, as a result of
development drilling and additional reservoir data. Also significant were
additions for fields in the United States, Asia and offshore eastern Canada. The
company will provide additional details relating to 2012 reserve additions in
its Annual Report on Form 10-K scheduled for filing with the SEC on February 22.


"In the downstream business, we completed a multiyear plan to streamline the
asset portfolio. We continued to focus our investments toward higher growth and
higher margin products," Watson added. In 2012, the company`s 50 percent-owned
affiliate, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, announced the beginning of
commercial production at a petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia, and the
initiation of front-end engineering and design for several petrochemical
projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Significant progress was also made on the
construction of new capacity to make premium base oil at the company`s
Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery and additional capacity at the company`s
existing additives plant in Singapore. 

The company purchased $1.25 billion of its common stock in fourth quarter 2012
under its share repurchase program. Repurchases for the full year totaled $5
billion. At year end, balances of cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and
marketable securities totaled $21.9 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion from
the end of 2011. Total debt at December 31, 2012 stood at $12.2 billion, an
increase of $2.0 billion from a year earlier. 

UPSTREAM

Worldwide net oil-equivalent production was 2.67 million barrels per day in the
fourth quarter 2012, up from 2.64 million barrels per day in the 2011 fourth
quarter. Production increases from project ramp-ups in Nigeria, the United
States and Thailand, higher cost recovery volumes in Bangladesh and new volumes
from the recently-acquired Delaware Basin properties were partially offset by
normal field declines and the continued shut-in of the Frade Field in Brazil.

U.S. upstream earnings of $1.36 billion in the fourth quarter 2012 were down
$242 million from a year earlier. Lower crude oil and natural gas realizations
were partially offset by higher crude oil production. 

The company`s average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas
liquids was $91 in the fourth quarter 2012, down from $101 a year ago. The
average sales price of natural gas was $3.22 per thousand cubic feet, compared
with $3.62 in last year`s fourth quarter. 

Net oil-equivalent production of 674,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter
2012 increased 13,000 barrels per day, or 2 percent, from a year earlier. The
increase in production was primarily due to further ramp-up of projects in the
Gulf of Mexico and the recently-acquired Delaware Basin properties, partially
offset by an absence of volumes associated with Cook Inlet, Alaska, assets sold
in 2011. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production increased 3
percent in the 2012 fourth quarter to 462,000 barrels per day, while net natural
gas production decreased 1 percent to 1.27 billion cubic feet per day.

International upstream earnings of $5.5 billion increased $1.4 billion from the
fourth quarter 2011. The increase between quarters primarily reflected a gain of
approximately $1.4 billion on an asset exchange in Australia. Foreign currency
effects decreased earnings by $34 million, compared with a decrease of $3
million a year earlier. 

The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in the 2012 fourth
quarter was $100 per barrel, compared with $101 a year earlier. The average
price of natural gas was $5.97 per thousand cubic feet, up from $5.55 in last
year`s fourth quarter. 

Net oil-equivalent production of 1.99 million barrels per day in the fourth
quarter 2012 increased 14,000 barrels per day from a year ago. Production
increases from project ramp-ups in Nigeria and Thailand and higher cost recovery
volumes in Bangladesh were partially offset by the continued shut-in of the
Frade Field in Brazil.The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production
decreased 3 percent to 1.33 million barrels per day, while net natural gas
production increased 8 percent to 3.96 billion cubic feet per day.

U.S. downstream operations earned $331 million in the fourth quarter 2012,
compared with a loss of $204 million a year earlier. The increase was due to
improved margins on refined products and higher earnings from the 50
percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. 

Refinery crude oil input of 702,000 barrels per day in fourth quarter 2012
decreased 61,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period, primarily due to an
early-August fire at the refinery in Richmond, California that shut down the
crude unit. Refined product sales of 1.15 million barrels per day were down
75,000 barrels per day from fourth quarter 2011, mainly reflecting lower
gasoline, gas oil and kerosene sales. Branded gasoline sales decreased 2 percent
to 507,000 barrels per day.

International downstream operations earned $594 million in the fourth quarter
2012, compared with $143 million a year earlier. Current quarter earnings
benefited from higher gains on asset sales, primarily reflecting the sale of the
company`s fuels marketing businesses in three countries in the Caribbean. A
favorable change in effects on derivative instruments and improved margins on
refined products also contributed to the higher earnings in the 2012 quarter. 

Refinery crude oil input of 918,000 barrels per day increased 113,000 barrels
per day from fourth quarter 2011, primarily due to consolidation of the 64
percent-owned Star Petroleum Refining Company beginning June 2012. Total refined
product sales of 1.57 million barrels per day in the 2012 fourth quarter were
flat compared to a year earlier.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF
"SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to Chevron`s
operations that are based on management`s current expectations, estimates and
projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries.
Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "targets,"
"forecasts," "projects," "believes," "seeks," "schedules," "estimates,"
"budgets," "outlook" and similar expressions are intended to identify such
forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors,
many of which are beyond the company`s control and are difficult to predict.
Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is
expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should
not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only
as of the date of this press release. Unless legally required, Chevron
undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural
gas prices; changing refining, marketing and chemical margins; actions of
competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil
liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product
substitutes; technological developments; the results of operations and financial
condition of equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company`s
joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development
activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from
existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential
delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the
potential disruption or interruption of the company`s production or
manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation networks due to war,
accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude oil
production quotas that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments
under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant
investment or product changes required by existing or future environmental
statutes, regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from
other pending or future litigation; the company`s future acquisition or
disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or
impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations,
industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of
company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar;
the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting
principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors set forth under
the heading "Risk Factors" on pages 29 through 31 of the company`s 2011 Annual
Report on Form 10-K. In addition, such results could be affected by general
domestic and international economic and political conditions. Other
unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this press release could also
have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/j9z3v6/global) has announced the
addition of the "Global Metal-cutting Machine Market 2012-2016" report to their
offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Metal Cutting Machine market to grow at
a CAGR of 5.39 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors
contributing to this market growth is the need for machining materials of
increased hardness. The Global Metal Cutting Machine market has also been
witnessing the development of smaller metal cutting machines. However, the need
for increased investment could pose a challenge to the growth of this market. 

The key vendors dominating this market space are Gildemeister AG, Dalian Machine
Tool Group Corp., and Mag Machine and Tool LLC. 

The other vendors mentioned in the report are Yamazaki Mazak Corp., Okuma Corp.,
Makino Milling Machine Co. Ltd., Haas Automation Inc., JTKET Corp., Doosan
Group, Index-Traub, Hyundai WIA Corp., Grob-Werke GmbH and Co. KG, Heller
Machine Tools Ltd., GF Agie Charmilles, Kitamura Machinery Co. Ltd., Femco
Machine Co LLC, and Yeong Chin Machinery Industries Co. Ltd. (YCM). 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Engineering team said:
''With the increased investment of the global production and manufacturing
companies, the APAC region has witnessed the need for the development of quality
products (at a cheaper price and in minimal time) and increased investment in
quality metal-cutting machines for enhanced productivity. For this reason,
several metal-cutting machine vendors are setting up demo centers and
exhibitions across these regions to increase their market reach and their
potential to tap the end-users. In addition, industrial exhibitions are being
held in several industrial areas in countries such as China and India to
increase the awareness of high-speed machining and quality product
development.'' 

According to the report, one of the main drivers is the need for faster
time-to-market. Metal-cutting machines are deployed across industries for
developing superior-quality products in minimal time.

&lt;p&gt;Analysts at JPMorgan Securities led by Domingos Falavina raised
the price target and recommendation on shares in Brazilian card
payment processor Cielo SA and insurance broker
Brasil Insurance SA because of their resilience to
lackluster economic activity and their current, more appealing
valuations relative to other financial stocks. Falavina and his
team upped the target on Cielo to 64 reais from a prior 53
reais, and on Brasil Insurance to 25 reais from 21 reais. Both
stocks have now an "overweight" recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts also cut their recommendations on Brazilian
insurer Porto Seguro SA and Bolsa Mexicana de Valores
SAB to "neutral" and left their price targets
unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Qara Hansher or "black fig" field in disputed area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Exxon mulling whether to stay at southern oilfield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Baghdad, Kurdistan have built up rival military posts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ahmed Rasheed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil and Iraqi
Kurdistan officials visited an oil exploration block caught in a
dispute between Baghdad's central government and the autonomous
Kurdish region, and discussed building a camp there, a local
official and sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks at the Qara Hansher block between an Exxon executive
and a top Kurdistan oil official could provoke Baghdad at a
sensitive time for the Arab-led central government and the
self-ruled Kurdish enclave in their feud over oil and land
rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it signed for six oil blocks with Kurdistan last year,
Exxon has been at the centre of the growing disagreement between
Baghdad and Kurdistan that threatens to fracture the OPEC
member's uneasy federal union a year after U.S. troops left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visit came as Exxon weighs whether to stay or pull out
of its huge West Qurna oilfield in the Iraqi south or keep its
Kurdistan fields. Iraqi and Kurdish officials have both
suggested Exxon will side with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Qara Hansher field, where the meeting took place on
Wednesday just north of Kirkuk, sits in the swath of disputed
territories, where both regions claim jurisdiction and where
Iraqi Arab and Kurdish troops have reinforced positions in a
tense standoff since last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the meeting we discussed the work of Exxon Mobil in Qara
Hansher block and we discussed how to facilitate the company's
work," Avesta Sheikh Mohammed, the local Kurdish major of the
area. "The Kurdistan Regional Government has all the right to
sign oil deals to develop energy resources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Iraqi oil official and a Kurdistan oil official confirmed
the meeting had taken place to talk over building a camp in the
block in the low hills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No work or drilling has started at the Qara Hansher block -
whose name means "black fig" in Kurdish - and the talks were for
an initial site, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qara Hasher shows the complications of working in the
disputed territories. Before the 2003 invasion that toppled
Saddam Hussein, Qara Hansher was part of Kirkuk. Baghdad still
considers it part of Kirkuk, but the Kurds claimed it as part of
their region and the mayor was apppointed by the Kurdistan
Regional Government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad says oil deals signed with Kurdistan are illegal and
warned foreign companies they risk losing their agreements in
Iraq's southern oilfields if they develop Kurdistan fields. But
fields in the disputed territories are more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry sources have said Exxon is considering concessions
from Baghdad to keep to stay at the $50 billion West Qurna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Iraqi oil official said the U.S. major may be trying to
smooth relations with Kurdistan with the block visit after the
company's top executive meet last month with Iraq's Prime
Minister Nuri al-Maliki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Exxon visited the block that does not mean it will
actually start upstream operations anytime soon. I think they
are comforting the Kurds, saying they won't abandon them," a
senior Iraqi oil official said. "Let's not jump to conclusions,
let's wait and see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AUTONOMY AND OIL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autonomous since 1991 with its own regional government and
armed forces, Kurdistan says that the federal constitution
enshrines its right to develop its oilfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region is steadily developing more energy autonomy, but
still relies on the central government for a share of the
national budget from oil revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Exxon entered Kurdistan, tensions between Baghdad and
Kurdistan have increased, but the U.S. major's move also opened
the door for other large foreign companies such as Chevron
, France's Total and Russia's Gazprom Neft
 to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron recently added a third block to its assets in
Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's oil minister on Sunday said during the most recent
meeting with Exxon, the government had made clear once again
that the U.S. company must decide between the two regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon Mobil cannot work in the two fields at the same
time," Oil Minister Abdul Kareem Luaibi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International oil companies have been prepared to take that
risk in return for Kurdistan's better contract terms, security
and an easier working environment, as opposed to the bureaucracy
and infrastructure hurdles hampering southern oil projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil dispute has been accompanied by an increase in
military tensions between the two regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Iraqi national army and Kurdish Peshmerga forces
both sent troops to reinforce their rival positions around towns
dotted along the disputed territories, including the sensitive
ethnically mixed town of Kirkuk.&lt;/p&gt;

Congress to avoid the "fiscal cliff" at the end of last year and

build a new crude oil pipeline and a rail offloading facility
plus expand tankage alongside the Mississippi River all to give
Exxon Mobil Corp's Louisiana refinery more access to
low-priced inland crudes, the company said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Houston-based company said it would spend $125 million
to nearly double capacity at its Port Hudson, Louisiana,
terminal to 416,000 barrels and build a new 18-mile (29 km)
pipeline to move crude south from there to a tank farm at
Exxon's 502,500 barrels-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genesis said it would build the rail offloading facility at
Exxon's Maryland terminal between Port Hudson and Baton Rouge
where the pipeline will pass through. Exxon will lease property
at the Maryland terminal for the new offloading facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This strategic project will increase the ability of the
refinery to access a wider slate of crude oil feedstock, which
will help increase the competitive position of the site," Exxon

projects to gain access to inland U.S. crude that is so
plentiful it trades at a sharp discount to other global crudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genesis said the pipeline will have an ultimate capacity of
350,000 barrels per day (bpd) and could deliver crude bound for
refineries other than Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genesis chief financial officer Bob Deere said the Baton
Rouge plant's Anchorage tank farm has connections to other
refineries, but he declined to say which plants also would
receive crude from the new infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deere also declined to specify where in the United States
the crude would come from, except to say it "would have the
potential of coming from anywhere where it could be transported
by barge or train."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could include crude moved south by barge from North
Dakota's Bakken shale play or crude moved by rail and barge from
Ohio's Utica play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Port Hudson tankage and new pipeline are expected to be

* Scientists developed a new flexible polymer material made of high-performance
silicone to create optical waveguides on printed circuit boards that can
withstand extreme operating heat and humidity with no measurable degradation in
performance. 
* The materials can be fabricated into waveguides using conventional
manufacturing techniques available today. 
* Board-level waveguides will help pave the way for the low-cost integration of
photonics in energy-efficient supercomputers and data centers.

SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Today at the Photonics West conference, Dow Corning and IBM scientists unveiled
a major step in photonics, using a new type of polymer material to transmit
light instead of electrical signals within supercomputers and data centers. This
new silicone-based material offers better physical properties, including
robustness and flexibility, making it ideal for applications in Big Data and for
the development of future exascale computers, which are capable of performing a
billion billion computations per second. 

With exabytes of structured and unstructured data growing annually at 60
percent, scientists have been researching a range of technological advancements
to drastically reduce the energy required to move all that data from the
processor to the printed circuit board within a computer. Optical interconnect
technology offers bandwidth and power efficiency advantages compared to
established electrical signaling. 

"Polymer waveguides provide an integrated means to route optical signals similar
to how copper lines route electrical signals," explains Dr. Bert Jan Offrein,
manager of the Photonics Research Group at IBM Research. "Our design is highly
flexible, resistant to high temperatures and has strong adhesion properties -
these waveguides were designed with no compromises." 

In a collaboration with Dow Corning, the scientists for the first time
fabricated thin sheets of optical waveguide that show no curling and can bend to
a 1 mm radius and is stable at extreme operating conditions including 85 percent
humidity and 85&#176;C. This new polymer, based on silicone materials, offers an
optimized combination of properties for integration in established electrical
printed circuit board technology. In addition, the material can be fabricated
into waveguides using conventional manufacturing techniques available today. 

"Dow Corning`s breakthrough polymer waveguide silicone has positioned us at the
forefront of a new era in robust, data-rich computing, especially as we continue
to collaborate with outstanding industry leaders like IBM," said Eric Peeters,
vice president, Dow Corning Electronic Solutions. "Optical waveguides made from
Dow Corning's silicone polymer technology offer customers revolutionary new
options for transmitting data substantially faster, and with lower heat and
energy consumption. We are confident that silicone-based board-level
interconnects will quickly supersede conventional electronic signal distribution
to deliver the amazing speeds needed for tomorrow`s supercomputers." 

A presentation (entitled Stable and Easily Processable Optical Silicones for
Low-Loss Polymer Waveguides) given here by Brandon Swatowski, application
engineer for Dow Corning Electronics Solutions, reported that fabrication of
full waveguide builds can be completed in less than 45 minutes, and enable a
high degree of process flexibility. Silicone polymer material, which is
dispensed as a liquid, processes more quickly than competitive waveguide
materials such as glass and does not require a controlled atmosphere chamber. 

Swatowski`s presentation went on to say that waveguide builds based on the
silicone polymer showed excellent adhesion to polyimide substrates. It also
discussed how optical characterization of the new polymer waveguides silicones
showed losses as low as 0.03 dB/cm, with environmental stability extending past
2,000 hours exposure to high humidity and temperature, and good performance
sustained over 500 thermal cycles between -40&#176;C and 120&#176;C.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Feb 4 (IFR) - The Premier healthcare alliance, the
nation's largest and most comprehensive healthcare database, is
headed for an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan 
have been mandated as joint bookrunners and are targeting a $5bn
valuation for the healthcare industry data aggregator, according
to a source close to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan
declined comment. Premier neither confirmed nor denied that it
was contemplating an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continually pursue strategies that will enable us to
achieve our goal. We will communicate openly if and when our
owners decide to make any changes to our business model," said
Alven Weil, director of PR and communications at Premier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A consortium of healthcare providers formed Premier as a way
to lower operating and administrative costs through sharing
information. The company's owners are some 200 hospitals and
health-care systems, which collectively operate 2,700 hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business model is quite similar to Verisk Analytics
, a provider of data and analytics to the insurance
industry, which raised $1.9bn in its October 2009 debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that offering, selling shareholders comprised more than
100 property and casualty insurers that populated Verisk's
database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selling shareholders initially were asked to sell
minimum parts of their holdings in the IPO. As Verisk became a
more seasoned public company, they were allowed to sell more
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely that Premier will pursue a similar tack if it
opts to price an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;

 and Permira have mandated JP Morgan to
explore an exit from German media group ProSiebenSat.1
, two persons familiar the companies involved told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JP Morgan will check whether anchor investors in the media
business or companies are interested in ProSieben as a whole or
whether the private equity owners' shares have to be floated,"
one person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KRR and Permira, which own 88 percent of the voting shares,
with Dutch publisher Telegraaf Media Group holding
the remaining 12 percent, said in December they would prepare an
exit following the sale of ProSieben's Scandinavian activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $1.7 billion disposal to Discovery Communications
 is expected to close in the current quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After ProSieben's shareholders meet on July 23, the two
private equity owners intend to convert non-voting preference
shares into ordinary shares, all of which will be admitted to
trading at the stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (JP Morgan) have been advisory bank of choice for KKR
and Permira for years and are now slowly preparing ground for
the exit," another person said, added that not much will happen
before the shareholders meeting in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ProSieben, KKR and Permira declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ProSieben will be the second major European media asset to
be made available this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week privately-held Bertelsmann, Europe's
biggest media group, said it was considering whether to sell a
small part of its 92.3-percent stake in RTL Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RTL and ProSieben are the two dominant players on the German
commercial television market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Permira and KKR in 2006 bought a controlling stake in
ProSiebenSat.1 and merged it with SBS Broadcasting, a media
group they bought a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction valued ProSiebenSat.1 at 5.9 billion euros.
ProSieben's current market capitalization is around 2.8 billion
euros, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;

Next Phase Begins in "forWARD" Vision for Ward Village
HONOLULU--(Business Wire)--
The Howard Hughes Corporation (NYSE: HHC) today announced plans to renovate the
IBM building, a well-known office building located along Ala Moana Boulevard in
the heart of Kaka`ako. As the next step in realizing its vision transforming
Ward Centers into Ward Village, a vibrant urban master planned community, The
Howard Hughes Corporation is making a substantial investment in the renovation
of the building.

"We look forward to the IBM building becoming an integral part of the vision for
Ward Village," said Nick Vanderboom, Senior Vice President of Development for
The Howard Hughes Corporation. "It is rewarding to bring new purpose to this
iconic structure." 

Originally designed by famed architect Vladimir Ossipoff, the IBM building
recently marked its 50th anniversary. Through the redevelopment, the majority of
the space will continue to serve as an office building while a portion will
serve as the future information and sales center for Ward Village. Planned for
completion in the fall of 2013, the update will create dynamic open space on the
ground floor by opening up the walls surrounding the ground level. A section of
the floor will be dedicated to telling the story of the land, while another will
showcase the vision for the project. The front of the building will also be
enhanced with landscaping, water features and other design elements in keeping
with the future character of Ward Village. 

Reflecting the Ward Village commitment to honoring the history of the land, the
concrete honeycomb exterior grille - the brise-soleil that makes the IBM
building a distinct architectural structure - will be retained as part of the
rehabilitation. 

"As best I can recall, Val Ossipoff is quoted as saying `the grille is a punched
screen and as such recalls the punch cards universally used in computing.` This
seemed an appropriate reason for relating IBM, a computer company, to its
Honolulu home. Here is a unique grille, very permanent being made of uncoated
concrete which provides shade and yet allows views out to the ocean and
mountains and allows for a naturally lit interior," said Sid Snyder, a longtime
friend and business partner of Val Ossipoff. 

"The building`s classic grille is being preserved and the unique character is
respected. I appreciate that and understand there is a new purpose for this
building being preserved," added Snyder. 

The Howard Hughes Corporation will invest more than $20 million in the IBM
building renovation. The renovation is being directed by the internationally
acclaimed design firm Woods Bagot along with the local firm of Ferraro Choi &amp;
Associates as the architect of record. The Howard Hughes Corporation is also
hiring local general contractors, Jay Kadowaki, Inc. and Albert C. Kobayashi,
Inc., respectively known for quality interiors and expertise in large-scale
projects. Nate Smith, a local project manager who has a history of managing
residential, commercial and institutional projects, including the renovation of
Ossipoff`s Thurston Chapel at Punahou School, has also been retained as a
consultant to assist with the coordination of the project." 

The Howard Hughes Corporation announced its "forWARD" vision for Ward Village in
October 2012, revealing plans to create a vibrant neighborhood offering unique
retail experiences, exceptional residences and affordable housing set among
dynamic public open spaces and pedestrian-friendly streets. Ward Village will
incorporate principles of sustainability and cultural respect that honor the
rich history of the land. The project is planned to be built out over the next
decade. When complete, Ward Village will double its retail, dining and
entertainment space, providing a compelling mix of local neighborhood shops,
restaurants and national retailers to serve locals and visitors alike. In
preparation for the renovation, The Howard Hughes Corporation has been working
to provide assistance to tenants affected by the project who are moving to other
locations within Ward Centers.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is playing defense with a $2 billion loan to help Dell Inc's founder buy back the world's No.3 PC maker as it seeks to shore up support for Windows and beat back the march of Google Inc's Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment in the landmark $24 billion buyout led by Michael Dell marks the latest step in Microsoft's plan to gain more influence over the hardware supply chain - a departure from the decades-old, software-centric philosophy that helped it dominate the computing world but is now increasingly under threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is far from clear, however, if this strategy will be successful, while the world's largest software maker risks upsetting other computer producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't mean it's a bad move, but it's definitely defensive. Microsoft is realizing it must be much more engaged in the hardware business than it used to be, it needs to be making bets and forming relationships," said Andrew Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company that built its fortune on making high-priced software to go in other companies' computers is inching closer to Apple Inc's belief that software and hardware must be closely integrated for the sake of the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft struck a deal to pay Nokia to make phones running Windows software in 2011 and a year later invested in Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook e-reader. It then launched its own computer, the Surface tablet, in October, which rankled some PC makers initially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of declining PC sales and the onslaught of Apple's iPad, "Microsoft has taken more unconventional measures than they would have in the past," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at investment firm McAdams Wright Ragen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, Microsoft made extra efforts not to alienate its other PC makers, talking to them before inking the deal, said sources familiar with Microsoft's relations with its partners, and holding off from an ownership stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft reached out (at the highest levels) a bit before all of it came out," one of the people said. "There were multiple conversations. Clearly they put some thought into it and definitely a schedule was pulled together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, world No.1 PC maker Hewlett-Packard Co (HP) issued a statement critical of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell "faces an extended period of uncertainty and transition that will not be good for its customers," HP said, adding that Dell's ability to invest in products and services will be extremely limited with its debt load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd said it remains focused on products and customers rather than "distracting financial maneuvers and major strategic shifts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, advised by Lazard Ltd, declined to comment on the terms of the Dell loan, or what exactly it gets in return, but made it clear it would look for "opportunities to support" companies that buy in to Windows, in whatever form. That suggests this may not be its last third-party investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there is no guarantee that Microsoft's loan will give it any sway over Dell at all. One former Microsoft executive said the deal was pointless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know Michael (Dell), he will continue to run his empire the way he has always done - without any outside influence," said Joachim Kempin, once Microsoft's top executive in charge of its relationships with PC makers, who left the company in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLATFORM WARS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Steve Ballmer made it clear last year that he sees Microsoft as a "devices and services" company with an explicit interest in hardware, whoever it is made by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has every interest to keep such a key player in its ecosystem alive and well," said Al Hilwa, an analyst at tech research firm IDC. "Dell supplies a large number of Microsoft customers with hardware, and it is important that their confidence is bolstered in the overall Microsoft ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell decided last year to focus its tablet strategy on the new Windows 8 operating system, in contrast to rivals such as Samsung, Asus and Lenovo, which are hedging or leading with Google's Android system, and HP which said this week it would make a Google Chromebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell did experiment with Android with its Streak tablet in 2010, but it flopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This investment might help Microsoft influence whether Dell adopts Android or not, that is likely the goal behind this," said Parakh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loan, negotiated by Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein, takes the form of a 10-year subordinated note and will pay 7 percent to 8 percent interest, according to sources familiar with the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear how much sway Microsoft will have on Dell's strategy, but the two have been close partners for 25 years, and will likely build on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think Microsoft is going to run Dell at any time or have a dispositive say in what Dell does," said one source familiar with Microsoft's thinking, who asked not to be named.

&lt;p&gt;* Marks Microsoft shift toward hardware, like Apple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* May keep Dell loyal to Windows, away from Android&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Risks alienating other PC makers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby and Poornima Gupta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp

adopts Android or not, that is likely the goal behind this," 
said Parakh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loan, negotiated by Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co beat estimates in quarterly adjusted earnings on Tuesday and said it expects the next few quarters to be better on a stronger lineup of films and growing attendance at its theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;

its$4.06 billion acquisition of director George Lucas' Lucasfilm
of in October, also plans to produce movies based on Lucas
properties other than "Star Wars", said Chairman and CEO Bob

"Star Wars" brand across other areas of Disney's business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating profit at Disney's Media Network's division, the
largest of its five units, increased by 2 percent although
earnings at its cable operations were lower due to higher costs
for ESPN to carry college football and NFL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasulo also said Disney was "exploring an exit" from its
ESPN operation in the U.K., adding that the sports channel "had
experienced losses due to the ramp-up and newness of that
business to us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's theme park unit benefited from higher attendance at
its domestic theme parks, driven by the new Cars Land attraction
it opened at California Adventure in Anaheim, Calif. in June,
although higher labor costs at its Disneyland Paris parks
weighed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said price hikes at Disney's parks are possible as it
continues to roll out new attractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've got some price leverage," he said. "If you build the
right things not only will people come but you get some leverage
out of it as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings fell 5 percent at Disney's studios, which it
attributed to a stronger slate a year earlier powered by Cars 2
-- a film that had worldwide ticket sales of $559.8 million,
according to the movie site Box Office Mojo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its interactive division swung to a profit of $9 million
from a loss of $28 million in the prior quarter, although Iger
and Rasulo said it would likely revert to a loss in the coming
quarter because it has fewer new products to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were no real surprises, although interactive was
probably what surprised us the most on the upside," said David
Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC has sold out its advertising for the upcoming Academy
Awards on Feb. 24, the best selling pace in more than a decade.
Rasulo said the Oscars had been virtually sold out by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad Age reported that Disney has been commanding between
$1.65 million and $1.85 million for a 30-second spot in this
year's Oscar broadcast, citing media buyers and others familiar
with the tone of the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's up from the $1.6 million to $1.7 million ABC secured
for the 2012 Oscars telecast, Ad Age said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Miller, analyst with B. Riley Caris, said he was

&lt;p&gt;After a month of speculation, Dell officially announced this morning that it will be going private in a $24.4 billion deal with founder Michael Dell and investment firm Silver Lake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft also announced this morning that it provided a $2 billion loan to Dell and Silver Lake, confirming previous rumors. In a (very) pithy statement this morning, Microsoft said it was &#8220;committed to the long-term success of the entire PC ecosystem&#8221; and it&#8217;s investing in a variety of ways to continue that ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell stockholders will get $13.65 for each share of Dell stock, a deal worth around $24.4 billion. That&#8217;s a 25 percent premium over the company&#8217;s $10.88 share price on Jan. 11, the last time the stock traded before rumors of Dell going private hit. The company&#8217;s board reportedly voted last night to approve the deal, according to the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By going private, Dell hopes to turn around its fate in a languishing PC market. The company is also trying to make a dent in mobile with tablets after giving up on smartphones. Like BlackBerry (formerly RIM) and Nokia, other giants from yesteryear, Dell is aiming to be relevant again by doing something drastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I believe this transaction will open an exciting new chapter for Dell, our customers and team members,&#8221; founder and chief executive Michael Dell said in a statement this morning. &#8220;We can deliver immediate value to stockholders, while we continue the execution of our long-term strategy and focus on delivering best-in-class solutions to our customers as a private enterprise. Dell has made solid progress executing this strategy over the past four years, but we recognize that it will still take more time, investment and patience, and I believe our efforts will be better supported by partnering with Silver Lake in our shared vision.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, VentureBeat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 5 (IFR) - IBM Corp on Tuesday made the most of a surge
in demand for floating-rate notes in the corporate bond market
by issuing a $1 billion two-year deal at a negative spread to
Libor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which was part of a $2 billion offering of
two-year floaters and five-year fixed-rate notes, was priced at
three-month Libor minus 2 basis points, making it one of the
very few corporates to have issued a floater inside of Libor
since the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aggressive pricing was possible because of a scramble
for floating-rate debt securities in the corporate bond market
in recent weeks as Treasury yields rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year more than $14 billion of floating-rate
notes have been priced, already equal to almost a third of the
$42 billion of floaters issued in all of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seen a resurgence of demand for floating-rate
product in 2013," said Anne Daley, managing director and senior
syndicate banker at Barclays in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While supply has not been massive yet, the fact that we
have already seen more than $14 billion year-to-date versus $42
billion for all of last year clearly shows there is very strong
demand growing for the product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporates have also been more willing to issue
floating-rate notes, to balance out a debt mix which has been
dominated by fixed-rate bond issuance in recent years as issuers
sought to lock in record low fixed-rate coupons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually money managers and securities lenders tend to buy
floaters inside of 18 months, but the strength of demand has
enabled names like IBM and General Mills to issue out to
two and three years respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan was able to raise $2.4 billion of five
year floaters in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is only the third industrial issuer since the crisis to
print at a negative spread to Libor, along with Procter &amp; Gamble
and Coca-Cola Company, which did deals last year.&lt;/p&gt;

Cable Networks

Operating income at Cable Networks decreased $15 million to $952 million for the
quarter due to a decrease at ESPN, partially offset by growth at the domestic
Disney Channels, ABC Family and A Television Networks (AETN). The decrease at
ESPN was driven by higher programming and production costs, partially offset by
higher affiliate revenue. The increase in programming and production costs
reflected contractual rate increases for college football and the NFL and an
increase in the number of NBA games due to the lockout in the prior year. The
increase in affiliate revenue was due to contractual rate increases and a
reduction in revenue deferrals related to annual programming commitments. During
the quarter we deferred $154 million of revenue compared to $190 million in the
prior-year quarter. The decrease in revenue deferrals was due to changes in the
provisions related to annual programming commitments in certain affiliate
contracts. At the domestic Disney Channels, growth was driven by higher
affiliate revenue due to contractual rate increases. The improvement at ABC
Family was driven by higher advertising sales reflecting higher units sold and
lower marketing costs. Higher equity income from AETN reflected higher affiliate
and advertising revenues, partially offset by higher marketing costs, along with
the benefit of the increase in the Company's ownership from 42% to 50%. 

Broadcasting

Operating income at Broadcasting increased $36 million to $262 million driven by
increased advertising revenues at the ABC Television Network and owned
television stations and higher program sales, partially offset by higher
primetime network programming costs. The increase in network advertising
revenues was primarily due to higher advertising rates and higher online
advertising, partially offset by lower ratings and fewer units sold. Higher
advertising revenue at the owned television stations reflected increased
political advertising. Program sales growth was driven by Revenge and Once Upon
A Time. Higher programming costs were due to more hours of first run original
scripted programming in the current quarter. 

Parks and Resorts

Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 7% to $3.4 billion and
segment operating income increased 4% to $577 million. Results for the quarter
were driven by an increase at our domestic operations, partially offset by a
decrease at our international operations. 

Higher operating income at our domestic operations was primarily due to
increased guest spending at both Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort,
the addition of the Disney Fantasy cruise ship which launched in March 2012,
attendance growth at Disneyland Resort, and higher occupied room nights at Walt
Disney World Resort. These increases were partially offset by higher operating
costs and lower average cruise ship ticket prices driven by a cruise itinerary
out of a new port location for the Disney Magic. Increased guest spending
reflected higher average ticket prices, daily hotel room rates and food,
beverage and merchandise spending. Higher operating costs were due to resort
expansion and new guest offerings, including the addition of the Disney Fantasy
and investments in systems infrastructure at Walt Disney World Resort, as well
as labor and other cost inflation. 

Lower results from our international operations reflect higher costs due to new
guest offerings and labor cost inflation at Disneyland Paris and start up costs
at Shanghai Disney Resort, partially offset by increased guest spending at Hong
Kong Disneyland Resort. 

Studio Entertainment

Studio Entertainment revenues decreased 5% to $1.5 billion and segment operating
income decreased 43% to $234 million. 

Lower operating income for the quarter was driven by decreases in home
entertainment and theatrical distribution, partially offset by an increase in
television and subscription video on demand (TV/SVOD) distribution. 

The decrease at home entertainment was due to lower unit sales reflecting the
strong performance of The Lion King Diamond Release in the prior-year quarter
compared to the Cinderella Diamond Release in the current quarter. Additionally,
the prior-year quarter included Cars 2, which had lower production cost
amortization given the strength of its merchandise licensing revenues, compared
to Brave in the current quarter. 

The decline in theatrical distribution was driven by marketing and distribution
costs for Lincoln and Monsters, Inc. 3D in the current quarter, the continuing
strong performance in the prior year of The Lion King 3D, which was released in
Q4 2011, and one additional new Disney theatrical title in wide release in the
current quarter. Key new Disney titles in wide release in the current quarter
were Wreck-it Ralph and Frankenweenie, while The Muppets was released in the
prior-year quarter. 

The operating income increase in TV/SVOD distribution was primarily due to a
domestic SVOD sale of library titles in the current quarter and higher
international sales driven by the timing of title availabilities. 

Consumer Products

Consumer Products revenues increased 7% to $1.0 billion and segment operating
income increased 11% to $346 million. Higher operating income was due to
increases at Merchandise Licensing and at our retail business. 

The increase at Merchandise Licensing was due to lower revenue share with the
Studio Entertainment segment which reflected a higher mix of revenues from
properties subject to the revenue share in the prior-year quarter driven by
sales of Cars merchandise. 

At our retail business, higher operating income was driven by higher comparable
store sales in Japan and growth in North America which benefited from higher
online sales, comparable store sales growth and store format changes. 

Interactive

Interactive revenues for the quarter increased 4% to $291 million and segment
operating results improved from a loss of $28 million to income of $9 million.
Higher operating results were driven by lower acquisition accounting impacts at
our social games business which were adverse in the prior-year quarter and
growth at our Japan mobile business from a new licensing agreement for Disney
branded mobile phones and content. 

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased $16 million to $123 million
for the quarter. The increase was driven by the timing of allocations to the
operating segments. 

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense was as follows (in millions):

                                      Quarter Ended

The decrease in net interest expense for the quarter was due to lower effective
interest rates. 

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rate was as follows:

                              Quarter Ended                                                     
                              December 29, 2012          December 31, 2011       Change         
 Effective Income Tax Rate    29.1       %               32.1       %            3.0       ppt  


The decrease in the effective tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to an
increase in the amount of prior-year earnings from foreign operations
indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States which are subject to
foreign tax rates lower than the federal statutory income tax rate. The impact
of the increase in the prior-year earnings from foreign operations as well as
certain other items affecting comparability benefited the effective tax rate by
4.3 percentage points. (See Footnote 1 to the reconciliation of reported EPS to
EPS excluding certain items in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for
further information on the effective tax rate). 

Noncontrolling Interests

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $1 million to $56
million for the quarter due to higher recognition of royalties and management
fees at Disneyland Paris and start up costs at Shanghai Disney Resort, partially
offset by an increase in net income at ESPN. The increase at ESPN was due to the
gain on the sale of our 50% equity interest in ESPN STAR Sports, partially
offset by lower operating results. Net income attributable to noncontrolling
interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing
costs and income taxes. 

Cash Flow

Cash provided by operations and free cash flow were as follows (in millions):

(1) Free cash flow is not a financial measure defined by GAAP. See the
discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows. 

Cash provided by operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 decreased 34%
or $590 million to $1.1 billion as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
The decrease was due to the timing of receivable collections at Media Networks
and cash disbursements at Corporate.

Capital expenditures decreased from $634 million to $545 million driven by a
decrease at domestic Parks and Resorts, partially offset by an increase at
international Parks and Resorts. The decrease at our domestic Parks and Resorts
was primarily due to lower spending for resort expansion and new guest offerings
at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort as compared to the prior-year
quarter which included Cars Land and Disney's Art of Animation. The increase at
our international Parks and Resorts was due to construction costs at Shanghai
Disney Resort, partially offset by decreased spending on the resort expansion at
Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.

non-GAAP financial measures that follows. 

The total borrowings shown above include $269 million and $267 million
attributable to our consolidated international theme parks as of December 29,
2012 and September 29, 2012, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents
attributable to our consolidated international theme parks totaled $320 million

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This earnings release presents EPS excluding the impact of certain items, net
borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income, all of which
are important financial measures for the Company but are not financial measures
defined by GAAP. 

These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP
financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of EPS,
borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. EPS
excluding certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment
operating income as we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures reported by other companies. 

EPS excluding certain items - The Company uses EPS excluding certain items to
evaluate the performance of the Company`s operations exclusive of certain items
that impact the comparability of results from period to period. The Company
believes that information about EPS exclusive of these impacts is useful to
investors, particularly where the impact of the excluded items is significant in
relation to reported earnings, because the measure allows for comparability
between periods of the operating performance of the Company`s business and
allows investors to evaluate the impact of these items separately from the
impact of the operations of the business. 

The following table reconciles reported EPS to EPS excluding certain items:

(2) Other income/(expense), net for the current year includes the Celador
litigation charge ($321 million) partially offset by the gain on the sale of our
interest in ESPN STAR Sports ($219 million). 

Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net borrowings
provides investors with a useful perspective on our financial condition. Net
borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total
borrowings. Since we earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a
portion of the interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be
used as a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness when
the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. However, we may not
immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the reduction of debt, nor do we
expect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repay
debt in the ordinary course of business. 

Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by operations
less investments in parks, resorts and other property), among other measures, to
evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for
purposes other than capital expenditures. Management believes that information
about free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the
cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and
pay dividends or repurchase shares. 

Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses
aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating
businesses separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that
information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by
allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company`s
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net
income, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other
factors that affect reported results. 

A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows (in
millions):

WASHINGTON, Feb. 5, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce
(USHCC) commends The Coca-Cola Company for its commitment to fight obesity through its new and
unprecedented campaign. Beginning with two national television commercials, the goal of the
campaign is to educate people about the importance of making informed choices and balancing their
caloric intake. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), "Obesity now affects 17% of all
children and adolescents in the United States - triple the rate from just one generation ago." As
a leader in the fight against obesity, Coca-Cola's campaign will also implement innovative
programs to educate its consumers. It is committed delivering a greater choice of beverages,
including low- and no-calorie options, and to clearly communicating the calorie content of all its
products.

The Calories Count Vending Program will ensure that vending machine labels feature calorie
information for each beverage selection, so that customers can make informed and healthy
decisions. The company is also expanding its Troops for Fitness program which supports the hiring
of U.S. veterans to teach military-style fitness classes in key cities across the country
throughout 2013.

"We are proud to partner with a company that holds itself responsible for the health and
well-being of its consumers. We applaud Coca-Cola for its leadership on this timely and critical
issue," said USHCC President &amp; CEO Javier Palomarez.

About the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce

Founded in 1979, the USHCC actively promotes the economic growth and development of Hispanic
entrepreneurs and represents the interests of over 3 million Hispanic-owned businesses across the
United States that contribute in excess of $465 billion to the American economy each year. It also
serves as the umbrella organization for more than 200 local Hispanic chambers and business
associations in the United States and Puerto Rico. For more information, visit www.ushcc.com

&lt;p&gt;By Christopher Swann and Robert Cyran
The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and Exxon Mobil may not be so different, after all. The two seemingly disparate companies share more than nearly identical U.S. market-leading values of about $400 billion. Both are threatened by shrinking margins and the struggle to replace their precious wares. Exxon in various iterations has survived four times longer than Apple, but is just as vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mortality rate in technology is high. Rapid advances in hardware and software regularly buffet the sector. Firms rarely survive more than one wave of technology, leaving their intellectual property with a short shelf life. Energy companies are more durable. Exxon&#8217;s roots stretch back to 1870. Oil explorers in particular sit on supplies of a commodity that is hard to replace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are starting to worry that Apple will succumb to the industry&#8217;s life-cycle squeeze. After soaring past $650 billion, its market capitalization has tumbled by more than a third in the past five months. Rival smartphones are gaining ground on the iPhone, which accounts for more than half of Apple&#8217;s sales and an even greater slug of profit. Operating margins slipped five percentage points to 32 percent in the last full quarter. If price becomes the next battleground, they may slide further still. Apple will have to innovate anew to reverse the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon faces a similar dilemma. The Texas-based company must be increasingly creative to extract oil from rocks, ocean depths and frigid arctic wastes. That explains a 90 percent surge in capital spending since 2007, to about $40 billion annually. Even so, Exxon has barely replaced its reserves. It also must contend with an additional pressure that Apple doesn&#8217;t: government actions discouraging the use of oil and fostering more competitive substitutes. It&#8217;s a recipe for slimmer margins or, in an extreme case, extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that sense, Apple&#8217;s problems may be easier to solve. If it can develop a new blockbuster, like a TV that already is anticipated, investors could rediscover their enthusiasm for the company, valued at 10 times estimated 2013 earnings. Exxon trades at a similar multiple, though its problems are arguably less tractable, with easily available oil already tapped. Either way, Apple and Exxon find themselves strangely in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 5 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed Turkey-based Coca-Cola Icecek A.S.'s
 (CCI) Long-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings
(IDR) and senior unsecured rating at 'BBB'. The Outlook on the IDRs is Stable.

The ratings reflect CCI's strong presence in high-growth markets, the
expectation of moderate leverage and cash flow generation, as well as the
continued operational support and oversight provided by The Coca-Cola Company
(TCCC, 'A+'/Stable). The ratings also incorporate implied support from CCI's
major shareholder (with 20.1% interest) TCCC. At the same time, due to its debt
mostly being denominated in USD and euros, CCI's balance sheet remains
vulnerable to any devaluation of the Turkish lira.

Volumes &amp; Mix Drive Growth:
CCI has shown consistent volume growth, driven by a young population and
relatively low soft drinks penetration in its countries of operations. Volume
growth in Turkey has been easing since 2011 but remains strong in value thanks
to product mix uplift. The other countries of operation maintain very strong
volume performances.

Robust Financial Performance:
In 9M12 net revenue per case (+7.3% in Turkey, which represents 72% of LTM
September 2012 group revenue, and +3.5% in the international segment) increased
by 10.2% in Turkish lira terms mainly due to higher prices and a better product
and channel of sales mix. These top-line results were even stronger than the
robust +8.2% of 2011 and, thanks to lower input costs, were accompanied by
significant EBITDA growth of 42%. Overall, Fitch expects a substantial rebound
in CCI's 2012 EBITDA margin back to the top-end of its 15.3%-16.6% range of
2008-2010, recovering from the low 14.3% of 2011 and to stabilise at this level
in 2013.

Forex Exposure:
96% of CCI's debt was denominated in dollars and euros at end- September 2012,
while revenues are generated in domestic currencies, mainly Turkish lira. The
company is consequently vulnerable to lira depreciation. Fitch calculates that
2011's 18% devaluation of the lira had an adverse effect of between 0.2x and
0.4x on CCI's net debt/EBITDA ratio, which has increased to 2.3x from 2010's
1.5x.

Strong Coca Cola Bottler:
CCI has diversified and grown in size, establishing itself as a strong Coca-Cola
franchisee. Its results have shown resilience to economic cycles and it has been
able to keep net debt/EBITDA under 2.5x. Although historically prone to negative
FCF due to its growth strategy, causing high capex and working-capital
absorption, CCI can swiftly move to a cash preservation mode in the event of a
downturn. In 2012 Fitch expects mildly positive FCF and, despite acquisition
spending of USD120m, net debt/EBITDA should remain at approximately 2.0x.

Ratings Incorporate Implied Support::
The ratings include embedded support from TCCC (which owns 20.1% of CCI) due to
its influence over major decisions, moderate operational and strategic ties (CCI
represents an entry point to fast-growing markets) and demonstrated support.

WHAT COULD TRIGGER A RATING ACTION?
Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a
negative rating action include:
- A material permanent deterioration in FCF generation or large acquisition
leading to lease-adjusted net debt/EBITDAR above 2.5x and FFO adjusted net debt
above 2.8x-3.0x for an extended period along with FFO interest coverage below
6x.

In addition, CCI's rating could be downgraded should Fitch perceive that CCI has
become strategically or operationally less significant to TCCC.

In the event of a sharp devaluation of the Turkish lira, Fitch will look at the
group's willingness and timing to undertake any necessary cash preservation
measures such as dividend and capex reduction (as observed in 2009).

Positive: An upgrade of the IDRs is unlikely due to CCI's limited scale,
diversification and profitability against certain peers and forex exposure.


Additional information is available on www.fitchratings.com. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/xnm2w5/global_private) has announced
the addition of the "Global Private Cloud Market 2012-2016" report to their
offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Private Cloud market to grow at a CAGR
of 8.98 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors contributing
to this market growth is the reduced costs of the cloud approach. The Global
Private Cloud market has also been witnessing the growing adoption of hybrid
cloud computing models. However, the high initial costs of private cloud
adoption could pose a challenge to the growth of this market. 

The key vendors dominating this market space are Amazon.com Inc., Hewlett
Packard Co., IBM Corp., Microsoft Corp., and VMware Inc. 

The other vendors mentioned in the report are Salesforce.com, Red Hat Corp.,
Dell Inc., Citrix Systems Inc., Rackspace Inc., Computer Science Corp., and EMC
Corp. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Data Centers team said:
''The rapid expansion of enterprise businesses and the advanced equipment
required to meet the growing business requirements is increasing the complexity
of the network infrastructure. To address the complexity, enterprises are
adopting private cloud solutions which centralize the storage and allocation of
computing resources to the end-users. The private cloud has a limitation in
terms of the capacity of computing resources that it can allocate to the
end-users. Cloud service providers are adopting hybrid cloud models where the
computing resources are accessed from the public cloud in case of scarcity of
resources in the private cloud infrastructure. The enterprises are charged on a
use basis which turns out to be more economical for them. The data is stored
within the enterprise premises.''

&lt;p&gt;After a month of speculation, Dell officially announced this morning that it will be going private in a $24.4 billion deal with founder Michael Dell and investment firm Silver Lake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft also announced this morning that it provided a $2 billion loan to Dell and Silver Lake, confirming previous rumors. In a (very) pithy statement this morning, Microsoft said it was &#8220;committed to the long term success of the entire PC ecosystem&#8221; and it&#8217;s investing in a variety of ways to continue that ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell stockholders will get $13.65 for each share of Dell stock, a deal worth around $24.4 billion. That&#8217;s a 25 percent premium over the company&#8217;s $10.88 share price on January 11, the last time the stock traded before rumors of Dell going private hit. The company&#8217;s board reportedly voted last night to approve the deal, according to the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By going private, Dell hopes to turn around its fate in a languishing PC market. The company is also trying to make a dent in mobile with tablets, after giving up on smartphones. Like BlackBerry (formerly RIM) and Nokia, other giants from yesteryear, Dell is aiming to be relevant again by doing something drastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I believe this transaction will open an exciting new chapter for Dell, our customers and team members,&#8221; founder and chief executive Michael Dell said in a statement this morning. &#8220;We can deliver immediate value to stockholders, while we continue the execution of our long-term strategy and focus on delivering best-in-class solutions to our customers as a private enterprise. Dell has made solid progress executing this strategy over the past four years, but we recognize that it will still take more time, investment and patience, and I believe our efforts will be better supported by partnering with Silver Lake in our shared vision.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, VentureBeat&lt;/p&gt;

The Chase may have concluded Sunday night, but "Mirage" characters will live on
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
While the team from Baltimore took home the championship Sunday night, a cast of
Showgirls raced to a victory of their own. They bested their desert rivals, the
Cowboys and the Badlanders, in a quest to be first to reach an ice-cold Coke. To
propel them to the finish line, fans casted nearly 910,000 votes, almost 7.3
million sabotages and virtually 3 million YouTube views, bringing active fan
engagement with the campaign to top 11 million in the process - figures that
surpassed past all internal projections. 

Over one million fans visited CokeChase.com to vote for the characters they
liked best. More impressively, those visitors stayed on the site, each
participating in an average of eight "sabotages" against opposing factions.
While the company anticipated fewer than one million total sabotages, nearly 7.3
million were performed. In addition, more than 86,000 mentions of the campaign
were tracked across various social media platforms. 

"We hoped our characters would come to life in such a way that fans would want
to rally behind their favorite team, but we are thrilled by the success of the
active engagement resulting from this year`s campaign," said Pio Schunker, SVP
Integrated Marketing Communications, Coca-Cola North America Group. "Fans
flocked to CokeChase.com to vote and sabotage in numbers far beyond the
aggressive performance goals we had in place." 

In addition to being seen by more than 100 million broadcast viewers, "Mirage"
was watched online nearly 3 million times, exceeding the 1.7 million cumulative
views of the Company`s Polar Bowl spots in 2012. And while the spot was created
as the centerpiece of a Big Game campaign, it doesn`t end with the final
whistle. 

"The characters featured in our Big Game ad, `Mirage,` generated such a
groundswell of support from fans, we`re not ready to say good-bye to them just
yet," said Schunker. "The unique nature of `Mirage` and the consumer engagement
it generated during our campaign - especially in active experiences, versus
passive experiences as in last year`s Polar Bowl-- makes it a repeatable idea
that will live on long after yesterday`s game." 

The 30-second payoff ad featuring the Showgirls` CokeChase victory immediately
after the game will air on Feb. 6 and 7 during American Idol. It will be joined
by a Kalaharian Epilogue, which features "Mirage" character Vincent De
Fairweather, on cable networks this week. In addition, moviegoers will begin
seeing Mirage in cinema beginning in March.

Keynote Will Address Social Media Engagement in Regulated Industries
NEW YORK &amp; SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In participation with Social Media Week 2013, Pfizer Inc. and LiveWorld will
join together to co-sponsor three keynote panels on February 20, 2013 at Pfizer
Corporate Headquarters in New York City. The theme for Social Media Week is
"Open &amp; Connected: Principles for a Collaborative World." 

Pfizer and LiveWorld will host a variety of presentations and panels to educate
regulated and consumer-sensitive industries such as pharma, finance, and
consumer packaged goods on the benefits and best practices of social media
monitoring, moderation, efficient process flow, and healthcare education. The
panels will further explore and address social media crises, regulatory
constraints and brand-sensitive environments. 

With case studies from Pfizer, Cleveland Clinic, Wilson Sonsini, Goodrich &amp;
Rosati, and P, presenters will highlight and discuss the most valuable lessons
and applications for brand-regulated social channels. These panels will bring
together social media experts from both the legal and marketing disciplines for
a discussion with a focus on pragmatic approaches to move a business forward. 

"We are pleased to join LiveWorld in hosting several quality presentations at
Social Media Week to address critical topics for our industry," said Andrew
Topen, Vice President, Pfizer Global Media Relations and Digital Communications.
"Exploring the potential of social applications is timely and crucial to our
industry. We are looking forward to great discussions." 

Many companies in regulated industries have been reluctant to engage in social
media. The presentations at Pfizer will explore how social media offers
pharmaceutical companies and other regulated business the opportunity to engage
effectively with their target audiences through social media channels. 

"Consumers have been seeking social media based engagement and support on
healthcare subjects since the earliest days of online community," said LiveWorld
Chairman &amp; CEO, Peter Friedman. "We are excited to co-host this series of events
with Pfizer which advances the category by demonstrating the benefits for health
care brands of pro-active participation in social media." 

In addition, LiveWorld will host the opening reception for Social Media Week

giving way 50 copies of her new book "Think Like Zuck."

&lt;p&gt;  BALTIMORE, MD, Feb 05 (Marketwire) -- 
Goldman Small Cap Research, a stock market research firm focused on the
small cap and micro cap sectors, has issued an updated research report on
The Pulse Beverage Corporation (OTCQB: PLSB), makers of the PULSE(R)
brand of functional beverages and Cabana(TM) 100% Natural Lemonade.

    Founded and led by former senior executives of the highly successful
Clearly Canadian Beverage Company, Pulse's products are targeted at the
nutritional and functional beverage segment of the non-carbonated
beverage market which has a potential market size in excess of $1 billion
in annual sales. The Company appears to be 2-3 years ahead of emerging
brands in the space as a result of the leverage of the brand's
formulation history, the swiftness of its 7500+ strong distribution
build-out, and the targeted time to achieving 1 million cases shipped.

    In the Goldman Opportunity Research report on the Company, analyst Rob
Goldman outlines his investment thesis. 

    "We are very impressed by what we view as 'Clearly Canadian II.' This
cohesive team has a tremendous track record, a great
nutritional/functional beverage formulation product in which $10 million
was invested in development and marketing, and a large top-tier
distribution network that usually takes years to cultivate and engage.
Given the M history in the specialty beverage arena, as PLSB achieves
its sales and distribution milestones, we believe that it could become a
hot property."

Coupa Brings Mobility and Unparalleled Adoption to Hundreds of Users
SAN MATEO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Coupa Software, the leader of cloud-based spend optimization solutions, today
announced that Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ:COKE), the nation`s
largest independent Coca-Cola bottler, has successfully rolled out its Coupa
implementation. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (CCBCC) decided to swap out
its legacy e-procurement platform and chose Coupa for its requisition to order
process and for importing invoice information into one of its existing systems. 

When evaluating spend optimization solutions, CCBCC really wanted a platform
that would support mobile users in the field who rely heavily on iPads and
iPhones to conduct business. They had poor user adoption rates with their legacy
procurement solution, and they desired a much more intuitive solution that would
boost adoption. Coupa supported all of CCBCC`s requirements for its 1,200-person
user base. Coupa is also seamlessly integrated to Coca-Cola Bottling`s SAP ERP
platform. 

"Our goal at CCBCC is to make, sell and deliver products better than anyone else
in our market," said Patrick Hopkins, procurement director of CCBCC. "Coupa is
one of the technology solutions that is critical for us to sustain that goal. We
had a very smooth transition to Coupa which is exactly what you want to see with
the deployment of any new technology." 

"When the deployment went live, CCBCC users were up and running almost
instantly," said Ravi Thakur, vice president, Services, Customers Success and
Adoption for Coupa. "The support phones were quiet on day one, which is a
testament to the ease-of-use of Coupa`s platform, and iPhone and iPad users
immediately started placing orders for items they needed to keep their
operations flowing. With such a successful rollout, we know that CCBCC is on its
way to gaining better control over its procurement processes." 

About Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated

Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (CCBCC) is the nation`s largest independent
Coca-Cola bottler. They make, market, sell and distribute Coca-Cola products
along with other unique beverages. CCBCC holds cola beverage agreements and

&lt;p&gt;If walking the path of a Jedi requires you to give up all wealth and material possessions, then Star Wars creator George Lucas has reached the halfway point in his journey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lucas donated $2 billion to education charities back in October, which accounts for roughly half of what he made from selling LucasFilm to Disney.&#160; And now, a little over a month after the sale was approved by federal regulators, he&#8217;s decided to sell his entire two percent stake in Disney, according to an SEC document filed today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the document, Lucas will sell 37,076,679 shares of Disney stock at $53.77 each. The stock sale will give him another $2 billion, which he&#8217;ll then need to surrender if he ever wants to reach the level of Grand Jedi Master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some are suggesting that the move is yet another example of how much faith Lucas has in Disney to continue the Star Wars legacy, which includes a new trilogy of movies (Episodes 7, 8, and 9) and several spin-off films. Thus far, fans seem happy with the decision, too, as all-star sci-fi director J.J. Abrams was recently named as the director of Star Wars Episode 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via TechCrunch; Photo via mnikita7/Flickr&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Media&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Visa Inc's (V.N) quarterly profit beat analysts' estimates for the ninth consecutive quarter as credit, debit and transactions grew at the world's largest payments network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, along with its closest rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N), have been working to spread card and online payments in parts of the world dominated by cash transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's purchase volumes grew 9 percent to $1.1 trillion in the first quarter, the fastest rate of growth in nine months.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Software makers Microsoft Corp and Symantec Corp said they disrupted a global cyber crime operation by shutting down servers that controlled hundreds of thousands of PCs without the knowledge of their users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move made it temporarily impossible for infected PCs around the world to search the web, though the companies offered free tools to clean machines through messages that were automatically pushed out to infected computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technicians working on behalf of both companies raided data centers in Weehawken, New Jersey, and Manassas, Virginia, on Wednesday, accompanied by U.S. federal marshals, under an order issued by the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They seized control of one server at the New Jersey facility and persuaded the operators of the Virginia data center to take down a server at their parent company in the Netherlands, according to Richard Boscovich, assistant general counsel with Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boscovich told Reuters that he had "a high degree of confidence" that the operation had succeeded in bringing down the cyber crime operation, known as the Bamital botnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think we got everything, but time will tell," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The servers that were pulled off line on Wednesday had been used to communicate with what Microsoft and Symantec estimate are between 300,000 and 1 million PCs currently infected with malicious software that enslaved them into the botnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIJACKING SEARCHES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies said that the Bamital operation hijacked search results and engaged in other schemes that the companies said fraudulently charge businesses for online advertisement clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bamital's organizers also had the ability to take control of infected PCs, installing other types of computer viruses that could engage in identity theft, recruit PCs into networks that attack websites and conduct other types of computer crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the servers have been shut down, users of infected PCs will be directed to a site informing them that their machines are infected with malicious software when they attempt to search the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Symantec are offering them free tools to fix their PCs and restore access to web searches via messages automatically pushed out to victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The messages warn: "You have reached this website because your computer is very likely to be infected by malware that redirects the results of your search queries. You will receive this notification until you remove the malware from your computer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the sixth time that Microsoft has obtained a court order to disrupt a botnet since 2010. Previous operations have targeted bigger botnets, but this is the first where infected users have received warnings and free tools to clean up their machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft runs a Digital Crimes Unit out of its Redmond, Washington, headquarters that is staffed by 11 attorneys, investigators and other staff who work to help law enforcement fight financial crimes and exploitation of children over the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symantec approached Microsoft about a year ago, asking the maker of Windows software to collaborate in trying to take down the Bamital operation. Last week they sought a court order to seize the Bamital servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies said they conservatively estimate that the Bamital botnet generated at least $1 million a year in profits for the organizers of the operation. They said they will learn more about the size of the operation after they analyze information from infected machines that check in to the domains once controlled by Bamital's servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their complaint identified 18 "John Doe" ringleaders, scattered from Russia and Romania to Britain, the United States and Australia, who registered websites and rented servers used in the operation under fictitious names. The complaint was filed last week with a federal court in Alexandria and unsealed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint alleges that the ringleaders made money through a scheme known as "click fraud" in which criminals get cash from advertisers who pay websites commissions when their users click on ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bamital redirected search results from Google, Yahoo and Microsoft's Bing search engines to sites with which the authors of the botnet have financial relationships, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint also charges that Bamital's operators profited by forcing infected computers to generate large quantities of automated ad clicks without the knowledge of PC users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symantec researcher Vikram Thakur said Bamital is just one of several major botnets in a complex underground "click fraud ecosystem" that he believes generates at least tens of millions of dollars in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that researchers at will comb the data on the servers in order to better understand how the click fraud ecosystem works and potentially identify providers of fraudulent ads and traffic brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is just the tip of the iceberg in the world of click fraud," said Thakur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boscovich said he believes the botnet originated in Russia or Ukraine because affiliated sites install a small text file known as a cookie that is written in Russian on infected computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cookie file contains the Russian phrase "yatutuzebil," according to the court filing. That can loosely be translated as "I was here," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft provided details on the takedown operation on its blog: here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Jim Finkle; Editing by Claudia Parsons and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

compensation for taking on risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does not in and of itself mean that a rout is coming,
nor does it mean that the rally can't continue, but it does
imply we should be very cautious about the returns we'll get
from here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Federal Reserve, in creating very easy monetary
conditions, gets prime responsibility for the rally, credit a
big assist to human nature and incentives within financial
services, neither of which has changed much since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, if you are not doing deals and putting money to
work now, you are taking your job in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles O. Prince, then CEO of Citgroup, illustrated this
mindset most ably in July of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be
complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you've got to
get up and dance. We're still dancing," Prince, who later
stepped down amid massive losses at Citi, told the Financial
Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was true then, and it is now, both in terms of the
complications to come and the imperative to dance now. Had
Prince been more conservative, much less been willing to stand
as one man against the tide of liquidity, he wouldn't have been
the head of Citigroup. And it's nice to be head of Citigroup, or
so they tell me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while there are investors out there, notably Dan Fuss of
Loomis, Sayles &amp; Company, who are willing to speak plainly about how loose things are,
they are the exception and they are feeling the heat. The
capital markets are not designed to go home early when there is
an open bar still running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By their nature, things in financial markets take on a
self-propelling momentum and, inevitably, go too far. Those are
two different things, however, and frankly, it is not clear that
we have yet gone too far. We may well have gone beyond
reasonable valuations for some assets, but that has been true
well below the peak many times before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Financial Stress Index, an amalgam of 18
indicators monitored by the St Louis Federal Reserve, markets
are now as blissed out as they have been at any time since
August of 2007, just after Prince wrote his epitaph. And while
current readings are less relaxed and easy than they were at the
height of the boom in 2005 and 2006, they are about on par with
the range the market enjoyed during much of the late 1990s,
another boom period for markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING: THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike 2007 and 1999 there isn't this time an obvious bubble
in a particular asset. We have nothing analogous to dotcom
stocks or housing plays. While portions of the bond market are
very clearly out of whack - notably high yield debt, financial
markets generally seem pleasantly anesthetized rather than
comatose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of candidates for the locus of a bubble -
the great energy renaissance in the U.S. to name two - but
nothing has emerged as a general mania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the bullishness across markets is striking, and
should be sobering. Allocations to stock markets among
individual investors have risen markedly, according to a survey
by the American Association of Individual Investors, and cash
levels in typical portfolios are about a quarter below their
historical average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true among professional investment
managers, according to a regular survey by the National
Association of Active Investment Managers. NAAIM data show
managers as bullish as at any time since March of 2007, and
other than that month, more bullish than at any time since the
survey began in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main underpinning of all of this is the policy of
central banks. The Fed and many others are purchasing assets,
and the ECB has written us all disaster insurance against the
break-up of the euro. It remains to be seen how effective this
will ultimately be in the real economy, though there are bright
spots like housing, but it is working very well in financial
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this means we won't get a correction, but for this
bull market to turn bear we probably need an outside shock,
always a possibility but a tough thing to base strategy on. It
also doesn't mean we will get good returns out of a typical
mixed portfolio of stocks and bonds, especially on a three of
five year view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call it a cynical rally but for now, at least, so long as
the Fed liquidity flows, the music and dancing don't look ready
to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct

2013 Smart Card Alliance Payments Summit, Salt Lake City, Utah, Feb. 6, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --
As the U.S. move to secure chip-based EMV payments continues to progress, executives from
MasterCard and Visa addressed the payments industry, clarified their roadmaps, and provided vision
for the future payments infrastructure yesterday at the 2013 Smart Card Alliance Payments
Summit
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10020921=1=2013%20Smart%20Card%20Alliance%20Payments%0ASummit=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scapayments.com%2F
.  Attendees also were updated on pilots for Isis mobile wallets, and their launch throughout
transit in Salt Lake City. 

The U.S. Path to Chip-based EMV Payments

Stephanie Ericksen, head of authentication product integration for Visa, addressed the audience of
more than 600 attendees about new details that expand Visa's roadmap to EMV.

Ericksen announced Visa's proposed solution to the Durbin Amendment's requirement that card
issuers enable at least two unaffiliated network routing options on their cards.  This requirement
allows merchants to choose their preferred debit network. Ericksen said that Visa will make some
of its EMV chip technology available free of charge in conjunction with a "generic, unbranded
Application Identifier (AID)," the number that identifies the payment system and the card type. 
With such a common AID, payment processors can route transactions to merchants' preferred
networks.

Visa will also expand its roadmap, according to Ericksen, to include an October 1, 2017 deadline
for the liability shift for counterfeit card fraud for ATMs.  This date is a year later than the
deadline MasterCard has imposed for ATMs.

MasterCard's Michael Weitzman, group executive, global products and solutions for U.S. markets,
explained how EMV will impact the future of payments, saying he "couldn't think of a more exciting
time to be in the payments industry."  He noted that by 2015, there will be "twice the number of
globally connected devices than there are people," presenting an opportunity for payments
innovations that should not be missed.  He urged payment card issuers to issue cards with dual
contact/contactless capabilities, and for merchants to implement terminals to accept both
technologies. Regarding the options for online vs. offline transactions in the new EMV ecosystem,
MasterCard supports both.  According to Weitzman, "online is better, but doesn't work in every
case." 

A panel consisting of merchant acquirers, issuers, and brands also offered their unique
perspectives yesterday on the move to EMV. Patty Walters of large merchant acquirer Vantiv noted
the unique challenges in the U.S. due to the sheer size of the market, as well as regulatory
requirements. She said she has seen significant advancement in her industry to meet the looming
April 2013 mandate, when all acquirer processors are required to support merchant acceptance of
chip transactions. Concerning her organization, Walters said she is "confident we will get there."

From an issuer perspective, Whitney Stewart of SunTrust Banks said that customer experience is
going to be a major priority with EMV, and that customer service education as well as consumer
education is going to be "a big piece of the pie."  All of the panelists agreed that a common
language and communication strategy is necessary, and pointed to the EMV Migration Forum's
Communications and Education Working Committee as a valuable collaboration to meet this goal. 

Isis NFC Mobile Wallet Pilots

Attendees were updated on the Isis mobile wallet pilots happening now in Salt Lake City and
Austin. The Isis wallet is an NFC-based, PIN-protected virtual wallet that allows consumers to
carry payment cards, loyalty cards, and offers in their mobile device.

Jim Stapleton, chief sales officer for Isis, said the pilots are still in "early days" but initial
results are positive, with active users paying with Isis five or more times per week.  Stapleton
said that consumers who take advantage of offers from merchants will shop twice as often at that
merchant.  He described several local merchants using the wallet to engage the customer and take
the "relationship beyond that moment of payment," and pointed to the Utah Transit Authority (UTA)
as the best use case of Isis in Salt Lake City.

UTA Open Payments Go Mobile

The UTA has fully implemented open contactless fare payments, which allow travelers to pay for
transit directly with the American Express, Discover, MasterCard, or Visa contactless card already
in their wallet.  Now, the UTA transit system is set to accept Isis mobile NFC payments, too. 
According to Jerry Benson of the UTA, these new ways to pay are about customer convenience -
allowing everyone to "always have the exact fare" - but also extremely helpful to the UTA to
gather data to better serve their customers.  Mobile, according to Benson, is a "great new way to
get a payment device in everybody's hands."  Since the launch of mobile payments acceptance, the
UTA has seen revenues increase by 25 percent, and contactless transactions increase from 400 to
1,000 per day, and still growing.  The long term strategy, said Benson, is to move people away
from cash and to electronic media payments. 

The Summit is being held through Thursday at the Grand America Hotel in Salt Lake City, Utah. For

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan announced a $1.5 million grant today, made through the JPMorgan
Chase Foundation, to renew its commitment to Bankers without Borders, a global
volunteer program that supports economic development in the world`s most poverty
stricken communities. J.P. Morgan`s grant allows Bankers without Borders to
develop a scalable platform that connects institutions serving the poor with
volunteers from companies who provide business skills, passion and
private-sector resources to fight global poverty. 

"At J.P. Morgan, we believe in investing in our people and communities," said
Mike Cavanagh, co-CEO of the Corporate &amp; Investment Bank. "The partnership with
Bankers without Borders enables employees to utilize their skills to help
emerging market enterprises build the technical capacity they need to thrive." 

Since the inaugural sponsorship in 2010, J.P. Morgan`s involvement has grown and
transformed with Bankers without Borders, a Grameen Foundation initiative.
Hundreds of J.P. Morgan employees have committed their time and expertise to
Bankers without Borders, collectively contributing 8,800 hours of service
globally. 

In Bangladesh, one J.P. Morgan volunteer leveraged his knowledge of local
affairs and advisory expertise to structure a deal between a non-profit
institution and a local small business to distribute goods to rural communities.
The resulting partnership employs over 12,000 women entrepreneurs to sell the
goods, including food and basic toiletries, improving market access for more
than 10 million consumers living near the poverty line. Another volunteer worked
with a Ugandan financial institution to conduct research on the mobile banking
sector and identify challenges and opportunities that would promote financial
inclusion for the world`s poorest.

consulting projects, Bankers without Borders` volunteers work to increase the
scale, sustainability and impact of the organizations they support. Volunteers
have completed more than 100,000 hours of service, worth an estimated $6 million
for more than 70 social enterprises in 20 countries. Collectively, Bankers
without Borders` social sector clients are reaching more than 18 million
individuals living in poverty.

About Disney`s Oz The Great and Powerful

Disney`s fantastical adventure "Oz The Great and Powerful," directed by Sam
Raimi, imagines the origins of L. Frank Baum`s beloved wizard character. When
Oscar Diggs (James Franco), a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics, is
hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz, he thinks he`s hit the
jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the taking-that is until he meets three
witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle
Williams), who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone`s been
expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and
its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is
too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a
bit of wizardry-Oscar transforms himself not only into the great wizard but into
a better man as well. 

"Oz The Great and Powerful" is produced by Joe Roth, with screen story by
Mitchell Kapner and screenplay by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire.
Grant Curtis, Palak Patel, Josh Donen and Philip Steuer are serving as executive
producers. "Oz The Great and Powerful" opens in U.S. theaters on March 8, 2013.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/w3v88h/walt_disney) has announced
the addition of the "Walt Disney - Company Profile" company profile to their
offering. 

Strong 2012 Q4 results 

Good results were driven by Cable &amp; Resorts, offset slightly by weakness in
Studios. 

EPS* growth of 18% (excluding the one-off gain on UTV), was driven by modest
revenue growth (of 6%), lower tax rates (down 4%) and share repurchases (of 6%).


The outlook has improved with continued margin expansion in Networks &amp; Resorts
and better film releases at Studios with the recent success of "The Avengers". 

- Q2 revenue rose $0.6 bn (+6%), to $9.6 bn; driven by Cable &amp; US Resorts. 

- Networks revenue rose $0.4 bn (+9%), to $4.7 bn; Growth was primarily in Cable
(+12%) while broadcasting was weak (+2%). Overall, affiliate fees &amp; advertising
were both up. 

- Parks &amp; Resorts revenue rose $0.3 bn (+10%), to $2.9 bn; mostly from higher
attendance &amp; spending at its US resorts. 

- Studio revenue fell $0.2 bn (-12%), to $1.2 bn; with a lack of decent films
released. 

- Excluding the UTV gain, EBIT* rose $124 m (+8%), to $1.9 bn. Margins* rose
0.3%. 

- Higher EBIT margins at Networks (up 1.6%) and Resorts (up 2.1%); were offset
by a loss in Studios (in turn due to a write off for the disastrous "John
Carter" film). 

- Net Income* rose $110 m (12%), to $1.1 bn, helped by lower tax rates (down 4%
to 32%). 

- EPS* rose $0.09 (+18%), to $0.58; boosted by 6% of shares being repurchased. 

- Note that reported EPS rose $0.14 (+29%), to $0.63; much more than the EPS*. 

- FCF fell by $1.0 bn (-75%), to $0.3 bn; due to higher CAPEX in Resorts
(Shanghai mostly). 

* = excluding the one-off gains &amp; restructuring charges on UTV (India). 

Note: Comparisons (eg. growth rates) are stated on a year-on-year basis. 

Significant recent events 

- Disney's "Avengers" film shattered records in its US debut weekend, earning
$200m. 

- The expensive "John Carter" film flops, making it a big error.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Marks Microsoft shift toward hardware, like Apple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* May keep Dell loyal to Windows, away from Android&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Risks alienating other PC makers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby and Poornima Gupta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp
 is playing defense with a $2 billion loan to help Dell
Inc's founder buy back the world's No.3 PC maker as it
seeks to shore up support for Windows and beat back the march of
Google Inc's Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment in the landmark $24 billion buyout led by
Michael Dell marks the latest step in Microsoft's plan to gain
more influence over the hardware supply chain - a departure from
the decades-old, software-centric philosophy that helped it
dominate the computing world but is now increasingly under
threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is far from clear, however, if this strategy will be
successful, while the world's largest software maker risks
upsetting other computer producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't mean it's a bad move, but it's definitely
defensive. Microsoft is realizing it must be much more engaged
in the hardware business than it used to be, it needs to be
making bets and forming relationships," said Andrew Bartels, an
analyst at Forrester Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company that built its fortune on making high-priced
software to go in other companies' computers is inching closer
to Apple Inc's belief that software and hardware must
be closely integrated for the sake of the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft struck a deal to pay Nokia to make
phones running Windows software in 2011 and a year later
invested in Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook e-reader. It then
launched its own computer, the Surface tablet, in October, which
rankled some PC makers initially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of declining PC sales and the onslaught of
Apple's iPad, "Microsoft has taken more unconventional measures
than they would have in the past," said Sid Parakh, an analyst
at investment firm McAdams Wright Ragen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, Microsoft made extra efforts not to alienate its
other PC makers, talking to them before inking the deal, said
sources familiar with Microsoft's relations with its partners,
and holding off from an ownership stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft reached out (at the highest levels) a bit before
all of it came out," one of the people said. "There were
multiple conversations. Clearly they put some thought into it
and definitely a schedule was pulled together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, world No.1 PC maker Hewlett-Packard Co (HP) 
issued a statement critical of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell "faces an extended period of uncertainty and transition
that will not be good for its customers," HP said, adding that
Dell's ability to invest in products and services will be
extremely limited with its debt load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd said it remains focused on
products and customers rather than "distracting financial
maneuvers and major strategic shifts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, advised by Lazard Ltd, declined to comment on the
terms of the Dell loan, or what exactly it gets in return, but
made it clear it would look for "opportunities to support"
companies that buy in to Windows, in whatever form. That
suggests this may not be its last third-party investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there is no guarantee that Microsoft's loan will give
it any sway over Dell at all. One former Microsoft executive
said the deal was pointless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know Michael (Dell), he will continue to run his empire
the way he has always done - without any outside influence,"
said Joachim Kempin, once Microsoft's top executive in charge of
its relationships with PC makers, who left the company in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLATFORM WARS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Steve Ballmer made it clear last year that
he sees Microsoft as a "devices and services" company with an
explicit interest in hardware, whoever it is made by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has every interest to keep such a key player in
its ecosystem alive and well," said Al Hilwa, an analyst at tech
research firm IDC. "Dell supplies a large number of Microsoft
customers with hardware, and it is important that their
confidence is bolstered in the overall Microsoft ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell decided last year to focus its tablet strategy on the
new Windows 8 operating system, in contrast to rivals such as
Samsung, Asus and Lenovo, which are
hedging or leading with Google's Android system, and HP
which said this week it would make a Google Chromebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell did experiment with Android with its Streak tablet in
2010, but it flopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This investment might help Microsoft influence whether Dell
adopts Android or not, that is likely the goal behind this," 
said Parakh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loan, negotiated by Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer
Peter Klein, takes the form of a 10-year subordinated note and 
will pay 7 percent to 8 percent interest, according to sources
familiar with the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear how much sway Microsoft will have on Dell's
strategy, but the two have been close partners for 25 years, and
will likely build on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think Microsoft is going to run Dell at any time or
have a dispositive say in what Dell does," said one source
familiar with Microsoft's thinking, who asked not to be named.
"Microsoft wants to continue to have a strong and ever deepening
relationship with Dell and you can take it as the expectation on
both sides."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCs are clearly in decline, with sales falling last year for
the first time in a decade as the popularity of tablets surges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts suggest Microsoft got involved in the deal to
learn more from Dell about selling to businesses and
individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dell is one of the best at building hardware and putting an
operating system on it," said Michael Cherry, an analyst at
Directions on Microsoft, an independent consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the rise of Google trying to sell into enterprises, it
should help Microsoft to have some influence over one of the
largest IT vendors, said Parakh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not always been successful in its tech
investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its multi-billion dollar bets on cable firms AT Inc 
and Comcast Corp in the late 1990s did not yield
success. Its $150 million in a struggling Apple in 1997 ended a
long-running patent spat between the two companies, but saved
Apple and put it on course to eclipse Microsoft financially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Apple is the model, and Microsoft can't become Apple
overnight," said Bartels at Forrester. "But it needs to have
really good partners."&lt;/p&gt;

ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Today's work environments profit from new means of getting things done.
Collaboration and social communication are key to successful business. German
company foresee, First Finalist for Best of Show of IBM Connect 2013, has
introduced its SOCIAL COLLABORATION ROOM at IBM Connect in Orlando. With this
ground breaking new work environment, foresee is perfectly in tune with this
year's conference slogan: "Get social. Do business."

The Future Of Work Is Only a Touch Away 

The computer has revolutionized individual work, but how can globally
distributed teams cooperate and at the same time ensure that everybody is
talking about the same things? At IBM Connect 2013 German company foresee
introduced the SOCIAL COLLABORATION ROOM. This groundbreaking integrated work
environment consists of an interactive table with cutting edge multi-touch
hardware (InteracTable), a vertical screen (Screenmate) and an intuitive
multi-touch application. The result? Instant connection of workforces from
anywhere on any device, shared documents, video conferencing, innovative
interfaces and instant meetings at the finger tips of collaborating teams. 

Frank Sonder, CEO and Co-Founder of foresee, and his team are proud that their
company was part of the Opening General Session at IBM Connect: "It was a great
honor that we were invited to be part of this important event. foresee is
especially proud of having been part of the opening session where we were able
to present our solution which in the end was nominated First Finalist for the
BEST OF SHOW AWARD." Frank Sonder's session "Collaboration Re-Invented" was as
well received by the audience in Orlando as the presentation of the SOCIAL
COLLABORATION ROOM itself. 

Full Integration With IBM Connections and IBM Sametime 

The setup of the SOCIAL COLLABORATION ROOM by foresee allows users to
intuitively work on documents using multi-touch gestures and share them with
other locations. The magic does not stop there though. By integrating community
members, activities and content streams it is possible to create tasks, link
information or import content from any third party application. The SOCIAL
COLLABORATION ROOM is fully integrated with IBM Connections and IBM Sametime.
This way, a meeting does not end with every participant taking home a pile of
memos. Instead the SOCIAL COLLABORATION ROOM and the corresponding software
allow for an ongoing collaboration leading to more effective projects and better
business. The solution can be used out-of-the-box with IBM SmartCloud. foresee
and its German partner GIS provide various deployment options. 

COLLABORATION ROOM Is A Win For Continental Tire Germany 

Continental Tire Germany, part of Continental AG, is one of the first companies
to put the COLLABORATION ROOM to use in multiple locations. Continental was
looking for a solution to make coordination more effective, improve
collaboration, reduce travel costs and overcome the limitations of available
video conferencing solutions. Continental executives now have a means to
intuitively, quickly and securely engage in team collaboration from anywhere on
any device.

integration environment

Oslo, Norway (December 6, 2013) -AIMS Innovation, a system monitoring software company, today
announced the launch of Health Check, a performance report of the BizTalk integration environment.

monitoring tool will shine a light on the organizational risks of downtime, and knowing the
general 'health' of your integration environment can help position systems integration as a
strategic priority within your organization."

$5.6 billion project is second-stage development of successful Mafumeira Field
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) announced today that its Cabinda Gulf Oil
Company Limited subsidiary will proceed with the development of the Mafumeira
Sul project located offshore Angola. 

Located 15 miles (24 km) offshore Cabinda province in 200 feet (60 m) of water,
the $5.6 billion Mafumeira Sul project is the second stage of development of the
Mafumeira Field located in Block 0. The project scope includes 50 wells, two
wellhead platforms, a central processing and compression facility and
approximately 75 miles (121 km) of subsea pipelines. 

"This decision demonstrates our commitment to further developing opportunities
in Angola where Chevron has a leading position and further adds to our strong
queue of major capital projects under development," said George Kirkland, vice
chairman, Chevron Corporation. 

"When completed, this project is expected to grow the company`s production
capacity in the Mafumeira Field," said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa
and Latin America Exploration and Production Company. "This development builds
off the success of the Mafumeira Norte project and our strong track record of
developing other major capital projects in the region." 

Mafumeira Sul is expected to reach first oil in 2015 and build toward peak total
daily production of 110,000 barrels of crude oil and 10,000 barrels of liquefied
petroleum gas. Associated natural gas will be commercialized through the Angola
Liquefied Natural Gas (ALNG) plant in Soyo, Angola. 

Chevron`s subsidiary is the operator and holds a 39.2 percent interest in
Mafumeira Sul. Chevron`s partners are Sonangol E.P. (41 percent), Total (10
percent) and ENI (9.8 percent). Mafumeira Norte, the initial development of the
Mafumeira Field, achieved first oil in 2009 and currently produces more than
40,000 barrels of oil a day. Chevron produces 340,000 barrels of oil and
condensate (108,000 net) from Block 0. 

Chevron is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is driven by
the ingenuity and commitment of its employees and their application of the most
innovative technologies in the world. Chevron is involved in virtually every
facet of the energy industry. The company explores for, produces and transports
crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels
and other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Feb 06 (Marketwire) -- 
JPR Communications, a proactive and strategic public relations firm
specializing in launching startups and establishing data storage/cloud
computing brands worldwide, announced today the company has reached a
milestone of $4 billion in client acquisitions. 

    Western Digital's recently announced acquisition of JPR client Arkeia
Software was preceded by IBM's acquisition of Texas Memory Systems,
Intel's purchase of NEVEX Virtual Technologies, and EMC's acquisition of
XtremIO, equating to $1 billion in acquisitions in 2012 alone.

    Strategic communications counseling plays a key role in positioning
companies for growth and/or acquisition, and working with experienced
agency specialists is a critical component. Companies that have been
acquired while represented by JPR have benefitted from increased
valuation and visibility in business and trade publications and from
being established as leaders in their markets. They have also experienced
significant revenue growth. Obviously,they have also captured the
attention of large companies looking to add disruptive technologies to
their offerings. 

    "Four billion dollars in total acquisitions is a major milestone and a
source of pride, since it indicates we are positioning our clients for
success and profit," said agency principal Judy Smith. "Whether it's a
new company with a groundbreaking product, or a company that's dominating
a market another vendor wants to enter, we believe effective PR makes a
world of difference when making a short list of acquisition candidates."

    Major vendors look at startups like NEVEX and XtremIO to bring promising,
disruptive technologies under their own roofs, while established
companies like Arkeia and Texas Memory Systems are frequently purchased
for assets like their executive and engineering teams, a large customer
base, strength in channel sales, and industry reputation. 

    Other notable JPR client acquisitions prior to 2012 included IO Turbine,
acquired by Fusion-io; Ocarina Networks, acquired by Dell; Spinnaker
Networks, acquired by NetApp; and numerous other companies in the data
storage market acquired by EMC. A full list can be viewed at

Recognized for Outstanding and Dedicated Individual Service in the Interest of
National Security
ARLINGTON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
CACI International Inc (NYSE:CACI) announced today that Dr. J.P. (Jack) London
(Captain, USN, Retired), CACI Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board, has
been honored with the Nathan Hale Award from the Reserve Officers Association
(ROA) at the organization`s 90th anniversary celebration at the Willard Hotel in
Washington, D.C. The award is given to prominent federal, state, and local
government and civic leaders to recognize outstanding and dedicated individual
service in the interest of national security, reflecting the patriotic
dedication to America epitomized by Nathan Hale. Founded by General John J.
Pershing, the ROA provides a wide range of professional and personal benefits to
its membership and keeps reservists and their families apprised of important
topics such as call-ups and legislative actions. 

Dr. London is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy (1959) and the Naval
Postgraduate School (1967). He holds a doctorate in business administration
conferred "with distinction" from The George Washington University (1971).
During his 12 years of active duty as a regular officer (1959-1971) during the
Cold War, he was a naval aviator and carrier pilot serving with U.S. Navy
"hunter-killer" task forces arrayed against the Soviet Union`s strategic nuclear
submarine threat. At the height of the Vietnam War, he served as aide and
administrative assistant to the Vice Chief of the Naval Material Command,
Department of the Navy (1969-70). Dr. London left active duty in 1971 and joined
the U.S. Navy Reserve, retiring as a captain in 1983, after having served as
commanding officer of aeronautical engineering units with the Naval Air Systems
Command, Washington, D.C. 

Over his 40 years of service with the company, Dr. London`s leadership has been
instrumental in helping CACI grow from a small consulting firm into a worldwide
information solutions and services company with more than 15,000 employees
serving vital national needs in defense, intelligence, homeland security, and
the modernization of government. His strategic vision and insight into the
evolving trend lines of the government marketplace served as the foundation of
the company`s growth in rapidly changing business climates. The robust mergers
and acquisition program Dr. London initiated has brought more than 50
acquisitions to CACI, including companies that have greatly strengthened CACI`s
position in the security and intelligence services markets and enhanced its
support for Department of Defense initiatives and defense of the homeland.
CACI`s service as a national asset for national priorities is demonstrated by
its dedicated focus on supporting the men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces,
both in-theatre and when they return home. The company's award-winning Deploying
Talent - Creating Careers program hires veterans with disabilities and provides
them with opportunities to use their unique skill sets to build careers. 

Today, CACI has revenue of $3.8 billion dollars and continues to capture new
business in high-growth, high-priority areas of its large addressable market,
with emphasis on the critical missions of customers in the intelligence, cyber,
healthcare, business systems, and integrated security solutions arenas. 

Commenting on the honor, Dr. London noted, "I am most humbled and appreciative
to be the recipient of this award, named after one of our nation`s greatest
sons. It is also a fitting tribute to CACI`s dedicated efforts to keep America
safe and free. With nearly one quarter of our employees coming from the U.S.
Armed Forces, we remain ever vigilant in doing work that is in the best interest
of our remarkable servicemen and women." 

Dr. Warren Phillips, Lead Director of CACI`s board noted, "We congratulate Dr.
London on receiving the Nathan Hale Award from the Reserve Officers Association.
This recognition exemplifies the spirit of patriotism that has marked Jack`s
conduct over the years. And it reinforces CACI`s consistent emphasis on
developing solutions that directly support mission success for our forces
worldwide." 

CACI provides information solutions and services in support of national security
missions and government transformation for Intelligence, Defense, and Federal
Civilian clients. A member of the Fortune 1000 Largest Companies and the Russell
2000 Index, CACI provides dynamic careers for approximately 15,500 employees
working in over 120 offices worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) earned the envy of its rivals this week as the investment bank secured a rare monopoly on the fees tied to a record stock offering by Asia's biggest oil refiner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $3.1 billion share sale by Sinopec (0386.HK), as China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp is known, is the largest-ever equity deal to be handled by a single bank in Asia excluding Japan, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means Goldman pocketed all underwriting and brokerage fees associated with the deal, at a time when banks are scrambling for roles in the region's equity capital market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banks knew Sinopec had been planning to raise funds for overseas acquisitions, but it was Goldman that managed to secure the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one person familiar with the matter, the combined sum that Goldman earned from the offering was around $40 million. Such a payout would be much larger than the average fees tied to similar transactions in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a coup, and because it comes with league table credit, it gives them a major boost because it's on a sole basis," said Philippe Espinasse, a former investment banker with Nomura and UBS in Hong Kong and author of 'IPO: A Global Guide.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fees are usually negotiated in private, so it is very difficult to determine the precise sum a bank earns from handling a financial transaction. Fees can run much higher or lower than what's expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The around $40 million sum that the source cited would not fall too far from industry norms, based on current fee standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brokerage commissions between buyers and sellers typically range from 0.5 to 1 percent of the total, or roughly $30 million at the low end in this instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was also paid an estimated underwriting fee by the issuer Sinopec of around $9.19 million, according to Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting data that estimates fee values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment. A Sinopec spokeswoman did not immediately respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large deals usually involve several international and local banks, with fees spread across all participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the five bookrunners handling American International Group Inc's (AIG.N) share selldown in AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK) in December received around $16 million maximum per bank, even though that deal was more than double the size of the Sinopec offering, according to Thomson Reuters calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Michael Flaherty and Ryan Woo)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A U.S. judge narrowed a patent lawsuit brought by Google's Motorola Mobility unit against Microsoft Corp, finding that parts of three Motorola patents are invalid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling on Thursday came from U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle, who is overseeing a tandem lawsuit in which Microsoft claims Motorola deserves only a small royalty on many of its telecommunications patents. Google bought Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly for its intellectual property stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc and Microsoft have been litigating in courts around the world against Google and partners such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which use the Android operating system on their mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS smartphone software and Microsoft holds patents it contends cover a number of Android features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola had sought up to $4 billion a year for its wireless and video patents, while Microsoft argues its rival deserves about $1 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If U.S. District Judge James Robart decides Google deserves only a small royalty, then its Motorola patents would be a weaker bargaining chip for Google to negotiate licensing deals with rivals.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 7 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge narrowed a patent lawsuit
brought by Google's Motorola Mobility unit against
Microsoft Corp, finding that parts of three Motorola
patents are invalid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling on Thursday came from U.S. District Judge James
Robart in Seattle, who is overseeing a tandem lawsuit in which
Microsoft claims Motorola deserves only a small royalty on many
of its telecommunications patents. Google bought Motorola for
$12.5 billion, partly for its intellectual property stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc and Microsoft have been litigating in
courts around the world against Google and partners such as
Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which use the Android
operating system on their mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS
smartphone software and Microsoft holds patents it contends
cover a number of Android features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola had sought up to $4 billion a year for its wireless
and video patents, while Microsoft argues its rival deserves
about $1 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If U.S. District Judge James Robart decides Google deserves
only a small royalty, then its Motorola patents would be a
weaker bargaining chip for Google to negotiate licensing deals
with rivals. A ruling on that issue is expected sometime in the
next several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Microsoft filed its case over the royalty amounts,
Motorola sued Microsoft on three patents that cover video
technology. In an order on Thursday, Robart found that parts of
those patents are "indefinite," which means Motorola's patent
language did not distinctly articulate the invention. Other
parts of those patents are still active in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Google spokesperson declined to comment and a Microsoft
representative could not immediately comment when reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in U.S. District Court, Western District of
Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil on Thursday
declared force majeure on Nigeria's benchmark Qua Iboe crude oil
exports due to pipeline repair work, the company's local unit
said, cutting output from Africa's top producer.
    Nigeria is among the world's top 10 crude exporters and
usually ships around 2 million barrels per day, supplying the
United States, China and India with its light oil.
    Qua Iboe is Nigeria's largest crude oil stream with exports,
before this announcement, expected to be around 400,000 bpd in
February, according to shipping schedules.
    At least three cargoes due to be shipped in February have
already been pushed back to March, traders said last month.
 
    "We are working to minimize down-time and have notified
appropriate regulatory agencies and purchasers. We regret any
inconveniences this may cause our customers," a statement from
Mobil Nigeria said.
    Exxon only lifted a three-week long force majeure on Qua
Iboe on December 10 last year, which was put in place due to
outages caused by flooding and oil spills.
    Fellow oil majors Shell, Total and Eni
 declared force majeure on Nigerian oil and gas exports
late last year as oil theft and flooding caused serious outages.
 
    Oil theft is a major problem in the winding creeks and
waterways of the Niger Delta, where it is easy to conceal boats
and illegal refineries in the dense mangroves. Nigeria estimates
around 150,000 bpd is stolen, much of which is sold abroad.

Kentish Knock South-1 adds to Chevron`s queue of offshore natural gas
opportunities in Australia
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced the 20th discovery off the
Western Australian coast since mid-2009 by its Australian subsidiary following
further drilling success in the Exmouth Plateau area, located in the prolific
Carnarvon Basin, a premier hydrocarbon basin. 

The Kentish Knock South-1 exploration discovery well encountered approximately
246 feet (75 meters) of net gas pay in the upper Mungaroo Sands. The well is
located in the WA-365-P permit area approximately 173 miles (280 kilometres)
north of Exmouth off the Western Australian coast. The well was drilled in 3,832
feet (1,168 meters) of water to a total depth of 10,056 feet (3,065 meters). 

"The Asia Pacific region is key to Chevron`s growth strategy and our strong
Australia natural gas portfolio continues to be bolstered by our strategic
approach to finding and developing resources that will help meet the growing
energy needs in the region," said George Kirkland, vice chairman, Chevron
Corporation. 

Melody Meyer, president, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production
Company, said, "Kentish Knock South-1 is an important addition to our queue of
high-quality offshore natural gas opportunities in Australia and further
supports our long-term plans to expand our Australian LNG position."

IBM IT service management software integrates with Emerson Network Power`s
Trellis platform
COLUMBUS, Ohio--(Business Wire)--
Emerson Network Power, a business of Emerson (NYSE: EMR) and a global leader in
maximizing availability, capacity, and efficiency of critical infrastructure,
today announced that it will combine the capabilities of its TrellisTM platform
with IBM IT service management (ITSM) software to significantly optimize the
management of data center resources. This integrated data center infrastructure
management (DCIM) solution will deliver increased energy and operational
efficiency and improved IT service delivery. 

DCIM is an essential component for businesses that have high quality of service
demands for information technologies and need to scale quickly. An estimated
$450 million market today, DCIM is expected to grow to $1.7 billion by 2016,
according to industry analyst firm Gartner.*

Emerson customer Brocade is one of many IT-intensive businesses struggling to
solve growth-related infrastructure challenges. The company recognizes the value
of combining DCIM and ITSM capabilities in providing information and metrics to
support the strategic resource allocation and investment required to meet future
needs. "`Do more with less` has become standard operating policy in IT and data
center environments. At the same time, the mix of physical and virtual assets is
growing exponentially," said Valery Sokolov, senior manager, Engineering Lab
Services, Brocade. "Because of these trends, there is a real business case for
tools and applications that will provide the visibility and metrics required to
manage IT resources and facilities provisioning efficiently and productively.
This is where DCIM and ITSM applications become critical to provide the data
required to achieve that goal, as well as to plan and model growth." 

Integrating IBM software with Emerson`s Trellis platform will provide real-time
visibility from IT applications, through infrastructure components, and all the
way to the power grid, enabling holistic management of the data center
ecosystem. This information can be used to improve energy efficiency and space
and capacity utilization, enable rapid problem management and resource
provisioning, and improve operational efficiency, all of which reduce the risk
of downtime and enhance the delivery of IT services. 

Industry analyst firm IDC, which has been studying the DCIM market since its
inception, believes this integration can deliver customer benefits. "The
combination of Emerson`s real-time infrastructure optimization capabilities in
the Trellis platform and IBM`s suite of enterprise system management
capabilities has the potential to help IT and facilities teams deploy a
comprehensive data center infrastructure management solution to increase energy
and operational efficiency," said Jennifer Koppy, research manager, IDC. 

The combined capabilities of Emerson`s Trellis platform and IBM software will
also enable data center managers to understand the true costs of running an
application with metrics like watts per workload, calculate its resource demands
in real-time, and dynamically provision physical and logical resources to
support the application efficiently and cost-effectively. 

"Managing the physical constraints of available space and power in the data
center is becoming a greater challenge for organizations. This, combined with
the increasing demand on the enterprise for reliable and agile IT services,
makes finding a cost-effective solution critical for our customers," said Jamie
Thomas, vice president, Tivoli strategy and development, IBM. "The combination
of Emerson Network Power`s market-leading DCIM solution - the Trellis platform -
along with our solutions for IT service management and systems management, is an
ideal way to meet these customer needs with innovative capabilities." 

Steve Hassell, president of Emerson Network Power`s Avocent business, added:
"Aligning our DCIM capabilities with IBM`s software capabilities enables data
center managers and IT and facilities leaders to see, decide, and act across all
resources. This collaboration with IBM is a strong validation of our DCIM
strategy and the ability of the Trellis platform to improve how data centers are
currently managed and operated. Our collaboration will span engineering,
development, and go-to-market strategies, and we are making significant
investments to realize the full potential of our work together." 

As part of this collaboration, IBM will resell the Emerson Trellis platform as
its DCIM solution. Details of the Trellis platform integration roadmap with IBM
Tivoli software will be available in March at the IBM PULSE 2013 conference. To

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, Feb 07 (Marketwire) -- 
NuVasive, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUVA), a medical device company focused on
developing minimally disruptive surgical products and procedures for the
spine, announced today that Bill Walton, Basketball Hall-of-Famer and a
Better Way Back(R) patient ambassador, has successfully completed a
nationwide tour speaking about the benefits of minimally invasive spine
surgery.

    For years, Bill Walton experienced debilitating chronic back and leg pain
during his years on and off the court that nearly compromised his current
position as a sports commentator. Bill's pain left him unable to walk,
sit or drive a car. After undergoing the minimally disruptive XLIF(R)
(eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion) procedure, Bill found relief, has
fully recovered, and is back to his active lifestyle. 

    "I was standing at the edge of the bridge, ready to jump before I found
the treatment that allowed me to play again in the wonderful 'game of
life,'" said Bill Walton. "I was terrified of spine surgery and waited
too long before seeking help. With the right treatment, doctor, and
technology there is hope. As with all surgical procedures, spine surgery
carries risks that should be discussed with a doctor, but my message to
other patients is don't wait; take control of your health and your life!
If I can do it, you can too!"

    Bill is sharing his story as a key spokesman for The Better Way Back, a
patient education program developed and funded by NuVasive. The program
is dedicated to helping individuals overcome the challenges of chronic
back and leg pain by providing them with the resources they need to find
treatment and emotional support. Bill traveled throughout Texas, North
Carolina, Massachusetts and California, speaking about his recovery to
patients looking for similar solutions to their chronic back and leg
pain. Drawing on his own recovery from debilitating back pain, Bill
refers to himself as "the luckiest man alive" and continuously provides
hope and inspiration to patients and their loved ones.

    "Since Bill has experienced debilitating back and leg pain, he has a
unique perspective in sharing his story with pre-operative patients,"
said Keith Valentine, NuVasive President and Chief Operations Officer.
"In addition to sharing his story with pre-operative patients as well as
hospitals and clinicians, Bill acts as an advocate for spine patients and
the spine industry. Bill has personally met with legislative and
regulatory decision makers, in hopes of improving access for spine
patients to innovative treatment options. As Bill's experience shows,
thoughtful diagnosis and treatment gives patients a new start, filled
with activity and free from pain."

    About NuVasive

    NuVasive is a medical device company focused on developing minimally
disruptive surgical products and procedurally integrated solutions for
the spine. The Company is the 4th largest player in the $8.2 billion
global spine market. NuVasive's principal product offering is based on
its Maximum Access Surgery, or MAS(R) platform. The MAS platform combines
several categories of solutions that collectively minimize soft tissue
disruption during spine surgery with maximum visualization and safe, easy
reproducibility for the surgeon: a proprietary software-driven nerve
avoidance system and intra-operative monitoring support; MaXcess(R), a
unique split-blade retractor system; a wide variety of specialized
implants; and several biologic fusion enhancers. MAS significantly
reduces surgery time and returns patients to activities of daily living
much faster than conventional approaches. Having redefined spine surgery
with the MAS platform's lateral approach, known as eXtreme Lateral
Interbody Fusion, or XLIF(R), NuVasive has built an entire spine
franchise. With over 80 products today spanning lumbar, thoracic and
cervical applications, the Company will continue to expand and evolve its
offering predicated on its R focus and dedication to outstanding
service levels supported by a culture of Absolute Responsiveness(R).

that involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors which,
if they do not materialize or prove correct, could cause NuVasive's
results to differ materially from historical results or those expressed
or implied by such forward-looking statements. The potential risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual growth and results to differ
materially include, but are not limited to: the risk that NuVasive's
revenue or earnings projections may turn out to be inaccurate because of
the preliminary nature of the forecasts and the risk of further
adjustment, or unanticipated difficulty in selling products or generating
expected profitability; the uncertain process of seeking regulatory
approval or clearance for NuVasive's products or devices, including risks
that such process could be significantly delayed; the possibility that
the FDA may require significant changes to NuVasive's products or
clinical studies; the risk that products may not perform as intended and
may therefore not achieve commercial success; the risk that competitors
may develop superior products or may have a greater market position
enabling more successful commercialization; the risk that additional
clinical data may call into question the benefits of NuVasive's products
to patients, hospitals and surgeons; and other risks and uncertainties

&lt;p&gt;Feb 8 (Reuters) - An international tribunal arbitrating Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) long-running legal dispute over pollution in Ecuador has found the country violated the panel's previous order to do all it could to prevent enforcement of a contested $19 billion judgment against the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribunal, acting under The Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration, said the Ecuador government should have stopped plaintiffs in the case from going to courts in Brazil, Argentina and Canada to try to collect the judgment handed down by an Ecuadorean court in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling by the panel came a year after it reaffirmed its original 2011 finding that the Quito government "take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;judgment against (Chevron) in the Lago Agrio case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorean court ruled in February 2011 that Chevron  should pay billions to plaintiffs living in the region around Ecuador's Lago Agrio, who had sued the company over pollution in the country's rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That judgment came a decade after Chevron bought Texaco, and 18 years after Texaco was first accused in a New York court of polluting the Ecuadorean rain forest and sickening people there.

&lt;p&gt;* Chevron filed for arbitration in 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Ecuador court found Chevron liable for $19 bln in damages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ecuadoreans sued over pollution of rain forest in 1993&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 8 (Reuters) - An international tribunal arbitrating
Chevron Corp's long-running legal dispute over pollution
in Ecuador has found the country violated the panel's previous
order to do all it could to prevent enforcement of a contested
$19 billion judgment against the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tribunal, acting under The Hague's Permanent Court of
Arbitration, said the Ecuador government should have stopped
plaintiffs in the case from going to courts in Brazil, Argentina
and Canada to try to collect the judgment handed down by an
Ecuadorean court in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling by the panel came a year after it reaffirmed its
original 2011 finding that the Quito government "take all
measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the
enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any
judgment against (Chevron) in the Lago Agrio case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorean court ruled in February 2011 that Chevron 
should pay billions to plaintiffs living in the region around
Ecuador's Lago Agrio, who had sued the company over pollution in
the country's rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That judgment came a decade after Chevron bought Texaco, and
18 years after Texaco was first accused in a New York court of
polluting the Ecuadorean rain forest and sickening people there.
The case was moved to Ecuador after Texaco argued for a change
in venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has contested the Ecuador court judgment, saying it

and fraud charges against the lawyers for the Ecuadorean
plaintiffs, in a case due to go to trial in New York in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador's attorney general contends the three-person
arbitration tribunal has no jurisdiction because Quito's
bilateral trade agreement with Washington took effect five years
after Texaco ended operations in Ecuador in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country has also said it cannot control the actions of

are not part of the tribunal proceedings, said courts hearing
enforcement actions would likely pay little attention to the
tribunal since it was not binding on the rain-forest

&lt;p&gt;* Ecuador court found Chevron liable for $19 bln in damages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ecuadorean plaintiffs seek enforcement in Canada,
Argentina, Brazil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ecuadoreans sued over pollution of rain forest in 1993&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STANFORD, Calif., Feb 8 (Reuters) - An international
tribunal weighing in on Chevron Corp's long-running
legal dispute over pollution in Ecuador has found the country in
violation of past orders to try to prevent enforcement of a
contested $19 billion judgment against the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formed via The Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration under
the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, the
panel is hearing a case brought by Chevron to determine whether
Ecuador violated a treaty with the United States requiring it to
ensure the company gets a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling - posted online by Chevron on Friday - comes a year after the tribunal reinforced its 2011
finding on enforcement suspension. The panel will consider all
the case's issues next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ecuadorean court first ruled against Chevron in February
2011. That was a decade after Chevron bought Texaco, and 18
years after Texaco was accused in a New York court of polluting
the Ecuadorean rain forest and sickening people there. After
Texaco argued for it, the case was moved to Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador's attorney general contends the three-person
arbitration tribunal has no jurisdiction because the bilateral
trade agreement went into effect five years after Texaco ended
operations in Ecuador in 1992. The attorney general was not
available for comment on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its Feb. 7 ruling, the tribunal cited the legal actions
of the rain forest plaintiffs in Argentina, Canada and Brazil to
collect on the $19 billion award made by the Lago Agrio court in
Ecuador, or the "Respondent." These actions were made because
Chevron - the "Claimants" - no longer has assets in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From its perspective under international law, this Tribunal
is the only tribunal with the power to restrain the Respondent
generally from aggravating the Parties' dispute and causing
irreparable harm to the Claimants in regard to the enforcement
and execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment," the panel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in a statement that the tribunal would next
consider compensation and whether Ecuador should pay for any
enforcement-related damages that the company has incurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has many strands. Chevron says it uncovered through
U.S. courts evidence of fraud by lawyers for the Ecuadorean
plaintiffs, which the lawyers deny. The second-largest U.S. oil
company is pursuing racketeering and fraud charges against them,
in a case due to go to trial in New York in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at a day-long symposium on the two decades of litigation
hosted by Stanford Law School, Graham Erion, who works for the
plaintiffs on the enforcement action, said the case had entered
a new and decisive phase. He cited an infamous Chevron statement
about fighting the case "until Hell freezes over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm from Canada. I know what ice looks like," he said.
"We're on the ice right now, and that's where this case is being
fought."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A court in Argentina last week upheld a freeze on Chevron
assets there related to the enforcement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In expectation of this global battle, Chevron filed for the
arbitration in September 2009. The panel includes a
Chevron-named member, Horacio Grigera Naon of the American
University law college, one named by Ecuador, Oxford Professor
Vaughan Lowe, and London lawyer V.V. Veeder, chosen by the other
two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. fraud and racketeering case is Chevron Corp v.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded 13 classes, removed two from Rating Watch Negative
and affirmed seven classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities
Trust, (JPMCC) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2007-CIBC20
due to increased loss expectations associated with the specially serviced assets
and on performing loans with declines in performance indicative of a higher
probability of default. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of
this press release. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Fitch modeled losses of 13.1% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the
original pool balance total 13.5%, including $45.8 million or 1.8% of the
original pool balance in realized losses to date. This is an increase from the
previous modeled 11.6% of original pool balance, and is primarily attributed to
declining valuations on the specially serviced assets. Fitch has designated 52
loans (32.9%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 15 specially serviced
assets (15.8%). 

As of the January 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance
has been reduced by 10.7% to $2.27 billion from $2.54 billion at issuance. No
loans have defeased since issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting
classes L through NR. 

The largest contributor to expected losses is the North Hills Mall loan (6.2% of
the pool), which is secured by a 576,431 square foot (sf) regional lifestyle
center located in Raleigh, NC within the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill MSA,
referred to as 'The Research Triangle'. The property is anchored by J.C. Penney,
Regal Entertainment, REI, and Target (not part of the collateral). There is also
a 101,354 sf office component. The 200 room Renaissance Hotel is not part of the
collateral. The property has struggled with low cash flow and declining debt
service since issuance. Although as of June 2012, the debt-service coverage
ratio (DSCR) has shown improvement to 1.17x from 1.06x at year-end (YE) 2011 and
1.20x at issuance. The property is 98.3% occupied as of October 2012. There is
approximately 10% of the net rentable scheduled to roll in 2014. Per REIS, as of
the third quarter (3Q) 2012, the Raleigh retail market had a vacancy rate of
9.5% with asking rents at $18.57. The average in-line base rents at the property
are slightly above market. 

The next largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced STF
Portfolio (1.9%), originally secured at issuance by a portfolio of 19 properties
totaling 1.2 million sf located in McAllen, TX, El Paso, TX and Santa Theresa,
NM. The loan transferred to special servicing in August 2010 for payment
default. In July 2012, the special servicer foreclosed on 17 properties, the
remaining two NM properties are expected to be foreclosed in February 2013. The
special servicer is in discussions with 9 existing tenants for a renewal of
approximately 96,891 sf and three new leases have been signed. There are eight
properties currently remaining in the portfolio. 

The third largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced
Baldwin Park Retail asset (1.8%), which is secured by an 182,464 sf retail
property located in Orlando, FL. The property is anchored by a Publix, CVS, and
other small retail units. The asset transferred into special servicing in June
2010 for payment default. Foreclosure occurred in November 2012. As of December
2012, the property was 73.6% occupied with a DSCR of 0.34x. Per REIS as of the
fourth quarter (4Q) 2012, the Orlando retail market had a vacancy rate of 13.7%.
The Northeast submarket had vacancy rates of 11.5% and 12.3% for anchored and
non-anchored retail. 

Fitch downgrades and removes from Rating Watch Negative the following two
classes: 

--$219.3 million class A-M to 'Asf' from 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$35 million class A-MFX to 'Asf' from 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable. 

In addition Fitch downgrades and assigns Rating Outlooks or Recovery Estimates
(REs) to the following classes as indicated: 

--$152.6 million class A-J to 'Bsf' from 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Negative; 

--$31.8 million class B to 'CCCsf' from 'BBsf'; RE 100%;

--$208.6 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$991.7 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects diplomat's name to James Jeffrey from Jeffrey James)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Peg Mackey and Isabel Coles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON/ARBIL, Iraq Feb 8 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil 
has hired a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq as a consultant,
diplomats and industry sources said, as the U.S. major faces a
dilemma over whether to operate in the south of the country or
honor its deals with the autonomous Kurdistan region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki last month made Exxon an
offer in a bid to woo back the company, which had seemed intent
on pulling out of the $50 billion West Qurna 1 oilfield in the
south under the central government's jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The substance of Maliki's offer to Exxon is not known, but
industry sources describe it as substantial and say it is likely
to involve much sweeter contract terms. The condition is that
Exxon quit the northern Kurdish region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether James Jeffrey was hired specifically
to handle the dilemma and its fallout, but industry sources and
diplomats said it was likely to work in the central government's
favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He probably has better relations in Baghdad than in Arbil,"
said a former U.S. diplomat on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since signing for six blocs with the Kurdistan regional
government in 2011, Exxon has put itself on one of Iraq's
deepest faultlines: between the northern enclave and Baghdad,
which says only it has the authority to grant oil contacts and
control crude exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kurds argue their right to their own oil policy is
enshrined in the country's federal constitution, drawn up
following the U.S.-led invasion of 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi oil officials and Kurdish politicians have said
publically they are certain Exxon will choose them over the
other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad has the advantage of pursuing a goal aligned with
the foreign policy of the United States, which has actively
discouraged the KRG from pursuing its own oil policy, fearing it
will precipitate the break-up of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions between Iraqi Kurds and the Shi'ite-led government
are such that both sides deployed their respective armies to
reinforce positions along their disputed internal border last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials say the solution lies in a national oil law
that has been caught up for years in a power struggle between
Sunni, Shi'ite and ethnic Kurdish factions, which has
intensified since U.S. troops withdrew in December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of Iraq's parliamentary oil and energy committee
told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that passing
legislation to govern the world's fourth largest oil reserves
was "at the bottom of the government's list."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon's made some big hires to patch up mistakes, which
could indicate they may be willing to scale down in Kurdistan" 
another diplomatic source told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the first major oil company to risk Baghdad's ire by
venturing north, Exxon afforded the Kurds a victory in their
ongoing turf war with the central government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it would be a symbolic blow if Exxon left, the
region is now host to a number of other majors such as Total
, Russia's Gazprom Neft and Chevron Corp
, and is determined to get greater energy autonomy.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A proposed liquidation plan for MF Global Holdings Ltd fails to take into account that its finance unit is being hit twice for the same debt, undercutting what some creditors might recover, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co said in a court filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creditors of the finance unit could get up to 47.7 percent of their money if the double liability were voided, according to the filing by JPMorgan, which is an agent and lender under the unit's $1.2 billion liquidity facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is more than the maximum 33.6 percent that those creditors would receive under the plan proposed earlier this month by Silver Point Capital, Knighthead Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in conjunction with trustee Louis Freeh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several legal strategies for voiding the double liability of the finance unit, according to the filing JPMorgan made late on Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the holding company claim against the finance unit were subordinated to lenders' claims against the finance unit, the lenders could recover nearly 60 percent of their money, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brett Miller, an attorney at Morrison &amp; Foerster who represents the trustee, declined to comment on JPMorgan's filing. Silver Point Capital and Bruce Bennett, a Jones Day attorney who represents the liquidation plan proponents, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disputed double liability stems from $931 million that was borrowed under a liquidity facility in the days leading up to the bankruptcy of MF Global in October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the holding company borrowed the money, the finance unit was also a borrower under the facility, creating the first liability. After the holding company received the money, it then transferred $928 million to the finance unit, creating a second liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The impact of this double liability on Finco creditor recoveries is significant," the JPMorgan filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the claims against the finance unit are in the same class as $1 billion in notes issued by the holding company. JPMorgan did not say in its filing if voiding the holding company's claim against the finance unit would reduce the recovery for holders of the notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Pantaleo, the Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett lawyer who is representing JPMorgan, declined to comment on the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disputed double liability stems from $931 million that
was borrowed under a liquidity facility in the days leading up
to the bankruptcy of MF Global in October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the holding company borrowed the money, the finance
unit was also a borrower under the facility, creating the first
liability. After the holding company received the money, it then
transferred $928 million to the finance unit, creating a second
liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The impact of this double liability on Finco creditor
recoveries is significant," the JPMorgan filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the claims against the finance unit are in the same
class as $1 billion in notes issued by the holding company.
JPMorgan did not say in its filing if voiding the holding
company's claim against the finance unit would reduce the
recovery for holders of the notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Pantaleo, the Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett lawyer who is
representing JPMorgan, declined to comment on the filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 8 (IFR) - IBM and AT made the most of a surge in
demand for floating-rate notes in the US corporate bond market
this week by issuing US$2.25bn of two-year and three-year
floaters, and in IBM's case at a negative spread to Libor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM issued US$1bn of two-year notes at three-month Libor
minus 2basis points, making it one of the very few corporates to
have issued a floater inside of Libor since the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT, meanwhile, issued US$1.25bn of three-year
floaters at 38.5bp over three-month Libor, at the tightest end
of guidance, after attracting US$2bn of orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aggressive pricing on both was possible because of a
scramble for floating-rate debt securities in the corporate bond
market in recent weeks as Treasury yields rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, more than US$16bn of FRNs have been
priced, already more than a third of the US$42bn of floaters
issued in all of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Floating-rate tranches from the likes of AT and IBM
 are rarities, with both having abstained from public
floater issuance since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although just 10.95% of overall year to-date issuance, the
amount of floating-rate deals is expected to ramp up
considerably if US economic data continue to be on the positive
side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESURGENCE OF DEMAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seen a resurgence of demand for floating-rate
product in 2013," said Anne Daley, managing director and senior
syndicate banker at Barclays in New York. "While supply has not
been massive yet, the fact that we have already seen more than
US$14bn year to-date versus US$42bn for all of last year clearly
shows there is very strong demand growing for the product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last big surge of floating-rate demand was in January
2011, when the market was convinced that the only way for rates
to go was up. Then issuance accounted for 23.58% of total deal
volume and stayed above 20% of the total through to April of
that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporates are keen to add more floating-rate debt to their
funding mix, which has become overweighted with fixed-rate notes
in the past few years as they jumped to lock in all-time low
yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their need to balance out their funding mix has been much
welcomed by investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Demand for floaters has increased because the risk
tolerance of traditional front-end buyers has grown in the last
12 months, coupled with a greater number of traditional
long-dated investors viewing floaters as a hedge against a rise
in interest rates at some point," said Dan Mead, a managing
director on Bank of America Merrill Lynch's investment-grade
corporate bond syndicate desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, money managers and securities lenders tend to buy
floaters inside of 18 months, but the strength of demand has
enabled names such as IBM and General Mills to issue out to two
and three-year deals, respectively, and JP Morgan was able to
raise US$2.4bn of five-year floaters in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is only the third industrial issuer since the crisis to
print at a negative spread to Libor, along with Procter &amp; Gamble
and Coca-Cola Company, which did deals last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM deal, led by Barclays, HSBC, Mizuho and RBC, was
part of a US$2bn two-part trade that also included a US$1bn
five-year fixed-rate portion. The floating-rate tranche
attracted US$1.25bn of unpadded orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AT floater, led by BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and UBS,
was part of a US$2.25bn trade that also included a US$1bn 0.90%
three-year fixed-rate portion priced at 55bp over Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This article will be published in the Feb 9 issue of

&lt;p&gt;
http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20130208:nGNXUXDEBa

PRINCETON, N.J., Feb. 8, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OxOnc Development LP, (OxOnc), today announced
that it has entered into a co-development agreement with Pfizer Inc., to conduct a pivotal
clinical trial of Pfizer's crizotinib, marketed under the trademark Xalkori, for the treatment of
patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring a ROS1 (c-ros) gene
rearrangement (ROS1-positive). ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor family. 

The trial will be conducted at multiple sites in Japan, China, Taiwan and South Korea to assess
the safety and efficacy of crizotinib in patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC. Crizotinib is
approved for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC in the U.S., EU1, Japan
and other countries.  

Under the terms of the agreement, OxOnc will provide funding and supervision for the trial, with
the goal of generating the clinical data necessary for Pfizer to submit crizotinib for review by
regulatory authorities for the treatment of advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC in the Asian region. If
approved for this indication, OxOnc will be eligible to receive milestone payments from Pfizer.
Additional terms were not disclosed.

"We are extremely pleased to collaborate with Pfizer and to support further clinical development
of Xalkori in NSCLC patents.  It is gratifying to be involved in co-developing this innovative
targeted therapy which exemplifies the future of oncology drug development," said Wenn Sun, Ph.D.,
OxOnc's Managing Partner.

"Pfizer continues to establish innovative partnerships that extend the scale and scope of our
oncology clinical development program," said Garry Nicholson, president and general manager,
Pfizer Oncology. "Xalkori is a breakthrough medicine in our oncology portfolio which may hold
potential for patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC. Through our collaboration with OxOnc, we
hope to explore the potential benefit that this important therapy may bring to this subset of lung
cancer patients who are in need of additional treatment options."

About NSCLC and Crizotinib (Xalkori):

The understanding of lung cancer is changing. What was previously believed to be an illness
largely linked to smoking is now recognized by physicians as a complex disease with many subtypes.
NSCLC comprises approximately 85 percent of lung cancer cases. Research on the genetics of NSCLC
is leading to an evolution in lung cancer treatment paradigms.

Xalkori is a first-in-class, small molecule inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and is
approved in the U.S., EU, Japan, China and other countries to treat patients with ALK-positive
advanced NSCLC. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, Xalkori demonstrated early signs of antitumor
activity in a cohort of advanced NSCLC patients whose tumors have the ROS1 gene rearrangement.2 
Its activity in this patient population continues to be studied in other ongoing trials.3

About OxOnc:

OxOnc Development LP is an oncology development company founded by pharmaceutical development
executives and oncology experts. OxOnc partners have extensive experience in building and managing
oncology research networks in Europe and Asia and in managing global contract research
organizations to optimally design and execute clinical trials. OxOnc is funded by Orbimed
Advisors, a leading venture capital group in life sciences, with $6 billion under management. MTS
Securities, LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to OxOnc on this transaction. Foley &amp; Lardner
LLP and WilmerHale acted as legal counsel in the transaction.

Forward-Looking Information Statement

This release contains forward-looking information about a potential additional indication for
crizotinib, including its potential benefits, that involves substantial risks and uncertainties.
Such risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research
and development; whether and when any drug applications may be filed in any jurisdictions for such
additional indication; whether and when any such applications may be approved by regulatory

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/ABUJA Feb 8 (Reuters) - The force majeure on Exxon
Mobil's Qua Iboe grade in Nigeria will cause delays of
four to eight days on affected cargoes, traders said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon said on Thursday exports of Qua Iboe crude oil were
under force majeure due to pipeline repair work, but the oil
major was continuing to produce the benchmark from fields not
affected by the outage, a company spokesman said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qua Iboe is Nigeria's largest crude oil stream with exports,
before this announcement, expected to be around 400,000 barrels
per day in February, according to shipping schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

Disney established its university spirit at the 2013 American International Toy
Fair today, kicking-off with a marching band to reveal the hottest new toys from
the Monsters University product collection, which consists of more than 1,000
products from 125 licensees. The audience of toy-industry insiders was treated

voice of James P. Sullivan, who was presented with a custom-built toy
celebrating his beloved character from the film. Pixar veterans, director Dan
Scanlon and producer Kori Rae, were also on hand to offer an inside look and

million in global box office and $1.5 billion in global merchandise retail sales
to date. The film also boasts 96 percent awareness among 13-54-year-olds, with

Disney&#8729;Pixar films, we set out to develop a robust Monsters University product
collection that takes play to a whole new level and leverages technology and
creativity," said Josh Silverman, executive vice president of Licensing for
Disney Consumer Products, who was also a key presenter at the event. 

The new toy line includes action figures, vehicles, playsets, plush figures,
preschool and remote control items to help kids recreate key moments from the
film. Monsters University will also be supported with product lines from

in the Monsters University collection with five different modes of play and the
ability to sense its environment, changing play modes automatically to match its
current surroundings. Kids can interact directly with Scare Off Sulley by
challenging him to a "scare off" - if they scream loud enough, he will fall
backwards in fear. 
* 100 percent kid powered, the Sulley Monster Mask (SRP $24.99, available spring
2013) allows kids to move Sulley`s eyebrows and lips as they put on the mask and
open, close or move their jaws up and down. 
* The Roll-A-ScareRace Playset (SRP $19.99, available spring 2013) allows kids
to utilize the Roll-A-Scare Monsters Assortment (SRP $6.99 each, available
spring 2013) to roll, pop and scare with favorite characters from the movie. The
monsters slide down the playset and as they reach the bottom they pop-up for
scaring fun. Each figure is uniquely stylized and has a surprise pop-up
activation that can also be activated with a Student ID card that springs the
monsters open. There are 12 characters to collect in total to recreate favorite
scenes from the movie.

From Disney Store:

* The exclusive Monsters University collection from Disney Store will include
toys, action figures, luggage, apparel and more. One of the most unique items is
the Monsters University Speak N Scare Action Figures line (SRP $34.95, available
June 2013) featuring favorite characters from the film. In tandem with a free
digital app, kids can rate their own "roar" or enhance it using different tools.
The app can also sync with the action figures to control their scaring actions.
Other modes of play include play mode with more than 40 phrases, scare mode with
five different sound-activated roars and interactive mode that allows the action
figures to converse with one another.

From Disney Interactive:

* Disney Infinity is a bold new gaming initiative from Disney Interactive that
features a new line of collectible figures based on Disney and Pixar`s biggest
franchises. The characters come to life in a new video game featuring
true-to-property Disney adventures in the game worlds of Monsters University,
The Incredibles, Pirates of the Caribbean, and more, as well as in a giant
virtual "Toy Box" where players can create their own Disney experiences. At this
year`s American International Toy Fair, attendees were given an opportunity to
preview the game and play to solve challenging puzzles, battle enemies and
explore iconic locations from Monsters University, while collecting unique
characters, vehicles, and gadgets and saving them to a "Toy Box."
Disney Infinity will launch in June across all consoles and will have a phased
roll out across mobile and online devices throughout 2013 (SRP $4.99 - $74.99)

From Disney Publishing:

* The Monsters University publishing program includes over 30 new Monsters
University books debuting in the U.S. this spring including novels/readers,

Imaginext (SRP $29.99, available spring 2013), which comes with electronics
featuring character voices to relive the fun of chasing Archie the scare pig
through the quad. The set comes with two figure disks that either spin the
bottom floor so you can have the monsters chase Archie in circles or catapult
Archie across the set, through a trap door and into his cage.

About Disney&#8729;Pixar`s Monsters University

Ever since college-bound Mike Wazowski (voice of Billy Crystal) was a little
monster, he has dreamed of becoming a scarer-and he knows better than anyone
that the best scarers come from Monsters University (MU). But during his first
semester at MU, Mike`s plans are derailed when he crosses paths with hotshot
James P. Sullivan, "Sulley" (voice of John Goodman), a natural-born scarer. The
pair`s out-of-control competitive spirit gets them both kicked out of the
University`s elite Scare Program. To make matters worse, they realize they will
have to work together, along with an odd bunch of misfit monsters, if they ever
hope to make things right. Screaming with laughter and oozing with heart,
Disney&#8226;Pixar`s "Monsters University" is directed by Dan Scanlon ("Cars," "Mater
and the Ghostlight," "Tracy"), produced by Kori Rae ("Up," "The Incredibles,"
"Monsters, Inc.") and features music from future
Rock-and-Roll-Hall-of-Fame-inductee and award winning composer Randy Newman
("Monsters, Inc.," "Toy Story 3"). For more information, like us at
facebook.com/PixarMonstersUniversity, and follow us on twitter.com/disneypixar.
The film opens in U.S. theaters on June 21, 2013, and will be shown in Disney
Digital 3D in select theaters. For more information about MU, check out

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/8l8p8l/pharmaceutical) has announced
the addition of the "Pharmaceutical Industry in Spain" report to their offering.


The birth origins of the Pharmaceutical Industry can be traced back to more
humble antecedents than just chemistry labs. The earliest incidents of
recognition of the antiseptic properties of the dyestuffs is around the late
19th century. The invention of penicillin can yet be recognized as a major
milestone for the emergent industry which firmly consolidated its R efforts in
the 1950's. Further in the 1960's the patent regulation support gave a further
impetus to the industry in new discoveries and relaxed controls on clinical
development with the booming spend on healthcare as economies boomed globally. 

The global presence of the pharmaceutical industry is evident with the roll out
of continent specific R programs and drugs which help companies maximize
penetration of markets and garner increased revenues with intercontinental
treatment demand of patients being serviced from often one or two mega research
centers in the continent. 

The pharmaceutical industry is under mounting scrutiny because of rapidly
increasing expenditures for drugs worldwide. Drug expenditures are now the
fastest-growing component of health care costs, increasing at the rate of about
15 percent per year. They account for about eight percent of health care
spending, and at their current rate of increase, they will soon surpass spending
for physicians' services and, for many health care organizations, the costs of
hospitalization. 

This R'search brings you a complete analysis of the Pharmaceutical Industry in
Spain. The report covers a brief profile of the global pharmaceutical industry,
the TRIPS agreement, offshoring in the pharmaceutical industry, economic trends
in the industry, competition in the industry, and the key players in the
pharmaceutical industry in Spain - complete with a SWOT analysis of the leading
companies in the market.

Fixes Microsoft Surface Pro Storage Space Woes, Triples Built-In NTFS Compression Savings</headline><body>

SYDNEY, Australia, Feb. 11, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - MagicRAR 8 is the only Windows
data compression utility providing transparent, full-disk data compression - enabling users to
access all of their files and data as if they were uncompressed, with a significant increase on
their bottom line of usable storage space.

When Microsoft introduced their new security model with Windows Vista, an unforeseen side effect
caused NTFS compression to miss a significant number of files that would otherwise be
compressible. MagicRAR 8 triples built-in NTFS compression by fixing this bug, which is still
present in the newer Windows 7, and even the very latest flagship Windows 8 operating systems -
while preserving full security lock-down on the end-user system, ensuring no compromises are made
on system security during storage space increase.

Microsoft's brand new Surface Pro has come under fire for not providing sufficient storage space,
due to the large number of files pre-installed on the Surface Pro. NTFS compression does not help
on its own, because a large number of these files are incompressible due to this security bug in
Windows. MagicRAR 8 successfully compresses virtually all of the files pre-installed on the
Surface Pro, in effect providing more than three times the free storage space compared to Windows
itself.

MagicRAR 8 takes full advantage of the advanced Surface Pro hardware. While Windows uses only one
thread during NTFS compression, MagicRAR 8 uses up to 8 threads; meaning the entire Surface Pro
flash storage is compressed up to 8 times faster. That's more than three times the storage space
delivered eight times faster! MagicRAR 8 may be enjoyed on all traditional Windows laptops and
desktops, in addition to the Surface Pro. Space savings are especially appreciated by SSD users,
where space costs a premium.

MagicRAR 8 offers a full suite of archive management utilities in addition to full-disk
compression. These include an open-source (https://github.com/magicrar
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10021369=5=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmagicrar )
plug-in stack for future extensibility, Outlook Add-Ins for transparent attachment compression and
compressed attachment previews, and a "Find Smallest Archive" Explorer right-click menu option
which compresses selected files and folders using all compression algorithms known to MagicRAR,
guaranteeing the smallest possible file sizes.

Perficient is one of 15 U.S.-based partners to receive Microsoft Premier Support
Lync Partner certification
ST. LOUIS--(Business Wire)--
Perficient, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRFT), a leading information technology consulting
firm serving Global 2000 and other large enterprise customers throughout North
America, today announced it will serve as the evening event sponsor and showcase
its expertise at the Microsoft Lync Conference. The Lync Conference will be held
Feb. 19 - 21 in San Diego, Calif., and is the first ever conference dedicated to
communications professionals looking to learn and network with the entire Lync
community. 

Microsoft Lync Server combines voice, instant messaging, audio, video, and web
conferencing into a richer, more simplified solution for organizations looking
to transform their business communications into more collaborative and engaging
interactions. As one of only seven Microsoft Worldwide National Systems
Integrator (NSI) Partners, Perficient partners with clients to implement Lync
technologies that integrate with client`s current applications and enhance
professional communications. 

"Enterprise communications have become increasingly complex as more information
is readily available to more people and in multiple formats. At a time when
access to expertise and knowledge sharing is critical to business success, our
clients are looking for ways to harness innovation and improve workforce
productivity through improved communication tools and by removing communication
barriers," said Matt McGillen, director of unified communications for
Perficient. "Lync is the only application that brings all communications
together in a single, simple way for users. With other solutions you find that
you need a new username and password, and a different application for
everything: phone, IM, audio conferencing, web conferencing are all separate
silos. Integrating Lync with current applications enables more seamless and
effective collaboration and communication within today`s organizations." 

Newly-Designated Lync Certifications Attest to Client Support and Satisfaction

Perficient recently was named one of 15 Microsoft partners in the United States
to receive the Premier Support Lync Partner (PSLP) certification. The PSLP
certification designates Perficient as an official provider of Lync solutions
and support for clients. In addition to its PSLP certification, Perficient has
two Lync Microsoft Certified Masters on staff - Keenan Crockett, and
newly-certified Jason Sloan. The MCM certification is an exclusive designation
recognizing technical excellence, and Perficient is one of a handful of partners
with multiple Lync MCMs. 

"For all the great improvements to communication that Lync brings, it does
require expertise to do a Lync deployment right. And it doesn`t end there;
supporting the environment after Lync has been rolled out is very important to
the well-being of our clients," continued McGillen. "To ensure our consultants
can provide the best service and experience to our clients, Perficient has
invested in the certification process. With two Lync MCM consultants and our
recent PSLP certification, we are proud to be one of very few partners that can
provide top-notch support for our clients in the whole lifecycle, not just
during deployment."

Perficient experts will be on hand during the Lync Conference in kiosk K-4 to

experience in advising both borrowers and lenders. His added experience in
leveraged finance will also support expansion of Goodwin`s London-based private
equity practice. Lyons will join Goodwin following completion of his notice
period. 

"Paul brings significant expertise in all aspects of real estate debt finance to
our growing London team," said David Evans, London Office Chair. "As real estate
debt markets continue to evolve in Europe, particularly with the expansion of
the non-bank lending sector, new opportunities are emerging. Paul will further
strengthen Goodwin`s ability to serve its clients as they capitalize on these
market shifts." 

"We`re delighted that Paul is joining our existing five-partner London real
estate practice, which includes Joe Conder who recently joined us from
Linklaters. This represents Goodwin`s latest step in the buildout of a talented
and deep team with decades of sector experience," said Regina M. Pisa, Chairman
of Goodwin Procter. "We are committed to continued, focused expansion in London
and are pleased that Paul has chosen Goodwin as the platform for his future
practice." 

Lyons` experience has included advising banks on debt originations and
restructurings as well as real estate and private equity fund clients on both
lender and borrower mandates, and on debt secondary transactions. He joined
Travers in 1997. 

Evans, who joined Goodwin from Ashurst in late 2011, is leading efforts to
expand firm hiring in London to support new and existing EMEA clients in the
real estate, hospitality and leisure, fund formation and private equity sectors.

Version 9.31 Now Includes Windows 8 Compatibility, APN Management, Improved
Hotspot Logon and Other Settings
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
NCP engineering today announced that enterprises can upgrade its centrally
managed IPsec VPN client suite to offer end users increased device and operating
system flexibility when remotely connecting to their corporate networks. The NCP
Secure Enterprise Client 9.31, which is available for purchase through NCP`s
network of reseller partners and distributors, supports laptops and tablets with
Microsoft`s Windows 8 operating system (Professional or Enterprise editions), in
addition to Windows 7/Vista/XP (32-/64-bit). 

To further support mobile employees` remote access needs, NCP has included its
new Access Point Name (APN) management feature in version 9.31. Rather than
manually configuring the mobile access point when they access the Internet,
users who switch out their SIM cards from different mobile operators, for
example, when traveling to another country, will see that NCP`s IPsec VPN
software automatically prompts their device driver to search for and configure
the APN via the SIM card`s NetID. 

Key Facts

* The NCP Secure Enterprise Client is a one-click IPsec VPN solution that
bundles a dynamic personal firewall, a dialer and an intuitive graphical user
interface. It can connect to any VPN gateway on the market, and guarantees that
every access point to the Internet is safe, without users needing to know and
worry about firewall settings, device compatibility, connection negotiation or
policy requirements. 
* NCP`s centrally managed VPN client suite also features the company`s Path
Finder technology, which solves complex connection issues for end users created
by firewall settings that prevent IPsec communications. Plus, it supports mobile
computing via seamless roaming and includes Friendly Net Detection, which forces
the network to identify itself to the end user`s device and automatically
activates the necessary firewall rules and security mechanisms, depending on if
it`s a known, friendly or unknown, unfriendly network. 
* Version 9.31 brings added security and usability benefits to enterprises and
mobile employees. For example, the software prompts users with warning messages
if they fail to log on to hotspots without Wi-Fi connections having first been
established, and advises on creating suitable connection profiles and whether
alternative network selections need to be made. The NCP Secure Enterprise Client
can automatically display a "High Contrast" mode to make the VPN client screen
easier to read, includes extended log settings to assist support personnel in
diagnosing problems as well as allow mobile employees to select information to
be forwarded via email to the support desk.

Resources

* Additional information about the new edition of the NCP Secure Enterprise
Client for Microsoft Windows operating systems is available on NCP`s website or
by contacting sales@ncp-e.com. 
* Interested enterprises can purchase NCP`s VPN software from the company`s
reseller partners and distributors. 
* Reach NCP engineering on its blog, VPN Haus, and on LinkedIn, Twitter or
YouTube.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Feb 11 (Reuters) - The private wealth arm of JP
Morgan has appointed seven bankers to its British division,
poaching five from rivals, as expansion plans continue apace
under its new boss Tracey Reddings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive directors Richard Cockburn, James Drace-Francis
and Stefano Ferraiolo join from Societe Generale, UBS
 and Credit Suisse respectively, JP Morgan
 said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francesca Hall joins from Coutts, the private banking arm of
Royal Bank of Scotland, as a vice president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the appointments - executive director Aaron
Georghiades and vice presidents Bambos Charalambous and Cliadhna
Law - come from elsewhere in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All seven will be based in London and report to Tracey
Reddings, who joined the bank last year from Societe Generale as
head of the UK private wealth unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The hires within our Private Wealth Management business in
the United Kingdom highlight our commitment to the increasing
number of high net worth clients in the region," Reddings said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddings is seeking to bring in more "core millionaire"
clients - people worth $3 million to $25 million, increasingly
courted over the super rich because their needs are less complex
and can generate wider margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planned expansion of the UK business follows a similar push
in Asia led by former Standard Chartered private
banking chief Peter Flavel and the group expects eventually to
introduce the strategy in other regions.&lt;/p&gt;

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/qn225k/amusement_parks) has
announced the addition of the "Amusement Parks &amp; Arcades" report to their
offering. 

Companies in this industry operate amusement parks or arcades. Major US
amusement park companies include Walt Disney, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, SeaWorld,
and Universal Parks &amp; Resorts; major arcade operators include Namco
Cybertainment, Dave &amp; Buster's, and CEC Entertainment (Chuck E Cheese's). 

The US amusement parks and arcades industry includes about 3,000 establishments
(single-location companies and units of multi-location companies) with combined
annual revenue of about $16 billion. Low growth is forecast for the next two
years. Key growth challenges include dependence on consumer spending and intense
competition. 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Demand is closely linked to the health of the economy, especially consumer
income. The profitability of individual companies depends on good marketing.
Large companies can build expensive rides and have economies of scale in
operations and advertising. Smaller companies can compete by serving smaller
markets or offering special rides. The industry is highly concentrated: the 50
largest companies generate about 85 percent of revenue. 

PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS &amp; TECHNOLOGY 

Amusement parks get about 55 percent of their revenue from admissions and about
30 percent from food and merchandise sales. The remainder is made from a mix of
parking fees, commission income from third-party exhibitors, advertising, and
fees for hosting parties and other events. Many parks operate only for a portion
of the year because of weather. Half of amusement parks, including 70 percent of
water parks, are closed during the cold months.

Key Topics Covered:

1. Industry Overview 

2. Quarterly Industry Update 

3. Business Challenges 

4. Business Trends 

5. Industry Opportunities 

6. Call Preparation Questions 

7. Financial Information 

8. Industry Forecast

&lt;p&gt;  BONITA SPRINGS, FL, Feb 11 (Marketwire) -- 
@ Customer Response Summit 5 -- SoCoCare(TM), a leading provider of
cloud-based customer service software, today announced the launch of
Social CIM(TM) (Customer Interaction Management), an all-in-one social
engagement for customer care offering. 

    Social CIM has been developed specifically for customer care agents,
supervisors and managers whose main focus is providing customer care over
multiple social channels. The cloud-based offering rolls-up listening,
engagement and social analytics into a comprehensive, all-in-one package
for professional customer care teams. The system handles Twitter,
Facebook, LinkedIn, RSS feeds, Blogs and articles.

    "Social CIM creates a command center for customer care across multiple
social channels," says Dan Miller, Senior Analyst at Opus Research.
"SoCoCare takes an all-in-one approach that features a user-friendly
dashboard with rich KPI and SLA analytics for both agents and
supervisors. The emphasis on agent productivity has great promise for
companies taking on the challenges of comprehensive customer care for
social channels."

    "Social CIM signals the end of the first generation single-feature social
customer care tools, which have to be integrated to all work together,"
says Ed Margulies, COO and co-founder of SoCoCare. "Now the pain of
sourcing NLP (Natural Language Processing), decisioning, network
aggregation, listening, analytics, and influence tools is gone. Instead,
Social CIM provides everything you need for your social engagement for
customer care needs."

    Spam Elimination
 One of the biggest problems vexing social customer care
teams is the existence of non-relevant or non-actionable social posts. In
fact, some social care agents spend 50 percent or more of their time
reading and characterizing posts as spam. Historically, the solution to
this problem was to cobble-on third party NLP tools to attempt to sort
out spam. With Social CIM, a self-learning spam elimination component is
built-in. Now, agents are able to filter out non-actionable items, thus
saving each agent hours of wasted time every day. The system
automatically trains based on user input so it gets more accurate in its
spam elimination over time.

    Social Analytics for Customer Care
 Social CIM offers role-based
analytics that help agents, supervisors and analysts be more effective at
doing their job. The system provides agent dashboards for self-KPIs (Key
Performance Indicators), comparisons to workgroup peers, Real-Time
supervisory KPI statistics, and extensive SLA (Service Level Agreement)
dashboards for each profile, cluster, workgroup and social feed. The
supervisory dashboards provide rich data and metrics that can improve
agent workflow, productivity, and decision-making.

    Author Search and Conversation Threading
 Social CIMs search capabilities
allow agents to quickly scan a social author's history by conversation
thread, showing all previous interactions over time. This avoids the
problem of multiple agents contradicting each other in what they say or
do for a customer.

    Automatic Prioritization of Social Posts
 Using built-in NLP and
Decisioning technology, Social CIM has the ability to automatically tag
and prioritize social posts based on attributes such as sentiment,
influence, and topical relevancy. These attributes are used to create
automatic triggers for prioritization, which not only saves agents time
but also enables agents to quickly respond to those who matter most.
Agents also benefit from pre-scripted "Next Best Actions" that provide
recommendations on exactly what to do or offer to a customer depending on
these decisioning triggers.

    About SoCoCare
 SoCoCare is part of the Hyfiniti portfolio of cloud-based
customer care offerings including InAppCare (Mobile Customer Care) and
Hold-Free Networks (Callback and Queue Management). SoCoCare products are
developed to deliver a more dignified customer service experience over
social channels. The company was founded by a group of contact center and
cloud-offering professionals who understand today's socially connected,
smartphone savvy, and generally demanding customer.

But the partnership has not lived up to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google remains the dominant search engine, with a 66.7 percent share of the U.S. market in December, almost unchanged from its 66.6 percent share two years earlier, according to online analytics firm comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had 16.3 percent share and Yahoo had 12.2 percent share in December, a reversal of two years earlier when Yahoo's U.S. search share was 16 percent and Microsoft had 12 percent share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's stock has risen more than 30 percent since Mayer took the helm in July, reaching its highest levels since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say that part of the stock's rise has been driven by significant stock buybacks, using proceeds from a $7.6 billion deal to sell half of its 40 percent stake in Chinese Internet company Alibaba Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayer said that she viewed the company's relationship with Yahoo Japan, which is partly owned by Softbank, as "strategic" to the company. Under previous CEOs, Yahoo had engaged in unsuccessful discussions to "monetize" its roughly 35 percent stake in Yahoo Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Challenge comes ahead of SEC ruling on BlackRock fund on
Feb. 22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Red Kite, Amrod and Luvata not parties to lawsuit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Josephine Mason&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - U.S. copper makers Southwire Co
and Encore Wire Corp are launching a legal challenge
against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval of
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's physically backed copper exchange
traded fund (ETF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies, which say the copper ETF will inflate prices
for the metal and distort supplies, filed a notice of appeal on
Tuesday asking the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. to
review the SEC's Dec. 14 ruling that gave the go ahead for the
copper ETF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies contend the SEC's ruling was "arbitrary and
capricious, an abuse of direction, or otherwise not in
accordance with law or unsupported by substantial evidence,"
said the petition signed by their attorney Robert Bernstein with
law firm Eaton &amp; Van Winkle LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal action could further frustrate JPMorgan's efforts to
launch the JPM XF Physical Copper Trust, more than two years
after it first filed for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also comes less than two weeks before the U.S regulator
decides on another, similar fund, the iShares Copper Trust
planned by BlackRock Inc. The ruling is due on Feb. 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokeswomen for JPMorgan and the SEC declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOWN TO TWO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southwire, North America's largest wire and cable maker, and
Encore Wire based in McKinney, Texas, will go it alone without
three other members of a consortium that tried unsuccessfully to
get the regulator to block the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major metals hedge fund and merchant, Red Kite, and two
other fabricators Luvata and AmRod are not parties to the
appeal, Bernstein told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an almost year-long struggle to get the SEC to reject
the fund, they may not have the appetite for a protracted and
potentially costly legal battle, market participants said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial users fear the funds would cut off supplies of
copper, used in electrical wiring and plumbing, and boost prices
since they will use physical copper cathode as collateral
against shares of the fund, effectively removing a chunk of
metal from the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their defense, JPMorgan and BlackRock say such fears are
unfounded because the funds, which would effectively allow U.S.
retail investors to trade physical copper easily for the first
time, would be miniscule compared with the 20-million-tonne
global market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In giving the green light, the SEC said it did not believe
the fund would affect supplies of metal for immediate delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank has much riding on the launch as the big banks
that swept into trading commodities over the past decade look
for new ways to make money in the wake of the world financial
crisis and amid tighter regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

PHILADELPHIA--(Business Wire)--
Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA, CMCSK) announced today it will acquire GE`s
entire 49% common equity stake in the NBCUniversal joint venture for
approximately $16.7 billion. Also, NBCUniversal will purchase from GE the
properties used by NBCUniversal at 30 Rockefeller Plaza and CNBC`s headquarters
in Englewood Cliffs, NJ for approximately $1.4 billion. The acquisition
accelerates GE's divestiture ahead of a redemption period that would have begun
in July 2014 and solidifies Comcast`s position as a leading media and technology
company. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is
expected to close by the end of the first quarter of this year. 

"This is an exciting day for Comcast as we have agreed to accelerate the
purchase of NBCUniversal. The management team at GE has been a wonderful partner
during the past two years and their support has been very valuable. Our decision
to acquire GE's ownership is driven by our sense of optimism for the future
prospects of NBCUniversal and our desire to capture future value that we hope to
create for our shareholders," said Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and CEO, Comcast
Corporation. "We believe the terms of the transaction are attractive and have
planned for this event by taking a number of financial steps to prepare our
balance sheet. We believe we are in a strong and unique position to continue to
grow and build value in our combined company." 

The transactions will be funded with $11.4 billion of cash on hand, $4.0 billion
of subsidiary senior unsecured notes to be issued to GE, $2.0 billion of
borrowings under Comcast and/or subsidiary bank credit facilities and $725
million of subsidiary preferred stock to be issued to GE. 

Morgan Stanley was financial advisor to Comcast and Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP
was the Company`s legal advisor.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co's (KO.N) fourth-quarter revenue missed analysts' estimates as lingering economic softness hurt results in Europe and China, sending its shares down 2.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest soft drink maker, with brands such as Sprite, Fanta and Minute Maid, on Tuesday said worldwide sales volume climbed 3 percent, below some analysts' estimates. Also disappointing were a 4 percent decline in China and a 5 percent drop in Europe, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they're diverse enough so that some things go up and some things go down and they manage OK," said Bernstein Research analyst Ali Dibadj. "You certainly wish they were firing on all cylinders, but this environment doesn't necessarily allow that to happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue for the quarter rose 4 percent to $11.46 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $11.53 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent said performance in China and Europe was not to his satisfaction, though he expects both regions to improve as 2013 unfolds. Still, he noted that the company's overall performance was in line with its long-term goals, which call for growth of 3 percent to 4 percent for volume, 6 percent to 8 percent for operating earnings, and high single-digits for earnings per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our opinion we haven't missed any revenue targets. We said we would meet or exceed our long-term growth targets ... and we've met them, for the quarter and the year," Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cited "prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing transition of the economy in China, the lukewarm recovery in the United States, and ongoing challenges for Japanese consumers." He expects challenges in those markets to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke did have some bright spots, reporting volume growth of 10 percent in the Eurasia and Africa segment, 5 percent in Latin America, 1 percent in North America, and 2 percent in the Pacific region. The company also reported profit slightly above Wall Street estimates, fueled by better margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola does not give quarterly financial forecasts but said that for the full year 2013 it expects $100 million in increased commodity costs related to sweeteners, juices, metals and plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also forecast a one-time hit to earnings in the current quarter related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. As a result of that move, the foreign exchange impact on 2013 results may be slightly worse than previously expected, Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke is also seeing tougher competition from PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), which is working hard to improve its North American beverage business. Pepsi has increased marketing spending with a focus on core brands like Pepsi-Cola, and analysts say the renewed effort is working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, given that volumes aren't that robust, the success of one player certainly has a negative impact on the success of the other," Bernstein's Dibadj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo is due to report quarterly earnings on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke said fourth-quarter net income was $1.87 billion, or 41 cents per share, up from $1.66 billion, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding restructuring charges and other one-time items, earnings were 45 cents per share, topping analysts' average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola shares were down $1.03 at $37.58 in afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays analyst Michael Branca advised buying the shares on Tuesday's weakness, noting that the 2013 outlook "seems no worse than the most bearish of forecasts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Martinne Geller in New York; Editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt Disney Company's (Disney)
proposed offering of two-year unsecured floating rate notes. The Rating Outlook
is Stable. Approximately $17.5 billion of debt was outstanding as of Dec. 29,
2012. A complete list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. 

Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Fitch expects the company
to use the proceeds of this issuance to term-out commercial paper (CP)
outstanding, which totaled $3 billion at Dec. 29, 2012. The notes will be issued
under Disney's existing indenture dated Sept. 24, 2001, and will be pari passu
with all existing debt. Similar to existing bonds, there are no financial
covenants. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS: 

The ratings and Outlook reflect Disney's ample financial flexibility,
underpinned by strong free cash flow (FCF) generation that Fitch expects to
exceed $3.5 billion beginning fiscal 2013, and total leverage around 1.5x.
Ratings incorporate Fitch's expectations that the company's share repurchases
and M activity will likely exceed FCF generation given strong liquidity and
current credit profile. The company's acquisition of Lucasfilm Limited for $2
billion in cash and $2 billion of equity, along with the contemplated equity
repurchase over the subsequent 24 months, is within Fitch's expectations for the
company's financial policy and within the current ratings. 

The company's pro forma maturity schedule over the next several years
(approximately $1 billion of maturities through calendar year end (CYE) 2013
(excluding CP balance), approximately $1.55 billion of maturities in CY 2014,
and $1.5 billion in CY 2015) will be easily manageable with FCF and access to
the capital markets. Fitch does not expect debt reduction going forward. 

The ratings incorporate the cyclicality of Disney's businesses, particularly
Parks &amp; Resorts (31% of revenue), Consumer Products (8%), and the advertising
portion of Broadcast and Cable Networks (18%). These businesses have exhibited a
degree of resiliency in the recent sluggish macroeconomic backdrop but remain at
risk in the event of a more severe economic downturn. Should macroeconomic
volatility return, Fitch expects these cyclical businesses to be under renewed
pressure but that the company's credit and financial profile will likely remain
within current ratings. The ratings incorporate Fitch's expectation that the
Studio Entertainment business, similar to that of its peers, will remain
volatile and low margin, given the hit-driven nature. The decline of DVD sales,
which is the window in which many films become profitable, is becoming less of a
concern amid the growth of higher-margin digital distribution, and should be
accommodated within current ratings. 

Disney's liquidity at Dec. 29, 2012 was strong and consisted of $3.2 billion of
cash ($320 million of which was held at the International Theme Parks), as well
as $4.5 billion available under two revolving credit facilities (RCF) of $2.25
billion each; the first matures in February 2015 and the second in June 2017.
These facilities backstop Disney's CP program. Liquidity is further supported by
the company's aforementioned strong annual FCF generation. 

Total debt at Dec. 29, 2012 was $17.5 billion and consisted of: 

--$3 billion of CP; 

--$12.3 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from December
2013-2093; 

--$269 million of debt related to Hong Kong Disneyland (Disneyland Paris debt is
no longer outstanding after Disney refinanced it with intercompany debt in
September 2012), which is non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch
consolidates under the assumption that the company would back the loan payments;


--Approximately $1.3 billion of foreign currency-denominated debt, including
approximately $300 million of debt assumed in the February 2012 acquisition of
UTV, which was refinanced in September 2012. 

--$524 million of other debt. 

Fitch notes the company's pension was 70% funded at Sept. 29, 2012 (the last
reported date). While annual pension funding obligations of several hundred
million dollars should continue over the next few years, they will be more than
covered by FCF. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.
However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to more
conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration. 

Negative: Rating pressure is less likely to be driven by operating performance
than by discretionary actions (debt-funded acquisitions) on the part of
management. 

Fitch currently rates Disney as follows: 

The Walt Disney Company 

--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'; 

--Short-term IDR 'F1'; 

--Commercial paper 'F1'. 

ABC Inc. 

--IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'. 

Disney Enterprises, Inc. 

--IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'. 

Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of
any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats
the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the
absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney
Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch
does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'
category investment-grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial
policies, and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney
Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if there
appeared to be heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment
grade (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more
relevant). 

Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the 
absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney
Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch 
does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'
category investment-grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial 
policies, and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney 
Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if there 
appeared to be heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment 
grade (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more 
relevant).

&lt;p&gt;* 4th-qtr oper profit 45 cents/shr vs Street view 44 cents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Sales volume down 4 pct in China, 5 pct in Europe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* CEO says company met its long-term rev growth targets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares off 2.7 percent in afternoon trading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Martinne Geller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 12 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co's fourth-quarter
revenue missed analysts' estimates as lingering economic
softness hurt results in Europe and China, sending its shares
down 2.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest soft drink maker, with brands such as
Sprite, Fanta and Minute Maid, on Tuesday said worldwide sales
volume climbed 3 percent, below some analysts' estimates. Also
disappointing were a 4 percent decline in China and a 5 percent
drop in Europe, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they're diverse enough so that some things go up
and some things go down and they manage OK," said Bernstein
Research analyst Ali Dibadj. "You certainly wish they were
firing on all cylinders, but this environment doesn't
necessarily allow that to happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue for the quarter rose 4 percent to $11.46 billion,
missing analysts' average estimate of $11.53 billion, according
to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent said performance
in China and Europe was not to his satisfaction, though he
expects both regions to improve as 2013 unfolds. Still, he noted
that the company's overall performance was in line with its
long-term goals, which call for growth of 3 percent to 4 percent
for volume, 6 percent to 8 percent for operating earnings, and
high single-digits for earnings per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our opinion we haven't missed any revenue targets. We
said we would meet or exceed our long-term growth targets ...
and we've met them, for the quarter and the year," Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cited "prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing
transition of the economy in China, the lukewarm recovery in the
United States, and ongoing challenges for Japanese consumers."
He expects challenges in those markets to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke did have some bright spots, reporting volume growth of
10 percent in the Eurasia and Africa segment, 5 percent in Latin
America, 1 percent in North America, and 2 percent in the
Pacific region. The company also reported profit slightly above 
Wall Street estimates, fueled by better margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola does not give quarterly financial forecasts but
said that for the full year 2013 it expects $100 million in
increased commodity costs related to sweeteners, juices, metals
and plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also forecast a one-time hit to earnings in the current
quarter related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.
As a result of that move, the foreign exchange impact on 2013
results may be slightly worse than previously expected, Chief
Financial Officer Gary Fayard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke is also seeing tougher competition from PepsiCo Inc
, which is working hard to improve its North American
beverage business. Pepsi has increased marketing spending with a
focus on core brands like Pepsi-Cola, and analysts say the
renewed effort is working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, given that volumes aren't that robust, the
success of one player certainly has a negative impact on the
success of the other," Bernstein's Dibadj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo is due to report quarterly earnings on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke said fourth-quarter net income was $1.87 billion, or 41
cents per share, up from $1.66 billion, or 36 cents per share, a
year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding restructuring charges and other one-time items,
earnings were 45 cents per share, topping analysts' average
estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola shares were down $1.03 at $37.58 in afternoon
trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays analyst Michael Branca advised buying the shares on
Tuesday's weakness, noting that the 2013 outlook "seems no worse
than the most bearish of forecasts."&lt;/p&gt;

-- Delo Engine Oils and Coolants Deliver Over 10,000 Hours of Service in a John
Deere 8520T Tractor --


SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of the Delo
brand of technologically advanced engine oils, lubricants and coolants, today
released a new case study highlighting the performance of Delo heavy-duty diesel
engine oil, Delo Extended Life Coolant (ELC) and Chevron THF 1000 at Marchini Ag
farms in California`s Central Valley.

tractors is a 300 brake horsepower (bhp) John Deere 8520T that has been in
operation for over nine years, accumulating more than 10,000 hours of service.
After a teardown of the tractor, Marchini Ag found the engine components and
valve train system in perfect condition with minimal wear. The water pump and
cylinder liners remained without any cavitation, demonstrating the excellent
heat transfer and protection the Delo ELC provided the engine over its nine
years of service. 

Chevron will highlight the Marchini Ag case study at its 2013 World Ag Expo
(February 12 -14) booth (#O40) in Tulare, CA. Videos and parts from the tear
down will be on hand for attendees to see how Delo lubricants enhanced engine
performance for the Stockton California-based company.

Classes Designed to Help Bentonville-based Suppliers Understand and Leverage New
Data
CHICAGO &amp; BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(Business Wire)--
Walmart`s recent decision to share its point-of-sale (POS) data with select
research companies for the first time since 2001 has created numerous
opportunities for suppliers, but also is causing significant uncertainty about
how to maximize these opportunities. To address suppliers` questions,
SymphonyIRI Group, Inc., a global leader in innovative solutions and services
for consumer, retail and healthcare companies, has partnered with 8th &amp; Walton,
a Walmart supplier education and Retail Link training business, to offer courses
that will educate suppliers on the use of Walmart and multi-outlet POS data.
Classes began Jan. 15 and are open to all interested Walmart suppliers with
approved access to multi-outlet POS data. 

"In talking with our clients, it`s evident that the renewed availability of
Walmart`s POS data is drastically impacting the marketplace," said Jeff Clapper,
chief marketing officer, 8th &amp; Walton. "Many suppliers weren`t ready for it and
are now scrambling to invest in new hires and add Walmart data to their data
sets. We`re excited to offer this deep, pervasive training to help get attendees
up-to-speed quickly and share SymphonyIRI`s valuable insights." 

SymphonyIRI, which is one of only three research companies currently receiving
POS data from Walmart, and 8th &amp; Walton each bring a unique, complementary
perspective and authority to the supplier community. The collaborative trainings
will be a great opportunity for suppliers to learn to leverage newly accessible
data to meet Walmart`s needs and move their business forward. 8th &amp; Walton and
SymphonyIRI are teaching these courses in partnership, and classes will touch on
diverse subjects, such as:

* Best practices for new multi-outlet POS data analysis and insights 
* Leveraging the category management process to drive growth 
* Building strategy through understanding shopper behavior

The partnership also includes SymphonyIRI`s Data Detective workshop series,
which is a set of interactive forums where attendees learn how to maximize the
potential of SymphonyIRI retail sales scanner data and consumer and shopper
household panel data. The workshop series focuses on how to apply best-practice
data analysis techniques in real-world business issues and utilize actual
examples of SymphonyIRI reports. 

"SymphonyIRI considers training and professional development essential to the
effective use of our solutions," said Bernhard Nann, president of Operations and
Technology, SymphonyIRI. "By learning to get the most out of our sophisticated
solutions, our clients maximize the value of the data and obtain deep, valuable
insights efficiently. Collaborating with 8th &amp; Walton is another outstanding way
for us to educate suppliers and help them foster better partnerships with
retailers." 

A webinar course on multi-outlet POS data will be held on March 1, 2013, from
8:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. CT (register here).

&lt;p&gt;  GLOSTRUP, DENMARK, Feb 12 (Marketwire) -- 
Dako, an Agilent Technologies company, announced today it has entered
into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer in the field of companion
diagnostics.

    The agreement constitutes a legal framework for various collaboration
projects between the two companies, covering research, development and
commercialization as well as advisory services.

    "We are extremely excited to partner with Pfizer, a company with such a
global presence and reputation for market leadership," said Lars
Holmkvist, CEO of Dako and senior vice president, Agilent. "This
collaboration is testimony to the level of expertise and service Dako is
committed to delivering to our  partners in companion diagnostics."

    Companion diagnostics are seen as the cornerstones of precision medicine.
They provide a way to improve patient care and reduce health-care costs by
matching specific therapies to the individuals most likely to benefit
from them, since all patients do not respond in the same way.

    "This partnership with Dako will support Pfizer's companion diagnostics
efforts, an important component of our growing Precision Medicine
capabilities," said John Hubbard, senior vice president, Development
Operations at Pfizer. "Precision Medicine R is designed to advance more
targeted therapies for patients, improve efficacy, safety and success
rates, and expedite development."

    Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

    Today's news follows an earlier announcement from Dako introducing a
master framework agreement between Dako and Eli Lilly and Company, which
focuses on developing novel companion diagnostics for Eli Lilly's
oncology pipeline.

alternative payments executives.

next-generation prepaid product empowering consumers to more effectively manage
their money with an unparalleled combination of affordability, style,
transparency, access, convenience, and mobility. The KAIKU Card`s sleek design
and low monthly fee of $1.95 positions itself as a lifestyle choice for today`s
increasingly mobile and cashless society. 

"Paybefore Awards were created to honor the companies and individuals that are
at the forefront of innovation as well as successful market implementation
across the globe," said Loraine DeBonis, Paybefore editor-in-chief and chair of

The KAIKU Visa Prepaid Card was selected by a panel of five industry experts who
served as judges for this year`s competition, which-once again-included a record
number of entries from around the world. 

"We are honored to be recognized as a Paybefore winner in these two categories.
The selection reinforces our desire to create an improved 'next-generation'
prepaid experience for all different types of consumers, offering an
eye-catching product, rich in features, but with low, limited and transparent
fees," explains KAIKU CEO, Jon Round. "Today`s consumers are diverse, savvy and
budget-conscious, and are looking for products that meet their unique needs.
We're offering prepaid as a lifestyle choice for consumers of all different
socio-economic groups, not as the `card of last resort`; people use our Card
because they want to, not because they have to."

will be announced during the Paybefore Awards ceremony on March 4 at the Prepaid
Expo (www.prepaidexpousa.com). And for the first time in Paybefore Awards
history, visitors to Paybefore.com will have a chance to vote on Best in

CNS Response's new technology, PEER Interactive
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10021482=PEER%20Interactive=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnsresponse.com
, is a cloud-based decision support tool which takes results of a standard electroencephalogram
(EEG), which records a patient's brain function much like an electrocardiogram (EKG) records heart
function. Developed by physicians as a quality assurance tool, PEER Interactive
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10021482=PEER%20Interactive=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnsresponse.com
 enables medical professionals to compare and learn which psychiatric medications have been more
effective, and which have been less effective when used by their fellow physicians treating
patients with similar EEG findings.

About CNS Response

CNS Response is a clinical decision support company with a commercial neurometric platform that
helps physicians predict drug response for treatment of psychiatric disorders, including
depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Although treatment has
doubled in the last 20 years, it is estimated that over 17 million Americans have failed two or
more medication therapies for their mental disorder. The Company's Psychiatric EEG Evaluation
Registry (PEER) is a new registry and reporting platform that allows medical professionals to
exchange treatment outcome data for patients, referenced to objective neurophysiology data
obtained through an EEG. Based on the company's original physician-developed database, there are
now over 35,000 outcomes in the PEER registry. The objective of PEER Interactive
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10021482=PEER%20Interactive=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnsresponse.com
 is to avoid trial and error pharmacotherapy, which is the dominant approach for treatment
resistant patients.

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today reported full-year and fourth quarter 2012 results.
Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola Company said,
"We are pleased with our results we announced today. In a year marked by
continued uncertainty in the global economy, we delivered solid volume, revenue
and profit growth, and we realized further volume and value share gains in
nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. The Coca-Cola Company has consistently
delivered quality results and met or exceeded its long-term volume, revenue and
profit growth targets every year since the announcement of our 2020 Vision at
the end of 2009. This reflects the commitment of our entire system to invest
together for a better tomorrow and to sustainably create shared value while
making a positive difference in the communities we serve. Together we are
delivering on our priorities and achieving success. 

"As we enter 2013 in what is still an uncertain global economy, we know that it
is critical to seize the opportunity to keep leading and succeeding in any
environment. We must continue investing in our business so that we get even
better -- better at collaborating, at innovating, at listening to consumers,
customers and our bottling partners and most importantly, at executing with
precision. All of us at Coca-Cola remain diligent about our results as we manage
our business for continued sustainable long-term success," continued Mr. Kent. 

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS

The Coca-Cola Company reported worldwide volume growth of 4% for the full year
and 3% in the quarter. The Company reported solid growth for the full year in
key developed markets, including North America (+2%) and Japan (+2%). Europe
volume declined 1% for the full year, reflecting ongoing uncertain macroeconomic
conditions. In addition, the Company delivered strong volume growth in key
emerging markets such as Thailand (+22%), India (+16%) and Russia (+8%) for the
full year. Our China business delivered 4% volume growth for the full year,
cycling double-digit growth in the prior year, and was impacted by the further
effects of a slowing economy, poor weather and a later Chinese New Year. Solid
growth continued in countries with per capita consumption of Company brands less
than 150 eight-ounce servings per year, with volume up 7% for the full year. 

For both the full year and the quarter, we grew global volume and value share in
nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages, with volume and value share gains
across nearly every beverage category. Further, our immediate consumption volume
grew a solid 5% globally in 2012, leading to transaction growth of 5%, driven by
focused in-store activation efforts and cold-drink equipment expansion. In
addition to increasing the total placement of our branded cold-drink equipment
to more than 14 million units as of the end of 2012, our global system remains
focused on innovations in cooler design, cost efficiency and effectiveness, and
sustainability. We have achieved a 40% to 50% improvement in energy efficiency
in new equipment placed today compared to equipment placed in 2000, and we
maintain our commitment to placing HFC-free units around the world. 

Worldwide sparkling beverage volume grew 3% for the full year and 1% in the
quarter. This represents approximately 550 million incremental unit cases in
2012, or the equivalent of adding 13.2 billion new servings to our global
business. We grew volume and value share in global core sparkling beverages for
the full year and in the quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola and reflecting a
balanced portfolio approach to growth in the core sparkling beverage category.
Worldwide brand Coca-Cola volume grew 3% for the full year, with growth across
diverse markets, including India (+33%), Thailand (+31%), Russia (+20%), the
Philippines (+8%), Brazil (+3%) and Mexico (+3%). In addition, Fanta volume grew
5% and Sprite volume grew 4% for the full year, as we activated global marketing
campaigns in locally relevant ways such as the Fanta Play campaign, now in
nearly 200 markets, and the Sprite Uncontainable Game NBA partnership. 

Worldwide still beverage volume grew 10% for the full year and 9% in the
quarter, with growth across beverage categories, including packaged water,
ready-to-drink tea and coffee, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and energy
drinks. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, still beverage volume grew 8% for
the full year and 7% in the quarter. We grew global volume and value share in
still beverages and delivered volume and value share gains across nearly every
still beverage category. 

Ready-to-drink tea volume grew 14% for the full year and 16% in the quarter,
with continued strong performance of key brands such as Gold Peak and Honest Tea
in North America, Ayataka green tea in Japan and Fuze Tea, which we continued to
expand across many markets worldwide during the year. Packaged water volume grew
12% for both the full year and the quarter, driven by our focus on innovative
and sustainable packaging and immediate consumption occasions. Our PlantBottleTM
PET packaging is now present in 10 countries that represent more than 50% of our
global packaged water business. Energy drink volume grew 20% for the full year
and 12% in the quarter, driven by growth across our global portfolio of energy
brands, with burn now available in 75 countries. 

In 2012, I LOHAS water and Ayataka green tea in Japan became our fourth and
fifth new billion-dollar brands since the announcement of our 2020 Vision,
building on our strong portfolio of brands across beverage categories, occasions
and geographies.

Eurasia &amp; Africa

* Our Eurasia and Africa Group`s volume grew 10% in the quarter and 11% for the
full year (up 7% and 9%, respectively, excluding the benefit of acquired
volume), cycling 4% growth in the prior year quarter and 6% growth in the prior
year. Growth in the quarter was led by the Middle East and North Africa, up 26%
(up 13% excluding the benefit of acquired volume), Turkey, up 13%, and Russia,
up 12%. Reported net revenues for the quarter increased 5%, reflecting a 10%
increase in concentrate sales, partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of 1%,
primarily geographic mix due to strong growth in the Middle East and North
Africa, and a 4% currency impact. After adjusting for unit case sales without
concentrate sales equivalents and the effect of two additional selling days,
concentrate sales in the quarter were in line with unit case sales. Comparable
currency neutral net revenues increased 9% in the quarter. Reported operating
income increased 18% in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral operating
income increased 23% in the quarter, driven by pricing and product mix, as well
as operating leverage as a result of two additional selling days in the quarter,
partially offset by increased investments in the business. For the full year,
reported net revenues increased 5%, reflecting a 10% increase in concentrate
sales and positive 4% price/mix, partially offset by a 9% currency impact. After
adjusting for unit case sales without concentrate sales equivalents, concentrate
sales for the full year were slightly ahead of unit case volume, primarily due
to timing. Comparable currency neutral net revenues increased 13% for the full
year. Reported operating income increased 7% for the full year. Comparable
currency neutral operating income increased 16% for the full year, driven by
volume and revenue growth across all business units. 
* During the quarter, Eurasia and Africa grew volume and value share in NARTD
beverages as well as in core sparkling beverages, juices and juice drinks,
sports drinks and energy drinks. Sparkling beverage volume grew 7% in the
quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola, which also grew 7%. Sprite and Fanta volume
both grew 6% in the quarter. Still beverage volume grew 23% in the quarter,
including the benefit of acquired volume which added 12 points of growth. In
India, we gained strong volume and value share in NARTD beverages as well as in
sparkling and still beverages in the quarter. India sparkling beverage growth in
the quarter was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 32% and driven by customized
integrated marketing campaigns centered on the mealtime occasion. India has now
delivered six consecutive years of double-digit volume growth. Russia volume
growth in the quarter continued to be led by our sparkling beverage brands,
including brand Coca-Cola, up 19%, Fanta, up 25% and Sprite, up 16%. We gained
volume and value share in NARTD beverages as well as in core sparkling and still
beverages in Russia, with a strong marketing campaign tied to the Christmas
holidays as well as a continued focus on packaging segmentation to drive
household penetration. As a result, our business in Russia has now achieved an
all-time high market share. The momentum behind our juice business in Russia
continued in the quarter, with flagship brand Dobriy up 18% and premium brand
Rich up 32%.

Europe

* Our Europe Group`s volume declined 5% in the quarter and 1% for the full year,
cycling 1% growth in the prior year quarter and 2% growth in the prior year,
reflecting the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and weak consumer confidence
across the region. Reported net revenues declined 6% in the quarter, reflecting
a 3% decline in concentrate sales, unfavorable price/mix of 1% and a 2% currency
impact. After adjusting for unit case sales without concentrate sales
equivalents and the effect of two additional selling days, concentrate sales
were in line with unit case sales in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral
net revenues declined 4% in the quarter. Reported operating income increased 13%
in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral operating income increased 12% in
the quarter, reflecting operating leverage as a result of two additional selling
days in the quarter as well as the tight management and timing of operating
expenses. For the full year, reported net revenues declined 6%, reflecting a 2%
decline in concentrate sales, even price/mix and a 4% currency impact. Full-year
concentrate sales were in line with unit case sales. Comparable currency neutral
net revenues declined 2% for the full year. Reported operating income declined
4% for the full year. Comparable currency neutral operating income declined 1%
for the full year, reflecting the impact of volume performance and mix shifts,
partially offset by efficient expense management. 
* During the quarter, the Europe Group maintained volume share and gained value
share in still beverages. In a quarter marked by declines in the overall
beverage industry in Europe, our sparkling beverage volume in Europe declined 5%
in the quarter and our still beverage volume declined 3% as a result of
continued weak consumer confidence, adverse weather and aggressive competitive
pricing. For the year, we leveraged integrated marketing campaigns centered on
holiday activation, our 2012 Olympic Games partnership and Coke with Meals
programming. Germany volume declined 5% in the quarter, cycling 9% growth in the
prior year quarter, and grew 1% for the full year, cycling 6% growth in the
prior year. Performance for Germany during the year was driven by strong
commercial campaigns such as our 2012 Olympic Games partnership and the
Coca-Cola Christmas Truck Tour, music-themed integrated marketing campaigns, a
continued focus on low-calorie and no-calorie sparkling beverages and packaging
segmentation to drive recruitment and household penetration. Volume in the
Central and Southern Europe region declined 3% in the quarter and 1% for the
full year, with share gains in sparkling beverages supported by strong brand
health scores and growth in Coca-Cola Zero, up 15% in the quarter. Volume in the
Northwest Europe &amp; Nordics region declined 5% in the quarter and 3% for the full
year, and the Iberia region declined 8% in the quarter and 1% for the full
year.

Latin America

* Our Latin America Group`s volume grew 5% in the quarter and for the full year,
cycling 4% growth in the prior year quarter and 6% growth in the prior year. All
business units in Latin America grew volume in the quarter and for the full
year, with 9% growth in Latin Center, 5% growth in both Mexico and Brazil and 4%
growth in South Latin during the quarter. Reported net revenues for the quarter
increased 8%, reflecting concentrate sales growth of 6% and positive price/mix
of 8%, offset by a currency impact of 4% and a 2% impact related to structural
changes. After adjusting for unit case sales without concentrate sales
equivalents and the effect of two additional selling days, concentrate sales in
the quarter lagged unit case volume due to timing. Comparable currency neutral
net revenues increased 12% in the quarter. Reported operating income increased
10% in the quarter, with comparable currency neutral operating income up 16%,
primarily reflecting operating leverage as a result of two additional selling
days in the quarter as well as solid volume growth and favorable pricing across
all business units in the group. For the full year, reported net revenues
increased 3%, reflecting concentrate sales growth of 5% and positive price/mix
of 7%, offset by a currency impact of 8% and a 1% impact related to structural
changes. Full-year concentrate sales slightly lagged unit case volume.
Comparable currency neutral net revenues increased 11% for the full year.
Reported operating income increased 2% for the full year. Comparable currency
neutral operating income increased 12% for the full year, primarily reflecting
solid volume growth and favorable pricing across the group, partially offset by
continued investments in the business, including some initial investments
related to the 2014 World Cup. 
* During the quarter, the Latin America Group gained volume and value share in
NARTD beverages, resulting in the eighth consecutive year of share gains. This
consistently strong performance is driven by continued investments behind our
brands, strong activation of holiday programming and a competitively advantaged
package/price portfolio. Sparkling beverage volume was up 3% in the quarter,
with a strong focus on growing our portfolio of flavored sparkling brands. Brand
Coca-Cola volume grew 3% in the quarter while Fanta was up 7% and Sprite was up
5%. Still beverage volume grew 16% in the quarter, driven by ready-to-drink tea,
up double digits as a result of the newly launched Fuze Tea, as well as 22%
growth in sports drinks, 16% growth in packaged water and 8% growth in juices
and juice drinks. Both Mexico and Brazil grew volume and value share in the
quarter in NARTD beverages, with a continued focus on both single-serve and
returnable packaging.

North America

* Our North America Group`s volume grew 1% in the quarter and 2% for the full
year, cycling 1% growth in the prior year quarter and 1% organic growth in the
prior year. Reported net revenues for the quarter increased 6%, reflecting "as
reported" volume growth of 5%, including the benefit of two additional selling
days in the quarter, and a 1% benefit from structural changes, primarily related
to the acquisition of Great Plains Coca-Cola Bottling Company. North America
price/mix in the quarter was even. Fourth quarter reported operating income grew
12%. Comparable currency neutral operating income grew 11% in the quarter,
reflecting positive volume growth and operating leverage as a result of two
additional selling days in the quarter, partially offset by higher commodity
costs and ongoing investments in marketplace executional capabilities. This
operating income growth represents continued sequential improvement quarterly
throughout 2012. For the full year, reported net revenues increased 5%,
reflecting volume growth of 2%, positive price/mix of 2% and a 1% benefit from
structural changes, primarily related to the acquisition of Great Plains
Coca-Cola Bottling Company. Full-year reported operating income increased 12%,
which includes the effect of items impacting comparability, principally costs
related to the integration of the former North America business of Coca-Cola
Enterprises (CCE), as well as net gains/losses related to our economic hedges,
primarily commodities. Comparable currency neutral operating income grew 2% for
the full year, primarily due to positive volume growth and favorable pricing,
partially offset by higher commodity costs and ongoing investments in
marketplace executional capabilities. 
* During the quarter and for the full year, North America gained volume and
value share in NARTD beverages as we continue to build strong value-creating
brands, improve customer service and develop system capabilities. In addition,
we gained volume and value share in sparkling beverages as well as in all still
beverage categories, except the packaged water category, where Dasani maintains
a significant price premium over private label competition, supported by our
PlantBottle PET packaging. Sparkling beverage volume declined 2% in the quarter
with sparkling beverage price/mix growth of 1%. Sparkling beverage volume
declined 1% for the full year. Coca-Cola Zero volume grew mid single digits in
the quarter and high single digits for the full year. Fanta volume was up 10% in
the quarter, led by strong Halloween programming, and Seagram`s grew 9% in the
quarter driven by the continued expansion of Seagram`s Sparkling Seltzer Water
and Diet Seagram`s. Still beverage volume grew 8% in the quarter, led by
Powerade growth of 11% as well as continued strong growth in our ready-to-drink
tea portfolio of Gold Peak, Honest Tea and Fuze. Importantly, Powerade led the
broader North America sports drink category in both absolute volume and value
growth in full year 2012, building on its strong 2012 Olympic Games activation
and the Power Through campaign. Our portfolio of juice and juice drink brands
grew 1% in the quarter and 2% for the full year, with the Simply trademark up
12% in the quarter, driven by the continued expansion of Simply Cranberry
Cocktail and Simply Lemonade with Mango. 
* As part of our previously announced global Productivity and Reinvestment
Program, we are reorganizing our Coca-Cola Refreshments business in the United
States to align its sales and operating functions around three geographies -
East, Central and West. We are taking this action as part of our ongoing effort
to further improve our processes and systems, and to ensure greater operating
effectiveness and productivity across our North America operations. This new
alignment is in keeping with the ongoing evolution of our North America business
model, as we work to further enhance our capabilities to deliver our 2020
Vision.

Pacific

* Our Pacific Group`s volume grew 2% in the quarter and 5% for the full year,
cycling 5% growth in both the prior year quarter and full year. All business
units in the Pacific Group delivered volume growth for full-year 2012, with 11%
growth in the ASEAN region, 5% growth in the Greater China and Korea region, 2%
growth in Japan and 1% growth in the South Pacific region. Reported net revenues
for the quarter declined 1%, reflecting a 1% decline in concentrate sales and
even price/mix. After adjusting for unit case sales without concentrate sales
equivalents and the effect of two additional selling days, concentrate sales in
the quarter lagged unit case sales, primarily due to timing, including a later
Chinese New Year in 2013. Comparable currency neutral net revenues were even in
the quarter. Reported operating income increased 11% in the quarter, reflecting
operating leverage as a result of two additional selling days in the quarter and
ongoing productivity initiatives, as well as positive geographic mix, partially
offset by shifts in product and channel mix. In addition, fourth quarter
reported operating income reflects a 2% currency benefit. Comparable currency
neutral operating income increased 10% in the quarter. For the full year,
reported net revenues increased 3%, reflecting 3% concentrate sales growth and a
1% currency benefit, partially offset by a 1% impact due to structural changes
and the cycling of prior year one-time items related to the natural disasters in
Japan. Price/mix for the full year was even. After adjusting for unit case sales
without concentrate sales equivalents, full-year concentrate sales lagged unit
case sales, primarily due to timing, including a later Chinese New Year in 2013.
Comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 2% for the full year. Reported
operating income increased 13% for the full year, reflecting operating leverage
as a result of productivity initiatives, as well as positive geographic mix,
partially offset by shifts in product and channel mix. Full-year reported
operating income also includes a 2% currency benefit. Comparable currency
neutral operating income increased 6% for the full year. 
* During the quarter, South Korea and Thailand volume and share growth momentum
continued. The Philippines volume grew 6% in the quarter, reflecting the benefit
of consistent investment in executional capabilities there by our Bottling
Investments Group over time. Japan volume declined 4% in the quarter, cycling 5%
growth in the prior year quarter, and China volume declined 4%, cycling 10%
growth in the prior year quarter. In Japan, our continued focus on investing in
new and growing categories has led to two new billion-dollar brands in our
global portfolio, Ayataka premium green tea and I LOHAS single-serve packaged
water. Our fourth quarter China volume was impacted by the ongoing economic
slowdown as well as poor weather, the cycling of double-digit growth from the
prior year and a later Chinese New Year in 2013. During the year, our strong
sparkling beverage portfolio in China continued to expand our nearly 2 to 1
share advantage over our primary competitor. As we look ahead to 2013, we
continue to expect China`s recent economic slowdown to have a short-term effect
on our industry and on our business, although we do expect to see some
improvement in consumer disposable income as the year progresses. As such, we
expect our China business to deliver sequential improvement as we move through
the rest of 2013. We have every confidence in the long-term resilience of our
China business and we remain very excited about our opportunities in this
region.

Bottling Investments

* Our Bottling Investments Group`s volume grew 5% in the quarter on an average
daily sales basis, and grew 10% for the full year. Reported net revenues for the
quarter grew 6%. This reflects 3% growth in "as reported" volume, positive
price/mix of 1% and a 5% benefit due to structural changes, primarily the
acquisition of the Vietnam, Cambodia and Guatemala bottling operations,
partially offset by a currency impact of 3%. The favorable price/mix was driven
by positive pricing across a number of our bottling operations, partially offset
by geographic mix. The growth in "as reported" volume in the quarter was
primarily driven by the Philippines, India and Brazil. Comparable currency
neutral net revenues increased 9% in the quarter. Reported operating income in
the quarter declined $64 million primarily due to the impact of currency as well
as restructuring initiatives. Comparable currency neutral operating income
increased 27% in the quarter, reflecting the increase in revenues resulting from
volume growth and positive pricing in select markets as well as operating
leverage as a result of two additional selling days in the quarter, partially
offset by shifts in package and channel mix and continued investments in our
in-market capabilities. For the full year, reported net revenues grew 4%. This
reflects 6% "as reported" volume growth, positive price/mix of 1% and a 3%
benefit due to structural changes, partially offset by a currency impact of 6%.
Reported operating income for the full year declined 37% primarily due to the
impact of currency as well as restructuring initiatives. Comparable currency
neutral operating income increased 10% for the full year, reflecting the
increase in revenues resulting from volume growth and positive pricing in select
markets, partially offset by shifts in package and channel mix and continued
investments in our in-market capabilities.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Fourth quarter reported net revenues grew 4%, with comparable net revenues also
up 4%. This reflects a 4% increase in concentrate sales and a 1% benefit due to
structural changes, principally the acquisition of bottling operations. Currency
had a 1% unfavorable effect on net revenues in the quarter and price/mix was
even. Comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 5% in the quarter. After
adjusting for unit case sales without concentrate sales equivalents and the
effect of two additional selling days in the quarter, concentrate sales lagged
unit case sales in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in
certain markets. For the full year, concentrate sales were in line with unit
case sales. Our price/mix results in the quarter were in line with our
expectations, as the quarter is cycling higher price/mix comparisons from the
prior year. Despite the tougher comparisons, we continued to grow global NARTD
value share for the 22nd consecutive quarter. For the full year, both reported
and comparable net revenues grew 3%. This reflects a 4% increase in concentrate
sales, positive price/mix of 1% and a 1% benefit due to structural changes.
Currency had a 3% unfavorable effect on net revenues for the full year.
Comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 6% for the full year. 

Reported cost of goods sold increased 5% in the quarter, with comparable cost of
goods sold up 4%, driven by a 4% increase in concentrate sales and reflecting
moderately higher commodity costs compared to the prior year quarter, primarily
in North America and the Bottling Investments Group. Currency had minimal impact
on comparable cost of goods sold in the quarter. For the full year, reported and
comparable cost of goods sold both increased 5%, driven by a 4% increase in
concentrate sales and incremental commodity costs of approximately $225 million
for sweeteners, juices, metals and PET, primarily impacting North America and
the Bottling Investments Group. Currency decreased comparable cost of goods sold
by 2% for the full year. Items impacting comparability in the quarter and for
the full year primarily included net gains/losses on commodities hedging. We
currently estimate full-year 2013 incremental commodity costs of approximately
$100 million for sweeteners, juices, metals and PET compared to 2012. 

Reported SG expenses grew 1% in the quarter, and comparable SG expenses were
even in the quarter. Currency decreased comparable SG expenses by 1% in the
quarter. We captured nine points of operating expense leverage in the quarter,
reflecting the benefit of two additional selling days in the quarter. In
addition, operating expense leverage benefited from the timing of certain
operating expenses and the reversal of expenses related to our long-term
incentive plans for certain performance periods due to the unfavorable impact
that currencies had, or are projected to have, on those plans. It is important
to remember that a portion of our stock-based compensation is based on
multi-year performance periods and includes the impact of currency. For the full
year, both reported and comparable SG expenses increased 2%. Comparable
currency neutral SG expenses increased 5%, which reflects our continued
investments around the world in the health and strength of our brands, as well
as the cost of adding incremental "feet on the street," primarily in North
America and the Bottling Investments Group, in support of our growing business.
SG also included a benefit from the reversal of expenses related to our
long-term incentive plans for certain performance periods due to the unfavorable
impact that currencies had, or are projected to have, on those plans. We
captured one point of operating expense leverage in 2012, consistent with our
prior expectations of slightly positive operating expense leverage for the full
year. For 2013, we estimate operating expense leverage to be even to slightly
positive for the full year. 

Fourth quarter reported operating income increased 12%, with comparable currency
neutral operating income up 14%. Full-year reported and comparable currency
neutral operating income both increased 6%. Items impacting comparability
reduced fourth quarter 2012 operating income by $300 million and reduced
full-year 2012 operating income by $471 million. Items impacting comparability
reduced fourth quarter 2011 operating income by $283 million and reduced
full-year 2011 operating income by $896 million. Currency reduced comparable
operating income by 4% in the quarter and 5% for the full year. For 2013,
including our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior
year rates, as well as the recent devaluation announcement in Venezuela, we
estimate currency will have a4% unfavorable impact on operating income for the
first quarter of 2013 and a 1% unfavorable impact for the full year. 

On a full-year basis, our net share repurchases totaled $3.1 billion, slightly
above the high end of our previous outlook of $2.5 to $3.0 billion. In 2013, we
are targeting net share repurchases of $3.0 to $3.5 billion for the full year. 

Fourth quarter reported EPS was $0.41 and comparable EPS was $0.45. Items
impacting comparability reduced fourth quarter 2012 reported EPS by a net $0.04
and reduced fourth quarter 2011 reported EPS by a net $0.03. In both periods,
these items included restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity
initiatives, gains/charges related to equity investees, net gains/losses on
transactions, net gains/losses related to our economic hedges, primarily
commodities, and certain tax matters. Items impacting comparability in fourth
quarter 2012 also included charges related to changes in the structure of
Beverage Partners Worldwide (BPW). Items impacting comparability in fourth
quarter 2011 also included CCE integration costs. 

Full-year cash from operations was $10,645 million, up 12%, primarily due to an
improvement in working capital of approximately $800 million, which partially
benefited from the timing of certain working capital items. 

Effective Tax Rate

The reported effective tax rates for the quarter and full year were 20.5% and
23.1%, respectively. The underlying effective annual tax rate on operations in
2012 was 24.0%, and we expect it to be approximately the same for 2013. The
variance between the reported rate and the underlying rate was due to the tax
effect of various items impacting comparability, separately disclosed in this
document in the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures schedule.


The underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of significant or
unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when they occur, are separately
recognized in the appropriate period. 

Items Impacting Prior Year Results

First quarter 2011 results included a net charge of $0.02 per share due to
restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity initiatives and the
CCE integration, and charges related to the natural disasters in Japan,
partially offset by a gain on the sale of the Company`s stake in Chilean bottler
Coca-Cola Embonor S.A. 

Second quarter 2011 results included a net gain of $0.02 per share due to a
noncash gain on the adjustment to fair value of our investment in Mexican
bottler Grupo Continental S.A.B., partially offset by restructuring charges,
costs related to global productivity initiatives and the CCE integration, and
charges related to the natural disasters in Japan. 

Third quarter 2011 results included a net charge of $0.04 per share due to
restructuring charges and costs related to global productivity initiatives and
the CCE integration. 

Fourth quarter 2011 results included a net charge of $0.03 per share due to
restructuring charges and costs related to global productivity initiatives and
the CCE integration, partially offset by transaction gains. 

NOTES

* All references to growth rate percentages, share and cycling of growth rates
compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period. 
* "Concentrate sales" represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage
bases and powders sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to
its bottling partners or other customers. 
* "Sparkling beverages" means NARTD beverages with carbonation, including energy
drinks and carbonated waters and flavored waters. 
* "Still beverages" means nonalcoholic beverages without carbonation, including
noncarbonated waters, flavored waters and enhanced waters, juices and juice
drinks, teas, coffees, sports drinks and noncarbonated energy drinks. 
* All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case
volume, except for the reference to volume included in the explanation of net
revenue growth for North America. All volume percentage changes are computed
based on average daily sales for the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and
are computed on a reported basis for the full year. "Unit case" means a unit of
measurement equal to 24 eight-ounce servings of finished beverage. "Unit case
volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company
beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners
to customers. 
* For both North America and Bottling Investments Group, net revenue growth
attributable to volume reflects the increase in "as reported" volume, which is
based on as reported sales rather than average daily sales and may include the
impact of structural changes. For North America, this volume represents
Coca-Cola Refreshments` unit case sales (which are equivalent to concentrate
sales) plus concentrate sales to non-Company-owned bottling operations. 
* Fourth quarter 2012 financial results were impacted by two additional selling
days, which offset the impact of one less selling day in first quarter 2012
results. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the
variance in selling days due to the average daily sales computation referenced
above. 
* Due to the refocusing in 2012 of the Beverage Partners Worldwide (BPW)
ready-to-drink tea joint venture with Nestl&#233; S.A. (Nestl&#233;), we have eliminated
the BPW joint venture volume and associated concentrate sales from our reported
results for both 2011 and 2012 in those countries in which the joint venture was
phased out during 2012. In addition, we have eliminated the Nestea licensed
volume and associated concentrate sales in the U.S. due to our U.S. license
agreement with Nestl&#233; terminating at the end of 2012. These changes did not
materially impact the Company`s reported volume results for fourth quarter or
full-year 2012 on a consolidated basis or for any individual operating group.
However, these changes increased the Company`s reported fourth quarter and
full-year 2012 volume for still beverages by 2 points in both periods, and
ready-to-drink tea by 18 points and 11 points, respectively. 
* The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). However, management
believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional
meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our
ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in
making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the
Company`s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition
to, and not as an alternative for, the Company`s reported results prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial information does not represent a
comprehensive basis of accounting.

 1 Effective January 1, 2012, the Company elected to change our accounting methodology for determining the market-related value of assets for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. The Company's change in accounting methodology has been applied retrospectively, and we have adjusted all prior period financial information presented herein as required. 
 2 Following shareowner approval, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation on July 27, 2012, to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 5.6 billion to 11.2 billion and effect a two-for-one stock split of the common stock. Accordingly, all share and per share data presented herein reflects the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split.

 1 Effective January 1, 2012, the Company elected to change our accounting methodology for determining the market-related value of assets for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. The Company's change in accounting methodology has been applied retrospectively, and we have adjusted all prior period financial information presented herein as required. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Note: Certain growth rates may not recalculate using the rounded dollar amounts provided.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       


During the three months ended December 31, 2012, the results of our operating
segments were impacted by the following items:

* Intersegment revenues were $26 million for Eurasia and Africa, $154 million
for Europe, $95 million for Latin America, $2 million for North America, $104
million for Pacific and $22 million for Bottling Investments. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$1 million for Europe, $70 million for North America, $2 million for Pacific,
$119 million for Bottling Investments and $20 million for Corporate due to
charges related to the Company`s productivity and reinvestment program as well
as other restructuring initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income (loss)
before income taxes were increased by $1 million for Europe due to the
refinement of previously established accruals related to the Company`s 2008-2011
productivity initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before
income taxes were increased by $1 million for North America due to the
refinement of previously established accruals related to the Company`s
integration of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.`s ("CCE") former North America
business. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$6 million for North America due to the loss or damage of certain fixed assets
as a result of Hurricane Sandy. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$6 million for Corporate due to the elimination of the Company`s proportionate
share of gross profit in inventory on sales to Embotelladora Andina S.A.
("Andina") following its merger with Embotelladoras Coca-Cola Polar S.A.
("Polar"). Subsequent to this transaction, the Company has an ownership interest
in Andina that we account for under the equity method of accounting. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were increased
by $3 million for Corporate due to a net gain on the sale of land held by one of
the Company`s consolidated bottling operations, partially offset by transaction
costs associated with the Company`s acquisition of an equity ownership interest
in Mikuni Coca-Cola Bottling Co., Ltd. ("Mikuni"), a bottling partner with
operations in Japan. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $185 million for Corporate
due to the gain the Company recognized as a result of the merger of Andina and
Polar. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $108 million for Corporate
due to the loss the Company recognized on the pending sale of a majority
ownership interest in our Philippine bottling operations to Coca-Cola FEMSA
S.A.B. de C.V. ("Coca-Cola FEMSA"). This transaction was completed in January
2013. As of December 31, 2012, the assets and liabilities associated with our
Philippine bottling operations were classified as held for sale in our
consolidated balance sheets. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $82 million for Corporate due
to the Company acquiring an ownership interest in Mikuni for which we paid a
premium over the publicly traded market price. This premium was expensed on the
acquisition date. Subsequent to this transaction, the Company accounts for our
investment in Mikuni under the equity method of accounting 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $25 million for Bottling
Investments due to the Company`s proportionate share of unusual or infrequent
items recorded by certain of our equity method investees. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $16 million for Corporate due
to other-than-temporary declines in the fair values of certain cost method
investments. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $1 million for Europe and was
increased by $1 million for Eurasia and Africa, $1 million for Latin America, $1
million for North America and $1 million for Pacific due to changes in the
structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide ("BPW"), our 50/50 joint venture with
Nestl&#233; S.A. ("Nestl&#233;") in the ready-to-drink tea category. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $5 million for Corporate due
to charges associated with the Company`s indemnification of a previously
consolidated entity.

During the three months ended December 31, 2011, the results of our operating
segments were impacted by the following items:

* Intersegment revenues were $28 million for Eurasia and Africa, $160 million
for Europe, $82 million for Latin America, $1 million for North America, $78
million for Pacific and $24 million for Bottling Investments. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$3 million for Eurasia and Africa, $20 million for Europe, $1 million for Latin
America, $145 million for North America, $1 million for Pacific, $31 million for
Bottling Investments and $64 million for Corporate, primarily due to the
Company`s productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$10 million for Corporate due to charges associated with the floods in Thailand
that impacted the Company`s supply chain operations in the region. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $13 million for Bottling
Investments due to the Company`s proportionate share of unusual or infrequent
items recorded by certain of our equity method investees. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by a net $122 million for
Corporate, primarily due to gains the Company recognized as a result of an
equity method investee issuing additional shares of its own stock during the
period at a per share amount greater than the carrying value of the Company`s
per share investment. These gains were partially offset by charges associated
with certain of the Company`s equity method investments in Japan. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $17 million for Corporate due
to other-than-temporary declines in the fair values of certain
available-for-sale securities. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $1 million for Corporate due
to costs associated with the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt.
This debt existed prior to the Company`s acquisition of CCE`s former North
America business.

 1 Effective January 1, 2012, the Company elected to change our accounting methodology for determining the market-related value of assets for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. The Company's change in accounting methodology has been applied retrospectively, and we have adjusted all prior period financial information presented herein as required.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, the results of our operating segments
were impacted by the following items:

* Intersegment revenues were $152 million for Eurasia and Africa, $642 million
for Europe, $271 million for Latin America, $15 million for North America, $476
million for Pacific and $88 million for Bottling Investments. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$1 million for Europe, $227 million for North America, $3 million for Pacific,
$164 million for Bottling Investments and $38 million for Corporate due to
charges related to the Company`s productivity and reinvestment program as well
as other restructuring initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income (loss)
before income taxes were increased by $4 million for Europe, $1 million for
Pacific and $5 million for Corporate due to the refinement of previously
established accruals related to the Company`s 2008-2011 productivity
initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were
increased by $6 million for North America due to the refinement of previously
established accruals related to the Company`s integration of CCE`s former North
America business. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$21 million for North America due to costs associated with the Company detecting
residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not registered in the U.S. for use
on citrus products, in orange juice imported from Brazil for distribution in the
U.S. As a result, the Company began purchasing additional supplies of Florida
orange juice at a higher cost than Brazilian orange juice. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$20 million for North America due to changes in the Company`s ready-to-drink tea
strategy as a result of our current U.S. license agreement with Nestl&#233;
terminating at the end of 2012. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$6 million for North America due to the loss or damage of certain fixed assets
as a result of Hurricane Sandy. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$6 million for Corporate due to the elimination of the Company`s proportionate
share of gross profit in inventory on sales to Andina following its merger with
Polar. Subsequent to this transaction, the Company has an ownership interest in
Andina that we account for under the equity method of accounting. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were increased
by $3 million for Corporate due to a gain on the sale of land held by one of the
Company`s consolidated bottling operations, partially offset by transaction
costs associated with the Company`s acquisition of an equity ownership interest
in Mikuni, a bottling partner with operations in Japan. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $185 million for Corporate
due to the gain the Company recognized as a result of the merger of Andina and
Polar. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $92 million for Corporate
due to a gain the Company recognized as a result of Coca-Cola FEMSA issuing
additional shares of its own stock during the period at a per share amount
greater than the carrying amount of the Company`s per share investment. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $108 million for Corporate
due to the loss the Company recognized on the pending sale of a majority
ownership interest in our Philippine bottling operations to Coca-Cola FEMSA.
This transaction was completed in January 2013. As of December 31, 2012, the
assets and liabilities associated with our Philippine bottling operations were
classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $82 million for Corporate due
to the Company acquiring an ownership interest in Mikuni for which we paid a
premium over the publicly traded market price. This premium was expensed on the
acquisition date. Subsequent to this transaction, the Company accounts for our
investment in Mikuni under the equity method of accounting. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $8 million for Bottling
Investments due to the Company`s proportionate share of unusual or infrequent
items recorded by certain of our equity method investees. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $16 million for Corporate due
to other-than-temporary declines in the fair values of certain cost method
investments. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $1 million for Eurasia and
Africa, $4 million for Europe, $2 million for Latin America and $4 million for
Pacific due to changes in the structure of BPW, our 50/50 joint venture with
Nestl&#233; in the ready-to-drink tea category. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $5 million for Corporate due
to charges associated with the Company`s indemnification of a previously
consolidated entity.

During the year ended December 31, 2011, the results of our operating segments
were impacted by the following items:

* Intersegment revenues were $152 million for Eurasia and Africa, $697 million
for Europe, $287 million for Latin America, $12 million for North America, $384
million for Pacific and $90 million for Bottling Investments. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$12 million for Eurasia and Africa, $25 million for Europe, $4 million for Latin
America, $374 million for North America, $4 million for Pacific, $89 million for
Bottling Investments and $164 million for Corporate, primarily due to the
Company`s productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives as well as
costs associated with the merger of Embotelladoras Arca S.A.B. de C.V. ("Arca")
and Grupo Continental S.A.B. ("Contal"). 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$2 million for North America and $82 million for Pacific due to charges
associated with the earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern and eastern
Japan on March 11, 2011. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$19 million for North America due to the amortization of favorable supply
contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCE`s former North
America business. 
* Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were reduced by
$10 million for Corporate due to charges associated with the floods in Thailand
that impacted the Company`s supply chain operations in the region. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by a net $417 million for
Corporate, primarily due to the gain the Company recognized as a result of the
merger of Arca and Contal. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by a net $122 million for
Corporate, primarily due to gains the Company recognized as a result of an
equity method investee issuing additional shares of its own stock during the
period at a per share amount greater than the carrying value of the Company`s
per share investment. These gains were partially offset by charges associated
with certain of the Company`s equity method investments in Japan. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $102 million for Corporate
due to the gain on the sale of our investment in Coca-Cola Embonor S.A.
("Embonor"), a bottling partner with operations primarily in Chile. Prior to
this transaction, the Company accounted for our investment in Embonor under the
equity method of accounting. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $53 million for Bottling
Investments due to the Company`s proportionate share of unusual or infrequent
items recorded by certain of our equity method investees. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $41 million for Corporate due
to the impairment of an investment in an entity accounted for under the equity
method of accounting. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $17 million for Corporate due
to other-than-temporary declines in the fair values of certain
available-for-sale securities. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $9 million for Corporate due
to the net charge we recognized on the repurchase and/or exchange of certain
long-term debt assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE`s former North
America business as well as the early extinguishment of certain other long-term
debt. 
* Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $5 million for Corporate due
to the finalization of working capital adjustments related to the sale of our
Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE.

 (UNAUDITED)                                             


The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or referred to herein
as "reported"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial
measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that
should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Management also
uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and
planning decisions and in evaluating the Company`s performance. Non-GAAP
financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative
for, the Company`s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our
non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of
accounting. 

ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY

The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative
information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting
comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP
financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as "items
impacting comparability" based on how management views our business; makes
financial, operating and planning decisions; and evaluates the Company`s ongoing
performance. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes which are
viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable
period, but not both, or as relating to different and unrelated underlying
activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered "items
impacting comparability." In addition, we provide the impact that changes in
foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results ("currency
neutral"). 

Asset Impairments and Restructuring

Asset Impairments

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded
charges of $16 million due to other-than-temporary declines in the fair values
of certain cost method investments. These charges were recorded in the line item
other income (loss) - net. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded
charges of $17 million due to other-than-temporary declines in the fair values
of certain available-for-sale securities. In addition, during the year ended
December 31, 2011, the Company recorded charges of $41 million due to the
impairment of an investment in an entity accounted for under the equity method
of accounting. These charges were recorded in the line item other income (loss)
- net. 

Restructuring

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded
charges of $119 million and $163 million, respectively, associated with the
integration of our German bottling and distribution operations as well as other
restructuring initiatives outside the scope of our recently announced
productivity and reinvestment program. These restructuring charges were recorded
in the line item other operating charges. See below for a discussion of our
productivity and reinvestment program. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded
charges of $40 million and $119 million, respectively, associated with the
integration of our German bottling and distribution operations as well as other
restructuring initiatives outside the scope of our productivity initiatives and
the integration of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.`s ("CCE") former North America
business. These restructuring charges were recorded in the line item other
operating charges. See below for a discussion of our productivity and CCE
integration initiatives. 

Productivity and Reinvestment

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded
charges of $93 million and $270 million, respectively, in the line item other
operating charges related to our productivity and reinvestment program which was
announced in February 2012. This program will further enable our efforts to
strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable
growth. The first component of this program is a new global productivity
initiative focused around four primary areas: global supply chain optimization;
global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and
operational excellence; and data and information technology systems
standardization. 

The second component of our productivity and reinvestment program involves a new
integration initiative in North America related to our acquisition of CCE`s
former North America business. The Company has identified incremental synergies
in North America, primarily in the area of our North American product supply
operations, which will better enable us to serve our customers and consumers. 

As a combined productivity and reinvestment program, the Company anticipates
generating annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million which will be
phased in over four years starting in 2012. We expect to begin fully realizing
the annual benefits of these savings in 2015, the final year of the program. 

Productivity Initiatives

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company reversed
charges of $1 million and $10 million, respectively, related to previously
established accruals associated with our 2008-2011 productivity initiatives.
These reversals were recorded in the line item other operating charges. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded
charges of $80 million and $156 million, respectively, related to our 2008-2011
productivity initiatives. These initiatives were focused on providing additional
flexibility to invest for growth and impacted a number of areas, including
aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques;
redesigning key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness; better
leveraging our size and scale; and driving savings in indirect costs. 

The Company incurred total costs of $498 million related to these initiatives
since inception. These initiatives delivered annualized savings of over $500
million beginning in 2011, exceeding the upper end of the Company`s original
savings target of $400 million to $500 million. 

Equity Investees

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded
net charges of $25 million and net gains of $8 million, respectively, in the
line item equity income (loss) - net. These amounts represent the Company`s
proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our
equity method investees. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded
net charges of $13 million and $53 million, respectively, in the line item
equity income (loss) - net. These charges represent the Company`s proportionate
share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method
investees. 

CCE Transaction

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company reversed
charges of $1 million and $6 million, respectively, related to previously
established accruals associated with the Company`s integration of CCE`s former
North America business. These reversals were recorded in the line item other
operating charges. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded
charges of $145 million and $386 million, respectively, primarily related to our
integration of CCE`s former North America business. These charges were primarily
due to the development, design and initial implementation of our future
operating framework in North America. 

The Company realized nearly $350 million in annualized savings by the end of
2011 and incurred total costs of $487 million related to our integration of
CCE`s former North America business. These charges were primarily due to the
development, design and initial implementation of our future operating framework
in North America. This initiative was completed at the end of 2011. See above
for a discussion of the Company`s productivity and reinvestment program which
involves a new integration initiative in North America related to our
acquisition of CCE`s former North America business.

Transaction Gains

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recognized
a gain of $185 million due to the merger of Embotelladora Andina S.A. ("Andina")
and Embotelladoras Coca-Cola Polar S.A. ("Polar"), two Latin American bottling
partners, with Andina being the acquiring company. The merger of the two
companies was a noncash transaction that resulted in Polar shareholders
exchanging their existing Polar shares for newly issued shares of Andina at a
specified exchange rate. Prior to the merger, the Company held an investment in
Andina that was classified as an available-for-sale security, and we also held
an investment in Polar that was accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Subsequent to this transaction, the Company holds an investment in
Andina that we account for under the equity method of accounting. The Company
recorded the gain in the line item other income (loss) - net. In addition, the
Company recorded a charge of $6 million during the three months and year ended
December 31, 2012, due to the elimination of our proportionate share of gross
profit in inventory on sales to Andina as a result of the merger. The Company
recorded this charge in the line item net operating revenues. 

On December 13, 2012, the Company and Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V.
("Coca-Cola FEMSA") executed a share purchase agreement for the sale of a
majority ownership interest in our consolidated Philippine bottling operations.
This transaction was completed in January 2013. As a result of this agreement,
the Company was required to classify our Philippine bottling operations as held
for sale, and we recognized a loss of $108 million during the three months and
year ended December 31, 2012, based on the agreed upon sale price and related
transaction costs. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded a
charge of $82 million due to the acquisition of an ownership interest in Mikuni
Coca-Cola Bottling Co., Ltd. ("Mikuni") for which we paid a premium over the
publicly traded market price. Although the Company paid this premium to obtain
specific rights that have an economic and strategic value to the Company, they
do not qualify as an asset and were therefore expensed on the acquisition date.
This charge was recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net. The Company
accounts for our investment in Mikuni under the equity method of accounting. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recognized
a net gain of $4 million due to the sale of land held by one of the Company`s
consolidated bottling operations. This gain was recorded in the line item other
operating charges. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded a
charge of $5 million associated with our indemnification of a previously
consolidated entity. The impact of this charge effectively reduced the gain the
Company recognized when we initially sold the entity. The Company recorded this
charge in the line item other income (loss) - net. 

During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recognized a gain of $92
million as a result of Coca-Cola FEMSA issuing additional shares of its own
stock during the period at a per share amount greater than the carrying amount
of the Company`s per share investment. Accordingly, the Company is required to
treat these types of transactions as if the Company sold a proportionate share
of its investment in the equity method investee. The Company recorded this gain
in the line item other income (loss) - net. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recognized
a net gain of $122 million, primarily due to gains associated with Coca-Cola
FEMSA issuing additional common shares of its own stock at a per share amount
greater than the carrying value of the Company`s per share investment. The gains
recognized during the three months and year ended December 31, 2011, were
partially offset by charges associated with certain of the Company`s equity
method investments in Japan. The Company recorded this net gain in other income
(loss) - net. 

During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company also recognized a net gain
of $417 million, primarily due to the merger of Embotelladoras Arca S.A.B. de
C.V. ("Arca") and Grupo Continental S.A.B. ("Contal"), two bottling partners
headquartered in Mexico, into a combined entity known as Arca Continental,
S.A.B. de C.V. ("Arca Contal"). The Company recorded this net gain in the line
item other income (loss) - net. Prior to this transaction, the Company held an
investment in Contal that we accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. The merger of the two companies was a noncash transaction that
resulted in Contal shareholders exchanging their existing Contal shares for new
shares in Arca Contal at a specified exchange rate. Subsequent to this
transaction, the Company holds an investment in Arca Contal that we account for
as an available-for-sale security. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the
Company also recorded charges of $35 million in the line item other operating
charges related to costs associated with the merger of Arca and Contal. 

In addition, the Company recognized a gain of $102 million during the year ended
December 31, 2011, as a result of the sale of our investment in Coca-Cola
Embonor S.A. ("Embonor"), a bottling partner with operations primarily in Chile.
Prior to this transaction, the Company accounted for our investment in Embonor
under the equity method of accounting. The Company recorded this gain in the
line item other income (loss) - net. 

Certain Tax Matters

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded a
net tax benefit of $124 million and $150 million, respectively. This benefit was
primarily related to the reversal of certain valuation allowances, partially
offset by amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax
positions, including interest and penalties. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded a
net tax benefit of $22 million and $7 million, respectively, related to amounts
required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including
interest and penalties. 

Other Items

Impact of Natural Disasters

On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused widespread flooding and wind damage
across the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, primarily in New York and
New Jersey, and as a result the Company experienced lost sales in the impacted
areas. In addition, during the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, we
recorded charges of $6 million due to the loss or damage of certain fixed assets
resulting from the hurricane. 

On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake struck off the coast of Japan, resulting
in a tsunami that devastated the northern and eastern regions of the country. As
a result of these events, the Company made a donation to the Coca-Cola Japan
Reconstruction Fund which has helped rebuild schools and community facilities
across the impacted areas of the country. During the year ended December 31,
2011, the Company recorded total charges of $84 million related to these events.
These charges were primarily related to the Company`s donation and assistance
provided to certain bottling partners in the affected regions. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2011, the Company also
recorded charges of $10 million as a result of the floods in Thailand that
impacted the Company`s supply chain operations in the region. 

Economic (Nondesignated) Hedges

The Company uses derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk
associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process as
well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these derivatives were not
designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective
economic hedges. The changes in fair values of these economic hedges are
immediately recognized into earnings. 

The Company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for
outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our
non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying exposure
being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of income. We believe
this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our
economic hedging activities. During the three months and year ended December 31,
2012, the net impact of the Company`s adjustment related to our economic hedging
activities described above resulted in an increase to our non-GAAP operating
income of $82 million and $5 million, respectively. During the three months and
year ended December 31, 2011, the net impact of the Company`s adjustment related
to our economic hedging activities described above resulted in an increase to
our non-GAAP operating income of $8 million and $111 million, respectively. 

Repurchase, Extinguishment and/or Exchange of Long-Term Debt

During the three months ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded a charge
of $1 million in the line item interest expense due to costs associated with the
early extinguishment of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the
Company recorded net charges of $9 million in the line item interest expense
related to the repurchase, extinguishment and/or exchange of certain long-term
debt. 

Beverage Partners Worldwide and License Agreement with Nestl&#233; S.A.

During the three months ended December 31, 2012, the Company reversed charges of
$3 million related to previously established accruals associated with changes in
the structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide ("BPW"), our 50/50 joint venture
with Nestl&#233; S.A. ("Nestl&#233;") in the ready-to-drink tea category. During the year
ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded charges of $11 million due to
these BPW changes. In addition, as a result of our current U.S. license
agreement with Nestl&#233; terminating at the end of 2012, the Company recorded
charges of $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2012. 

Brazilian Orange Juice

In December 2011, the Company learned that orange juice being imported from
Brazil contained residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not registered in
the U.S. for use on citrus products. As a result, the Company began purchasing
additional supplies of Florida orange juice at a higher cost than Brazilian
orange juice. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company incurred
charges of $21 million related to these events, including the increased raw
material costs. 

Currency Neutral

Management evaluates the operating performance of our Company and our
international subsidiaries on a currency neutral basis. We determine our
currency neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate,
our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results by the current period
actual exchange rates (that include the impact of current period currency
hedging activities), to derive our current period local currency operating
results. We then multiply or divide, as appropriate, the derived current period
local currency operating results by the foreign currency exchange rates (that
also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging
activities) used to translate the Company`s financial statements in the
comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar
operating results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not
changed from the comparable prior year period.

&lt;p&gt;  POWAY, CA, Feb 12 (Marketwire) -- 
BridgeSTOR, LLC, the company Advancing Deduplication to the Cloud, today
announced release of the CRUNCH(TM) Virtual Deduplication Appliance,
BridgeSTOR's 2nd generation deduplication and compression technology for
Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM 2010/2012).
Delivered as a VHD, CRUNCH for DPM enables users of Microsoft's server
and workstation data protection product to store deduplicated data onsite
for fast data recovery or offsite for disaster recovery, archive and long
term data retention. 

    By creating a new long-term deduplicated disk storage tier, CRUNCH
reduces the disk requirements in short-term DPM storage pools, making
BridgeSTOR's capacity optimization the ideal response to DPM's voracious
storage appetite. CRUNCH deduplication helps DPM storage managers extend
the life of their in-place disk hardware with optional data compression
further reducing capacity requirements. 

    Adding CRUNCH to DPM data protection architectures extends the number of
available long-term recovery points and seamlessly integrates into your
current protection strategy while remaining under the control of DPM. 

    In addition to reducing DPM capacity requirements, CRUNCH supplies
"agentless" backup for NFS and CIFS clients that are currently
unprotected by DPM. NFS, CIFS and DPM data can be stored on disk, tape
and/or in the Cloud -- all in CRUNCH-deduplicated format. 

    "CRUNCH for DPM is the 2nd generation of BridgeSTOR's industry-leading
DPM deduplication technology and is based on the Data Deduplication File
System (DDFS(TM)), a breakthrough in Cloud-enabled data deduplication
that operates at both the file and sub-file (data block) level," says
John Matze, CEO, BridgeSTOR. "CRUNCH for DPM and DDFS are the results of
a significant development effort by an industry-leading team of
deduplication experts and Microsoft Server application specialists." 

    In its initial release, BridgeSTOR deduplication for DPM is optimized to
interoperate with the unique storage workloads produced by DPM 2010 and
2012 when protecting Hyper-V and shared storage (NAS, CIFS) servers as
well as workstations and laptops. Deduplication for DPM-protected
Exchange, SQL Server and SharePoint data will be available shortly. Using
CRUNCH for DPM, Microsoft's Data Protection Manager can finally offer
"bullet-proof" data protection coupled with market-leading data storage
efficiency. 

    Other key DDFS features include NearTime(TM) Deduplication,
ProtectedCloud(TM) Security, SHA Exchange(TM), Global Deduplication and
an unlimited number of Data Recovery Points. Deduplicated DPM data
retained on local disk by CRUNCH can be natively mounted, enabling
immediate data recovery.

    DPM users will soon be able to download an evaluation copy of CRUNCH for
DPM through the company's website. This capability will be announced in a
future press release.

    CRUNCH for DPM is offered through a BridgeSTOR Deduplication as a Service
(DaaS) subscription. Using DaaS, a user signs up for a period of time,
receives value over that period and then, at the end of the subscription
period determines whether or not to renew. If the customer decides not to
renew they will always be able to recover data. DaaS customers pay only
for the services provided. 

    The DaaS model is easy to understand and the annual subscription is low
and fixed. There are no upgrades nor are there additional features that
are not included in the base monthly charge. There are no hidden charges
or surprises and there are no "up-front" or one-time charges. No CAPEX is
required because DaaS is a pure OPEX offering. 

    CRUNCH for DPM annual subscription fees start at $2,400.00 per instance.
Contact BridgeSTOR sales for further detail. 

    BridgeSTOR, headquartered in Poway, CA, near San Diego, is advancing the
technology of data deduplication to bridge the gap between the data
center and offsite storage. The company is extending the boundaries of
data deduplication into virtual machine disaster recovery and archive,
optimized virtual data transfer to the Cloud and the long-term retention
of deduplicated data on magnetic tape. BridgeSTOR makes virtual machine
data protection, disaster recovery and data archive simple, affordable
and accessible to businesses of all sizes. The company brings data
deduplication to both Cloud storage and magnetic tape using on-premises
Virtual Deduplication Appliances and the innovative "Deduplication as a
Service" (DaaS) OPEX-only cost model to deliver a data protection
experience that overcomes the limitations of traditional storage and
networking. The company's website is: http://www.BridgeSTOR.com.

Management Commentary

"Steep declines in the prices for our recovered products and reduced drilling
activity in western Canada dampened otherwise solid performance in the quarter
and for the year," said Al Cadotte, President and CEO of Newalta. "Most of the
challenges we faced are dissipating and commodity prices are stabilizing.
Returns from our 2012 capital and strengthening market demand are expected to
drive improved results in the quarters ahead."

Fourth quarter results were below management's expectations as outlined in our
Q3 2012 outlook, primarily due to the following key factors:



--  Sharp decline in recovered crude oil and base oil prices in the latter
    part of the quarter, directly impacting our results 
    --  Our pricing for conventional and heavy oil fell dramatically from
        October over the latter part of the quarter, by 22% and 37%,
        respectively, due to the wider differentials experienced across the
        Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin ("WCSB"). The prices we receive
        for conventional and heavy oil are tied to Edmonton Par and Bow
        River. Further, Motiva (base oil) prices followed a similar pattern
        declining by 7% during the quarter. 



Commodity Pricing August 2012 to January 2013:

--  Decline in drilling activity in western Canada 
    --  Active rigs fell by 28% in the quarter, year-over-year, much more
        than anticipated. Reduced drilling activity primarily impacted our
        drill site equipment rental business in western Canada, as evidenced
        by equipment utilization declining from 68% in Q4 2011 to 36% in Q4
        2012. Reduced waste volumes at oilfield facilities were offset by
        increased recovered crude oil volumes as well as operational
        efficiencies.

--  Early winter freeze-up, impacting processing volumes of Mature Fine
    Tailings ("MFT") 
    --  Production delays driven by colder than expected weather restricted
        processing of MFT. Most, if not all, of the shortfall is anticipated
        to be recovered in 2013. 



"Potential in our key growth areas remains unchanged and our business
fundamentals remain strong," said Mr. Cadotte. "We made significant progress
with our long-range growth plan in 2012, preparing us to capitalize on the
many opportunities present in all areas of the business in 2013.

We met a number of objectives in 2012, specifically, we: 



--  increased our long-term onsite contract revenue base to 9% of revenue,
    up from 3% in 2011; 
--  established a leadership position in the area of MFT processing which
    may lead to additional contract work; 
--  grew our U.S. revenue by 25%; 
--  aligned the organization in three new divisions to enhance customer
    service and to support key growth areas; 
--  strengthened the organization through talent development programs and
    the addition of new talent, growing our employee base by 10% to over
    2,200 people;  
--  invested $137 million to drive growth in 2013; 
--  increased the dividend by 25% compared to 2011; and, 
--  completed a $77 million equity offering to strengthen our balance sheet.



"Our markets continue to improve but progress remains choppy. We have the
financial capacity, including proceeds from the recent equity financing, to
weather short-term fluctuations in commodity prices and market demand as we
experienced in the fourth quarter. We will continue to execute our long-term
plan to deliver strong, profitable growth and outstanding returns to investors
for many years ahead."

Results of Q4 2012 Compared to Q4 2011



--  Revenue increased 8%, Adjusted EBITDA and net earnings declined 9% and
    32%, respectively. Lower prices for recovered products impacted Adjusted
    EBITDA by $5.3 million; 
--  Revenue and gross profit from Facilities were $122.9 million and $21.7
    million, down 1% and 17%, respectively. Active rigs decreased by 28% and
    meters drilled were down 20%. Cost efficiencies realized in the quarter
    at our Western Facilities were offset by lower oilfield activity and the
    impact of lower recovered product prices. Lower sales volumes and
    increased procurement costs at Ville Ste-Catherine ("VSC") also impacted
    results year-over-year; 
--  Onsite revenue and gross profit in the quarter grew 26% and 5%,
    respectively, to $75.5 million and $17.3 million. Strong demand for our
    contract and project services was impacted by reduced drilling activity
    and lower recovered oil prices;  
--  Adjusted SG (SG before stock-based compensation and amortization)
    was flat compared to last year at $19.5 million.  



Results of 2012 Compared to 2011



--  Revenue was up 6%, Adjusted EBITDA was down 3% while net earnings
    increased 28%. Stronger demand for our services was offset by the lower
    value received for our products of $13.4 million and higher Adjusted
    SG expenses. Lower finance charges, deferred income tax expense and a
    gain on embedded derivatives contributed to the increase in net
    earnings;  
--  Facilities revenue and gross profit were $446.2 million and $100.0
    million, down 4% and 6%, respectively. Gains from productivity
    improvements and increased recovered oil volumes were offset by lower
    recovered product prices, reduced waste volumes and lower lead sales at
    VSC as well as lower oilfield activity; 
--  Onsite revenue and gross profit grew 28% and 19%, respectively, to
    $280.0 million and $69.7 million. Contributions from our MFT contract
    and higher project activity more than offset the impact of lower
    drilling activity and recovered crude oil prices;  
--  Adjusted SG (SG before stock-based compensation and amortization)
    was $74.3 million in 2012, a 9% increase over the prior year due to
    investments in people and people development to support our growth in
    2013. Adjusted SG remains in line with our expectation of 10% of
    annual revenue; 
--  Return on capital was 13.3% compared to 15.2% in 2011; 
--  Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 2.41 compared to 2.35 in 2011. 



Other Highlights: 



--  Capital expenditures for the three months and year ended December 31,
    2012, were $57.4 million and $172.3 million, respectively, ahead of our
    projected $155.0 million. The increased capital expenditure
    predominantly relates to equipment for the MFT contract, technical
    development, U.S. onsite projects and efficiency improvements in Western
    Facilities. Growth capital expenditures for the quarter and year
    primarily related to facility and service expansion at our Western
    Facilities and equipment for contract work in our Heavy Oil business
    unit;  
--  Our 2013 capital budget remains at $190 million, a 10% increase over
    2012 capital. Growth and maintenance capital expenditures are expected
    to be $155 million and $35 million, respectively. We expect to spend
    approximately 40% of the capital budget in the first half of 2013. We
    may revise the capital budget, from time-to-time, in response to changes
    in market conditions that materially impact our financial performance
    and/or investment opportunities. The capital program will be
    predominantly funded through cash flow from operations and the proceeds
    from the equity offering completed in the fourth quarter of 2012; 
--  In the fourth quarter, Newalta completed an equity financing with the
    issuance of 5.5 million common shares for gross proceeds of $77 million
    (net proceeds of $74.4 million); 
--  A dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 per share annualized) was declared,
    payable January 15, 2013 to shareholders of record December 31, 2012.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES 

This Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD") contains references to
certain financial measures, including some that do not have any standardized
meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS" or
"GAAP") and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other
corporations or entities. These financial measures are identified and defined
below:

"EBITDA", "EBITDA per share", "Adjusted EBITDA", and "Adjusted EBITDA per
share" are measures of our operating profitability. EBITDA provides an
indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior
to how these activities are financed, assets are amortized or how the results
are taxed in various jurisdictions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA provides an
indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior
to recognizing stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation, a component
of employee remuneration, can vary significantly with changes in the price of
our common shares. As such, Adjusted EBITDA provides improved continuity with
respect to the comparison of our operating results over a period of time.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are derived from the consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income and retained earnings. EBITDA per share and
Adjusted EBITDA per share are derived by dividing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
by the basic weighted average number of shares. 

They are calculated as follows:

"Adjusted net earnings" and "Adjusted net earnings per share" are measures of
our profitability. Adjusted net earnings provides an indication of the results
generated by our principal business activities prior to recognizing
stock-based compensation expense and the gain or loss on embedded derivatives.
Stock-based compensation expense, a component of employee remuneration, can
vary significantly with changes in the price of our common shares. The gain on
the embedded derivative is a result of the change in the trading price of the
debentures and the volatility of the applicable bond market. As such, Adjusted
net earnings provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of
our results over a period of time. Adjusted net earnings per share is derived
by dividing Adjusted net earnings by the basic weighted average number of
shares.

Effective January 1, 2013, we reorganized our reporting structure into three
divisions - New Markets, Oilfield and Industrial. We expect the reorganized
structure will facilitate a seamless service package to customers and optimize
our resource allocations.

We will continue to focus on our core values and business fundamentals to
improve returns on existing business lines. We will use our organic growth
investments to re-establish Return on capital to historic levels of 18% and
deliver the best cost-effective environmental solutions for our customers. We
have an inventory of low-risk, high-return projects to expand services, extend
our market coverage and to add long-term operating contracts. Our average
payback assumption on growth capital investments is approximately four years.

Strategy: 

The following table outlines our strategic focus through 2016 and the action
plan in 2013 and 2014 to achieve our strategic objectives.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW 

Fourth quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-year to $198.4 million while
Adjusted EBITDA was $33.3 million, 9% lower compared to Q4 2011. Increased
demand for our onsite contracts and projects was more than offset by the
impact of lower value received for our recovered products and reduced oilfield
activity. The impact of the lower value received for recovered crude oil, base
oil and lead was $5.3 million. In addition, drilling activity was down 28%
year-over-year. Excluding the lower value received for our products, Adjusted
EBITDA would have been $38.6 million in Q4 2012. Reduced operational results
and higher stock-based compensation, offset in part by lower finance charges,
caused net earnings to decline 32% to $4.1 million in Q4 2012. Our Total Debt
to Adjusted EBITDA ratio increased from 2.35 in Q4 2011 to 2.41 in Q4 2012. 

In 2012, revenue increased 6% to $726.2 million (2011 - $682.8 million) and
Adjusted EBITDA declined to $142.1 million (2011 - $146.5 million). Stronger
demand for our contract and project services was offset by the lower value
received for our products of $13.4 million, reduced oilfield activity and
higher Adjusted SG expenses. In addition, drilling activity in 2012
decreased 15% from 2011. Excluding the lower value received for our products,
Adjusted EBITDA would have been $155.5 million in 2012. Net earnings for the
year increased 28% to $42.8 million. Lower finance charges, lower deferred
income tax expense and gain on embedded derivatives contributed to the
increase in net earnings.

Revenue and gross profit from Facilities in the quarter were $122.9 million
and $21.7 million, down 1% and 17%, respectively, from Q4 2011. Compared to Q4
2011, active rigs decreased 28% and meters drilled were down 19%. Declines in
the prices of crude oil, base oil and lead resulted in reduced prices received
for our products of $4.3 million. Western Facilities efficiency improvements
for the quarter were offset by the impact of lower oilfield activity. Eastern
Facilities were positively impacted by an increase in volumes at Stoney Creek
Landfill ("SCL") as compared to Q4 prior year. VSC volumes were 11% lower than
Q4 2011. Compared to 2011, revenue and gross profit for the year declined 4%
and 6%, respectively. The impact of lower value received for our products was
$11.8 million. 

Onsite revenue and gross profit in the quarter were $75.5 million and $17.3
million, up 26% and 5%, respectively, from Q4 2011. Strong demand for our
contract and project services was impacted by lower value received for our
products and reduced drilling activity. Declines in the price of crude oil
resulted in reduced prices received for our products of $1.0 million. For the
year, revenue and gross profit increased 28% and 19%, respectively, from the
prior year. The increase was driven by our contract to process MFT and strong
demand for our project services. This increase was partially offset by the
impact of lower drilling activity and a decline in value received for our
products. The impact of lower value received for our products was $1.6
million. 

Return on capital decreased to 13.3% in Q4 2012 from 15.2% in Q4 2011. During
the quarter, we closed an equity financing issuing 5.5 million shares for
gross proceeds of $77.0 million (net $74.4 million). 

Revenue ($ millions) and Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions):

Capital expenditures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012,
were $57.4 million and $172.3 million, respectively, ahead of our projected
spend of $155.0 million. The increased capital expenditure predominantly
relates to equipment for the MFT contract, technical development, U.S. onsite
projects and efficiency improvements in Western Facilities. Growth capital
expenditures for the quarter and year primarily related to facility and
service expansion at our Western Facilities and equipment for contract work in
our Heavy Oil business unit. 

OUTLOOK

To the end of January, the prices we receive for our recovered conventional
and heavy oil have increased 19% and 22%, respectively, compared to December
2012. Drilling activity has improved 35% over Q4 2012. Base oil pricing has
declined 9% from December 2012. 

Returns from our 2012 capital and strengthening market demand are expected to
drive improved results in the quarters ahead. In the first half of 2013, we
anticipate ongoing strength across our three divisions while continued
short-term fluctuations impact the prices received for our recovered products.
Compared to Q1 2012, conventional and heavy oil prices for January are down 9%
and 24%, respectively. Drilling activity in Q1 2013 is expected to be
approximately 10% below Q1 2012. Base oil for January is 24% lower than Q1
2012. We anticipate normal operations at VSC and SCL in the quarter.

In 2013, we will operate under the following three new divisions:



--  New Markets will continue to focus on growing long-term contracts,
    strengthening our foundation of stable cash flow and maximizing cash
    flow from existing assets. We will continue to grow our contract revenue
    as a percentage of our total revenue. Our contract to process MFT will
    enter into its second year and we expect higher volumes to be processed
    in 2013 compared to 2012. Contributions from the MFT contract will
    predominately be realized in Q2 and Q3, with no contribution in Q1. We
    expect to continue to develop our U.S. platform, establishing two new
    U.S. operating locations to service key markets and meet market demand. 
--  Our Oilfield Division will drive organic growth by continuing to focus
    on productivity improvements, expanding our facility network through the
    addition of two new oilfield satellites, and adding new services. We
    will also leverage our onsite capabilities to expand our market presence
    within the conventional oilfield sector. 
--  Our Industrial Division will focus on growing organically through
    capacity expansions, expanding the facility network, productivity
    improvements, adding new services and growing our onsite business. In
    2013, we will proceed with detailed engineering plans to double the
    capacity of our North Vancouver oil recycling process. We will also
    establish one new industrial operating location to improve service to
    key markets in 2013.  



We have good visibility on our pipeline of organic growth capital projects,
extending well into 2014. Our 2013 capital budget remains at $190 million,
with growth capital and maintenance expenditures of $155 million and $35
million, respectively. We expect to spend approximately 40% of the capital
budget in the first half of 2013. We may revise the capital budget, from
time-to-time, in response to changes in market conditions that materially
impact our financial performance and/or investment opportunities. The capital
program will predominately be funded by cash flow from operations and the
proceeds from the equity offering completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. 

We continue to execute our business plan, reflecting a 15% and 20% revenue and
Adjusted EBITDA compound annual growth rate ("CAGR"), respectively, over the
plan period to 2016. Our strong balance sheet will allow us to weather
short-term fluctuations that may arise from time to time as we experienced in
Q4 2012. We will work towards a debt leverage ratio of 2.0, and will remain
well within debt covenant thresholds through 2013. 

With our continued focus on business fundamentals to improve returns on
existing assets, growth from our contract and project work, contributions from
the 2012 capital program and continued market demand for our services, we are
well positioned for growth in 2013 and beyond.

Q4 2012 revenue and gross profit were $122.9 million and $21.7 million, down
1% and 17%, respectively, from prior year. Western Facilities efficiency gains
were offset by the impact of reduced oilfield activity. At our Eastern
Facilities, performance was positively impacted by an increase in volumes at
SCL compared to prior year. A decline in the value of our crude oil, base oil
and lead products reduced our gross profit $4.3 million in Q4 2012. Excluding
the lower value received for our products, gross profit in Q4 2012 would have
been $26.0 million, 20% of revenue. 

In 2012, revenue and gross profit are $446.2 million and $100.0 million, down
4% and 6%, respectively. Western Facilities performance was positively
impacted by efficiency gains and offset by reduced oilfield activity. Eastern
Facilities were down due to lower volumes at SCL compared to 2011. Performance
was also negatively affected by the lower value received for our products,
reducing gross profit by $11.8 million. Excluding the lower value received for
our products, gross profit would have increased 5% to $111.8 million in 2012,
24% of revenue and above the prior year. 

Western Facilities

Western Facilities are located in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan
and generate revenue from:



--  the processing of industrial and oilfield-generated wastes, including:
    collection; treatment; water disposal; clean oil terminalling; custom
    treating and landfilling; 
--  sale of recovered crude oil for our account; and 
--  oil recycling, including the collection and processing of waste lube
    oils and the sale of finished products. 



Western Facilities draws its revenue primarily from industrial waste
generators and the oil and gas industry. Waste generated by the oil and gas
industry is affected by volatility in the prices of crude oil and natural gas
and drilling activity. Drilling activity will impact the volume of waste
received with the makeup of that waste being affected by specific drilling
techniques employed. Changes in the waste mix will impact the amount of crude
oil recovered to our account. Historically, for oilfield facilities,
approximately 75% of our waste volume relates to ongoing production resulting
in a fairly stable revenue base. Volatility in the price of crude oil impacts
crude oil revenue. Fluctuations in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate
impact U.S. dollar sales, which account for approximately 10% of Western
Facilities revenue. Changes in environmental regulations in western Canada
also impact our business. Management is not aware of any new legislation
proposed that is expected to have a material impact on our business and,
regardless, we tend to have a positive bias to change in environmental
regulations. 

Western Facilities revenue was down 9% compared to Q4 2011. Active rigs
decreased 28% and meters drilled were down 19% compared to Q4 2011 resulting
in a 21% decline in waste processing volumes year-over-year. Crude oil volumes
recovered increased 17% in the quarter as a result of processing higher oil
content waste. The value of the crude oil we recovered was impacted by a 14%
decline in Edmonton Par compared to Q4 2011. Oil recycling performance was
impacted by the reduced value of our base oil products as Motiva decreased
22%. 

In 2012, revenue was up 4% compared to 2011, primarily due to improved
performance at the majority of our facilities. Growth at our oilfield
facilities was driven by a shift to higher oil content waste derived from
production related activities and increased recovered crude oil from the
optimization of a facility commissioned in 2011. Growth in oil recycling was
driven by market diversification initiatives which resulted in a shift to
higher margin product lines. This was tempered by the impact of the lower
value received for our products and the decrease in drilling activity.

Eastern Facilities 

Eastern Facilities is comprised of facilities in Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic
Canada, and includes an engineered non-hazardous solid waste landfill located
in Stoney Creek, Ontario. Eastern revenue is primarily derived from:



--  the processing of industrial wastes, including collection, treatment and
    disposal; and 
--  Stoney Creek Landfill ("SCL"), an engineered non-hazardous solid waste
    landfill with an annual permitted capacity of 750,000 MT of waste per
    year. 



Eastern Facilities draws its revenue from the following industries in eastern
Canada and the bordering U.S. states: automotive; construction; forestry;
manufacturing; mining; oil and gas; petrochemical; pulp and paper; refining;
steel; and transportation service. The broad customer and industry base helps
to diversify risk; however, the state of the economy as a whole will affect
these industries. In addition, Eastern Facilities is sensitive to changing
environmental regulations regarding waste treatment and disposal. Management
is not aware of any new environmental regulatory reviews underway that are
expected to have a material effect on Newalta and, regardless, we tend to have
a positive bias to change in environmental regulations. 

In Q4 2012, volumes at SCL were up 11% from Q4 2011. Excluding SCL, Eastern
Facilities revenue was relatively flat year-over-year. 

Compared to 2011, Eastern Facilities revenue decreased 4% for the year.
Excluding SCL, Eastern processing facilities improved 6% over prior year as a
result of improved demand for our services. Volumes received at SCL in 2012
were at the maximum permitted capacity. In 2011, we received a one-time
contingency to continue to receive materials beyond the annual permitted
volume from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment.

Ville Ste-Catherine 

VSC is our lead-acid battery recycling facility. This facility generates
revenue from a combination of direct lead sales and tolling fees received for
processing batteries. Fluctuations in the price of lead affect our direct
sales revenue and waste battery procurement costs. Tolling fees are generally
fixed, reducing our exposure to fluctuations in lead prices. The cost to
acquire waste batteries is generally related to the trading price of lead at
the time of purchase. As a result of the shipping, processing and refining of
lead, there is a lag between the purchase and final sale of lead. Slow and
modest changes in the value of lead result in a relatively stable differential
between the price received for recycled lead and the cost to acquire lead acid
waste batteries. However, sharp short-term swings in the London Metal Exchange
("LME") price can distort this relationship, resulting in a temporary
disconnect in values. 

Our objective is to ensure optimal performance at VSC, which historically has
meant balancing direct sales and tolling volumes equally. In 2012, our split
was approximately 50/50. Production volumes will be managed to optimize
performance under prevailing market conditions. In addition, fluctuation in
the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate impacts revenue and procurement.
Substantially all of VSC's revenue and the majority of our battery procurement
costs are denominated in U.S. dollars, with the balance of our operating costs
denominated in Canadian dollars. 

Q4 2012 revenue was up 14% compared to prior year. The increase was mainly
attributable to a shift in our tolling/direct mix towards direct sales in
addition to a 4% increase in LME pricing. The lagged LME price increased to
U.S. $2,167/MT (Q4 2011 - U.S. $2,076). VSC volumes were 17,600 MT (Q4 2011 -
19,800 MT), in line with our quarterly average. The increase in price was more
than offset by increased procurement costs.

Compared to 2011, VSC revenue decreased 16%, primarily due to the decline in
lead price. Lagged LME price decreased 16% to U.S. $2,041/MT (2011 - U.S.
$2,435/MT). Sales volume in 2012 decreased 10% to 64,700 MT (2011 - 71,700
MT). The direct and tolling split was consistent with 2011. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ONSITE DIVISION

Overview

Onsite includes a network of more than 25 facilities with over 700 employees
across Canada and the U.S. Onsite services involves the mobilization of
equipment and our people to manage industrial by-products at our customer
sites. Onsite includes: the processing of oilfield-generated wastes and the
sale of recovered crude oil for our account; industrial cleaning; site
remediation; dredging and dewatering and drill site processing, including
solids control and drill cuttings management. Onsite includes the Western
Onsite, Eastern Onsite and Heavy Oil business units. 

Our Onsite services, excluding drill site, generally follow a similar sales
cycle. We establish our market position through the execution of short-term
projects which ideally may lead to longer term contracts, providing a more
stable cash flow. The cycle to establish longer term contracts can be between
18 months to three years. Characteristics of projects and contracts are:



--  Projects: non-recurring and/or seasonal services completed in less than
    one year, primarily completed between March and November and will vary
    from period-to-period, and 
--  Contracts: typically evolve from projects and are generally year round
    arrangements based on fee for service solutions with terms longer than
    one year and no direct commodity price exposure.  



In addition, Onsite performance is affected by the customer's requirement for
Newalta to maintain a strong safety record. To address this requirement, our
Environmental, Health and Safety ("EH") team works with our people and our
customers to develop an EH culture and prevention strategy owned by
operators to ensure we maintain our strong record.

The business units contributed the following to division revenue:

Assets employed is the sum of capital assets, intangible assets and goodwill
allocated to each division. 

Q4 revenue increased 26% and gross profit was 5% higher compared to Q4 2011.
Strong demand for our contracts and project services was impacted by the
decline in the value of our recovered products and reduced waste volumes in
Heavy Oil facilities. Declines in the price of crude oil resulted in reduced
prices received for our products of $1.0 million. Lower drilling activity in
the WCSB resulted in lower utilization rates for drill site. Performance was
positively impacted by waste volumes processed under our MFT contract in the
quarter. 

For the year, revenue and gross profit increased 28% and 19%, respectively,
compared to prior year. Increased contract and project activity offset the
impact of lower drilling activity and lower value received for our products.

Western Onsite

Revenue is primarily generated from:



--  the supply and operation of drill site processing equipment, including
    equipment for solids control and drill cuttings management throughout
    western Canada and the U.S.;  
--  onsite service in western Canada (excluding services provided by Heavy
    Oil) includes: industrial cleaning; site remediation; centrifugation;
    and dredging and dewatering; and 
--  environmental services serving primarily oil and gas customers. 



Western Onsite performance is primarily affected by fluctuations in drilling
activity in western Canada and the U.S. We can also be impacted by the
competitive environment. To address these risks, we have developed a strong
customer partnership approach and service differentiation to secure Newalta
brand loyalty. Other onsite services for this business unit are in the early
stages of development. We are currently engaged primarily in short-term or
event-based projects, which will vary from quarter-to-quarter. Western Onsite
is also affected by market conditions in various other industries, including
pulp and paper, refining, mining and municipal dewatering. 

Q4 2012 Western Onsite revenue increased 8% compared to Q4 2011. The growth
was driven by U.S. onsite projects including our multi-year arrangement in the
U.S. to process slop oil emulsions, and increased market demand for our
industrial onsite services in western Canada. Drill site utilization rates
declined in the quarter over prior year. Canadian utilization was negatively
impacted by a 28% decline in active rigs in western Canada. U.S. utilization
improved 9% from Q4 2011 due to the deployment of new and existing equipment
to more active areas. 

For the year ended December 31, 2012, Western Onsite revenue increased 17%
compared to 2011 with contributions from onsite projects in the U.S. and
industrial onsite services in western Canada. In the third quarter, we entered
into a new multi-year arrangement in the U.S. to process slop oil emulsions on
a customer's site in the Bakken. The utilization rate for drill site equipment
was down 9% compared to 2011.

Eastern Onsite

Eastern Onsite revenue is derived from:



--  onsite service in eastern Canada, including: industrial cleaning;
    centrifugation; and dredging and dewatering; and 
--  a fleet of specialized vehicles and equipment for emergency response and
    onsite processing. 



Eastern Onsite services a broad range of industries in eastern Canada;
however, these industries are sensitive to the state of the economy in these
regions. 

Revenue grew 38% and 35% for the three month period and year ended December
31, 2012, respectively, as a result of increased customer adoption of our
onsite service model. We are engaged primarily in short-term or project based
work, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Similar to our model in other
regions, the strategy is to secure projects that can be converted into
contracts. We currently have one Eastern Onsite operating contract.

Heavy Oil

Our heavy oil services business began 17 years ago with facilities at
Hughenden and Elk Point, Alberta. This business has expanded from processing
heavy oil in our facility network to operating equipment on customers' sites.
Leveraging our facilities as staging areas, we deliver a broad range of
specialized services at numerous customer sites. Heavy Oil revenue is
generated by facilities services which includes the processing and disposal of
oilfield-generated wastes, including water disposal and landfilling as well as
the sale of recovered crude oil for our account. The balance of Heavy Oil
revenue is generated from specialized onsite services for heavy oil producers
under projects and contracts. 

Heavy Oil facility revenue has an established customer base; however,
performance is affected by the amount of waste generated by producers and the
sale of crude oil recovered to our account. These streams vary due to
volatility in the price of heavy oil and drilling activity. To address this
volatility, over the past four years we have worked with customers to develop
specialized onsite services where revenue is based on processed volumes,
eliminating our exposure to crude oil prices for these services. In addition,
these services create cost savings and provide more environmentally beneficial
solutions for our customers. Growth in the business unit will come from our
ability to attract and retain customers as new heavy oil operations come on
stream. 

Q4 2012 Heavy Oil revenue increased 43% compared to Q4 2011. Processing under
our MFT contract drove the increase that was tempered by lower waste volumes
received at our facilities and the impact of lower pricing received for our
recovered crude oil product. Recovered crude oil volumes increased 12% over
prior year due to processing higher oil content waste. Waste volumes decreased
26% due to lower oilfield activity. Price per barrel received declined 23%
compared to prior year.

For the year, revenue increased 37% compared to 2011, driven by our MFT
contract, increased demand for our services and increased recovered crude oil
volumes. Recovered crude oil volumes increased 13% over 2011 due to processing
higher oil content waste.

To date, we have nine Heavy Oil contracts, seven of which were operating in Q4
2012. Contracts now generate 9% of total revenue compared to 3% in 2011.

IFRS requires that amortization of corporate assets be included in SG
expenses. The above table removes stock-based compensation and amortization
from SG to provide improved transparency with respect to the comparison of
our results.

For Q4 2012, Adjusted SG was flat to prior year. For the year, Adjusted SG
increased due to investments in people and people development to support our
growth in 2013. Adjusted SG remains in line with our expectation of 10% of
annual revenue. Stock-based compensation expense increased for both the
quarter and year. It fluctuates based on the effects of vesting, volatility in
our share price and dividend rate changes. Approximately 55% of stock-based
compensation expense is estimated to be settled with equity, with the balance
to be settled in cash.

Research and development expenses are related to our Technical Development
group. They search globally and evaluate new technologies for commercial
application at our Facilities and on our customer sites. There is a steady
stream of new technologies moving through our Technical Development pipeline;
from identification and evaluation to the development phase. Our objective is
to deliver two new commercial processes every year.

(1) Includes convertible debentures and senior unsecured debentures in 2011.  

(2) Excludes capitalized interest of $1,595 and $4,664 in Q4 2012 and 2012
year-to-date, respectively, and $858 and $2,744 in Q4 2011 and 2011
year-to-date, respectively. 

(3) Relates to decommissioning liability. 

(4) Relates to the early redemption feature for the Series 1 and 2 senior
unsecured debentures. 

The decrease in finance charges before the gain on the embedded derivatives
and the unwinding of the discount for the quarter and year-to-date is
attributable to unamortized issue costs expensed upon early redemption of the
Convertible Debentures in Q4 2011. The non-cash gain on the embedded
derivatives is associated with the early redemption feature for the Series 1
and Series 2 Senior Unsecured Debentures (collectively the "Senior Unsecured
Debentures") recognized during the quarter. The gain is an estimate of the
fair value of the embedded derivatives and is primarily impacted by the
risk-free rate, market volatility, and our credit spread. See Note 17 to the
Financial Statements for further information.

Finance charges associated with the Senior Unsecured Debentures include annual
coupon rates of 7.625% and 7.75%, respectively, as well as the accretion of
issue costs and gains or losses on the embedded derivatives for both series.
In 2011, we had Convertible Debentures with an annual coupon rate of 7.0%,
which were refinanced in Q4 2011 with the Series 2 Senior Unsecured
Debentures. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD for discussion
of our long-term borrowings.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Deferred taxes decreased 73% and 21% to $0.7 million and $11.2 million,
respectively, in the quarter and for the year. The lower effective tax rate in
2012 resulted due to statutory and other rate decreases and changes in
non-deductible items including stock-based compensation expense and gain on
embedded derivatives. Our statutory tax rate in Canada is 25.72% for 2012 and
was 27.35% in 2011. Loss carry forwards were approximately $142 million at
December 31, 2012. We do not anticipate paying significant income tax until
2016.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The term liquidity refers to the speed with which a company's assets can be
converted into cash, or its ability to do so, as well as cash on hand.
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will encounter difficulty in meeting
obligations associated with financial obligations that are settled by cash or
another financial asset. Our liquidity risk may arise due to general
day-to-day cash requirements and in the management of our assets, liabilities
and capital resources. Liquidity risk is managed against our financial
leverage to meet obligations and commitments in a balanced manner. For further
information on our liquidity risk management, refer to Note 17 to the
Financial Statements for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012. 

Our debt capital structure is as follows:

We continue to focus on managing our working capital accounts while supporting
our growth. Working capital at December 31, 2012, was $10.7 million (December
31, 2011 - $13.7 million). At current activity levels, working capital is
expected to be sufficient to meet our ongoing commitments and operational
requirements of the business. We continue to manage working capital well
within our prescribed targets, commensurate with activity levels. For further
information on credit risk management, please refer to Note 17 to the
Financial Statements for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012.

DEBT RATINGS 

DBRS Limited ("DBRS") and Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") provide a
corporate and Senior Unsecured Debentures credit rating. On October 17, 2012,
DBRS upgraded our issuer rating to BB from BB (low) and revised the trend to
Stable from Positive. The rating change was attributable to our execution of
the business plan, and a growing onsite contract business that is more stable
with multi-year terms, strengthening our financial profile. DBRS has also
upgraded the Senior Unsecured Debentures to BB from BB (low) with the trend
being Stable. Moody's rating remains unchanged from November, 2010.

SOURCES OF CASH

Our liquidity needs can be sourced in several ways including: Funds from
operations, borrowings against or increases in our Credit Facility, new debt
instruments, the issuance of securities from treasury, return of letters of
credit or replacement of letters of credit with other types of financial
security and proceeds from the sale of assets. 

Credit Facility

At December 31, 2012, $132.8 million was available and undrawn to fund growth
capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes, as well as to provide
letters of credit to third parties for financial security up to a maximum
amount of $60 million. The aggregate dollar amount of outstanding letters of
credit is not categorized in the financial statements as long-term debt;
however, the issued letters of credit reduce the amount available under the
Credit Facility and are included in the definition of Total Debt for covenant
purposes. Under the Credit Facility, surety bonds (including performance and
bid bonds) to a maximum of $125 million are excluded from the definition of
Total Debt. As at December 31, 2012, surety bonds issued and outstanding
totalled $43.8 million. 

During the third quarter, the Credit Facility was amended and restated. The
Credit Facility now matures July 12, 2015. Management may, at its option,
request an extension of the Credit Facility on an annual basis. If no request
to extend the Credit Facility is made by management, the entire amount of the
outstanding indebtedness would be due in full on July 12, 2015. Under the
amended facility, the principal borrowing amount is $225 million and the
maximum Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio is 4:1. The facility requires
us to be in compliance with certain covenants. Our covenant ratios under the
Credit Facility remained well within their thresholds. 

Financial performance relative to the financial ratio covenants(1) under the
Credit Facility is reflected in the table below.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



(1) We are restricted from declaring dividends if we are in breach of any
covenants under our Credit Facility.  

(2) Senior Secured Debt means the Total Debt less the Senior Unsecured
Debentures.  

(3) EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, the closest measure of which is net
earnings. For the purpose of calculating the covenant, EBITDA is defined as
the trailing twelve-months consolidated net income for Newalta before the
deduction of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash
items (such as non-cash stock-based compensation and gains or losses on asset
dispositions). Additionally, EBITDA is normalized for any acquisitions or
dispositions as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period.  

(4) Total Debt comprises outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility,
including bank overdraft balance and the Senior Unsecured Debentures.

Our Total Debt was $342.2 million as at December 31, 2012, which reflected a
$2.3 million decrease over December 31, 2011. Proceeds of the equity financing
were offset by increased capital spending and lower EBITDA causing the Total
Debt to EBITDA ratio to increase from 2.38 in Q4 2011 to 2.47 in Q4 2012. Our
target for Total Debt to EBITDA ratio remains at or below 2.0. Our covenant
ratios under the Credit Facility remained well within their thresholds. We
will manage within our covenants throughout 2013.

(1) If a change of control occurs, Newalta will be required to offer to
purchase all or a portion of each debenture holder's Senior Unsecured
Debentures, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
of the Senior Unsecured Debentures offered for repurchase plus accrued
interest to the date of purchase 

(2) Up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount with the net cash proceeds of
one or more public equity offerings 

(3) Plus interest to the date of redemption

The Senior Unsecured Debentures are unsecured senior obligations and rank
equally with all other existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to
any subordinated debt that may be issued by Newalta or any of its
subsidiaries. The Senior Unsecured Debentures are effectively subordinated to
all secured debt to the extent of collateral on such debt.

The trust indenture under which the Senior Unsecured Debentures have been
issued contains certain annual restrictions and covenants that, subject to
certain exceptions, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay
dividends, make certain loans or investments and sell or otherwise dispose of
certain assets subject to certain conditions, among other limitations. 

Covenants under our trust indenture include:

(1) We are restricted from declaring dividends, purchasing and redeeming
shares or making certain investments if the total of such amounts exceeds the
period end surplus for such restricted payments.

We will manage within our covenants throughout 2013. 

Equity Issuance

During the fourth quarter, we closed an equity financing with the issuance of
5.5 million shares at a price of $14.00 per share for gross proceeds of $77.0
million (net proceeds of $74.4 million). The funds were used to expand our
organic growth plan and contribute to the funding of customer-driven capital
projects. Proceeds of the offering were used to reduce indebtedness and for
general corporate purposes until fully invested. 

USES OF CASH

Our primary uses of funds include maintenance and growth capital expenditures
as well as acquisitions, payment of dividends, operating and SG expenses and
the repayment of debt. 

Capital Expenditures

"Growth capital expenditures" or "growth and acquisition capital expenditures"
are capital expenditures that are intended to improve our efficiency and
productivity, allow us to access new markets and diversify our business.
Growth capital, or growth and acquisition capital, are reported separately
from maintenance capital because these types of expenditures are
discretionary. "Maintenance capital expenditures" are capital expenditures to
replace and maintain depreciable assets at current service levels. Maintenance
capital expenditures are reported separately from growth activity because
these types of expenditures are not discretionary and are required to maintain
current operating levels.

Capital expenditures for the periods indicated are as follows: 



                                      Three months ended          Year ended

Total capital expenditures(1)           57,400    45,289   172,340   117,680
----------------------------------------------------------------------------



(1) The numbers in this table differ from Consolidated Financial Statements of
Cash Flows because the numbers above do not reflect the net change in working
capital related to capital asset accruals. 

Total capital expenditures were $57.4 million for the three months ended
December 31, 2012. Growth capital expenditures for the quarter relate
primarily to facility and service expansion at our Western Facilities and
equipment for contract work in our Heavy Oil business unit. Maintenance
capital expenditures relate primarily to process equipment improvements at our
facilities. Capital expenditures were funded from funds from operations and
our Credit Facility.

Total capital spending for 2012 was $172.3 million compared to $117.7 million
in 2011. The increase over prior year was driven by additional equipment
purchases primarily for our project and contract related work, facility and
service expansion at our Western Facilities. 

Our 2013 capital budget is $190 million, comprised of growth capital of $155
million and maintenance capital of $35 million. We expect to spend
approximately 40% of the capital budget in the first half of 2013. We may
revise the capital budget, from time-to-time, in response to changes in market
conditions that materially impact our financial performance and/or investment
opportunities. The capital program will be funded by cash flow from operations
and the proceeds from the equity financing completed in the fourth quarter of
2012. 

Our $155 million in growth capital investment for 2013 will be allocated among
the following areas:



New Markets                   $70 million 
Oilfield                      $40 million 
Industrial                    $30 million 
Technical Development and                 
Corporate                     $15 million 



Dividends and Share Capital

In determining the dividend to be paid to our shareholders, the Board of
Directors considers a number of factors, including: the forecasts for
operating and financial results; maintenance and growth capital requirements;
as well as market activity and conditions. After a review of all factors, the
Board declared $5.4 million in dividends or $0.10 per share, paid January 15,
2013, to shareholders of record as at December 31, 2012.

During the quarter we implemented a Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("DRIP"). The
DRIP provides eligible Newalta shareholders with the opportunity to reinvest
their quarterly cash dividend to acquire additional shares at a purchase price
equal to 95% of the average market price (defined as the volume weighted
average trading price of the shares for the five trading days immediately
preceding the dividend payment date). The dividend paid to shareholders of
record on December 31, 2012 was the first dividend eligible to be reinvested
under the DRIP. The full text of the DRIP and an Enrollment Form are available
from Valiant Trust at www.valianttrust.com or on Newalta's website at
www.newalta.com. 

As at February 13, 2013, Newalta had 54,410,235 shares outstanding, and
outstanding options to purchase up to 4,308,459 shares. 

Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations, as at December 31, 2012 were:

Quarterly performance is affected by, among other things, weather conditions,
timing of onsite projects, the value of our products, foreign exchange rates,
market demand and the timing of our growth capital investments as well as
acquisitions and the contributions from those investments. Growth capital
investments completed in the first half of the year will tend to strengthen
the second half financial performance. Revenue from certain business units is
impacted by seasonality. However, due to the diversity of our business, the
impact is limited on a consolidated basis. For example, waste volumes received
at our oilfield facilities decline in the second quarter due to road bans
which restrict drilling activity. This decline is offset by increased activity
in our Eastern Onsite business unit due to the aqueous nature of work
performed, as well as potentially by fluctuations in the value of our products
or event-based waste receipts at SCL. As experienced over the last eight
quarters, fluctuations in the value of our products can impact results.

All four quarters in 2011 reflect continued strong demand for our products and
services. Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, earnings before taxes and net earnings
have steadily improved quarter-over-quarter in line with market conditions
from 2010. Net earnings in Q2 relative to Q1 2011 were positively impacted by
lower stock-based compensation expense and lower related deferred tax expense.
Relative to Q3 2011, Q4 net earnings and Earnings before taxes were lower due
to lower Adjusted EBITDA as well as higher financing fees as a result of the
early redemption of the Convertible Debentures. Adjusted EBITDA was lower in
Q4 relative to Q3 2011 due largely to lower contributions from Facilities
resulting from lower event-based business at SCL and weaker performance at
VSC, as well as higher Adjusted SG due to the timing of expenses. 

Quarterly revenue in 2012 grew, reflecting strong demand for our services.
Compared to Q4 2011, Q1 2012 revenue was down and Adjusted EBITDA was flat.
Lower contributions from Onsite due to reduced activity at our Heavy Oil
facilities were offset by lower Adjusted SG costs. Net income was down 20%
over Q4 2011 due to seasonally lower contributions from Onsite and higher
stock-based compensation expense which were offset by lower finance charges.
Compared to Q1, Q2 2012 revenue was up slightly and net earnings increased
significantly due to lower stock-based compensation expense and net finance
charges. Adjusted EBITDA in Q2 2012 was down from Q1 due to the lower value
received for our products in the quarter and higher SG expenses. Revenue and
adjusted EBITDA in Q3 2012 increased compared to the prior quarter as a result
of growth in Onsite. Net earnings decreased in Q3 2012 due to higher
stock-based compensation expense. Fourth quarter revenue increased relative to
Q3 2012 due to increased demand for our onsite contracts and projects. Net
earnings and adjusted EBITDA in Q4 decreased from Q3 2012 due to the impact of
lower value received for our products, reduced oilfield activity and higher
stock-based compensation expense. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On January 1, 2013, we reorganized our reporting structure into three
divisions - New Markets, Oilfield and Industrial. The changes to our operating
structure are based on:



--  improved alignment of our operations with our customers so that we can
    provide a seamless service package and also focus our efforts on
    developing new and innovative solutions for them; 
--  providing the optimum structure to allocate management to execute our
    growth plans; and, 
--  improving the disclosure to our investors with additional detail on the
    results of our areas of high growth (New Markets Division) while
    retaining all of the previous information provided. 



The reorganization of the three new divisions will be as follows:

New Markets



--  Heavy Oil Business Unit (includes heavy oil facilities and onsite) 
--  U.S. Business Unit (includes U.S. facilities, drill site and onsite) 



 Oilfield 



--  Includes oilfield facilities, oilfield onsite, environmental services
    and Canadian drill site 



 Industrial



--  Western Business Unit (includes oil recycling, industrial facilities and
    industrial onsite in western Canada) 
--  Eastern Business Unit (includes VSC, SCL, industrial facilities and
    industrial onsite in eastern Canada) 



The tables below restate the historical segmented information from the
Facilities and Onsite divisions to the New Markets, Oilfield and Industrial
divisions.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 

SENSITIVITIES 

Our stock-based compensation expense is sensitive to changes in our share
price. At December 31, 2012, a $1 change in our share price between $12 per
share and $18 per share has a $3.0 - $4.0 million direct impact on annual
stock-based compensation reflected in SG We anticipate that approximately
55% of stock-based compensation will be settled in cash in future periods. 

Our revenue is sensitive to changes in commodity prices for crude oil, base
oils and lead. These factors have both a direct and indirect impact on our
business. The direct impact of these commodity prices is reflected in the
revenue received from the sale of products such as crude oil, base oils and
lead. Historically approximately 25% of our revenue is sensitive to direct
impact of commodity prices. The indirect impact is the effect that the
variations of these factors, including natural gas, has on activity levels of
our customers and, therefore, demand for our services. Management actively
manages the indirect impact by strategically geographically balancing mobile
assets to meet demand and shifts in activity levels where necessary. The
indirect impacts of these fluctuations previously discussed are not
quantifiable.

The following table provides management's estimates of fluctuations in key
inputs and prices and the direct impact on revenue from product sales and
SG:

RISK MANAGEMENT

To effectively manage the risk associated with our business and strategic
objectives, we continue to implement an enterprise risk management (ERM)
system. This process provides the framework to understand and prioritize risks
faced by our organization. We use a matrix to identify and analyze the
potential impact, probability and risk mitigation strategy for each key risk.
Risk categories identified include:



--  Strategic - risk to earnings, capital, and strategic objectives arising
    due to changes in the business environment 
--  Operational - risk of loss due to failed internal processes and systems,
    human and technical errors, or external events 
--  Financial - risk associated with financial processes, obligations, and
    assets 
--  People - risk to Business Plan due to recruiting, training, labour
    availability, union relations, and managerial structure 
--  Legal/Regulatory - risk of loss due to compliance with laws, ethical
    standards, disclosure, and contractual obligations 
--  Technology and Data - risk that IT systems are not adequate to support
    strategic and business objectives 



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Such estimates
relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial
statements. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as
transactions are settled in the future. Amounts recorded for amortization,
accretion, future decommissioning obligations, embedded derivatives, deferred
income taxes, valuation of warrants and impairment calculations are based on
estimates. By their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement
uncertainty, and the impact of the difference between the actual and the
estimated costs on the financial statements of future periods could be
material.

Recoverability of Asset Carrying Values

Newalta assesses its property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill
for impairment at the cash generating unit ("CGU") level by comparing the
carrying amount to the recoverable amount of the underlying assets. Judgment
is required in the aggregation of assets into CGU's. The determination of the
recoverable amount involves estimating the CGU's fair value less costs to sell
or its value-in-use, which is based on its discounted future cash flows using
an applicable discount rate. Future cash flows are calculated based on
management's best estimate of future inflation and are discounted based on
management's current assessment of market conditions.

Our determination, as at December 31, 2012, was that there was no impairment. 

Decommissioning Liability 

Newalta recognizes a provision for future remediation and post abandonment
activities in the consolidated financial statements as the net present value
of the estimated future expenditures required to settle the estimated future
obligation at the balance sheet date. The recorded liability increases over
time to its future amount through unwinding of the discount. The measurement
of the decommissioning liability involves the use of estimates and assumptions
including the discount rate, the expected timing of future expenditures and
the amount of future abandonment costs. Decommissioning estimates are reviewed
annually and estimated by management, in consultation with Newalta's engineers
and environmental, health and safety staff, on the basis of current
regulations, costs, technology and industry standards.

Revisions to the estimated amount or timing of the obligations are reflected
prospectively as increases or decreases to the recorded liability and the
related asset. Actual decommissioning expenditures, up to the recorded
liability at the time, are drawn against the liability as the costs are
incurred. Amounts capitalized to the related assets are amortized to income in
line with the depreciation of the underlying asset.

Fair Value Calculation on Share-Based Payments and Stock Appreciation Rights

We have two share-based compensation plans: the 2006 Option Plan and the 2008
Option Plan (collectively the "Option Plans"). Under the Option Plans, we may
grant to directors, officers, employees and consultants of Newalta or any of
its affiliates, options to acquire up to 10% of the issued and outstanding
shares. 

The fair value of share-based payments is calculated using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model, depending on the characteristics of the share-based
payment. There are a number of estimates used in the calculation such as the
future forfeiture rate, expected option life and the future price volatility
of the underlying security which can vary from actual future events. The
factors applied in the calculation are management's best estimates based on
historical information and future forecasts.

We may also grant stock appreciation rights ("SARs") to directors, officers,
employees and consultants of Newalta Corporation or any of its affiliates.
SARs entitle the holder thereof to receive cash from Newalta in an amount
equal to the positive difference between the grant price and the trading price
of our common shares on the exercise date. The grant price is calculated based
on the five-day volume weighted average trading price of our common shares on
the TSX. 

The fair value at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model method with the share-based compensation expense
recognized over the vesting period of the options. There are a number of
estimates used in the calculation such as the future forfeiture rate, expected
option life and the future price volatility of the underlying security which
can vary from actual future events. The factors applied in the calculation are
management's best estimates based on historical information and future
forecasts.

Taxation

The calculation of deferred income taxes is based on a number of assumptions
including estimating the future periods in which temporary differences, tax
losses and other tax credits will reverse. Tax interpretations, regulations
and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject
to change.

Derivative Instruments

The estimated fair value of derivative instruments resulting in financial
assets and liabilities, by their very nature, are subject to measurement
uncertainty.

Leases

Newalta makes judgments in determining whether certain leases, in particular
those with long contractual terms where the lessee is the sole user and
Newalta is the lessor, are operating or finance leases. 

Revenue

Newalta may enter into arrangements with customers which contain multiple
elements in which revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when
earned based on the relative fair value of each unit of accounting as
determined by internal or third party analyses of market-based prices.
Significant judgment is required to allocate contract consideration to each
unit of accounting and determine whether the arrangement is a single unit of
accounting or a multiple element arrangement. Depending upon how such judgment
is exercised, the timing and amount of revenue recognized could differ
significantly.

FUTURE ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGES

As of January 1, 2013 with the exception of IFRS 9, which is expected to be
effective as of January 1, 2015, we are required to adopt the following
standards and amendments as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board ("IASB"), which are not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. 



--  IFRS 10, "Consolidated Financial Statements", which is the result of the
    IASB's project to replace Standing Interpretations Committee 12,
    "Consolidation - Special Purpose Entities" and the consolidation
    requirements of IAS 27, "Consolidated and Separate Financial
    Statements". The new standard eliminates the current risk and rewards
    approach and establishes control as the single basis for determining
    consolidation of an entity. 

--  IFRS 12, "Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities", which outlines the
    required disclosures for interests in subsidiaries and joint
    arrangements. The new disclosures require information that will assist
    financial statement users to evaluate the nature, risks and financial
    effects associated with an entity's interests in subsidiaries and joint
    arrangements. 

--  IFRS 11, "Joint Arrangements", which is the result of the IASB's project
    to replace IAS 31, "Interest in Joint Ventures". The new standard
    redefines joint operations and joint ventures and requires joint
    operations to be proportionately consolidated and joint ventures to be
    equity accounted. Under IAS 31, joint ventures could be proportionately
    consolidated. 

--  IFRS 13, "Fair Value Measurement", which provides a common definition of
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under IFRS
    and enhances the disclosures required for fair value measurements. The
    standard applies where fair value measurements are required and does not
    require new fair value measurements. 

--  IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments", which is the result of the first phase
    of the IASB's project to replace IAS 39, "Financial Instruments:
    Recognition and Measurement". The new standard replaces the current
    multiple classification and measurement models for financial assets and
    liabilities with a single model that has only two classification
    categories: amortized cost and fair value. 



BUSINESS RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Prior to making
any investment decision regarding Newalta, investors should carefully
consider, among other things, the risks described herein (including the risks
and uncertainties listed on the front page of this MD and throughout this
MD) and the risk factors set forth in the most recently filed Annual
Information Form of Newalta which are incorporated by reference herein. For
further information on our risk management framework, please refer to page 43
of our 2011 Annual Report. 

The Annual Information Form is available through the internet on the Canadian
System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval ("SEDAR") which can be
accessed at www.sedar.com. Copies of the Annual Information Form may be
obtained, on request without charge, from Newalta Corporation at 211 - 11th
Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2R 0C6, or by facsimile at (403) 806-7032. 

FINANCIAL AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS

The carrying values of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
the fair value of these financial instruments due to their short term
maturities. Our credit risk from our customers is mitigated by our broad
customer base and diverse product lines. Historically, on an annual basis, our
top 25 customers generate approximately 40% of our total revenue, with 12% of
these customers having a credit rating of A or higher and 52% of these
customers having ratings of BBB or higher. In the normal course of operations,
we are exposed to movements in U.S. dollar exchange rates relative to the
Canadian dollar. The foreign exchange risk arises primarily from U.S. dollar
denominated long-term debt and working capital. We have not entered into any
financial derivatives to manage the risk for the foreign currency exposure as
at December 31, 2012. Management assesses our working capital foreign exchange
exposure regularly and may draw U.S. denominated long-term debt as required,
which serves as a natural hedge, to mitigate our balance sheet exposure.  The
floating interest rate profile of our long-term debt exposes us to interest
rate risk. We do not use hedging instruments to mitigate this risk. The
carrying value of the senior secured long-term debt approximates fair value
due to its floating interest rates. For further information regarding our
financial and other instruments, please refer to Note 17 to the Financial
Statements for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012.

During the year, we recorded an impairment of $1.6 million on our available
for sale financial asset due to a decline in investment value. The change in
value has been reclassified from other comprehensive loss to finance charges
in accordance with IAS 39 requirements. 

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer (collectively the
"Certifying Officers") have evaluated the design and effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2012, and have concluded
that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective. In additional,
the Certifying Officers have evaluated the design and effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, and have
concluded that such internal controls over financial reporting were effective.
There have not been any changes in the internal control over financial
reporting in Q4 of 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. 

(All tabular data in thousands of Canadian Dollars except per share and ratio
data)

NOTE 1. CORPORATE STRUCTURE 

Newalta Corporation (the "Corporation" or "Newalta") was incorporated on
October 29, 2008, pursuant to the laws of the Province of Alberta. Newalta
completed an internal reorganization resulting in a name change from Newalta
Inc. to Newalta Corporation effective January 1, 2010. Newalta provides
cost-effective solutions to industrial customers to improve their
environmental performance with a focus on recycling and recovery of products
from industrial residues. These services are provided both through our network
of facilities across Canada and at our customers' facilities where we mobilize
our equipment and people to process material directly onsite. Our customers
operate in a broad range of industries including oil and gas, petrochemical,
refining, lead, manufacturing and mining industries.

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Statement of Compliance 

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and include the accounts
of Newalta and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and
transactions including revenue and expenses have been eliminated. These
consolidated financial statements are prepared using IFRS accounting policies
which became Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for publicly
accountable enterprises and were adopted by the Corporation for fiscal years
beginning on January 1, 2011. 
These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of
Directors on February 12, 2013.

Basis of Preparation 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical
cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair
value, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is
generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for
assets.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.

a) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and short-term deposits with
maturities of three months or less, when purchased.

b) Inventories 

Inventories are comprised of oil, lead and other recycled products, spare
parts and supplies, and are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable
value. Inventories are valued using the weighted average costing method. Cost
of finished goods includes the laid down cost of materials plus the cost of
direct labour applied to the product and the applicable share of overhead
expense. Cost of other items of inventories comprise the laid down cost. 

c) Property, plant and equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
amortization and impairment. Amortization rates are calculated to amortize the
costs, net of residual value, over the assets' estimated useful lives.
Significant parts of property, plant and equipment that have different
depreciable lives are amortized separately. 

Plant and equipment is principally depreciated at rates of 5-10% of the
declining balance (buildings, site improvements, tanks and mobile equipment)
or from 5-14 years straight line (vehicles, computer hardware and software and
leasehold improvements), depending on the expected life of the asset. Some
equipment is depreciated based on utilization rates. The utilization rate is
determined by dividing the cost of the asset by the estimated future hours of
service. Residual values, up to 20% of original cost, may be established for
buildings, site improvements, and tanks. These residual values are not
depreciated. The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization
methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of
any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. 

Landfill assets represent the costs of landfill available space, including
original acquisition cost, incurred landfill construction and development
costs, including gas collection systems installed during the operating life of
the site, and capitalized landfill closure and post-closure costs. The cost of
landfill assets, together with projected landfill construction and development
costs for permitted capacity, is amortized on a per-unit basis as landfill
space is consumed. Management annually updates landfill capacity estimates,
based on survey information provided by independent engineers, and projected
landfill construction and development costs. The impact on annual amortization
expense of changes in estimated capacity and construction costs is accounted
for prospectively. 

d) Permits and other intangible assets 

Permits and other intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated
amortization and impairment, and consist of certain production processes,
trademarks, permits and agreements which are amortized over the period of the
contractual benefit of 8 to 20 years on a straight line basis. Certain permits
are deemed to have indefinite lives and therefore are not amortized. There are
nominal fees to renew these permits provided that Newalta remains in good
standing with regulatory authorities. 

e) Leases 

Lessee 

All of the Corporation's leases are classified as operating leases and the
leased assets are not recognized in the Corporation's consolidated balance
sheets. Payments made under operating leases are recognized in profit or loss
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic
basis is representative of the time pattern of the user's benefit, including
any rent-free periods. Lease incentives are recognized as an integral part of
the total lease expense, over the term of the lease. 

Leases where the Corporation assumes substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership would be classified as finance leases and the corresponding asset
would be classified as property, plant and equipment and the liability as
obligations under finance lease. 

Leases may include additional payments for real estate taxes, maintenance and
insurance. These amounts are expensed in the period to which they relate.

Lessor 

Assets subject to operating leases are recognized and classified according to
the nature of the asset. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and
arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased
asset and expensed over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.
The depreciation policy for leased assets is consistent with the depreciation
policy for similar owned assets.

f) Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
the net identifiable assets of acquired businesses.

g) Impairments 

Impairments are recorded when the recoverable amount of assets are less than
their carrying amounts. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's
fair value less cost to sell or its value in use. Impairment losses, other
than those relating to goodwill, are evaluated for potential reversals when
events or changes in circumstances warrant such consideration. 

The carrying values of all assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. Additionally, the carrying values of identifiable intangible
assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are tested annually for impairment. 

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash
generating units ("CGU") and management has determined that the appropriate
CGUs for Newalta are: the Western Facilities business unit, Eastern Facilities
business unit, Ville Ste-Catherine ("VSC") business unit, and Onsite division.
Goodwill is allocated to those CGUs that are expected to benefit from the
business combination in which the goodwill arose. 

When the net book value of a CGU is higher than its value in use, the
difference is an impairment loss. An impairment loss is first written off
against any goodwill associated with the CGU with any remaining impairment
loss proportionally allocated to the assets of that CGU. Management determined
that as at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 there were no impairments
of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill.

h) Decommissioning liabilities 

Newalta provides for estimated future decommissioning costs for all its
facilities based on the useful lives of the assets and the long-term
commitments of certain sites. Over this period, Newalta recognizes the
liability for the future decommissioning liabilities associated with property,
plant and equipment. These obligations are initially measured at the
discounted future value of the liability. This value is capitalized as part of
the cost of the related asset and amortized over the asset's useful life. The
balance of the liability is adjusted each period for the unwinding of the
discount, with the associated expense included within finance charges.
Decommissioning costs are estimated by management, in consultation with
Newalta's engineers and environmental, health and safety staff, on the basis
of current regulations, costs, technology and industry standards. Actual
decommissioning costs are charged against the provision as incurred.

i) Revenue recognition 

Revenue is recognized in the period products are delivered or services
provided and when all the following conditions have been satisfied:



--  Newalta has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership
    of the goods to the buyer; 
--  Newalta retains no continuing managerial involvement to the degree
    usually associated with ownership or effective control over the goods
    sold; 
--  the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; 
--  it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the
    transaction will flow to Newalta; and 
--  the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can
    be measured reliably. 



The major sources of revenue relate to the processing of waste material and
the sale of recycled products recovered from the waste. Revenue is recognized
when waste material is received and a risk and reward transferred for the
waste. Revenue from the sale of recycled products is recognized when products
are delivered to customers or pipelines. For construction projects, revenue is
recognized on a percentage of completion basis. For onsite projects and
contracts, processing revenue is recognized on a per-day fee, throughput,
percentage of completion basis, or over the life of the project. 

Newalta offers complete and integrated solutions to meet customer needs. These
solutions may involve the delivery of multiple services and products occurring
at different points in time and/or over different periods in time. As
appropriate, these multiple element arrangements are separated into their
units of accounting based upon their relative fair values when the delivered
item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. If the fair value of
the delivered item is not reliably measurable, then the revenue is allocated
based on the difference between the total arrangement consideration and the
fair value of the undelivered item. 

Revenue from operating leases includes revenue from the service of operating
the assets as well as revenue for the lease of the assets. Revenue for the
service of operating the assets is recognized on a units of production basis
at the average unit price. Revenue attributed to the lease of the assets is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which use
benefit derived from the leased asset is diminished.

j) Research and development 

Research and development costs are incurred in the design, testing and
commercialization of Newalta's products and services. Research costs, other
than capital expenditures, are expensed as incurred. The costs incurred in
developing new technologies are expensed as incurred unless they meet the
criteria under IFRS for deferral and amortization. These costs will be
amortized over the estimated useful life of the product, commencing with
commercial production. In the event that a product program for which costs
have been deferred is modified or cancelled, the Corporation will assess the
recoverability of the deferred costs and if considered unrecoverable, will
expense the costs in the period the assessment is made.

k) Taxation 

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is
recognized in the statements of operations, except to the extent that it
relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income
or directly in equity, respectively. 

Newalta and its wholly-owned subsidiaries follow the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
measured based upon temporary differences between the carrying values of
assets and liabilities and their tax base. Income tax expense is computed
based on the change during the year in the deferred income tax assets and
liabilities. Effects of changes in tax laws and tax rates are recognized when
substantively enacted. 

Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the benefits from tax losses and
deductions with no accounting basis, provided those benefits are probable to
be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based
on the tax laws and rates that are anticipated to apply in the period of
estimated realization.

l) Earnings per share 

Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated
by adding the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year to
the additional shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive
shares had been issued, using the "treasury stock" method.

m) Stock-based incentive plans 

The Corporation's stock-based incentive plans consist of stock options, stock
appreciation rights and share units, and are granted to executives, employees
and non-employee directors. 

Stock options 

Newalta has three stock-based option compensation plans, the 2003 Option Plan
(the "2003 Plan"), the 2006 Option Plan (the "2006 Plan") and the 2008 Option
Plan (the "2008 Plan"). Under the option plans, Newalta may grant to
directors, officers, employees and consultants of Newalta or any of its
affiliates, rights to acquire up to 10% of the issued and outstanding common
shares of the Corporation (the "Shares"). 

The 2003 Plan is an equity-settled plan where the fair value of options at the
date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
method with the stock-based compensation expense recorded as a selling,
general and administrative expense that is recognized over the vesting period
of the options, with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus. When
options are exercised, the proceeds, together with the amount recorded in
contributed surplus, are transferred to shareholders' capital. Forfeitures are
estimated and accounted for at the grant date and adjusted, if necessary, in
subsequent periods. 

The 2006 Plan and the 2008 Plan are both stock-based payment awards that allow
for individuals to settle their options in cash. The fair value at the date of
grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model method with
the stock-based compensation expense recorded as a selling, general and
administrative expense that is recognized over the vesting period of the
options with a corresponding entry to either accrued liabilities or other
liabilities. The fair value is subsequently re-measured at the end of each
reporting period. Forfeitures are estimated and accounted for at the grant
date and adjusted, if necessary, in subsequent periods.

Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") 

SARs entitle the holder thereof to receive cash from Newalta in an amount
equal to the positive difference between the grant price and the trading price
of Newalta's common shares on the exercise date. The grant price is calculated
based on the five-day volume weighted average trading price of Newalta's
Shares on the Toronto stock exchange ("TSX"). SARs generally expire five years
after they have been granted and the vesting period is determined by the Board
of Directors of Newalta. The fair value at the date of grant is calculated
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model method with the stock-based
compensation expense recognized over the vesting period of the options and
recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense with a corresponding
entry to accrued liabilities or other liabilities. The fair value is
subsequently re-measured at the end of each reporting period. Forfeitures are
estimated and accounted for at the grant date and adjusted, if necessary, in
subsequent periods.

Share units 

Newalta has a cash-settled Deferred Share Unit ("DSUs") plan that has been
established for non-executive directors. Under this plan, notional DSUs are
granted annually and vest immediately. The measurement of the compensation
expense and corresponding liability for these awards is based on the fair
value of the award, and is recognized as a stock-based compensation expense
which is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense with a
corresponding increase in accrued liabilities. Dividend equivalent grants, if
any, are recorded as stock-based compensation expense in the period the
dividend is paid. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at
settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized
in earnings. Each DSU entitles the holder to receive a cash payment equal to
the five-day volume weighted average trading price of the shares preceding the
date of redemption. The DSUs may only be redeemed within the period beginning
on the date a holder ceases to be a participant under the plan and ending on
December 31 of the following calendar year. 

A cash-settled Performance Share Unit ("PSUs") incentive plan has been
established for officers and other eligible employees. Under this plan,
notional PSUs may be granted based on corporate performance criterion and vest
after three years. The vested PSUs are automatically paid out in cash upon
vesting at a value determined by the fair market value of the Corporation's
shares at December 31 of the vesting year and based on the number of PSUs held
multiplied by a vesting factor. The vesting factor is based on performance
conditions established by the Board of Directors prior to the date of grant of
the PSUs. The stock-based compensation expense of the PSUs is recorded as a
selling, general and administrative expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period with a corresponding entry to either accrued liabilities or
other liabilities. This estimated value is adjusted each period based on the
period-end trading price of the Corporation's Shares and an estimated vesting
factor with any changes in the fair value of the liability being recognized in
earnings. Dividend equivalent grants, if any, are recorded as stock-based
compensation expense in the period the dividend is paid. 

A Restricted Share Unit ("RSUs") incentive plan has been established for
officers and other eligible employees. Under this plan, notional RSUs are
granted and vest annually over a two-year term or immediately upon termination
of employment by a participant. Upon vesting, RSUs are automatically paid out
in Shares purchased on the open market in a number equal to the number of RSUs
held. The fair value of the RSUs is accrued in accrued liabilities and charged
to earnings as a selling, general and administrative expense upon grant. This
estimated value is adjusted each period based on the period-end trading price
of the Corporation's Shares with the resulting gains or losses included in
earnings. Dividend equivalent grants, if any, are charged to earnings in the
period the dividend is paid.

n) Financial instruments 

Classification 

All financial instruments are classified into one of five categories and are
initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured as noted in the
table below.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Cash and accounts and other receivables are classified as loans and
receivables. Senior secured debt, senior unsecured debentures, bank
indebtedness, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable and
other liabilities are classified as financial liabilities.

Impairment of financial assets 

Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of
impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets are
considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result
of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the
financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been
affected.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Embedded derivatives 

The embedded derivatives are classified at fair value through profit and loss
("FVTPL"). They have been valued using the option adjusted spread ("OAS")
model, which requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions. They are valued at fair value upon initial recognition and at the
end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized through finance
charges in the consolidated statement of operations.

Transaction costs 

Transaction costs incurred with respect to the credit facility are deferred
and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the facility.
The asset is recognized in prepaid expenses and other on the balance sheet
while the amortization is included in financing charges within net income.
Transaction costs associated with other financial liabilities are netted
against the related liability.

o) Functional and presentation currency

Each of the Corporation's subsidiaries is measured using the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the "functional
currency"). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian
dollars, which is the Corporation's functional currency. 

Upon consolidation, the financial statements of the subsidiary that have a
functional currency different from that of the Corporation are translated into
Canadian dollars whereby assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of
exchange at the balance sheet date, revenues and expenses are translated at
average monthly exchange rates (as this is considered a reasonable
approximation of actual rates), and gains and losses in translation are
recognized in the shareholders' equity section as accumulated other
comprehensive income.

Effective December 31, 2011, the functional currency of Newalta's United
States subsidiary changed from the Canadian dollar to the United States dollar
as a result of changes in its economic circumstances.

If the Corporation were to dispose of its entire interest in a foreign
operation, or to lose control, joint control, or significant influence over a
foreign operation, the foreign currency gains or losses accumulated in other
comprehensive income related to the foreign operation would be recognized in
net earnings. If the Corporation were to dispose of part of an interest in a
foreign operation which remains a subsidiary, a proportionate amount of
foreign currency gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income
related to the subsidiary would be reallocated between controlling and
non-controlling interests.

p) Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying asset form part of the cost of that
asset. A qualifying asset is an asset that requires a period of six months or
greater to get ready for its intended use or sale.

q) Critical judgments and estimate uncertainties in applying accounting
policies

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Such estimates
relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial
statements. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as
transactions are settled in the future. Amounts recorded for amortization,
accretion, future decommissioning obligations, deferred income taxes,
valuation of warrants and impairment calculations are based on estimates. By
their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty, and the
impact of the difference between the actual and the estimated costs on the
financial statements of future periods could be material.

The following are the critical judgments that management has made in applying
the Corporation's accounting policies and that have the most significant
effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

Recoverability of asset carrying values 

Newalta assesses its property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill
for impairment at the CGU level by comparing the carrying amount to the
recoverable amount of the underlying assets. Judgment is required in the
aggregation of assets into CGU's. The determination of the recoverable amount
involves estimating the CGU's fair value less costs to sell or its
value-in-use, which is based on its discounted future cash flows using an
applicable discount rate. Future cash flows are calculated based on
management's best estimate of future inflation and are discounted based on
management's current assessment of market conditions.

Decommissioning liability 

Newalta recognizes a provision for future remediation and post abandonment
activities in the consolidated financial statements as the net present value
of the estimated future expenditures required to settle the estimated future
obligation at the balance sheet date. The recorded liability increases over
time to its future amount through the unwinding of the discount. The
measurement of the decommissioning liability involves the use of estimates and
assumptions including the discount rate, the expected timing of future
expenditures and the amount of future abandonment costs. Decommissioning
estimates are reviewed annually and estimated by management, in consultation
with Newalta's engineers and environmental, health and safety staff, on the
basis of current regulations, costs, technology and industry standards.

Revisions to the estimated amount or timing of the obligations are reflected
prospectively as increases or decreases to the recorded liability and the
related asset. Actual decommissioning expenditures, up to the recorded
liability at the time, are drawn against the liability as the costs are
incurred. Amounts capitalized to the related assets are amortized to income in
line with the depreciation of the underlying asset.

Fair value calculation on stock-based payments 

The fair value of stock-based payments is calculated using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model, depending on the characteristics of the stock-based
payment. There are a number of estimates used in the calculation such as the
future forfeiture rate, expected option life and the future price volatility
of the underlying security which can vary from actual future events. The
factors applied in the calculation are management's best estimates based on
historical information and future forecasts.

Taxation 

The calculation of deferred income taxes is based on a number of assumptions
including estimating the future periods in which temporary differences, tax
losses and other tax credits will reverse. Tax interpretations, regulations
and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which the Corporation and its
subsidiaries operate are subject to change.

Derivative instruments 

The estimated fair value of derivative instruments resulting in financial
assets and liabilities, by their very nature, are subject to measurement
uncertainty.

Leases 

Newalta makes judgments in determining whether certain leases, in particular
those with long contractual terms where the lessee is the sole user and
Newalta is the lessor, are operating or finance leases. 

Revenue 

Newalta may enter into arrangements with customers which contain multiple
elements in which revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when
earned based on the relative fair value of each unit of accounting as
determined by internal or third party analyses of market-based prices.
Significant judgment is required to allocate contract consideration to each
unit of accounting and determine whether the arrangement is a single unit of
accounting or a multiple element arrangement. Depending upon how such judgment
is exercised, the timing and amount of revenue recognized could differ
significantly.

r) Recent pronouncements issued

As of January 1, 2013 with the exception of IFRS 9, which is expected to be
effective as of January 1, 2015, Newalta will be required to adopt the
following standards and amendments as issued by the IASB, which are not
expected to have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial
statements.



--  IFRS 10, "Consolidated Financial Statements", which is the result of the
    IASB's project to replace Standing Interpretations Committee 12,
    "Consolidation - Special Purpose Entities" and the consolidation
    requirements of IAS 27, "Consolidated and Separate Financial
    Statements". The new standard eliminates the current risk and rewards
    approach and establishes control as the single basis for determining the
    consolidation of an entity. 

--  IFRS 12, "Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities", which outlines the
    required disclosures for interests in subsidiaries and joint
    arrangements. The new disclosures require information that will assist
    financial statement users to evaluate the nature, risks and financial
    effects associated with an entity's interests in subsidiaries and joint
    arrangements. 

--  IFRS 11, "Joint Arrangements", which is the result of the IASB's project
    to replace IAS 31, "Interest in Joint Ventures". The new standard
    redefines joint operations and joint ventures and requires joint
    operations to be proportionately consolidated and joint ventures to be
    equity accounted. Under IAS 31, joint ventures could be proportionately
    consolidated. 

--  IFRS 13, "Fair Value Measurement", which provides a common definition of
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under IFRS
    and enhances the disclosures required for fair value measurements. The
    standard applies where fair value measurements are required and does not
    require new fair value measurements. 

--  IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments", which is the result of the first phase
    of the IASB's project to replace IAS 39, "Financial Instruments:
    Recognition and Measurement". The new standard replaces the current
    multiple classification and measurement models for financial assets and
    liabilities with a single model that has only two classification
    categories: amortized cost and fair value.

In assessing goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment at
December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, Newalta compared the aggregate
recoverable amount of the assets included in the CGUs to their respective
carrying amounts. The recoverable amount has been determined based on the
value in use of the CGUs using the four year cash flow business plan approved
by management and the Board of Directors that made use of observable markets
for inputs. For periods beyond the four year business plan, cash flows were
extrapolated using growth rates that do not exceed the long-term average in
each CGU. The weighted average growth rate reflects a nominal inflationary
rate as required by IFRS that is calculated over the remaining useful life of
each CGU. There was no impairment as at December 31, 2012 and December 31,
2011. 

Key assumptions included the following:

In all CGUs, reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would not cause
the recoverable amount of goodwill to fall below the carrying value. 

NOTE 6. OTHER ASSETS 

a) Other assets 

BioteQ Environmental Technologies Inc. ("BioteQ") 

During the first quarter of 2010, Newalta acquired 3,636,364 units, at a price
of $1.10 per share from the treasury of BioteQ for cash consideration of $4
million. Each unit purchased included a common share and a warrant to acquire
an additional common share of BioteQ at $1.375 during the first year, and
$1.65 thereafter. The warrants expire after 5 years. The fair value of the
warrants is estimated using a binomial methodology and the common shares based
on a publicly available quoted price. 

The common shares are classified as available-for-sale and are marked to
market at each period end with changes in fair value recorded in other
comprehensive income. As at December 31, 2012 an unrealized loss of $0.2
million (net of tax of nil) was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income. 

During 2012 an impairment test was performed for Newalta's investment in
BioteQ. For the year ended December 31, 2012, Newalta recorded an impairment
on common shares of $1.6 million due to a decline in investment value. The
change in value has been reclassified from other comprehensive loss to finance
charges in accordance with IAS 39 requirements. 

The warrants are classified as fair value through profit and loss ("FVTPL")
and are revalued at each period end with the change in fair value recognized
in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Corporation recorded an
unrealized loss of $0.1 million (year ended December 31, 2011 - unrealized
loss of $1.2 million) which is included in finance charges. As at December 31,
2012, the fair value was calculated using the following assumptions: an
expected volatility of 55.2% (December 31, 2011 - 81.3%), a risk-free interest
rate of 1.1% (December 31, 2011 - 1.2%) and no expected dividend (December 31,
2011 - no expected dividend). 

b) Other long-term assets consist of the following:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



TerraAqua Resource Management LLC 

During the third quarter of 2011, Newalta acquired a 50% interest in TARM in
exchange for cash consideration of $5.8 million. This joint venture is
included within other long-term assets. Newalta's interest in TARM is
accounted for under the equity method and these consolidated financial
statements include Newalta's share of net earnings from the date that joint
control commenced, based on the present 50% ownership interest in TARM.
Newalta's share of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2012, as well as
the assets and liabilities as at December 31, 2012, are not significant.

(1) Issue costs related to the facility have been included in prepaid       
    expenses and other in 2012 and will be amortized over the extended      
    credit facility term.                                                   



On July 12, 2012, Newalta amended and extended its revolving Credit Facility
("Credit Facility"). The maturity of this Credit Facility is July 12, 2015.
The principal borrowing amount was increased from $200 million to $225
million, the maximum Total Debt to EBITDA has been increased from 3.5:1 to
4:1, and the lending syndicate increased from five to six institutions. The
Credit Facility is available to fund growth capital expenditures and for
general corporate business purposes as well as to provide letters of credit to
third parties for financial security up to a maximum amount of $60 million.
Newalta may, at its option, request an extension of the credit facility on an
annual basis. If no request to extend the Credit Facility is made by Newalta,
the entire amount of the outstanding indebtedness would be due in full on July
12, 2015. The facility also requires Newalta to be in compliance with certain
covenants. At December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, Newalta was in
compliance with all covenants.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, credit facility fees of $1.5 million
(year ended December 31, 2011 - nil) were incurred in connection with the
amending and extending of the revolving credit facility. These fees have been
recorded in prepaid expenses and other and will be amortized over the extended
credit facility term.

NOTE 8. SENIOR UNSECURED DEBENTURES 

The trust indenture under which the senior unsecured debentures have been
issued requires Newalta to be in compliance with certain covenants as at
December 31 of each year. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, Newalta
was in compliance with all covenants.

interest is payable in equal instalments semi-annually in arrears on May 23
and November 23 in each year, which commenced on May 23, 2011. The series 1
debentures are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all other
existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to any subordinated debt
that may be issued by Newalta or any of its subsidiaries. The series 1
debentures are effectively subordinated to all secured debt to the extent of
collateral on such debt. 

Prior to November 23, 2013, Newalta may on one or more occasions: 



--  Redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the series 1
    debentures, with the net cash proceeds of one or more public equity
    offerings at a redemption price equal to 107.625% of the principal
    amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. 
--  Redeem the series 1 debentures, in whole or in part, at a redemption
    price which is equal to the greater of (a) the Canada Yield Price (as
    defined in the trust indenture) and (b) 101% of the aggregate principal
    amount of series 1 debentures redeemed, plus, in each case, accrued and
    unpaid interest to the redemption date. 



After November 23, 2013, the series 1 debentures are redeemable at the option
of Newalta, in whole or in part, at redemption prices expressed as percentages
of the principal amount, plus in each case accrued interest to the redemption
date, if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on November 23 of
the years as follows: Year 2013 - 103.813%; Year 2014 - 102.542%; Year 2015 -
101.906%; Year 2016 and thereafter - 100%. 

If a change of control occurs, Newalta will be required to offer to purchase
all or a portion of each debenture holder's series 1 debentures, at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the series 1 debentures
offered for repurchase plus accrued interest to the date of purchase.

Series 2 

On November 14, 2011, Newalta issued $125.0 million of 7.75% series 2 senior
unsecured debentures ("series 2"). The series 2 debentures mature on November

interest is payable in equal instalments semi-annually in arrears on May 14
and November 14 in each year, commencing on May 14, 2012. The series 2
debentures are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all other
existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to any subordinated debt
that may be issued by Newalta or any of its subsidiaries. The series 2
debentures are effectively subordinated to all secured debt to the extent of
collateral on such debt. 

Prior to November 14, 2015, Newalta may on one or more occasions: 



--  Redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the series 2

Non-capital loss carry forwards relating to Canadian operations total $124.5
million and relating to our U.S. operations total $17.7 million. The losses
relating to Canadian operations will begin expiring in 2026 and losses
relating to U.S. operations will begin expiring in 2029.

The income tax expense differs from the amount computed by applying Canadian
statutory rates to operating income for the following reasons:

NOTE 11. RECONCILIATION OF DECOMMISSIONING LIABILITY 

The total future decommissioning liability was estimated by management based
on the anticipated costs to abandon and reclaim facilities and wells, and the
projected timing of these expenditures. The net present value of this amount,
$78.9 million (December 31, 2011 - $77.8 million) has been accrued on the
consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2012. The total estimated future
cost for decommissioning liability at December 31, 2012, was $402.0 million
over an expected range to 200 years. During the second quarter, future costs
were reduced largely due to the obligation at Stoney Creek landfill decreasing
from 300 to 200 years. Newalta used the Bank of Canada's long term bond rate
of 2.37% as at December 31, 2012 (December 31, 2011 - 2.5%) and an inflation
rate of 2% (December 31, 2011 - 2%) to calculate the present value of the
decommissioning liability with the exception of Stoney Creek landfill for
which we used a discount rate of 6% (December 31, 2011 - 6%). The
reconciliation of estimated and actual expenditures for the period is provided
below:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Excludes transaction costs                                              



The objectives in managing the capital structure are to:



--  Align our debt structure with our asset structure; 
--  Utilize an appropriate amount of leverage to maximize return on
    Shareholders' equity; and 
--  Provide for borrowing capacity and financial flexibility to support
    Newalta's operations. 



Management and the Board of Directors review and assess Newalta's capital
structure and dividend policy at least at each regularly scheduled board
meeting which are held at a minimum four times annually. The financial
strategy may be adjusted based on the current outlook of the underlying
business, the capital requirements to fund growth initiatives and the state of
the debt and equity capital markets. In order to maintain or adjust the
capital structure, Newalta may:



--  Issue shares from treasury; 
--  Issue new debt securities; 
--  Cause the return of letters of credit with no additional financial
    security requirements; 
--  Replace outstanding letters of credit with bonds or other types of
    financial security; 
--  Amend, revise, renew or extend the terms of its then existing long-term
    debt facilities; 
--  Draw on existing credit facility and/or enter into new agreements
    establishing new credit facilities; 
--  Adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders; and/or 
--  Sell idle, redundant or non-core assets. 



Management monitors the capital structure based on covenants required pursuant
to the Credit Facility.

    covenants under our credit facility.                                    
(2) Senior secured debt means the total debt less the senior unsecured

    the deduction of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and    
    non-cash items (such as non-cash stock-based compensation and gains or  
    losses on asset dispositions). Additionally, EBITDA is normalized for   
    any acquisitions or dispositions as if they had occurred at the

issued also contains certain annual restrictions and covenants that, subject
to certain exceptions, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay

NOTE 14. EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per share calculations for the year ended December 31, 2012 and
2011 were based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the
respective years. Diluted earnings per share include the potential dilution of
outstanding options under incentive plans to acquire shares. 

The calculation of diluted earnings per share does not include anti-dilutive
options. These options would not be exercised during the period because their
exercise price is higher than the average market price for the period. The
inclusion of these options would cause the diluted earnings per share to be
overstated. The number of excluded options for the year ended December 31,
2012 was 680,000 (1,019,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011).

NOTE 17. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities 

Newalta's financial instruments include cash, bank indebtedness, accounts and
other receivables, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
dividends payable, senior secured debt and senior unsecured debentures. The
fair values of Newalta's financial instruments that are included in the
consolidated balance sheets, with the exception of the debentures, approximate
their recorded amount due to the short-term nature of those instruments for
cash, bank indebtedness, accounts and other receivable, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, dividends payable, senior secured debt and the note
receivable, due to the floating nature of the interest rate applicable to
these instruments. The fair values incorporate an assessment of credit risk.
The carrying values of Newalta's financial instruments at December 31, 2012
are as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Embedded Derivatives 

The senior unsecured debentures have early redemption features at values based
on percentages of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Due
to the redemption rates being fixed, an embedded derivative exists when
compared to current market rates. Newalta estimates the fair value of the
embedded derivatives using a valuation model that considers the current bond
prices and spreads associated with the senior unsecured debentures. Newalta
has recognized gains of $1.3 million and $13.4 million for the three months
and year ended December 31, 2012, respectively (for the three months and year
ended December 31, 2011 - nil) and has determined the fair value of the
embedded derivative for the senior unsecured debentures to be $14.1 million as
at December 31, 2012. A corresponding embedded derivative asset was included
within other long-term assets on the balance sheet. Subsequent changes in fair
value will be included in finance charges on the consolidated statements of
operations.

Newalta categorizes its financial instruments carried at fair value into one
of three different levels, depending on the significance of inputs employed in
their measurement. 

Level 1 includes assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on
unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active
markets that are accessible at the measurement date. An active market for an
asset or liability is considered to be a market where transactions occur with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing
basis. Newalta's cash, senior unsecured debentures and senior secured debt are
classified as level 1 financial instruments. 

Level 2 includes valuations determined using directly or indirectly observable
inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1. Financial instruments
in this category are valued using models or other industry standard valuation
techniques derived from observable market data. Such valuation techniques
include inputs such as quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors
and broker quotes that can be observed or corroborated in the market for the
entire duration of the derivative instrument. Instruments valued using Level 2
inputs include the embedded derivative within the senior unsecured debentures.


Level 3 includes valuations based on inputs which are less observable,
unavailable or where the observable data does not support a significant
portion of the instruments' fair value. Generally, Level 3 valuations are
longer dated transactions, occur in less active markets, occur at locations
where pricing information is not available or have no binding broker quote to
support Level 2 classification. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, Newalta did not
have any significant Level 3 assets or liabilities. 

Credit risk and economic dependence 

Newalta is subject to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable balances.
The customer base is large and diverse, and one customer balance represented
10% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2012, (no single customer was
greater than 10% as at December 31, 2011). This account receivable is
recognized within the Onsite segment. Newalta views the credit risks on these
amounts as normal for the industry. Credit risk is minimized by Newalta's
broad customer base and diverse product lines, and is mitigated by the ongoing
assessment of the credit worthiness of its customers as well as monitoring the
amount and age of balances outstanding. Newalta's assessment of credit risk
has remained unchanged from the prior year. 

Revenue from Newalta's largest customer represented 10% of revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2012 (13% for the year ended December 31, 2011). This
revenue is recognized within the Facilities segment. No other customer's
revenue exceeded 10% for the period presented. 

Based on the nature of operations, established collection history and industry
norms, receivables are not considered past due until 90 days after invoice
date, although standard payment terms require payment within 30 to 90 days.
Depending on the nature of the service and/or product, customers may be
provided with extended payment terms while Newalta gathers certain processing
or disposal data. Included in the Corporation's trade receivable balance, are
receivables totalling $5.0 million (December 31, 2011 - $2.8 million), which
are considered to be outstanding beyond normal repayment terms at December 31,
2012. A provision of $0.5 million (December 31, 2011 - $0.3 million) has been
established as an allowance for doubtful accounts. No additional provision has
been made as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the
amounts are still considered collectible. Newalta does not hold any collateral
over these balances but may hold credit insurance for specific non-domestic
customer accounts. Total accounts receivable of $150.3 million is comprised of
$106.8 million of trade receivables, accrued receivables of $27.6 million and
other receivables of $15.9 million.

To determine the recoverability of a trade receivable, management analyzes
accounts receivable, first identifying customer groups that represent minimal
risk (large oil and gas and other low risk large companies, governments and
municipalities). Impairment of the remaining accounts is determined by
identifying specific accounts that are at risk, and then by applying a formula
based on aging to the remaining amounts receivable. All amounts identified as
at risk are provided for in an allowance for doubtful accounts. The changes in
this account for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:



Allowance for doubtful accounts         December 31, 2012  December 31, 2011

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Liquidity risk 

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of
Directors of Newalta, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management
framework for the management of the Corporation's short, medium and long-term
funding and liquidity management requirements. Management mitigates liquidity
risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and other borrowing
facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Newalta's
assessment of liquidity risk has remained unchanged from the prior year.

Interest rate risk 

Newalta is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that its credit
facility has a variable interest rate. Management does not enter into any
derivative contracts to manage the exposure to variable interest rates. The
senior unsecured debentures have fixed interest rates until their maturity
dates, at which point, any remaining amounts owing under these debentures will
need to be repaid or refinanced. Newalta's assessment of interest rate risk
has remained unchanged from the prior year. The table below provides an
interest rate sensitivity analysis to net earnings as at period end:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Market risk 

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of Newalta's
financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Newalta is exposed to foreign exchange market risk. Foreign exchange risk
refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment, recognized asset
or liability will fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The risk arises primarily from U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt and
working capital. As at December 31, 2012, Newalta had $11.8 million in net
working capital and nil in long-term debt both denominated in U.S. dollars.
Management has not entered into any financial derivatives to manage the risk
for the foreign currency exposure as at December 31, 2012. Newalta's
assessment of market risk has remained unchanged from the prior year. 

The table below provides a foreign currency sensitivity analysis to net
earnings on long-term debt and working capital outstanding as at period end:

NOTE 21. SEGMENTED INFORMATION 

Onsite and Facilities constitute our two reportable segments. The reportable
segments are distinct strategic business units whose operating results are
regularly reviewed by the Corporation's executive officers in order to assess
financial performance and make resource allocation decisions. The reportable
segments have separate operating management and operate in distinct
competitive and regulatory environments. The Facilities segment includes the
processing of industrial and oilfield-generated wastes including collection,
treatment, and disposal; clean oil terminalling; custom treating; the sale of
recovered crude oil for our account; oil recycling; and lead battery
recycling. The Onsite segment involves the mobilization of equipment and staff
to process waste at our customer sites, including the processing of
oilfield-generated wastes, the sale of recovered crude oil; industrial
cleaning; site remediation; dredging and dewatering; and drill site processing
including solids control and drill cuttings management.

Investigation Board Chairman Rafael Moure-Eraso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Continuing to troubleshoot the problem and having
firefighters remove insulation searching for a leak - while
flammable hydrocarbons were flowing through the leaking piping -
was inconsistent with good safety practice," he said in the
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its technical report on the damaged, 8-inch pipe at the
heart of the fire, the CSB found a "deformation" in the area of
likely rupture consistent with force applied on the outside of
the pipe, "possibly from a fire pike."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it was taking corrective actions to
strengthen its management oversight, process safety, mechanical
integrity, and leak response, while adding that its own
investigation of the fire was nearly complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we do not agree with some of the characterizations in
the CSB news release, we are committed to discussing the
findings from our investigation and our corrective actions with
the investigating agencies," Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crude unit at the 245,000 barrel-per-day refinery is
still expected to restart by the end of March, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has not said how limited the refinery's output is,
but the impact was clear with the company's average
fourth-quarter U.S. refining input down 226,000 bpd from the
second quarter - the last period when Richmond was fully running
throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the California Division of Occupational Safety
and Health (Cal/OSHA) imposed a record fine of nearly $1 million
on Chevron and found that the second-largest U.S. oil company
had not complied with state safety standards and put workers and
the public at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Richmond and the entire East Bay need assurances that our
refineries will be operated safely," Nancy Skinner, a local
state assembly member, said in a statement. "Monetary penalties
alone may not suffice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSB does not have law enforcement or regulatory
authority. It is authorized by Congress to investigate chemical
accidents, determining not only the root causes of fires and
explosions, but also recommending changes in industry practices
and regulatory enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report out on Wednesday was part of a cooperative effort
between the CSB, Cal/OSHA, the United Steelworkers and Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cal/OSHA Chief Ellen Widess said the report confirmed what
Chevron already knew about the pipe being corroded and requiring
replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron's own metallurgists and pipe inspectors reached the
same conclusion and recommended as far back as 2002 that Chevron
take action to protect its workers, the community and the
environment by replacing the pipe that finally ruptured in
2012," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSB found that 19 Chevron employees were initially
caught in a vapor cloud after the initial hydrocarbon release,
but 18 escaped before the fire started and one escaped without
injury after the ignition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident resulted in six minor injuries, while more than
15,000 residents in the surrounding area sought treatment at
medical facilities as a result, the CSB noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moure-Eraso said he hoped the report's findings received
widespread attention throughout the petrochemical industry as a
precaution to all refiners to watch out for potential corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSB identified the corrosion of the pipe wall last
September, when it said that Chevron had been concerned about
corrosion in the section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 13 (IFR) - Blue-chip credit Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOF) has
always had ambitious pricing goals, but bankers are wondering
whether it can really achieve its cheap target levels on a new
international bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Latin American company, the largest Coca-Cola
bottler in the world by sales, has been heard discussing a level
of 80 basis points (bp) over Treasuries for a new 10-year issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while rates are super low at the moment, allowing
companies to issue debt incredibly cheaply, pricing a bond less
than 100bp over Treasuries might be too much to expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers say the price will ultimately be largely determined
by how the company's existing bonds are faring in the secondary
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its outstanding 2020 bonds were priced in early 2010 at 60bp
tighter than the Mexican government's bonds - at the time one of
the smallest coupons ever seen out of Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 4.625% printed at 99.491 to yield 4.689%, or 105bp over
Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that bond is now trading wide or flat to peers with
lower credit ratings than KOF's A2/A-/A, and has sold off since
initial discussions began in December about a new debt issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spreads have climbed from a recent low of 119bp on
October 18 to around 150bp this week on a G-spread basis,
according to one banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, many in the market say the goal of 80bp for
the new issue may be just a little too bold - although 100bp
seems well within reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of the day, investors will price to the
secondary (market)," one banker said. "Unless the 2020s rally to
65bp over, a new 10-year at 80bp will be ambitious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIGHTENING IN A BOTTLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KOF is roadshowing its new deal in the United States this
week, according to one account, winding up on Thursday in
Atlanta and Milwaukee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is believed to be considering a broad range of
tenors from five to 30 years for the new deal, which is being
led by Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing the deal inside of comparable US bonds, rather than
any in Mexico, is thought to be the goal this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KOF last year bought a majority stake in Coca-Cola Bottling
Philippines for about US$689m, making it a truly global player
rather than simply a Mexican or Latin American name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By explaining its story in roadshows to investors, some say,
KOF will be able to tighten the pricing on the new issue
somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They could reposition this curve," said a debt capital
markets banker. "I could see them coming at 100bp."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the current G-spread of around 150bp, the KOF 2020s
compare to Dr. Pepper's 2022s (Baa1/BBB), which are being quoted
at around 92bp; Heineken's 2023s (Baa1), quoted at 110bp; and
InBev's 2023s at 84bp over Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile KOF's parent Coca-Cola has 2021s trading
at a G-spread of 66bp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLAVOR OF SUCCESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its favor for reaching the ambitious pricing target, KOF
has its underlying credit strength, the illiquidity of the
existing bonds and the relatively high price of the 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these factors could be leveraged to encourage
investors to participate, if KOF indeed does decide to raise the
 full US$1bn-US$1.25bn it is heard seeking and establish a
liquid benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at approximately 111 dollars, the price on the KOF 2020s
is not that high - and being able to come 70bp inside the
current 150bp G-spread seems unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 10-year US Treasuries at around 1.975% on Tuesday,
an 80bp finish would equate to a yield of 2.775% - an incredibly
cheap price for any new KOF debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some bankers say that the secondary levels on the existing
2020s don't reflect KOF's underlying credit quality. But, as one
put it, the secondary pricing is real - and there for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't get 70bp of arbitrage in single A names," the
banker said. "The Street would keep putting in higher and higher
prices until they got paper."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing for any deal remains unclear. Bankers are wondering
whether KOF will wait for the release of its fourth-quarter
earnings before moving forward with what is expected to be an
SEC-registered bond. There has also been talk that the borrower
might want to meet with Asian investors, given its recent
acquisition in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other related fixed-income quotations, stories and

investigators on Wednesday criticized Chevron's response to a
leak at its Richmond refinery crude unit that caused a huge fire
last August that put many lives at risk and has severely limited
the output of the San Francisco Bay plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a technical report on the damaged 8-inch pipe at the
heart of the fire, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard
Investigation Board (CSB) found a "deformation" in the area of
likely rupture initiation consistent with mechanical force
applied on the outside of the pipe, "possibly from a fire pike."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the day of the accident, Chevron should have shut down

Experienced digital media leader joins the rapidly growing content advertising
company
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
OneSpot - the content advertising company that marries content marketing with
the power, data intelligence, and infrastructure of online advertising - has
named as CEO Steve Sachs, former Executive Vice President, Consumer Marketing
and Sales at the Time Inc. division of Time Warner. OneSpot Founder Matt Cohen
will continue as President. 

"Steve Sachs is an industry-leading marketing visionary with extensive
experience at the intersection of digital media, content, and marketing," said
Matt Cohen, OneSpot Founder and President. "He has an impressive track record of
new business leadership, including launching the Real Simple brand and as a
member of the Board of Directors at Next Issue Media, the digital content joint
venture owned by Time Warner and four other major media companies. His love of
creating new products that help consumers and advertisers is a perfect fit for
OneSpot and its solution that blends content, data, and advertising to create
real value for companies." 

Sachs brings 19 years` experience in digital marketing, media, advertising, and
custom content to OneSpot. He has served in a number of key executive positions
at Time Inc. including: leading consumer digital strategy and distribution and
revenue for 20 U.S. media brands; President of the Time Inc. Lifestyle Group,
which includes Real Simple, Cooking Light, Southern Living, MyRecipes; and as
President of Real Simple, where he led the launch of the Real Simple brand and
the series Real Simple. Real Life. on TLC, as well as Real Simple-branded
products sold at Target and Bed Bath and Beyond. Under Sachs` leadership, Real
Simple was recognized as among the most innovative, successful media brands by
Advertising Age, Adweek, and others. 

"Content is emerging as a core component of advertising, marketing, sales, and
other important business functions. $16 billion will be invested in content
creation this year and that will continue to increase," said Steve Sachs, CEO,
OneSpot. 

"However, the hardest problem with content is getting the right audiences to see
it," Sachs continued. "OneSpot empowers businesses to transform their owned or
earned digital content into high-performing advertising, and then use data
intelligence, segmentation, and re-targeting to align their content strategy
with business goals. 

"The result reaches the right prospects at the right time in the purchase
cycle," Sachs said. "OneSpot`s content advertising approach increases response
rates 2 to 50 times over traditional advertising and transforms earned media
into a channel for companies to identify prospects." 

Sachs' passion for helping innovative companies reach audiences through
marketing and content extends beyond Fortune 500 companies. Sachs has served as
a mentor with startup accelerators TechStars New York and First Growth Venture
Network, and recently joined the Board of Directors of The Texas Tribune, a
nonpartisan, nonprofit media organization that promotes civic engagement and
discourse on public policy, politics, government, and other matters of statewide
concern. While in New York, he served on the Board of Trustees of Brooklyn
Academy of Music (BAM), and chaired the marketing committee, advising on
distribution strategy of BAM's content to raise awareness, grow audience, and
deepen loyalty. 

Sachs holds a BS in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA
from Stanford University.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 13 (Reuters) - MF Global Holdings Ltd amended
its liquidation plan to take into account demands from creditor
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co but the trustee overseeing the
company's bankruptcy warned that the changes could expose
JPMorgan to a legal attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan arranged for a $1.2 billion liquidity facility for
MF Global Holdings, led by former New Jersey Governor and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc chief Jon Corzine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $928 million of the facility was transferred
immediately to a unit of the company, MF Global Finance, in the
days leading up to the bankruptcy of MF Global in October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the finance unit owes money to both the holding
company and the lenders, including JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creditors of the finance unit could recover up to 47.7
percent of their money if the double liability were voided,
according to a filing by JPMorgan, which was also the agent for
the liquidity facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is more than the maximum 33.6 percent those creditors
would receive under a plan proposed earlier this month by Silver
Point Capital, Knighthead Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in
conjunction with trustee Louis Freeh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said the double liability could be voided or
subordinated to other debts, which would enable the trustee to
pay more money to the finance unit's creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MF Global included JPMorgan's information in its revised
disclosure statement on Tuesday, which describes the liquidation
plan that creditors must vote to approve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the revised disclosure statement also includes a warning
to JPMorgan. Knighthead Capital said that some of the legal
strategies that could be used to attack the double liability
"apply with equal force to disallow or subordinate JPMorgan's
own claim against (the finance unit)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knighthead Capital said that was because the money
transferred by the holding company to the finance unit ended up
enabling payments to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hearing on the disclosure statement is set for Thursday,
with a final confirmation hearing set for April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corzine resigned shortly after the firm declared bankruptcy
related to its exposure to risky European sovereign debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case became a political firestorm after federal
investigators discovered that money in customer trading funds
had gone missing in the collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy is In re MF Global Holdings Ltd, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-15059.&lt;/p&gt;

* Companies to add seven Arctic license areas covering approximately 600,000
square kilometers (150 million acres) in the Chukchi, Laptev and Kara seas 
* Rosneft is provided the option to acquire a 25 percent interest in Point
Thomson natural gas and condensate project in Alaska operated by ExxonMobil 
* Companies to jointly study potential for LNG project in Russian Far East

MOSCOW--(Business Wire)--
Rosneft and ExxonMobil have agreed to expand their cooperation under their 2011
Strategic Cooperation Agreement to include an additional approximately 600,000
square kilometers (150 million acres) of exploration acreage in the Russian
Arctic and potential participation by Rosneft (or its affiliate) in the Point
Thomson project in Alaska. They have also agreed to conduct a joint study on a
potential LNG project in the Russian Far East. 

The agreements, which include plans to explore seven new blocks in the Chukchi
Sea, Laptev Sea and Kara Sea, were signed by Igor Sechin, president of Rosneft,
and Stephen Greenlee, president of ExxonMobil Exploration Company, in the
presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

The license blocks include Severo-Vrangelevsky-1, Severo-Vrangelevsky-2 and
Yuzhno-Chukotsky blocks in Chukchi Sea, Ust` Oleneksky, Ust` Lensky and
Anisinsko Novosibirsky blocks in Laptev Sea and Severo Karsky block in Kara Sea,
which are among the most promising and least explored offshore areas globally. 

A separate Heads of Agreement was signed providing Rosneft (or its affiliate) an
opportunity to acquire a 25 percent interest in the Point Thomson Unit, which
covers development of a remote natural gas and condensate field on Alaska`s
North Slope. It is estimated that Point Thomson contains approximately 25
percent of the known gas resource base in Alaska`s North Slope. 

Rosneft and ExxonMobil also executed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly
study the economic viability of an LNG development in the Russian Far East,
including the possible construction of an LNG facility. The companies will form
a joint working group, which is expected to commence work in the coming weeks to
study the viability of an LNG project using available natural gas resources. 

Commenting on the agreements signed, Igor Sechin said, "The agreements signed
today bring the already unprecedented scale of the Rosneft and ExxonMobil
partnership up to a completely new level. The acreage in the Russian Arctic
subject to geological exploration and subsequent development increased nearly
six-fold. That means the enormous resource potential of Russian Arctic offshore
fields will be explored and developed in the most efficient manner with the
application of cutting-edge technologies and expertise of our strategic partner,
ExxonMobil, and using state-of-the-art environmental protection systems.
Participation in the Point Thomson project will increase Rosneft`s access to the
latest gas and condensate field development technologies used in harsh climatic
conditions." 

Stephen Greenlee said the agreements build on the ongoing successful cooperation
between the companies. "This expansion is an illustration of the strength of the
partnership that exists between ExxonMobil and Rosneft," said Greenlee. "We look
forward to working together on these new projects." 

The companies are committed to using global best practices and state-of-the-art
safety and environmental protection systems for the Arctic operations. The work
will be supported by the recently signed Declaration on the Russian Arctic Shelf
Environmental protection. Also, ExxonMobil and Rosneft will work together
through an Arctic Research Center to provide a full range of research and design
services to support their cooperation on Arctic projects. 

Rosneft and ExxonMobil continue to implement a program of staff exchanges of
technical and management employees to help strengthen relationships between the
companies.

Second-generation MR-Conditional Pacemaker Combines Advanced Pacing Technology with MRI Access

MINNEAPOLIS - February 13, 2013 - Showcasing its leadership position in pacing technologies,
Medtronic, Inc. (NYSE: MDT), today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval
and U.S. launch of its Advisa DR MRI(TM) SureScan(R)  pacing system. The Advisa MRI system is
Medtronic's second-generation MR-Conditional pacemaker and is the first system to combine the most
advanced pacing technology with proven MRI access.

MRI is the standard of care in soft tissue imaging, providing information not seen with X-ray,
ultrasound or CT scans, and is critical for early detection, diagnosis and treatment. Advisa MRI
was specifically tested and approved for use as labeled with MRI scanners in the U.S. Of the 156
patients scanned in the Advisa MRI Clinical Trial, none showed any MRI-related complications.  The
new system includes an Advisa MRI device and two CapSureFix MRI(TM) SureScan(R) leads, which must
be used together.

"Your physician can implant a pacemaker with advanced options that will allow for broad access to
MRI scanning," said Dr. J. Rod Gimbel of Cardiology Associates of East Tennessee in Knoxville,
Tenn. "MRI is just so very important and traditional pacemakers not FDA approved for MRI scanning
often prevent the patient from having an MRI when they need it. With more than 85 percent of
pacemaker patients being at least 65 years old and having multiple comorbidities for which MRI may
be needed, it's key that physicians and patients have a pacing system that allows MRI imaging as a
diagnostic procedure."

The first SureScan pacemaker system was introduced in Europe in 2008 and its use in the MRI
environment is supported by clinical studies and extensive computer modeling, as well as
real-world data. To date, more than 100,000 Medtronic SureScan devices have been sold
worldwide;[1] #_edn1  and, in the U.S., it is estimated that more than 10 percent of patients with
SureScan pacing systems have received MRIs.[2] #_edn2  These patients received Medtronic's
first-generation Revo MRI(R) SureScan(R) pacing system, which was the only FDA approved (February
2011) MR-Conditional pacemaker in the U.S. before the Advisa MRI system.

Until the availability of Medtronic's SureScan pacing systems, patients with pacemakers in the
U.S. have been contraindicated from receiving MRI scans because of potential interactions between
the MRI and device function. According to published literature, up to 75 percent of patients
worldwide with implanted cardiac devices are expected to need an MRI scan during the lifetime of
their devices.[3] #_edn3 

Advisa MRI - Medtronic's MRI Pacing System with Innovative Technology
Medtronic's Advisa MRI pacing system provides physicians with innovative technology that will
benefit their patients, including the MVP(R) (Managed Ventricular Pacing) algorithm, which is
proven to reduce unnecessary ventricular pacing.[4] #_edn4  Additional Advisa features include:

*[5]Complete automaticity with Ventricular and Atrial Capture Management(TM) (VCM and ACM) to
eliminate manual threshold checks and extend longevity of the device by up to one year.
*(R)Diagnostics, such as the Cardiac Compass Report, and AF management tools that assist
physicians in the early detection and treatment of atrial fibrillation.
*(R)Remote monitoring via Medtronic's CareLink Network, which transmits comprehensive arrhythmia
and diagnostic device data to a physician's clinic. 
*[6][7], Rate Drop Response that identifies abrupt cardiac slowing and responds by pacing the
heart at an elevated rate, which may reduce the frequency of syncope (fainting) in patients with
apparent cardio-inhibitory vasovagal syncope.
*Highupper tracking rate to provide pacing support at higher heart rates for active and younger
patients.

This system is the latest addition to a growing number of Medtronic devices which are designed for
MRI access including the SynchroMed(R) II programmable drug infusion system available worldwide,
and the SureScan(R) neurostimulation systems for the management of chronic pain which are
available in Europe. In addition, SureScan(R) pacing systems - including Advisa MRI - are
available worldwide.

In collaboration with leading clinicians, researchers and scientists worldwide, Medtronic offers
the broadest range of innovative medical technology for the interventional and surgical treatment
of cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias. The company strives to offer products and
services that deliver clinical and economic value to healthcare consumers and providers around the
world.

including Nokia Growth Partners. The undisclosed amount will be used to
begin manufacturing the company's QuantumFilm image sensors, which are
currently being evaluated by phone manufacturers. Devices incorporating
the technology are expected to ship in Q2 2014. GGV and Nokia Growth
Partners join InVisage's existing investors RockPort Capital, InterWest
Partners, Intel Capital and OnPoint Technologies. 

    "InVisage is poised to make a tremendous impact on consumer devices and
end users with its QuantumFilm image sensors," said Thomas Ng, founding
partner, GGV Capital. "Our investment focus and expertise are helping
companies during this crucial expansion stage, and we look forward to
working with the InVisage team as they scale their technology for the
demands of the global mobile-device market."

    InVisage QuantumFilm is the world's most light-sensitive image sensor for
smartphones, capable of producing gorgeous, high-quality photos in
virtually any lighting condition. InVisage has transformed the image
sensor by adding a thin layer of quantum dot film to produce highly
sensitive image sensors that can be mass-produced using standard CMOS
processes. Compared to current camera technologies, the InVisage
QuantumFilm sensor provides incredible performance in the smallest
package, making picture-taking foolproof, even in dimly lit rooms. 

    "The innovative QuantumFilm technology from InVisage has the potential to
disrupt the market for silicon-based image sensors," said Bo Ilsoe,
managing partner of Nokia Growth Partners. "Imaging remains a core
investment area for NGP, and it is our belief that InVisage's technology
will change how video and images are captured in consumer devices."

    "The participation of new investors, including a major handset maker, in
this round signals that imaging is a critical differentiator in mobile
devices," said Jess Lee, CEO, InVisage Technologies. "For too long, the
image sensor industry has lacked innovation. We are excited to bring
stunning image quality and advanced new features that will truly
transform this industry."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc is seeking court permission to question the JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co trader known as the "London Whale" in connection with its $8.6 billion lawsuit accusing the largest U.S. bank of driving it into bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a late Wednesday night filing in Manhattan bankruptcy court, Lehman and a committee of its unsecured creditors said months of disclosures about the trader, Bruno Iksil, suggest that he played a "greater role" than previously thought in the events underlying the May 2010 lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck for permission to ask French authorities to compel Iksil's testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti declined to comment about the request. A lawyer for Iksil did not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil worked for JPMorgan in London and is no longer employed by the New York-based bank. His activities have been linked to more than $6.2 billion of trading losses at JPMorgan's chief investment office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the court filing, Lehman and its creditors committee said Iksil's "practice of intentional mismarking" of trades warranted an inquiry into trades he oversaw that led to an "unjustified multimillion-dollar collateral call" on September 9, 2008, six days before Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman and the committee also want to examine how the chief investment office managed JPMorgan's exposure to Lehman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they said Iksil's lawyers have indicated that he will not cooperate in the absence of an official request under international legal norms, even though JPMorgan has largely agreed to the discovery requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman accused JPMorgan in the lawsuit of hastening its bankruptcy by using its "unparalleled" knowledge of its distress, through its role as the main clearing bank handling third-party dealings, to extract $8.6 billion of collateral in the four business days prior to the Chapter 11 filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last April, Peck narrowed Lehman's lawsuit but let stand some claims, saying that protections given to "systemically important" banks such as JPMorgan did not excuse them from acting in a "commercially unreasonable" manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman was once Wall Street's fourth-largest investment bank, and its bankruptcy remains the largest in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emerged from Chapter 11 last March, and is expected to spend several years winding down.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 14 (Reuters) - The California State Teachers' Retirement
System (CalSTRS) said on Thursday it will oppose Walt Disney
Co's combination of the CEO and chairman roles, and its
executive pay plan at the company's annual shareholder meeting
in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. pension fund owns about 5.3 million
Disney shares, a 0.3 percent stake worth $263 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Iger became CEO of the media and theme park company
in 2005 and was elected chairman at last year's annual meeting.
He received $40.2 million in total compensation last year,
according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here we go again, sliding back into a governance structure
that has already proved detrimental to the company's long-term
growth and to its shareholders' interests," said Anne Sheehan,
CalSTRS director of corporate governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, in its proxy statement released on Jan. 18, said the
company recorded a total shareholder return of 139 percent
during Iger's tenure, far above the 36 percent return for the
S 500 during the same time. Ninety-two percent of Iger's
compensation is contingent upon the financial results and stock
performance, Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CalSTRS' Sheehan said investors have "been through this
fight before" in 2004 and 2005, leading to the ouster of
then-CEO Michael Eisner and the splitting of the roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CalSTRS said it will support a shareholder proposal from the
Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds to keep the roles
separate in the future, except under "extraordinary
circumstances." CalSTRS also said it will vote "no" in a
non-binding vote on executive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its regulatory filing, Disney urged shareholders to vote
against the proposal to split the jobs "because it seeks to
replace the current, clear and workable standard for electing a
chairman with a vague and unworkable standard."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's annual meeting will take place on March 6 in
Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Institutional Shareholder Services, a shareholder governance
group and the treasurer for the state of Connecticut, objected
last year to Iger holding both jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares slipped 8 cents to close at $54.88 on the New
York Stock Exchange on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's global head
of equity proprietary trading has quit the investment bank to
set up a hedge fund in Switzerland, the Financial Times reported
on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepak Gulati, one of the bank's star traders, will launch
Argenti&#232;re Capital sometime in the second or third quarter of
this year, the financial daily quoted two people familiar with
the plans. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also said the hedge fund would be based in Zug,
the low-tax Swiss canton also home to global commodities trader
Glencore International Plc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketers expect Argenti&#232;re to raise as much as $500 million
for its launch, the FT said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New rules banning U.S. banks or those with U.S. subsidiaries
from risky but potentially profitable proprietary trading are
encouraging some traders to move to hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proprietary trading, or trading with the bank's own money,
can closely resemble trading in the hedge fund business and has
turned out big profits before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. Dodd-Frank bill, introduced under President
Barack Obama, includes a ban, known as the Volcker rule, on
proprietary trading because it is risky.&lt;/p&gt;

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/27jmwv/microsoft) has announced the
addition of the "Microsoft - Playing Catch up with Windows 8" company profile to
their offering. 

Investment thesis - A digital dinosaur lumbers on. 

Microsoft had an excellent financial track record until recently; Microsoft is
hampered by ineffective management execution. Since S. Ballmer became CEO in
2000, there has been a series of product failures and strategic blunders. 

The main problem is limited prospects due to dependence on a maturing PC
industry 

Microsoft is a digital dinosaur: large, un-innovative, slow and heading for
extinction. 

A lot hinges on Windows 8's success; to stay relevant with the shift to mobile
devices. 

Uninspiring 2013 Q2 results following Windows 8 release. 

Q2 revenues rose 3%, EBIT margins fell 2% and GAAP EPS fell 3%. Revenues &amp;
margins have been in a downward trend since 2010 as fundamentals erode.

Combined roles create conflicts and compensation plan works against
shareholders` interest.
WEST SACRAMENTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The California State Teachers` Retirement System (CalSTRS) today announced its
vote at the March 6, 2013, Walt Disney Company annual shareholder meeting. A
detailed vote tally and analysis are available in the Corporate Governance
section of the CalSTRS website. 

CalSTRS continues to be troubled by the company`s decision to recombine its
Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer positions and the executive pay
structures at Disney. CalSTRS attributes the poor governance structure and
compensation plans to an entrenched and insular board that lacks independence
from the CEO. 

"Here we go again, sliding back into a governance structure that has already
proved detrimental to the company`s long-term growth and to its shareholders`
interests," said CalSTRS Director of Corporate Governance Anne Sheehan. "We`ve
been through this fight before, in 2004-05, which resulted in the ouster of
then-CEO Michael Eisner and a shareholder revolt that led to the separation of
the Board Chair and CEO positions." 

As a long-term owner-investor, CalSTRS believes directors in the boardroom are
there to represent shareholders and to serve the shareholders` interests, not
the CEO`s. CalSTRS owns 5,282,341 shares of Disney stock worth $263 million,
which represents 0.3 percent of the outstanding shares. 

The California State Teachers` Retirement System, with a portfolio valued at
$157.8 billion as of December 31, 2012, is the largest educator-only pension
fund in the world. CalSTRS administers a hybrid retirement system, consisting of
traditional defined benefit, cash balance and voluntary defined contribution
plans, as well as disability and survivor benefits. For 100 years, CalSTRS has
served California's public school educators and their families, who today number
856,000 from the state`s 1,600 school districts, county offices of education and
community college districts.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Breaking up is getting easier for pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent restructurings by Pfizer (PFE.N) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) have set the pace for others as investors applaud the unlocking of value trapped inside large drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of deals such as Abbott splitting off its innovative drugs into AbbVie (ABBV.N) and Pfizer's spin-out of animal health into Zoetis (ZTS.N) has increased the pressure on other boards to consider smarter corporate structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will see more," said Jeff Greene, head of life sciences transactions at Ernst &amp; Young. "It doesn't mean we are not going to see a lot of merger and acquisition activity as well, but there is going to be a focus on rationalizing portfolios."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two factors are driving the trend: the changing nature of the market - which demands different offerings in different countries - and a more rigorous approach to capital allocation, prompting firms to carve out some areas while adding others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) is one company ahead of the pack on divestments, after spinning off its baby food unit Mead Johnson Nutrition (MJN.N) in 2009. It took a further step to shed non-core assets with a $482 million deal this week that gives Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) rights to sell certain over-the-counter (OTC) drugs in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N), arguably the ultimate healthcare conglomerate, is also considering selling its diagnostics business or turning it into a stand-alone company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Pfizer, which sold its nutrition business to Nestle (NESN.VX) for $12 billion nine months before floating Zoetis, is not ruling out an even bigger split of its premium branded drugs from its generic products, although such a step, if entertained, is likely to be some way off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European drugmakers have been more wary about such radical reshaping, reflecting their broader global footprint relative to U.S. rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since the European companies have twice the emerging markets presence as the U.S. companies, they have been moving more towards diversification - global presence tends to dictate a broader business model," said UBS analyst Gbola Amusa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means a wide range of OTC, generic products and vaccines are core to the likes of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX) in a way they are not for Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"U.S. drug companies are less globally diversified than those in Europe, so they need fewer types of businesses in order to succeed," Amusa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OLD BUSINESS MODEL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there is some movement in Europe. GSK, for example, may sell its Lucozade and Ribena drinks, which together represent just over 2 percent of group sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More significantly, it is also reviewing pharma operations in Europe, where cash-strapped governments are reluctant to pay for costly new drugs, putting the region at odds with more rewarding markets such as the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is not really a global market for innovative drugs, which the industry's old business model assumed there was," said Chris Stirling, head of life sciences at KPMG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, the big companies are trying to shape their businesses to the reality that Europe is different to the U.S. and Japan, which in turn are different to emerging markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSK has said its new approach in Europe may involve simple partnerships for certain drugs or more complex joint ventures, along the lines of its HIV drugs collaboration ViiV Healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis is another company where shareholders are hungry for change, as evident from the share price jump when Chairman Daniel Vasella said last month he was stepping down after 17 years at the top of the Swiss group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors hope Novartis will now consider disposals to generate cash for redistribution through share repurchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, investors are eyeing a $12 billion stake Novartis holds in cross-town rival Roche (ROG.VX), which Vasella bought between 2001 and 2003. The stake is "increasingly likely" to be sold back to Roche, according to Jefferies analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a move would be likely to trigger earnings-boosting share buybacks at both Novartis and Roche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies, such as AstraZeneca (AZN.L), are more focused on acquisitions to rebuild their business. But even Astra may have scope for creative restructuring, perhaps by running its diabetes tie-up with Bristol as an separate unit, bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the welcome given by the market to industry actions so far gives managements food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbott has outperformed the sector and the wider market since unveiling its planned split in 2011 and the two units secured a combined market value of some $105 billion, slightly above the legacy group, when they finally divided last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's Zoetis public offering, meanwhile, was priced above its expected range and the shares have risen 29 percent since their February 1 debut, valuing the business at $17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is value in a break-up and we are entering a phase when everyone knows this is the kind of thing they need to consider," said one healthcare banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Louise Ireland)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Abbott split and Pfizer divestments welcomed by market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Pressure on other companies to rationalise portfolios&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* U.S. drugmakers reshaping businesses faster than Europeans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ben Hirschler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Breaking up is getting easier for
pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent restructurings by Pfizer and Abbott
Laboratories have set the pace for others as investors
applaud the unlocking of value trapped inside large drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of deals such as Abbott splitting off its
innovative drugs into AbbVie and Pfizer's spin-out of
animal health into Zoetis has increased the pressure on
other boards to consider smarter corporate structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will see more," said Jeff Greene, head of life sciences
transactions at Ernst &amp; Young. "It doesn't mean we are not going
to see a lot of merger and acquisition activity as well, but
there is going to be a focus on rationalising portfolios."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two factors are driving the trend: the changing nature of
the market - which demands different offerings in different
countries - and a more rigorous approach to capital allocation,
prompting firms to carve out some areas while adding others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb is one company ahead of the
pack on divestments, after spinning off its baby food unit Mead
Johnson Nutrition in 2009. It took a further step to
shed non-core assets with a $482 million deal this week that
gives Reckitt Benckiser rights to sell certain
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson &amp; Johnson, arguably the ultimate healthcare
conglomerate, is also considering selling its diagnostics
business or turning it into a stand-alone company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Pfizer, which sold its nutrition business to Nestle
 for $12 billion nine months before floating Zoetis, is
not ruling out an even bigger split of its premium branded drugs
from its generic products, although such a step, if entertained,
is likely to be some way off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European drugmakers have been more wary about such radical
reshaping, reflecting their broader global footprint relative to
U.S. rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since the European companies have twice the emerging
markets presence as the U.S. companies, they have been moving
more towards diversification - global presence tends to dictate
a broader business model," said UBS analyst Gbola Amusa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means a wide range of OTC, generic products and
vaccines are core to the likes of GlaxoSmithKline and
Novartis in a way they are not for Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"U.S. drug companies are less globally diversified than
those in Europe, so they need fewer types of businesses in order
to succeed," Amusa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OLD BUSINESS MODEL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there is some movement in Europe. GSK, for example,
may sell its Lucozade and Ribena drinks, which together
represent just over 2 percent of group sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More significantly, it is also reviewing pharma operations
in Europe, where cash-strapped governments are reluctant to pay
for costly new drugs, putting the region at odds with more
rewarding markets such as the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is not really a global market for innovative drugs,
which the industry's old business model assumed there was," said
Chris Stirling, head of life sciences at KPMG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, the big companies are trying to shape their
businesses to the reality that Europe is different to the U.S.
and Japan, which in turn are different to emerging markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSK has said its new approach in Europe may involve simple
partnerships for certain drugs or more complex joint ventures,
along the lines of its HIV drugs collaboration ViiV Healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis is another company where shareholders are hungry
for change, as evident from the share price jump when Chairman
Daniel Vasella said last month he was stepping down after 17
years at the top of the Swiss group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors hope Novartis will now consider disposals to
generate cash for redistribution through share repurchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, investors are eyeing a $12 billion stake
Novartis holds in cross-town rival Roche, which Vasella
bought between 2001 and 2003. The stake is "increasingly likely"
to be sold back to Roche, according to Jefferies analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a move would be likely to trigger earnings-boosting
share buybacks at both Novartis and Roche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies, such as AstraZeneca, are more
focused on acquisitions to rebuild their business. But even
Astra may have scope for creative restructuring, perhaps by
running its diabetes tie-up with Bristol as an separate unit,
bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the welcome given by the market to industry
actions so far gives managements food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbott has outperformed the sector and the wider market
since unveiling its planned split in 2011 and the two units
secured a combined market value of some $105 billion, slightly
above the legacy group, when they finally divided last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's Zoetis public offering, meanwhile, was priced above
its expected range and the shares have risen 29 percent since
their Feb. 1 debut, valuing the business at $17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is value in a break-up and we are entering a phase
when everyone knows this is the kind of thing they need to
consider," said one healthcare banker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUCHAREST (Reuters) - U.S. energy major Chevron (CVX.N) is moving towards exploration for shale gas in eastern Romania but still needs at least two more permits before it can start drilling, the environment ministry said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local authorities in Vaslui county, where Chevron has a 1.6 million acre concession, have granted the company planning permits for three shale gas exploration wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This document does not confer the right to carry out works," the environment ministry said in a statement to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are talking about exploration, not exploitation, and we are in the first phase of assessing an environment permit", for one of the three wells, the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that Romania and neighboring Bulgaria and Hungary could have 538 billion cubic meters of shale gas between them, slightly more than Europe's annual consumption and enough to cover Romania's for almost 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-shale gas activists protested last year in Romania, however, asking the government to annul Chevron's exploration rights on environmental concerns and keep a moratorium on exploration enforced by the ruling leftist government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after a clear victory in a December election, Prime Minister Victor Ponta has indicated Romania will allow companies to at least look for shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron will also need permission for construction before it can start exploration work, according to the text of a law cited by the ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic fracturing or fracking to extract shale gas involves injecting water and chemicals at high pressure into underground rock formations. Experts say that if it is done according to best practice it is environmentally safe, but the technology still evokes much public concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ponta has softened his views on shale gas exploration since the December election, in which his alliance won a two-thirds majority in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exploration yes.

 is moving towards exploration for shale gas in eastern
Romania but still needs at least two more permits before it can

that Romania and neighbouring Bulgaria and Hungary could have
538 billion cubic metres of shale gas between them, slightly
more than Europe's annual consumption and enough to cover

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, Feb 14 (Marketwire) -- 
The food and beverage sector has been at the forefront of traders' minds
this week, with the world's largest soft drinks maker Coca-Cola
announcing results on Tuesday, 12 February, and peer PepsiCo reporting
later today.

    Coca-Cola shares fell following its results announcement, with the
company missing analyst expectations for fourth quarter revenues.
Revenues grew 4% to $11.46 billion, missing consensus forecasts for a
sharper rise to $11.53 billion. Despite the miss, Coca-Cola remains
confident that it will meet its full-year global volume growth targets of
between 3% and 4%. Analysts are widely expecting PepsiCo to announce a
0.8% rise in revenue to $19.7 billion, and a 9% slide in earnings per
share to $1.05 -- its fourth consecutive quarter of declining profit
growth. 

    The Pepsi Challenge

    If PepsiCo's results slide below analyst estimates, this could disappoint
investors and put downward pressure on the stock, pushing prices lower in
the coming days. However, if the results beat expectations, this could
have a positive impact on Pepsi's share price.

    Spread betting can be a great way of taking advantage of the share price
moves of companies such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, especially during
earnings season. With spread betting, you can make a profit irrespective
of whether a company's share price moves up or down. If you expect prices
to rise, you go long or buy the company's shares. If, however, you
expected shares to fall, you simple need to go short or sell the
company's shares. If you were right and prices move in the direction you
had anticipated, you would net a profit. However, if prices move against
you, you would net a loss that could exceed your initial deposit if you
do not manage your risk.

    To potentially profit from any positive or negative price movement in
PepsiCo shares when it posts results today, all you need to do is
determine whether you expect prices to rise or fall following the results
announcement and take a position accordingly.

City Index. 

    With spread betting your losses are magnified in the same way as your
gains if the market moves against you and can result in losses exceeding
your initial outlay. Please ensure you fully understand the risks
involved.

&lt;p&gt;ZURICH/LONDON Feb 15 (Reuters) - JP Morgan's trader
Deepak Gulati is to give the Swiss hedge fund industry a boost
with the second-quarter debut of a major fund, a source close to
the matter said, in a tough environment for start-up managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His new firm Argentiere Capital was entered in Switzerland's
commercial register last July and has already raised a
substantial sum of money for the fund, the source said, although
he declined to confirm the sum or a fundraising target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicity-shy Gulati, global head of equity proprietary
trading at JP Morgan, will take his team of 'black box' traders
with him, this person added, as the Wall Street giant looks to
cut its proprietary trading arms at the behest of regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many banks have shed their proprietary trading arms or
disbanded prop teams in response to the Dodd Frank Act of 2010,
which curbs banks' speculative bets with their own money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch comes at a tough time for new hedge fund firms -
even star names spinning out of banks - as they battle tough
market conditions and investor nervousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pierre Henri-Flamand, a former head of proprietary trading
at Goldman Sachs, said in November he would shut his fund
Edoma Partners, despite managing as much as $2 billion at one
stage, after poor performance and seeing its assets shrink to
$855 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, another high-profile launch, Azentus Capital,
which was set up by former Goldman trader Morgan Sze and which
also ran $2 billion at one stage, lost 6.8 percent in
performance terms in 2011 and gained only about 1 percent last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported on Friday that marketers
expected Argentiere to raise as much as $500 million for its
launch. Such an amount would dwarf most launches this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can start with $500 million... then you're really
off to a very, very advantageous start," said one prime broker.
"The single most difficult thing for aspiring new managers is
getting... new capital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most European hedge fund start-ups still plump for
London's upmarket Mayfair district or close by, Argentiere is
nevertheless one of several new fund launches slated in
Switzerland this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One industry executive, whose company both seeds and
provides services for emerging hedge fund managers, said his
company was working on four launches of funds ranging in size
from $50-$250 million scheduled for the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of high-profile firms, most notably Brevan Howard
and BlueCrest, have shifted operations to Switzerland in recent
years. However, some traders have found life in Geneva expensive
or have missed London's buzzing night life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the difficulties of setting up in Switzerland is
getting the people - the CFO (chief financial officer), tech
people... In London there's a ready-made talent pool," the prime
broker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gulati's new fund is likely to be a so-called 'event-driven'
fund and focus on merger arbitrage, an investment style which
seeks to profit from price discrepancies following merger
announcements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the company's registration Eamon Comerford, head of
trading at Derivative Partners Invest AG is listed as a board
member and signatory, while JP Morgan trader Michael Quinlivan
is also a signatory and is named as Argentiere's contact person
on the Swiss company database 'moneyhouse'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ernst &amp; Young is named as group auditor.&lt;/p&gt;

Oslo, Norway - February 15, 2013 - AIMS Innovation, a systems monitoring software company, today
announced the launch of a new version of its application, AIMS for BizTalk, which is Microsoft
Platform Ready for the Windows Azure Platform.

The Windows Azure Platform offers customers enhanced security, as well as innovative user
interface features and reliability improvements. AIMS for BizTalk
http://www.aimsinnovation.com/default.aspx  is an IT early warning system that prevents costly
downtime of the Microsoft BizTalk server environment by monitoring all IT infrastructure
connections and flagging early signs of trouble. Unlike other Microsoft monitoring software
solutions, AIMS for BizTalk offers a proactive warning before a serious problem arises,
pinpointing the exact location needing attention and sending a real-time alert to relevant IT team
members. This gives service and operations departments the time to resolve problems before serious
incidents occur and, hence, prevent system downtime.

"Our ISV community is alive with innovation, and we're committed to helping our partners drive the
next generation of software experiences," said Ross Brown, Vice President of ISV and Solutions
Partners for the Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft. "Adding compatibility for the latest
Microsoft technologies helps ISVs to stay ahead of the competition and give their customers access
to cutting-edge technologies."

"AIMS Innovation is excited to launch this new version of AIMS for BizTalk," said Ivar Sagemo, CEO
at AIMS Innovation. "Making our application Microsoft Platform Ready for Windows Azure helps us
deliver AIMS for BizTalk and other AIMS applications from the cloud, thus removing the need for a
client to install the application on site. It also enables us to use AIMS for BizTalk for both
single client and multi-tenant installations, which will help partners who monitor the performance
of their clients' BizTalk systems."

CHENGDU, China, Feb. 16, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GeneralTouch Technology CO., LTD., announces the
attainment of Microsoft Windows 8 LOGO certification for its innovative and proprietary touch
technology - Projected Infrared Touch (PIT). In a span of six months, from the introduction of the
first PIT prototype, PIT has become one of the chosen few touch technologies that is Windows 8
Touch LOGO certified.

As the newest operating system of Microsoft, Windows 8 was specially created to incorporate
multi-touch as a standard feature in the next generation of PC systems. To be inducted to Windows
8, a touch technology has to pass Microsoft's strict test parameters. Hence, GeneralTouch is
profoundly gratified that its PIT technology is now Windows 8 LOGO certified and with it, comes
the attestation of PIT's outstanding performance and its 100% compatibility with Windows 8.

This is a big win not only for GeneralTouch as the certification inevitably paves the way for
leading major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs) to
unreservedly develop PIT products that run on Windows 8 where touch is intrinsic. Both the
monitor, All-in-One PC ODM/OEMs and consumers will greatly profit from the benefits of PIT
technology, with its excellent multi-touch performance, elegant aesthetics, near zero bezel, high
level of customization, superb cost-effectiveness &amp; reliability; thus, breaking the monopoly of
Projected Capacitive (PCAP) touch technology in consumer electronics applications.

Having earned the Windows 8 LOGO certification, GeneralTouch will double its efforts in speeding
up PIT products engineering, mass production schedule and marketing campaign, to usher PIT touch
products into the mass market in the near future, as previously envisaged. In particular,
GeneralTouch will spare no effort in supporting leading PC ODM/OEMs to roll out Windows 8 Desktop
touch displays and PCs, interfaced with PIT, soonest possible. 

The prompt development and initiation of PIT into the world of touch technology reflects the
resolute research and indomitable design capabilities of GeneralTouch. In maintaining its stance
as the world leading touch solutions provider, GeneralTouch will keep on innovating advanced touch
technologies and products for the global touch industry. The current PIT touch product comes in
size ranging from 15" to 32" and is suitable for Desktop Monitors, All-in-one (AIO) PCs with
touch.

&lt;p&gt;* Rupiah's fall in value makes rules more problematic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Chevron warned it may cut investment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Indonesian regulation "very difficult", says Total&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Fergus Jensen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, Feb 18 (Reuters) - French oil major Total 
has added its voice to complaints by U.S. leviathan Chevron
 that Indonesia's rules for overseas investors are
hampering operations in the southeast Asian country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia's central bank brought in rules in 2011 to force
exporters to channel earnings through local banks, but the issue
has become more sensitive in recent months because of the fall
in value of the rupiah and could threaten future
investment by the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With today's contracts and way of working, it would be very
difficult," Total's Indonesia CEO Elizabeth Proust told
reporters on Monday, in reference to the Bank Indonesia
regulation. "It's not possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, a former OPEC member and now a net oil importer,
is trying desperately to boost energy production and encourage
investors to put more money into exploration. But it has been
widely criticised for confusing and sometimes contradictory
regulations that some have warned could end up scaring off
foreign investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint by Total, the biggest producer of liquefied
natural gas (LNG) in Indonesia, follows a warning by Chevron
that it could reduce its investment in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Indonesia's biggest oil producer, had told the
state oil and gas regulator (SKK Migas) that the central bank
rules were among a number of issues threatening its investments
in Indonesia. Chevron accounted for 45 percent of Indonesia's
total crude production in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'RISK TO INVESTMENT'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have engaged with Bank Indonesia and the government of
Indonesia to clarify its regulations, given (that) they conflict
with terms of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) under which
Chevron operates," the company's Asia Pacific spokesman Alex
Yelland told Reuters in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(The regulation) will increase economic risk to new
investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate comment from the central bank. Its
rules do not state how long funds need to be held in local
banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of gas production has become politically
sensitive, with some politicians arguing that Indonesia should
stop gas exports unless its trade partners help it to balance
its own needs through alternative energy infrastructure
investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total operates the Mahakam block with Japan's Inpex
, but state oil and gas company Pertamina has expressed
an interest in the gas field, which was producing 100 million
standard cubic feet of gas a day in late 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Total's investment plans for 2013 remain intact,
Proust said that uncertainties over the company's Mahakam
contract extension could interfere with its business in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the time being we can still work, but in the coming
years it will be more difficult."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another oil major, ExxonMobil, also ran into
difficulties when the government decided not to renew its local
CEO's work permit, accusing him of being uncooperative and of
moving too slowly to ramp up production in the Cepu oil block,
Indonesia's main hope for increased production.&lt;/p&gt;

Vantiv First U.S. Acquirer to Complete Mandate Requirements
to Process both EMV Visa and Interlink Transactions

Single Integrated Processing Platform Continues to Enable Vantiv to Quickly Integrate New
Technologies

Largest U.S. PIN Debit Acquirer Continues to Provide Leadership in Transitioning Merchants to EMV

Cincinnati - Feb. 19, 2013 - Vantiv, Inc. http://www.vantiv.com/  (NYSE: VNTV), a leading provider
of payment processing services and related technology solutions for merchants and financial
institutions of all sizes, announced today that it is the first U.S. acquirer to complete host
testing requirements to process both Visa and Interlink EMV transactions in support of the EMV
acquirer mandate.

EMV is a global standard for credit and debit payment cards based on chip card technology with
enhanced security. Embedded in the card is a microprocessor containing cryptographic processing
techniques, which when utilized, make card-present payments more secure. More than one billion
card users outside the United States are currently utilizing this technology, and U.S. acquirers
are required to certify their processing platforms by April 1, 2013.

"We are proud to be the first U.S. acquirer to achieve this integration with Visa," said Carlos
Lima, Chief Operating Officer at Vantiv. "To assist our clients with the coming EMV liability
shift, being the first to offer EMV acceptance for both Visa and Interlink is essential and is a
testament to our strengths in quickly implementing new payment technologies and compliance
standards." 

Vantiv is the third largest merchant acquirer and the largest PIN debit acquirer in the United
States based on number of transactions, and processes for 8 of the top 25 retailers in the nation
with volumes weighted towards non-discretionary, everyday spend categories.

"Visa is pleased Vantiv is able to support EMV processing ahead of the acquirer processing mandate
and meet the needs of merchants and financial institutions who want to adopt EMV chip technology,"
said Stephanie Ericksen, Head of Authentication Product Integration at Visa Inc. "Meeting this
milestone demonstrates Vantiv's commitment to EMV technology."

As a leader in the industry, Vantiv is the only U.S. headquartered acquirer to serve on the Board
of Advisors of EMVco http://www.emvco.com/ , and is one of two acquirers recently elected to the
Smart Card Alliance EMV Forum Steering Committee http://www.smartcardalliance.org/ .  The Company
also participates as a key member of the Merchant Advisory Group's EMV Forum.

"At Vantiv, we work to ensure our clients are informed and prepared for this important
transition," said Patty Walters, Senior Vice President for Merchant Products and Security at
Vantiv. "EMV offers merchants and financial institutions new ways to limit counterfeit fraud and
provides their customers a more secure shopping experience. While today is an important milestone
for Vantiv, we remain focused on continuing to educate our clients and partners to ensure a
seamless, timely transition for the entire industry."

Vantiv's integrated processing platform continues to enable the Company to quickly integrate new
technologies such as EMV.  This, combined with Vantiv's comprehensive suite of payment solutions,
represents the Company's continued investments in its core processing platform, emerging
technologies and strong execution capabilities, which expand choice and acceptance options for
merchants nationwide.

Vantiv is on track to achieve its remaining EMV network certifications by April 1, 2013. For more

SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Sycuan Casino and legendary basketball pro Bill Walton join together with the
Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF), a world leader in helping individuals with
physical challenges get involved - and stay involved - in sports, to launch a
second year of partnership. The 2013 partnership kicked off on February 17, 2013
in Sycuan`s GameDay Sports Bar and Grill for the NBA All-Star game where Bill
Walton provided game commentary and signed fan autographs after a special check
presentation of $50,000 from Sycuan`s Chairman, Daniel Tucker, to further
support CAF`s mission. CAF Executive Director, Virginia Tinley, and CAF
spokesperson and challenged athlete, Scout Bassett, accepted the check on behalf
of the foundation. Bill praised Scout as the "true all-Star" in the room for
overcoming adversity after losing her leg in a liquid fire and left as an orphan
in Nanjing, China, to becoming a role model for others with physical
disabilities. 

"We are proud to partner with the Challenged Athletes Foundation for the second
year in a row as they exemplify how sports serve as the springboard to success
in life," said Tucker. "As an organization dedicated to having a positive impact
on our community, we couldn`t imagine a better foundation to support." This
donation will allow CAF to provide grants for adaptive sports equipment, sports
prosthetics, training, mentorship and competition expenses to challenged
athletes throughout the world, with many right here in the San Diego community.
GameDay will further support challenged athletes by donating 5% of proceeds to
CAF. "Over the years I have had the honor and privilege of meeting many
inspirational athletes, like the remarkable Scout Bassett. This team of CAF and
Sycuan is one of the best I`ve played on for the passion they share to help
others succeed in life using sports," said Bill Walton. "I look forward to
making regular appearances at GameDay throughout March Madness and this upcoming
year." 

GameDay Sports Bar &amp; Grill

Sycuan`s GameDay Sports Bar &amp; Grill - the Official Sports Bar of basketball
legend Bill Walton, is your premier sports viewing destination featuring luxury
accommodations and one-of-kind San Diego sports memorabilia.The Bar &amp; Grill
features 39 large screen televisions, including five 100-inch
Holodisplayprojection TVs. The bar offers 12 beers on tap as well as a full
cocktail selection, and guests can select from a delicious menu of great casual
food like a "build your own burger" selections, a full Mexican offering and
dozens of appetizer choices. There are even 29 bar-top video poker machines for
those who like to play while they watch. Stop in to see the 15-foot tall metal
"Louisville Slugger" bat from Jack Murphy stadium, the original four front-row
seats from Petco Park, and an original San Diego Chicken Costume.

Challenged Athletes Foundation

The Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF) is a world leader in helping
individuals with physical challenges get involved - and stay involved - in
sports. CAF believes that participation in sports at any level increases
self-esteem, encourages independence and enhances quality of life. Since 1994,
more than $40 million has been raised and almost 7,000 funding requests from
challenged athletes in all 50 states and dozens of countries have been
satisfied. Additionally, CAF`s outreach efforts help another 60,000 individuals
each year. Whether it`s a $2,500 grant for a handcycle, helping underwrite a
carbon fiber running foot not covered by insurance, or arranging enthusiastic
encouragement from a mentor who has triumphed over a similar challenge, CAF`s
mission is clear: give those with the desire to live active, athletic lifestyles
every opportunity to compete in the sports they love. To learn more, visit

NetSocket introduces CEM solution based on Microsoft Lync Network Diagnostics
API to provide comprehensive probe-less visibility into Microsoft Lync
environments
PLANO, Texas--(Business Wire)--
NetSocket, a leading provider of network service assurance solutions for unified
communications (UC)in enterprise and service provider environments, today
announced its collaboration with Microsoft in fully implementing the Microsoft
Lync&#174; Network Diagnostics API for Lync 2013 and 2010 environments. The latest
version of its Cloud Experience Manager (CEM) delivers comprehensive, real-time
visibility into IP network issues that could impact Lync users` experience,
enabling UC managers to quickly anticipate, isolate and remediate network-based
UC problems. NetSocket CEM reduces problem resolution time by more than 70
percent, for a significantly lower total cost of ownership (TCO) and a superior
Lync user experience. 

NetSocket`s patented IP Correlation Engine&#174; fully supports the Microsoft Lync
Network Diagnostics API, a new and unique Microsoft Lync real-time service
assurance API, to provide real-time, hop-by-hop IP topology path identification
and recording of all media streams for all Lync voice and video calls. The
real-time identification of specific route paths for each call allows IT support
staff to correlate a user`s complaint to the likely root cause of service
degradation more accurately and faster than has ever been possible before.
NetSocket is the first IP network service assurance provider to deploy this new
Microsoft Lync API in a real-time solution for distributed enterprises. 

Offering more than just monitoring, CEM provides complete IP network
information, automatically correlating session, content and topology data. CEM
delivers immediate insight into the underlying IP networks that support
Microsoft Lync environments without using costly probes throughout the network
or burdening the performance of all UC elements with post-event diagnostics
traces. 

CEM`s UC service assurance management interface provides proactive and intuitive
network service management through a single-pane-of-glass view that allows IT
support personnel to rapidly execute diagnostic workflows upon receipt of
service complaints. CEM`s interface and workflow structure allows a much greater
percentage of UC service cases to be quickly managed by IT operations and
support personnel without requiring a higher level of expert resources. CEM also
supports manager-of-manager applications such as Microsoft System Center,
delivering key performance indicator alerts and other service-related data to
unified management solutions. 

NetSocket`s powerful IP Correlation Engine, with its automatic correlation of
all IP network data, fully supports the Microsoft Lync Network Diagnostics API
to provide a complete picture of the Lync user experience. Within seconds, CEM
isolates the faults of a service degradation event and, through its informative
graphical user interface, provides both real-time and historical IP network
information for any call, enabling root cause identification for all calls
affected by an event. 

"CEM optimizes Microsoft Lync UC service management and users` experience by
providing immediate insight into the IP network issues that could impact a
Microsoft Lync user`s experience," said John White, CEO and president of
NetSocket. "NetSocket is leading the way in supporting the Microsoft Lync
platform and assuring exceptional unified communications, providing further
reductions in enterprise and managed service provider TCO."

Nominates Five Highly-Qualified Candidates Experienced in Mining

Believes Current Board Has Shown a Lack of Strategic and Financial Judgement
Reflected in Company`s Significant Underperformance
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Audley Capital Advisors LLP ("Audley Capital") announced today that a related
Audley investment fund recently notified Walter Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX:
WLT) ("Walter Energy" or "the Company") that it will nominate five candidates
for election to the Company`s board of directors at its upcoming 2013 Annual
Meeting of Shareholders. 

Audley Capital believes that Walter Energy has high quality metallurgical coal
assets in established mining jurisdictions with scope for significant growth,
with a market position that should enable it to generate substantial free cash
flow going forward. However, following the acquisition of Western Coal Corp. in
November 2010, Walter Energy has consistently failed to deliver shareholder
value as a result of questionable financial decisions and poor management. As a
result, Audley Capital believes that shareholders have lost confidence in the
ability of the existing Board of Directors to deliver profitable growth going
forward. For example, Walter Energy`s share price has fallen 73% since its peak
in April 2011, underperforming major mining indices including the MSCI World
Metals and Mining Index, which has declined only 33% in the same period.1

Audley Capital points to a few areas it believes to be of immediate concern:

* Consistently missed quarterly earnings guidance over the last two years.
Walter has missed consensus earnings expectations for six out of the last eight
quarters. In particular the failure to deliver production growth and cost
reductions in Canada has disappointed expectations. 
* A serious lack of consistent leadership. There have been four CEOs over the
last five years. 
* A stale and out-of-depth board. Only three of the ten board members have
significant mining experience, five non-executive directors have interlocking
directorships, six of ten directors are over the recommended retirement age of
65 (in some cases over the age of 70). 
* Questionable financial decisions. Walter Energy currently has $2.3 billion of
debt, largely accumulated during the acquisition of Western Coal during 2010.
Audley Capital believes that the acquisition could easily have been funded by
issuing more equity above a price of $100 per share at the time of the
transaction and at a time of record coal prices. Instead, shareholders are left
with a net debt to book value of equity ratio of 200% for a mining company with
a high level of operational and commodity price risk. 
* Insufficient cost controls. Audley Capital believes that a thorough and
disciplined review of SG costs is needed. Based on Audley Capital`s analysis,
SG costs at the Company are higher than Walter Energy`s U.S. peer group and
savings of at least $10 million per quarter ($40 million per year) should be
feasible. Such cost reductions could equate to $200 million of incremental value
at a 5.0x multiple, the ultimate goal being a reduction of SG costs of $40
million per annum.

Audley Capital has identified a number of initiatives to seek to improve the
governance, financial performance and asset value of Walter Energy over the next
12 months, which will be communicated to shareholders in the coming weeks. 

Audley`s director nominees include individuals with extensive experience in the
metallurgical coal industry on an international basis and possess the skills
required to manage multi-jurisdictional coal operations and their financing.
Audley is not seeking to replace a majority of the Board, but does believe
significant change to the composition of the Board is warranted given the
qualifications of its nominees and the long-term underperformance of Walter
Energy. Audley will seek the support of fellow Walter Energy shareholders to
replace the following current directors: Mr. Howard Clark, Mr. Jerry Kolb, Mr.
Joseph Leonard, Mr. Bernard Rethore and Mr. Mike Tokarz. 

Julian Treger, Managing Partner of Audley Capital, said, "There is substantial
value in Walter Energy that is not reflected in the current share price. We
believe Walter Energy has high quality metallurgical coal assets with potential
for significant growth. Unfortunately, what we see as poor financial and
strategic judgement by the current board has weighed heavily on the Company and
prevented it from creating value for its shareholders." 

Added Treger, "Our director nominees will bring experience, accountability and a
fresh perspective to the Walter Energy board. Once elected, we believe they can
substantially and dramatically improve the Company`s ability to operate in the
current environment and help put in place initiatives that will enable the
Company to achieve its value creating potential over the long-term for the
benefit of all shareholders." 

Audley`s slate of directors includes highly qualified mining industry experts,
with considerable operating experience. The nominees are: 

Mr. Eddie Scholtz (59)

Mr. Eddie Scholtz has over 40 years of experience in the mining industry,
primarily in South America and Africa. During his career he spent 37 years with
BHP Billiton, where he held a variety of positions, including Managing Director
of Ingwe Collieries, BHP Billiton's wholly-owned South African coal business,
now known as BHP Billiton Energy Coal South Africa. In this role Mr. Scholtz
oversaw one of the largest coal businesses in the world. More recently Mr.
Scholtz was also Managing Director for BHP Billiton's bauxite and alumina
operations in Suriname in South America and was formerly Chief Operating Officer
for TSX-listed CIC Energy Corp, which was acquired by Jindal Steel and Power
Limited in 2012, and was formerly President and CEO of TSX-listed Talon Metals
Corp. 

Mr. Scholtz has undertaken management development studies at London Business
School, University of South Africa (UNISA), and University of Cape Town's
Graduate Business School. 

Mr. Mark Lochtenberg (52)

Formerly the co-head of Glencore International AG`s worldwide coal division, Mr.
Mark Lochtenberg spent 13 years at Glencore`s commodity trading concern,
overseeing a range of trading activities including the purchase and aggregation
of the coal project portfolio that would later become Xstrata Coal. Previously,
Mr. Lochtenberg had established a coal "swaps" market for Bain Refco (Deutsche
Bank) after having served as coal marketing manager for Peko Wallsend Limited.
He is also a director of Australian Transport and Energy Corridor Limited
("ATEC") and an alternate director of Surat Basin Rail Pty Ltd. Mr. Lochtenberg
is currently the Executive Chairman and a founding executive director of
ASX-listed Cockatoo Coal Limited. 

Mr. Lochtenberg graduated with a Bachelor of Law (Hons) degree from Liverpool
University, U.K. 

Mr. Robert Stan (59)

Mr. Robert Stan has been involved in the Canadian coal industry since 1979,
during which time he has developed an extensive knowledge of the international
coal industry and markets. He has held senior management positions with several
Canadian mining companies, including Fording Coal Limited, Westar Mining Ltd,
Teck Corporation and Smoky River Coal Limited (SRCL). Mr. Stan was appointed a
director of Grande Cache Coal Corporation in July 2000, President in February
2001 and Chief Executive Officer in September 2002. Grande Cache Coal was sold
for C$1 billion in 2011 to Hong Kong-listed Winsway Coking Coal and Japanese
trading house Marubeni Corporation. Prior to February 2001, Mr. Stan was
Vice-President of Westpine Inc., a privately held mining investment company, and
prior to March 2000 was Vice-President, Marketing and Business Development of
SRCL. 

Mr. Stan received a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Saskatchewan. 

Mr. Lawrence Clark, Jr. (41)

Mr. Larry Clark recently became President and Chief Executive Officer of JW
Resources, Inc., a private operator of thermal coal assets in Central
Appalachia, and serves as Managing Member of BalanTrove Management, LLC, a
corporate advisory business catering to small and middle market resource and
energy companies. Prior to founding BalanTrove in early 2011, Mr. Clark was a
Managing Director and Director of Investments of Harbinger Capital Partners LLC
from 2002 to 2011 where he was responsible for investments in metals, mining,

PARIS--(Business Wire)--
As part of its commitment to delivering the new workspace where all

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chairman Bill Gates said he was not satisfied with the company's pace of innovation over the last few years, and that it had mishandled its early mobile strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We didn't miss cellphones, but the way that we went about it didn't allow us to get the leadership. It's clearly a mistake," Gates, Microsoft's former CEO, said in a rare interview with CBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates hedged questions on whether he was happy with Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's performance. He said Ballmer had achieved a lot but that both he and Ballmer were not satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(Ballmer) and I are two of the most self-critical people I know," Gates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a lot of amazing things that Steve's leadership achieved &#8212; Windows 8, the Surface computer, Bing, Xbox.

The company's shares have dropped 45 percent since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former senior Microsoft executive, Joachim Kempin, said in a book he wrote about his time at the company that Ballmer was not the right leader for the world's largest software company but held his grip on it by systematically forcing out any rising manager who challenged his authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His criticism echoes that of investor David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who called for Ballmer to step down in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has faced criticism for its latest Windows 8 versions for different devices, while its Bing search engine has won only a small market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sayantani Ghosh in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)&lt;/p&gt;

* Next-generation dedicated video conferencing room system purpose-built for
Microsoft Lync 2013 to bring simplicity and advanced collaboration capabilities
to customers
* New software application enables enhanced content-sharing between
standards-based video collaboration devices and Lync
* Polycom offers 40 solutions interoperable or optimized to work with Lync 2010
* UC solutions combining Polycom RealPresence solutions and Microsoft Lync
continue to win over customers worldwide

SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Polycom, Inc. (Nasdaq: PLCM), the global leader in open standards-based unified
communications and collaboration (UC), today announced a new dedicated room
system for Microsoft Lync 2013, a multi-way content sharing application,
additional interoperable solutions, and customer momentum in support of
Microsoft`s inaugural Lync Conference. Polycom`s portfolio of 40 video, voice,
and content sharing solutions are interoperable or optimized to work with
Microsoft Lync, driving a majority of customers to choose Polycom and Microsoft
over other vendors for a complete UC solution. 

Together, Polycom RealPresence video and voice solutions and Microsoft Lync
unify communications across work environments - on the go, home and work
offices, conference rooms, and immersive theaters. With the combination of Lync
and RealPresence solutions, employees can launch video collaboration sessions
easily and intuitively from within familiar interfaces and normal workflows,
from any work environment on- or off-premises. They simply click a name in their
Lync contact list to securely collaborate face-to-face via Polycom video at
their desktop or in a conference room. 

"We have long worked with Microsoft to ensure our solutions are interoperable
and we`re excited to do so again with Lync 2013," said Ted Colton, Global Vice
President of Strategic Alliances, Polycom. "Today our mutual customers are
benefitting from the ability to eliminate the barrier of geographic distance
between employees. The combination of Polycom and Microsoft software gives
employees greater flexibility and a seamless UC solution for video, voice,
conferencing and collaboration, from anywhere, anytime. And with our new
dedicated room system purpose-built for Lync 2013, it`s only going to get better
and drive more value for our mutual customers." 

Next-generation dedicated Lync room system

Polycom will launch a new dedicated video conferencing room system combining
Microsoft Lync 2013 and Polycom video collaboration technology. The solution
will feature high-end Polycom camera and microphone options (for traditional
front-of-room cameras and center-of-table 360-degree cameras), touchscreen
monitors, and a tabletop touch controller. The new Polycom room system will be
purpose-built for Lync 2013 to extend the familiar Lync user experience to the
video conference room environment and will include rich presence, contact search
and instant messaging as well as powerful video conferencing with rich
collaboration capabilities including white boarding, PowerPoint presentations,
application sharing and editing, and more. Its tight integration with Microsoft
Outlook will help users both in the meeting room as well as remotely start and
manage meetings more efficiently, ultimately increasing usage and driving a
greater return on investment. The Polycom room system for Microsoft Lync will
include several features that specifically take advantage of Lync 2013 such as
built-in multi-party video and will leverage the industry`s first open
standards-based SVC (Scalable Video Coding) implementation - unveiled by Polycom
in Fall 2012. 

Enhanced content sharing

Polycom also announced the Polycom RealPresence Content Sharing Suite, a
software application for the Polycom RealPresence Platform software
infrastructure. The new software solution allows Lync users to share content
back and forth with standards-based video collaboration devices such as
room-based video solutions (such as Polycom HDX systems) or mobile apps (such as
Polycom RealPresence Mobile 2.0 app). Lync users have always been able to view
content as part of the video stream but the new software from Polycom allows
Lync users to view and share documents and presentations in a separate content
video stream, allowing for high-definition display of content (up to 720p HD),
larger display of participants, and an overall enhanced user experience. 

Expanded interoperability options

Polycom offers a broad and rich portfolio of solutions that are interoperable or
optimized to work with Microsoft Lync - 40 solutions in total. Anchored by the
flagship Polycom CX family of products, built for custom integration with Lync,
Polycom has an expansive portfolio of solutions that have achieved formal
qualification for Microsoft Lync 2010 interoperability including:

* Polycom RealPresence Collaboration Server (RMX 1500 and 2000), software for
multiparty video and voice collaboration that connects the most people at
highest quality and lowest cost. The RealPresence Collaboration Server is a key
component of the Polycom RealPresence Platform software infrastructure. 
* Polycom RealPresence Room video collaboration systems (Polycom HDX 6000, 7000,
and 8000) and the Polycom HDX 4500 executive desktop video system. 
* Polycom VVX 500 business media phones that improve productivity by simplifying
communication processes and business workflows. The media phones can be
video-enabled when used with the Polycom VVX Camera. 
* The Polycom SoundPoint IP series desktop phones (SoundPoint 450, 550, 560, and
650).

Additionally, Polycom`s latest HD video collaboration systems for rooms and
budgets of all sizes, the Polycom RealPresence Group Series (300, 500 and 700),
can also connect with Microsoft Lync 2010. The new RealPresence Group Series
solutions include a simple and intuitive new user interface, and offer the
industry's best HD video and content-sharing (up to 1080p60 resolution), and
crystal-clear audio. 

Polycom and Microsoft across industries, around the world

Customers around the world, of all size and in all industries, are using
Microsoft Lync together with Polycom RealPresence video and voice solutions as
their comprehensive UC solution to keep their global teams connected,
communicating, and collaborating.

* Lonza, one of the world's leading suppliers to the pharmaceutical, healthcare
and life science industries, uses Polycom and Microsoft solutions to implement a
more flexible working environment for its 11,000 staff across 90 sites so
employees can work more effectively away from the office and securely join video
meetings from home or on the move. 
* UK-based global technology firm Smiths Group PLC uses Microsoft and Polycom at
400 locations in over 50 countries, creating a virtual link for over 23,000
employees. Smiths is also using Polycom RealPresence Mobile 2.0 app for mobile
staff using tablets and smartphones to extend video collaboration beyond the
office to virtually anywhere. 
* LOTOS Group, a major producer and supplier of oil products across Poland and
abroad, has equipped its 5,000 employees with a combined Polycom and Microsoft
UC solution to encourage knowledge sharing company-wide. 
* University of the West of England, one of the largest universities in the UK
with 30,000 student and 3,000 staff spread over four campuses, uses the Polycom
and Microsoft interoperable solution to enable distance learning among the
faculty of UWE and other institutions and students. For example, when an
international college in Asia is running a master's program associated with UWE
and a student wants an interview with his or her tutor, they connect over video.

* Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, with 17,000 healthcare staff serving
340,000 people in Northern Ireland, uses Microsoft and Polycom to deliver care
closer to where it`s needed, saving time and helping to save lives. The
interoperable solutions allow healthcare professionals to make decisions faster
and more efficiently.

"We chose Polycom primarily for their experience and reputation; secondly, the
interoperability with other systems; and thirdly because of the strength of its
strategic relationship and commitment to integrate with Microsoft Lync," said
Ernst Hutter, Head of Global IT Infrastructure, Lonza. "The combination of
Microsoft Lync and Polycom video collaboration has significantly changed our way
of working in the last two years. We have more and more home users and this has
allowed the organization to implement a more flexible working environment, so
employees can work more effectively away from the office and securely join video
meetings from home or on the move." 

Continuing commitment to Microsoft alliance

Last month, Polycom announced its intent to acquire Sentri, Inc., a leading
provider of advanced services with expertise in Microsoft technologies
(including Lync), UC, video collaboration, cloud services and networking.
Sentri is Gold certified by Microsoft in communications, messaging, portals and
collaboration, and desktop technology; Microsoft Premier Support for Lync
Partners (PSLP) certified; and has two Microsoft Certified Master engineers.
Sentri`s deep expertise integrating Microsoft Lync with Polycom solutions is a
key element of the acquisition.

SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Allen Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory &amp; Natsis LLP, a leading California-based
litigation, real estate and business law firm, is pleased to announce that
Marshall Wallace and Stephen Walters, partners in the firm's San Francisco
office, are two of the preeminent plaintiff attorneys in California according to
Benchmark: Plaintiffs, the only publication dedicated to the comprehensive
analysis of the U.S. plaintiffs bar. 

Marshall Wallace's practice focuses on high-stakes, complex business disputes.
For a quarter century he has compiled a track record of victories in challenging
contract, fraud, insurance, corporate, real estate, trade secret, and unfair
competition cases. Marshall represents plaintiffs and defendants. Nearly all of
Marshall's cases involve claims of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of
California Business and Professions Code section 17200, punitive damages, or bad
faith. His work has focused on the title insurance, financial services, real
estate and construction materials industries. Marshall is the editor of CEB
California Trial Objections and the author of CEB Summary Judgment Manual. 

Stephen Walters specializes in complex business and commercial litigation. He
has tried more than 100 jury and nonjury cases on behalf of both plaintiffs and
defendants and has represented clients in major arbitrations and before trial
and appellate courts throughout the country. Stephen has handled almost every
type of complex civil case for companies and individuals in a broad range of
industries, and recently brought lawsuits on behalf of an SEC-appointed receiver
of a Ponzi-like enterprise against alleged aiders and abettors of the securities
fraud that settled for more than $60 million. 

The Allen Matkins litigation practice group, comprising over 100 attorneys
statewide, is recognized nationally for its expertise in handling all aspects of
business, real estate, construction, bankruptcy, environmental, consumer safety,
and employment litigation. Allen Matkins enjoys an outstanding reputation for
aggressive representation of clients and successful trial results in state and
federal court jury and bench trials and arbitrations. 

Benchmark is the only publication on the market to focus exclusively on
litigation in the U.S. The guide`s results are the culmination of a six-month
research period that allows their researchers to conduct extensive interviews
with litigators and their clients. During these interviews they examine recent
casework handled by the firms and ask sources to offer their professional
opinions on litigators practicing within their state or national practice areas.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 19 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's
largest publicly traded oil company, said on Tuesday its oil and
gas reserves rose last year, boosted by output from shale
formations in the United States and projects in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserve additions from the Bakken Shale in North Dakota as
well as its Cold Lake oil sands development in Alberta helped
Exxon replace 115 percent of its 2012 output, the Irving, Texas
company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's proved reserves totaled 25.2 billion barrels
oil-equivalent (boe) at year-end 2012, up from 24.9 billion boe
in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over half of Exxon's reserves were made up of more valuable
crude oil and other liquids, an improvement over the prior year
when 51 percent of Exxon's reserves were gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon edged up 37 cents to $88.73 in late-morning
New York Stock Exchange trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

service with The Coca-Cola Company on June 1, 2013. (Photo: Business Wire)

A well-respected global leader, Jones joined The Coca-Cola Company in 1982 and
has held roles of increasing responsibility around the Company`s corporate
giving and community outreach. She has served as Chair of The Coca-Cola
Foundation since 1991. 

During her three-decade Coca-Cola career, Jones has led the transformation of
the Company`s philanthropic outreach, growing a U.S.-focused program into a
global campaign, which now includes water stewardship, active healthy living,
community recycling and education programs worldwide. Under Jones` leadership,
The Coca-Cola Foundation has awarded more than $500 million to thousands of
community organizations worldwide. 

"Over the past 30 years, I have been grateful to work for a company that commits
the talent and time of its employees and its philanthropic dollars to issues and
organizations that empower and enhance the lives of others," said Jones. "I`m
proud of the work of the Foundation and believe deeply in the people and
communities we`ve served around the world. I am fortunate to have worked with
extraordinary leaders, community supporters and caring and committed
associates." 

Jones` community and leadership accomplishments are many. They include chairing
a number of notable national and local organizations such as the United Way of
Metro Atlanta, the Woodruff Arts Center, National Black Arts Festival, and The
Carter Center Board of Advisors. In addition, she serves or has served on the
board of organizations such as Clark Atlanta University, the Congressional Black
Caucus Foundation, the Ohio State University President`s Council on Women, Girl
Scouts of the USA, The Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation and The Coca-Cola Africa
Foundation. She is currently the Chair of the National Council of Negro Women. 

A testament to her leadership within the community, Jones has received many
honors from organizations ranging from the National Urban League and the Jackie
Robinson Foundation to the Executive Leadership Council, National Women`s
Research Alliance and the YWCA of Atlanta. 

"Ingrid`s contributions to our Company and to the communities we serve worldwide
cannot be overstated," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola
Company. "Simply put, she has been the heart and soul of Coca-Cola in the
community for three decades. Her passion for serving and improving communities
has made a profound difference in the world and taught us that we all possess
the ability to transform the lives of others. We are deeply indebted to her
incomparable legacy of service and we wish her all the best as she moves into
the next phase of her life." 

The Coca-Cola Company also announced Lisa Borders will succeed Jones as Vice
President of Global Community Connections and Chair of The Coca-Cola Foundation,
effective May 1. Borders joins Coca-Cola after serving as President of the Grady
Health Foundation - the philanthropic arm of Grady Health System - Georgia`s
largest public hospital and Atlanta`s premier level I trauma center. As
Foundation President, Borders led the Greater Grady capital campaign, a
five-year, $325 million effort, and guided the system`s development efforts
during the most important period in Grady`s history. 



"I am excited to be joining a company that has played such a critical role in my
hometown and around the world not only as a driver of economic growth but of
social empowerment and philanthropic leadership," said Borders. "I look forward
to leading the work of The Coca-Cola Foundation and continuing its legacy of
service to others." 

Borders has extensive experience leading a range of community-focused civic,
philanthropic, business and political endeavors. Formerly, she served as
President of the Atlanta City Council, Vice Mayor of Atlanta and Co-Chair of the
transition team for Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. Her numerous Atlanta initiatives
have included increasing the availability of affordable housing, uncovering
transportation solutions and promoting neighborhood safety and preservation. She
holds a Bachelor`s Degree from Duke University in Durham, N.C., and a Master of
Science in Health Administration from the University of Colorado in Denver. 

A lifelong Atlanta resident, Borders has deep roots in the community. She is
currently a trustee at The Westminster Schools, a board member at Clark Atlanta
University, a member of the Board of Visitors and Board of Ethics at Emory
University, and a board member of the Atlanta Downtown Community Improvement
District (ADID). 

"Lisa is an accomplished leader in all aspects of what we call the Golden
Triangle - the partnership between civil society, business and government," said
Kent. "Her deep background in philanthropic giving, public service and corporate
strategy brings to the Company the right combination of experience to lead our
global community outreach. We welcome Lisa to the Coca-Cola family and wish her
the best of success in her new role." 

Borders will report to Bea Perez, Vice President and Chief Sustainability
Officer, The Coca-Cola Company.

"Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day" inspires middle-school students for 10th
consecutive year

* Program sparks students` curiosity in science, technology, engineering and
math 
* More than 7,000 students have participated in ExxonMobil-sponsored activities
since the program began in 2003 
* ExxonMobil to host hundreds students at 16 company locations

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
The ExxonMobil Foundation is collaborating with the National Engineers Week
Foundation for the 10th consecutive year to host Introduce a Girl to Engineering
Day at 16 company locations across the United States. The program promotes
interest in engineering among middle-school students and helps reduce the gender
gap in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. 

"We can inspire our nation`s youth to pursue STEM careers by capturing their
interest at an early age," said Suzanne McCarron, president of the ExxonMobil
Foundation. "Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day helps young women gain
self-confidence and an appreciation for the engineering profession by learning
from role models and taking part in engaging math and science activities." 

ExxonMobil employees will lead fun, hands-on activities that connect math and
science to everyday life and reinforce classroom instruction. Activities include
water-purification experiments, energy-industry demonstrations using 3D
technology to search for oil and natural gas and exploring the science of
manufacturing cosmetics. 

"The National Engineers Week Foundation is committed to helping students --
especially girls who are underrepresented in engineering and technology --
discover engineering and how it helps the world," said Leslie Collins, executive
director, National Engineers Week Foundation. "Our partnership with the
ExxonMobil Foundation enables thousands of youth to envision a fulfilling future
through a career in engineering." 

The need to engage girls in math and science studies, and eventually careers, is
critical. The National Science Foundation estimates that 80 percent of jobs in
the next decade will require math and science knowledge. The Congressional Joint
Economic Committee reports that women represent just 14 percent of engineers and
comprise only 27 percent of mathematics and computer-science professionals. 

Programs like Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day are helping more young women
gain the knowledge and skills associated with STEM careers to alleviate the
workforce deficit. 

More than 7,000 students have participated in ExxonMobil-sponsored science and
math activities since the program began in 2003.

* Positions provide range of experience for students to help community

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
The ExxonMobil Foundation announced today that 30 Dallas County nonprofit
agencies will participate in the 2013 ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program. 

"The Community Summer Jobs Program opens doors in the workforce for students
while also making a positive impact in our community," said Suzanne McCarron,
president of the ExxonMobil Foundation. 

The program provides much-needed assistance to nonprofit agencies and helps
college students gain valuable work experience and a better understanding of the
important role of nonprofit organizations. 

Paid summer internship positions involve students in a range of activities, such
as coordinating housing for area residents to implementing summer programs for
underprivileged children. In addition to daily internship duties, students also
work on a group service project. Qualified college students interested in
gaining hands-on experience in the nonprofit sector this summer are encouraged
to apply. 

To be eligible, applicants must be current undergraduate students returning to
college as a full-time (minimum 12 credit hours per semester) sophomore, junior
or senior in the fall of 2013. Interested students may contact the selected
agencies, listed below, to request applications and learn more about available
opportunities. Information is also available at csjpdallas.org. 

Since 1990, the ExxonMobil Foundation has contributed more than $3.7 million to
fund the program in Dallas, subsidizing 1,565 internships and benefitting more
than 300 agencies. 

Since the program began in 1971 in New York City, the ExxonMobil Foundation has
provided more than $17.5 million to support nearly 5,000 community summer job
internships.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chairman Bill
Gates said he was not satisfied with the company's pace of
innovation over the last few years, and that it had mishandled
its early mobile strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We didn't miss cellphones, but the way that we went about
it didn't allow us to get the leadership. It's clearly a
mistake," Gates, Microsoft's former CEO, said in a rare
interview with CBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates hedged questions on whether he was happy with Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer's performance. He said Ballmer had
achieved a lot but that both he and Ballmer were not satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(Ballmer) and I are two of the most self-critical people I
know," Gates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a lot of amazing things that Steve's leadership
achieved - Windows 8, the Surface computer, Bing, Xbox. Is it
enough? No. He and I are not satisfied that in terms of
breakthrough things we are doing everything possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer took over as Microsoft's CEO in February 2000. The
company's shares have dropped 45 percent since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former senior Microsoft executive, Joachim Kempin, said in
a book he wrote about his time at the company that Ballmer was
not the right leader for the world's largest software company
but held his grip on it by systematically forcing out any rising
manager who challenged his authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His criticism echoes that of investor David Einhorn of
Greenlight Capital, who called for Ballmer to step down in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has faced criticism for its latest Windows 8
versions for different devices, while its Bing search engine has
won only a small market share.&lt;/p&gt;

Integrated Solution Leverages Accellion Secure Container to Minimize Risks to
Data, While Increasing Productivity of Business Users On-the-Go
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Accellion, Inc., the award-winning pioneer in providing enterprise-class, secure
mobile file sharing solutions, today introduced the Accellion Mobile
Productivity Suite that combines mobile content creation and editing with secure
file sync and sharing. This industry first, mobile office productivity suite
enables users to securely create, edit, view and share Microsoft&#174; Office
documents from iOS devices. 

"Business users on-the-go look for solutions that allow them to work outside the
office. In the absence of an enterprise-sanctioned tool, they are willing to put
corporate data at risk using consumer-grade apps to be productive while mobile,"
said Chris Hazelton, research director, mobile and wireless, 451 Research. "The
ability to create, edit and share content securely on mobile devices, without
the risk of data leaks is paramount to supporting a mobilized workforce." 

The Accellion Mobile Productivity Suite is an integrated solution within the
Accellion Mobile App that allows users to securely create, edit, view, and
collaborate on Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files all within Accellion`s
secure container on iOS devices. This eliminates the risk of enterprise data
leaks from employees opening, editing and sharing documents using unapproved
consumer apps. 

In addition to supporting creation and editing of Microsoft Office documents the
Accellion Mobile App supports secure sharing of photos from a mobile device`s
camera roll or library. This is a critical capability for field workers in many
industries, including insurance, legal and construction, who take photos as part
of their work but are at risk for overlooking security and compliance
requirements for storing and sharing images. 

"In today`s mobile environment, employees need solutions that enable them to
perform their work tasks quickly, efficiently and securely. It is not enough to
simply store and view documents and images, the mobile employee needs to create,
contribute and collaborate with their coworkers, customers and partners on their
mobile devices," said Yorgen Edholm, CEO of Accellion, Inc. "Accellion is
leading the industry in delivering the solutions necessary for enabling mobile
productivity while keeping corporate data secure." 

The Accellion Mobile Productivity Suite offers an integrated solution within the
Accellion Mobile App. The Accellion Mobile Productivity Suite will be demo-ed at
the upcoming RSA Conference February 25 - March 1, 2013 in San Francisco and
will be generally available in March 2013.

Company Joins Microsoft`s Visual Studio Industry Partner Program; Hosting
Webinar to Highlight its Visual Studio Integration with TeamMentor and the
Microsoft CAT.NET Code Analysis Tool
WILMINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Security Innovation, an authority in application security assessment and
training, announced today that it has joined the Microsoft Visual Studio
Industry Partner (VSIP) Program. Security Innovation`s involvement in the
program is based on its TeamMentor solution, the company`s real-time reference
guide of secure software development standards, and its integration with Visual
Studio 2010 via the CAT.NET static code analysis plugin. 

TeamMentor is a SaaS (Software as a Service) product providing timely,
consistent and prescriptive guidance to help security and development teams
create secure software out of the box, with support for industry best practices,
coding and architectural standards. It helps teams ease compliance to internal
security policies, allowing for the creation and customization of security best
practices and standards, while reducing overall application security risk. 

TeamMentor has actionable guidance for every member of a software development
team - program managers, architects, developers, testers/QA, and deployment
managers - and its fully editable content provides coverage for a broad array of
technology platforms, including .NET, Java, PHP, Mobile (iOS and Android), C/C++
and more. TeamMentor also maps secure coding activities to compliance
requirements like the PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.) 

TeamMentor v3.2 is also available as a Visual Studio plugin that integrates
Microsoft`s CAT.NET static code analysis tool with TeamMentor`s security
guidance. This gives security and development teams comprehensive remediation
capabilities to expand the value and impact of static analysis scan results, and
fix code vulnerabilities based on specific coding patterns to permanently
eliminate problems in code moving forward.

security teams using Microsoft Visual Studio to build secure applications for
today`s modern devices and platforms," said Tom Lindeman, director of the Visual
Studio Industry Partner program at Microsoft. "We're excited to welcome Security
Innovation into the VSIP program and further support Visual Studio developers by
partnering with providers of beneficial, integrated solutions." 

Security Innovation is participating in a Microsoft webinar entitled,
"Streamline the Fix: Diminish the Impact of Software Vulnerabilities through
CAT.NET and TeamMentor Integration in Visual Studio," on February 25 at 9:00 AM
PST/12:00 PM EST. Dinis Cruz, Principal Security Engineer at Security
Innovation, and Chief Architect of TeamMentor will demonstrate the key use cases
of TeamMentor, and show how teams can leverage this free plugin to identify,
verify and fix vulnerabilities in software code.

, an add-on to Microsoft SCCM 2012 that enables companies to effectively manage a large
distributed enterprise network as if it were a single, local system. They will discuss the

Specialty Retailer Launches Movie Sweepstakes
OAKLAND, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Cost Plus World Market (www.worldmarket.com) is thrilled to announce its
collaboration with Walt Disney Studios for the theatrical release of the
fantastical adventure, "Oz The Great and Powerful," directed by Sam Raimi in
theaters and IMAX 3D on March 8, 2013. As part of its collaboration, the
specialty retailer has launched "Oz The Great and Powerful Sweepstakes Presented
by World Market" now through March 15, 2013. Customers can enter the sweepstakes
at worldmarketsweepstakes.com for a chance to win one grand prize of a private
movie screening of "Oz The Great and Powerful" for the winner and 50 guests,
free IMAX movie tickets for a year and a $1000 World Market gift card. In
addition, $500 World Market gift cards will be awarded to three runner-up
winners.* 

Disney`s "Oz The Great and Powerful" imagines the origins of L. Frank Baum`s
beloved wizard character. When Oscar Diggs (James Franco), a small-time circus
magician with dubious ethics, is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant
Land of Oz, he thinks he`s hit the jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the
taking-that is until he meets three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora
(Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams), who are not convinced he is the
great wizard everyone`s been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems
facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and
who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through
illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry-Oscar transforms himself not only
into the great wizard but into a better man as well. 

"Oz The Great and Powerful," directed by Sam Raimi, is produced by Joe Roth,
with screen story by Mitchell Kapner and screenplay by Mitchell Kapner and David
Lindsay-Abaire. Grant Curtis, Palak Patel, Josh Donen and Philip Steuer are
serving as executive producers. 

If you`re a movie fan then you know that Hollywood`s most glamorous night is
less than a week away. World Market has a great selection of affordable tabletop
serving pieces, furniture and home d&#233;cor items and gourmet food and wine to
create your own viewing party of the big awards show on Sunday night. With an
array of unique foods to create small appetizer dishes, cocktail mixes,
sparkling wines, chocolates and more, the specialty retailer is your one-stop
shopping destination for entertaining at home.

Partnership Creates Seamless EDI Integration with Microsoft Dynamics NAV and AX
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
DiCentral Inc., a leading innovator in supply chain management solutions and B2B
integration, today announced that it has partnered with Business Systems
Integrators, LLC (BSI) to offer a comprehensive EDI integration system for
suppliers and distributors using Microsoft Dynamics ERP Systems. The partnership
will enable all Dynamics NAV and AX users to easily and seamlessly integrate a
world-class EDI and communications platform into the user`s ERP system.
DiCentral will showcase the integration solutions at Microsoft Convergence on
March 18 - 21 in Booth #851 at the New Orleans Memorial Convention Center in New
Orleans, Louisiana. 

"BSI is excited to be providing a robust, best-of-breed joint EDI solution with
DiCentral. This joint solution provides a comprehensive, tailored solution for
Microsoft Dynamics users," stated Larry Knoch, CEO of BSI. 

Traditionally, integrating EDI functionality in Dynamics NAV has been cost
prohibitive, lengthy and complex. However, DiCentral and BSI`s joint solution
enables suppliers to almost instantly add distribution and supply chain
functionality to Dynamics NAV. Building upon functionality found in Microsoft
Dynamics NAV 2009 Service Pack 1, the joint solution provides customized client
interfaces to accommodate company requirements. Additionally, the solution
utilizes Microsoft web services and cloud computing technology to ensure
application availability and efficient use of resources. 

Microsoft Dynamics AX users can also benefit from customized implementation and
comprehensive data flow with DiCentral and BSI`s integration solution.
DiCentral`s vast knowledge in B2B data integration and BSI`s insight and
extensive experience with Dynamics AX prove to be a natural fit and a win-win
for both their current and potential clients. This alliance brings together the
engineering and development strength of two leading pioneers in each field. 

Adoption of EDI by many companies has been slow in the past because of the
complex and expensive process of mapping channels between trading partners.
DiCentral and BSI take on the responsibility for mapping user connections and
keeping them current when trading partners make changes. In addition, they are
committed to consistently supporting updates to the Dynamics ERP systems to
ensure easy upgrades for users. This saves an extraordinary amount of time and
allows for Dynamics ERP users to become EDI compliant quickly and easily. 

"DiCentral welcomes the opportunity to work with BSI to deliver high quality EDI
integration solutions to the Microsoft Dynamics ERP community," stated Jimmy
Payne, Senior Director of Global Channels at DiCentral. "This alliance will
simplify supply chain communication and improve the EDI integration experience
for Dynamics ERP users."

provider that supports and services the Microsoft Dynamics product lines. BSI

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Celtic Exploration Ltd CLT.TO said the Canadian government has approved its acquisition by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), paving the way for the $2.64 billion deal to be closed four months after it was first announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celtic Exploration said in a statement late on Wednesday that no further regulatory approvals are required as the Minister of Industry approved the transaction under the terms of the Investment Canada Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Exxon Mobil's Canadian subsidiary, ExxonMobil Canada, agreed to buy Celtic Exploration for C$2.6 billion ($2.64 billion), in a deal to raise its presence in some of Western Canada's most promising shale oil and gas regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key provision in the Investment Canada Act requires the government to determine whether certain foreign investments in Canada are of net benefit to the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December Canada approved China's biggest foreign takeover, the $15.1 billion bid by CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK) for energy company Nexen Inc, but drew a line in the sand against future acquisitions by foreign state-owned enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Michael Urquhart)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* PlayStation 4 to launch during holiday season&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* It will have cloud-gaming capabilities, new interface&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* New controller has touch pad, camera&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft rumored to unveil Xbox successor this summer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Liana B. Baker and Malathi Nayak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Sony Corp said it will
launch its next-generation PlayStation this year, hoping its
first video game console in seven years will give it a
much-needed head start over the next version of Microsoft's Xbox
and help revive its stumbling electronics business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new console will have a revamped interface, let users
stream and play video games hosted on servers, and allow users
to play while downloading titles as well as share videos with
friends. Its new controller, dubbed DualShock 4, will have a
touchpad and a camera that can sense the depth of the
environment in front of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony, which only displayed the controller but not the
console, said on Wednesday the PlayStation 4 would be available
for the year-end holiday season and flagged games from the likes
of  Ubisoft Entertainment SA and Activision Blizzard
Inc, whose top executives also attended the glitzy
launch event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not disclose pricing or an exact launch date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony's announcement comes amid industry speculation that
Microsoft Corp is set to unveil the successor to its
Xbox 360 later this summer. The current Xbox 360 beats the
seven-year-old PlayStation 3's online network with features such
as voice commands on interactive gaming and better connectivity
to smartphones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all video game console makers are grappling with the
onslaught of mobile devices into their turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tablets and smartphones built by rivals such as Apple Inc
 and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd already
account for around 10 percent of the $80 billion gaming market.
Those mobile devices, analysts predict, will within a few years
be as powerful as the current slew of game-only consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks good and had a lot of great games but the industry
is different now," Billy Pidgeon, an analyst at Inside Network
Research, said of the new PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll be a slow burn and not heavy uptake right away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIGRATION TO MOBILE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Console makers will also have to tackle flagging video game
hardware and software sales, which research firm NPD group says
have dropped consistently every month over the last year as
users migrate to free game content on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PlayStation 4 will have an app on Android and Apple mobile
devices that connects to console games and can act as a second
screen, Jack Tretton, President and CEO of Sony Computer
Entertainment of America, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Playstation 4 ... really connects every device in the
office and the smartphone and the tablet out there in the
world," Tretton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The console, which has been in development for the last five
years, will have 8 GB of memory and will instantly stream game
content from the console to Sony's handheld PlayStation Vita
through a feature called "Remote Play," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Sony is banking on is the ease of the use of this
system," Greg Miller, PlayStation executive editor at video game
site IGN.com, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six years, Sony PlayStation sales are just shy of
Xbox's 67 million installed base and well behind the 100 million
Wii consoles sold by Nintendo Co Ltd, according to
analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tretton said it would be a big undertaking to manufacture
and distribute the console in Sony's four major markets by the
end of the year, adding that it would be a "phased rollout" that
starts before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia predicted Sony would 
probably get a couple of million units of the PlayStation 4 out
by the 2013 holiday season and 7 million or 8 million out a year
later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony also announced a strategic partnership with video game
publisher Activision Blizzard to take its Diablo III game to the
PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activision's upcoming sci-fi shooter game "Destiny" in
development by its Bungie Studio will also be available on
PlayStation consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 20 (Reuters) - Celtic Exploration Ltd said the
Canadian government has approved its acquisition by Exxon Mobil
Corp, paving the way for the $2.64 billion deal to be
closed four months after it was first announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celtic Exploration said in a statement late on Wednesday
that no further regulatory approvals are required as the
Minister of Industry approved the transaction under the terms of
the Investment Canada Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Exxon Mobil's Canadian subsidiary, ExxonMobil
Canada, agreed to buy Celtic Exploration for C$2.6 billion
($2.64 billion), in a deal to raise its presence in some of
Western Canada's most promising shale oil and gas regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key provision in the Investment Canada Act requires the
government to determine whether certain foreign investments in
Canada are of net benefit to the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December Canada approved China's biggest foreign
takeover, the $15.1 billion bid by CNOOC Ltd for
energy company Nexen Inc, but drew a line in the sand against
future acquisitions by foreign state-owned enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge dropped criminal charges against Chevron Corp, Transocean Ltd and 17 of their employees related to a November 2011 offshore oil spill, the companies said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case, and a civil suit seeking as much as 40 billion reais ($20.4 billion) in damages, have cast a chill over Brazil's oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal suit carried penalties of up to 31 years. The still-open civil case is Brazil's largest-ever environmental lawsuit, even though the amount of oil spilled was much less than other recent spills in Brazil and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilian oil output fell in 2012, and shutting Chevron operations in the South American country contributed to the decline. Investor interest was already waning in the face of regulatory changes and a bitter dispute over royalties that have blocked the sale of new exploration licenses for four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron has been tied up for more than a year over a spill that caused no real damage," said Adriano Pires, head of the Brazil Infrastructure Institute, a Rio de Janeiro energy think-tank. "It's impossible to understand how a country that wants to attract investment would have taken so long to dismiss the case against Chevron."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said failure to resolve the legal actions related to the spill will make it hard for Brazil to attract investment for three oil and gas rights auctions planned for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With criminal charges dismissed, industry watchers will focus on the civil case and Chevron administrative efforts to restart output in the Frade field, where the spill occurred in November and all output was stopped in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Chevron and Brazilian prosecutors said they were near a settlement in the civil case and that Chevron was ready to pay 311 million reais ($159 million) to compensate for damages caused by the spill, less than 1 percent of the amount initially sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor called the offer "reasonable." Chevron said a settlement would render the suits extinct and that it, and not Transocean, would pay all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in December that a settlement of 30 million reais would be reasonable. They based their estimate on the size of financial awards in the Deepwater Horizon case and Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIELD RESTART DELAYED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Chevron expressed hope that it would be able to restart output at the Frade field by early January. But output remains stalled. Court holidays delayed resolution of the civil case and Brasil's oil regulator, the ANP, moved more slowly than expected on renewing Chevron's authorization to pump oil from the Frade field, an oil industry executive involved in planning for the field told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron and its partners "had hoped to be producing oil again from Frade by now," said the executive, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the press. "We got caught by the year-end, then the Carnaval holidays."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frade field is 52 percent owned by California-based Chevron, 30 percent by Brazil's state-led Petroleo Brasileiro SA and 18 percent by Frade Jap&#227;o, a group owned by Japanese trading companies Inpex Corp and Sojitz Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's global output in 2012 was 70,000 barrels per day short of company expectations. The loss of Frade was responsible for about 40 percent of that loss, according to Chief Financial Officer Patricia Yerrington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restart requires approval of the ANP. The regulator's website said the restart was not on the agenda of its board meeting Wednesday, and officials could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrobras, as the Brazilian company is known, Sojitz and Inpex were never charged in relation to the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECISION WELCOMED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The press offices of Chevron and Transocean confirmed a Reuters report of the dismissal of criminal charges, which had been based on three sources with direct knowledge of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sources told Reuters that prosecutors can still appeal the ruling dismissing the charges, made by Judge Marcelo Luzio of the 10th Criminal Unit of the Rio de Janeiro Federal Court. The sources asked not to be named because their employers do not allow them to speak about the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We welcome this news that the Court recognized, with respect to the Frade event of November 2011, that Transocean's crews did exactly what they were trained to do, acting responsibly, appropriately and quickly while always maintaining safety as their top priority," Guy Cantwell, a Transocean spokesman in Houston, said in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal charges were filed last March by Eduardo Santos de Oliveira, the same Brazilian prosecutor who filed the civil lawsuit. Oliveria, who is on vacation, told Reuters on Wednesday he had not yet been informed of the dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dos Santos, who works from Campos, Brazil, in northern Rio de Janeiro state, was taken off the cases when they were moved to the city of Rio de Janeiro, the state capital. He considers the spill one of the worst ecological disasters in Brazil's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'NO DISCERNABLE DAMAGE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ANP reported last year that the 3,600 barrel spill in the Frade field was quickly stopped, cleaned up and caused no discernable environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spill was less than 1/1000th of the size of BP Plc's Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. The Frade spill never came close to shore and no workers were injured. In the Deepwater Horizon disaster 11 died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in a statement that it "is pleased by the court's decision. Chevron Brasil remains committed to its policy of full transparency and close cooperation with the Brazilian authorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares fell 0.8 percent in New York on Wednesday afternoon, in line with a broader stock market decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Transocean, which was also operator of the Deepwater Horizon rig which burned and sank in 2010 after BP's Macondo well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, dropped 3.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 1.96 Brazilian reais)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Braden Reddall in San Franciso; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is investigating JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) over allegations that Bear Stearns provided misleading information about its mortgage products during the lead-up to the financial crisis, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns in a 2008 fire sale encouraged by the government, and has pushed back against various government suits that have sought to hold JPMorgan accountable for the failed investment bank's alleged mortgage-related misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this investigation, civil lawyers in the Justice Department are looking into whether Bear Stearns altered due diligence information that third parties provided about the quality of mortgage loans packaged into securities, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation, which is in early stages, shows that enforcement authorities are still actively building cases amid criticism that institutions have not adequately been held to account for their role in causing the 2007-2009 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment. DOJ spokeswoman Adora Andy also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department last year issued more than a dozen civil subpoenas to top financial institutions as part of an inquiry into the packaging and sale of home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pending inquiries at the Justice Department are largely an outgrowth of a state-federal initiative known as the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, which President Barack Obama announced during his 2012 State of the Union speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the co-chairs of the group, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, already sued JPMorgan for fraud over Bear Stearns' packaging and sale of mortgage securities in the run up to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the recent Justice Department investigation into JPMorgan will result in enforcement action or might merge with mortgage-related probes by other agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sign of how important the department appears to view these cases, the JPMorgan inquiry involves lawyers close to acting associate attorney general Tony West, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West led the department's civil division until last February when he was promoted to his current post as the agency's third in command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another sign U.S. authorities are actively pursuing mortgage-related inquiries, the inspector general's office of the Federal Housing Finance Agency is hosting a training session this week with members of the RMBS working group, including federal prosecutors, members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, special agents and others, a person familiar with the training said. The group has held several similar sessions in the past year, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIVATE SUITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ inquiry into the due diligence performed for Bear Stearns tracks accusations detailed in private lawsuits against the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns hired Mortgage Data Management Corp to review a sample of loans in a 2006 mortgage securitization, according to a case filed against JPMorgan last year by bond insurer MBIA Inc (MBI.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers concluded that around one-third of the loans had serious credit and compliance problems, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bear Stearns altered the electronic spreadsheets to conceal the problems, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in New York State Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns removed 50 columns of information from the spreadsheet that showed the issues and then sent the altered report to MBIA, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its answer to the MBIA complaint, JPMorgan denied the allegations that it had altered the spreadsheets. That case is pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LATEST LEGAL HEADACHE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has recently been hit by a wave of lawsuits over the conduct of Bear Stearns that appear to have some overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York's case, filed in October, accuses Bear Stearns of causing some $22.5 billion in losses to investors of mortgage-backed securities by failing to ensure the quality of the underlying loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, the U.S. credit union regulator sued the bank over $3.6 billion in securities sold by Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in November, JPMorgan paid $296.9 million to settle a case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that accused Bear of failing to disclose it had arranged discounted cash settlements with originators that left investors stuck with problem loans. The SEC also accused JPMorgan itself of overstating the quality of home loans that backed a $1.8 billion residential mortgage-backed securities offering it underwrote in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's chief executive Jamie Dimon has said the bank is continuing to pay the price for doing "a favor" for the Federal Reserve in agreeing to rescue Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inquires are the latest legal headache for JPMorgan, which also faces separate investigations from a trading loss of $6.2 billion that sprung from a botched hedging strategy carried out in its London office, and inquiries into whether its traders manipulated benchmark interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Karen Freifeld in New York and Aruna Viswanatha in Washington; Editing by Karey Wutkowski and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Weak market has battered U.S. coal miners&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Company is facing proxy challenge from hedge fund&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Miner reports a $71.0 million loss vs a year-earlier
profit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Allison Martell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 20 (Reuters) - Walter Energy Inc, squaring off
with a hedge fund that wants to replace half its board, reported
a wider-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday as a drop in
metallurgical coal prices held back the miner's revenue, sending
its shares lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results followed word on Tuesday that hedge fund Audley
Capital Advisors LLP plans to nominate five candidates to Walter
Energy's 10-member board. The fund criticized Walter Energy for
missing forecasts and said its directors have very little mining
experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond James analyst Jim Rollyson said Wednesday's results
did nothing to hurt Audley's case, but he also said the fund
seems to have only a small stake in Walter Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a little unusual to have an activist that is barely an
owner, but you can't really disagree with some of their logic,"
he said, noting that the company has had a number of chief
executives, and has struggled to hit its forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Tuesday, Walter Energy said it is
"committed to creating value for all shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audley owns less than 1 percent of Walter Energy, according
to disclosures included with its release on Tuesday. But it is
no stranger to the miner - it was a major shareholder in Western
Coal, acquired by Walter in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Walter Energy's production is metallurgical coal,
used to make steel. It also sells some thermal coal, most often
used to generate electricity. It has operations in western
Canada, the United States and Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's stock, which closed down 8.0 percent on
Wednesday as commodity prices tumbled, fell a further 5.9
percent to $34.60 in aftermarket trading in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEAK MARKET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent quarters, metallurgical coal miners' sales volumes
and prices have been under pressure, hurt in part by weak demand
from China, the world's largest producer and consumer of steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low thermal coal prices also battered U.S. coal miners, and
a number of Walter Energy's competitors have curbed output to
weather the tough market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Alpha Natural Resources Inc's shares
soared after aggressive cost-cutting helped it pull off a
narrower-than-expected operating loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Walter Energy's fourth quarter metallurgical coal
production was lower than in the third quarter, it was still 6
percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walter's been, kind of, seemingly just biding its time,
waiting for the market to improve, which hasn't happened yet,"
said Rollyson. "They either need to dial back production ... or
the market needs to improve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it expects 2013 metallurgical coal
production to be in line with 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although there are clear signs of improving trends in
global demand and pricing for met coal, our current outlook for
2013 remains cautious and we are focused on driving further
efficiency in our business," said Chief Executive Walter
Scheller in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EARNINGS, REVENUE MISS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said metallurgical coal prices averaged $149 per
tonne, 22 percent lower than in the third quarter, and 39
percent lower than the fourth quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its net loss for the quarter to Dec. 31 came in at $71.0
million, or $1.13 a share, compared with a profit of $80.3
million, or $1.29, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding impairment and restructuring charges, the adjusted
loss was $66.4 million. That is equivalent to a loss of $1.06 a
share, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Birmingham, Alabama-based company said revenue dropped
to $478.8 million, from $703.0 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, had been expecting a loss of 89 cents

&lt;p&gt;Feb 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is
investigating JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co over allegations that
Bear Stearns provided misleading information about its mortgage
products during the lead-up to the financial crisis, according
to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns in a 2008 fire sale
encouraged by the government, and has pushed back against
various government suits that have sought to hold JPMorgan
accountable for the failed investment bank's alleged
mortgage-related misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this investigation, civil lawyers in the Justice
Department are looking into whether Bear Stearns altered due
diligence information that third parties provided about the
quality of mortgage loans packaged into securities, said the
people, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the
probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation, which is in early stages, shows that
enforcement authorities are still actively building cases amid
criticism that institutions have not adequately been held to
account for their role in causing the 2007-2009 financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. DOJ spokeswoman Adora Andy also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department last year issued more than a dozen
civil subpoenas to top financial institutions as part of an
inquiry into the packaging and sale of home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pending inquiries at the Justice Department are largely an
outgrowth of a state-federal initiative known as the Residential
Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, which President Barack
Obama announced during his 2012 State of the Union speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the co-chairs of the group, New York Attorney General
Eric Schneiderman, already sued JPMorgan for fraud over Bear
Stearns' packaging and sale of mortgage securities in the run up
to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the recent Justice Department
investigation into JPMorgan will result in enforcement action or
might merge with mortgage-related probes by other agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sign of how important the department appears to view
these cases, the JPMorgan inquiry involves lawyers close to
acting associate attorney general Tony West, according to people
familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West led the department's civil division until last February
when he was promoted to his current post as the agency's third
in command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another sign U.S. authorities are actively pursuing
mortgage-related inquiries, the inspector general's office of
the Federal Housing Finance Agency is hosting a training session
this week with members of the RMBS working group, including
federal prosecutors, members of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, special agents and others, a person familiar with
the training said. The group has held several similar sessions
in the past year, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIVATE SUITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ inquiry into the due diligence performed for Bear
Stearns tracks accusations detailed in private lawsuits against
the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns hired Mortgage Data Management Corp to review a
sample of loans in a 2006 mortgage securitization, according to
a case filed against JPMorgan last year by bond insurer MBIA Inc
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers concluded that around one-third of the loans had
serious credit and compliance problems, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bear Stearns altered the electronic spreadsheets to
conceal the problems, according to the lawsuit, which was filed
in New York State Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns removed 50 columns of information from the
spreadsheet that showed the issues and then sent the altered
report to MBIA, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its answer to the MBIA complaint, JPMorgan denied the
allegations that it had altered the spreadsheets. That case is
pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LATEST LEGAL HEADACHE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has recently been hit by a wave of lawsuits over
the conduct of Bear Stearns that appear to have some overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York's case, filed in October, accuses Bear Stearns of
causing some $22.5 billion in losses to investors of
mortgage-backed securities by failing to ensure the quality of
the underlying loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, the U.S. credit union regulator sued the bank
over $3.6 billion in securities sold by Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in November, JPMorgan paid $296.9 million to settle a
case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that
accused Bear of failing to disclose it had arranged discounted
cash settlements with originators that left investors stuck with
problem loans. The SEC also accused JPMorgan itself of
overstating the quality of home loans that backed a $1.8 billion
residential mortgage-backed securities offering it underwrote in
2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's chief executive Jamie Dimon has said the bank is
continuing to pay the price for doing "a favor" for the Federal
Reserve in agreeing to rescue Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inquires are the latest legal headache for JPMorgan,
which also faces separate investigations from a trading loss of
$6.2 billion that sprung from a botched hedging strategy carried
out in its London office, and inquiries into whether its traders
manipulated benchmark interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge dropped criminal charges against Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Transocean Ltd (RIG.N) and 17 of their employees related to a November 2011 offshore oil spill, the companies said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case, and a civil suit seeking as much as 40 billion reais ($20.4 billion) in damages, have cast a chill over Brazil's oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal suit carried penalties of up to 31 years. The still-open civil case is Brazil's largest-ever environmental lawsuit, even though the amount of oil spilled was much less than other recent spills in Brazil and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilian oil output fell in 2012, and shutting Chevron operations in the South American country contributed to the decline. Investor interest was already waning in the face of regulatory changes and a bitter dispute over royalties that have blocked the sale of new exploration licenses for four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron has been tied up for more than a year over a spill that caused no real damage," said Adriano Pires, head of the Brazil Infrastructure Institute, a Rio de Janeiro energy think-tank. "It's impossible to understand how a country that wants to attract investment would have taken so long to dismiss the case against Chevron."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said failure to resolve the legal actions related to the spill will make it hard for Brazil to attract investment for three oil and gas rights auctions planned for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With criminal charges dismissed, industry watchers will focus on the civil case and Chevron administrative efforts to restart output in the Frade field, where the spill occurred in November and all output was stopped in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Chevron and Brazilian prosecutors said they were near a settlement in the civil case and that Chevron was ready to pay 311 million reais ($159 million) to compensate for damages caused by the spill, less than 1 percent of the amount initially sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor called the offer "reasonable." Chevron said a settlement would render the suits extinct and that it, and not Transocean, would pay all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in December that a settlement of 30 million reais would be reasonable. They based their estimate on the size of financial awards in the Deepwater Horizon case and Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIELD RESTART DELAYED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Chevron expressed hope that it would be able to restart output at the Frade field by early January. But output remains stalled. Court holidays delayed resolution of the civil case and Brasil's oil regulator, the ANP, moved more slowly than expected on renewing Chevron's authorization to pump oil from the Frade field, an oil industry executive involved in planning for the field told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron and its partners "had hoped to be producing oil again from Frade by now," said the executive, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the press. "We got caught by the year-end, then the Carnaval holidays."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frade field is 52 percent owned by California-based Chevron, 30 percent by Brazil's state-led Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) and 18 percent by Frade Jap&#227;o, a group owned by Japanese trading companies Inpex Corp (1605.T) and Sojitz Corp (2768.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's global output in 2012 was 70,000 barrels per day short of company expectations. The loss of Frade was responsible for about 40 percent of that loss, according to Chief Financial Officer Patricia Yerrington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restart requires approval of the ANP. The regulator's website said the restart was not on the agenda of its board meeting Wednesday, and officials could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrobras, as the Brazilian company is known, Sojitz and Inpex were never charged in relation to the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECISION WELCOMED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The press offices of Chevron and Transocean confirmed a Reuters report of the dismissal of criminal charges, which had been based on three sources with direct knowledge of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sources told Reuters that prosecutors can still appeal the ruling dismissing the charges, made by Judge Marcelo Luzio of the 10th Criminal Unit of the Rio de Janeiro Federal Court.

Oliveria, who is on vacation, told Reuters on Wednesday he had not yet been informed of the dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dos Santos, who works from Campos, Brazil, in northern Rio de Janeiro state, was taken off the cases when they were moved to the city of Rio de Janeiro, the state capital.

&lt;p&gt;* Companies still face civil lawsuit over 2011 oil spill
    * Case has helped chill interest in Brazil's oil frontier
    * ANP OK for Frade field restart delayed by holidays -source


    By Jeb Blount
    RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge dropped
criminal charges against Chevron Corp, Transocean Ltd
 and 17 of their employees related to a November 2011
offshore oil spill, the companies said on Wednesday.
    The criminal case, and a civil suit seeking as much as 40
billion reais ($20.4 billion) in damages, have cast a chill over
Brazil's oil industry.
    The criminal suit carried penalties of up to 31 years. The
still-open civil case is Brazil's largest-ever environmental
lawsuit, even though the amount of oil spilled was much less
than other recent spills in Brazil and abroad.
    Brazilian oil output fell in 2012, and shutting Chevron
operations in the South American country contributed to the
decline. Investor interest was already waning in the face of
regulatory changes and a bitter dispute over royalties that have
blocked the sale of new exploration licenses for four years.
    "Chevron has been tied up for more than a year over a spill
that caused no real damage," said Adriano Pires, head of the
Brazil Infrastructure Institute, a Rio de Janeiro energy
think-tank. "It's impossible to understand how a country that
wants to attract investment would have taken so long to dismiss
the case against Chevron."
    He said failure to resolve the legal actions related to the
spill will make it hard for Brazil to attract investment for
three oil and gas rights auctions planned for later this year.
    
    
    
    With criminal charges dismissed, industry watchers will
focus on the civil case and Chevron administrative efforts to
restart output in the Frade field, where the spill occurred in
November and all output was stopped in March.
    In December, Chevron and Brazilian prosecutors said they
were near a settlement in the civil case and that Chevron was
ready to pay 311 million reais ($159 million) to compensate for
damages caused by the spill, less than 1 percent of the amount
initially sought. 
    The prosecutor called the offer "reasonable." Chevron said a
settlement would render the suits extinct and that it, and not
Transocean, would pay all costs.
    Chevron said in December that a settlement of 30 million
reais would be reasonable. They based their estimate on the size
of financial awards in the Deepwater Horizon case and Exxon
Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989.
   
    FIELD RESTART DELAYED
    In December, Chevron expressed hope that it would be able to
restart output at the Frade field by early January. But output
remains stalled. Court holidays delayed resolution of the civil
case and Brasil's oil regulator, the ANP, moved more slowly than
expected on renewing Chevron's authorization to pump oil from
the Frade field, an oil industry executive involved in planning
for the field told Reuters.
    Chevron and its partners "had hoped to be producing oil
again from Frade by now," said the executive, who asked not to
be named because he is not authorized to talk to the press. "We
got caught by the year-end, then the Carnaval holidays."
    The Frade field is 52 percent owned by California-based
Chevron, 30 percent by Brazil's state-led Petroleo Brasileiro SA
 and 18 percent by Frade Jap&#227;o, a group owned by
Japanese trading companies Inpex Corp and Sojitz Corp
.
    Chevron's global output in 2012 was 70,000 barrels per day
short of company expectations. The loss of Frade was responsible
for about 40 percent of that loss, according to Chief Financial
Officer Patricia Yerrington.
    Restart requires approval of the ANP. The regulator's
website said the restart was not on the agenda of its board
meeting Wednesday, and officials could not be immediately
reached for comment.
    Petrobras, as the Brazilian company is known, Sojitz and
Inpex were never charged in relation to the spill.
        
    DECISION WELCOMED
    The press offices of Chevron and Transocean confirmed a
Reuters report of the dismissal of criminal charges, which had
been based on three sources with direct knowledge of the case.
    One of the sources told Reuters that prosecutors can still
appeal the ruling dismissing the charges, made by Judge Marcelo
Luzio of the 10th Criminal Unit of the Rio de Janeiro Federal
Court. The sources asked not to be named because their employers
do not allow them to speak about the case.
    "We welcome this news that the Court recognized, with
respect to the Frade event of November 2011, that Transocean's
crews did exactly what they were trained to do, acting
responsibly, appropriately and quickly while always maintaining
safety as their top priority," Guy Cantwell, a Transocean
spokesman in Houston, said in an e-mailed statement.
     The criminal charges were filed last March by Eduardo
Santos de Oliveira, the same Brazilian prosecutor who filed the
civil lawsuit. Oliveria, who is on vacation, told Reuters on
Wednesday he had not yet been informed of the dismissal.
    Dos Santos, who works from Campos, Brazil, in northern Rio
de Janeiro state, was taken off the cases when they were moved
to the city of Rio de Janeiro, the state capital. He considers
the spill one of the worst ecological disasters in Brazil's
history.
    
    'NO DISCERNABLE DAMAGE"
    But the ANP reported last year that the 3,600 barrel spill
in the Frade field was quickly stopped, cleaned up and caused no
discernable environmental damage.
    The spill was less than 1/1000th of the size of BP Plc's
 Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. The Frade spill never
came close to shore and no workers were injured. In the
Deepwater Horizon disaster 11 died.
    Chevron said in a statement that it "is pleased by the
court's decision. Chevron Brasil remains committed to its policy
of full transparency and close cooperation with the Brazilian
authorities."
    Chevron shares fell 0.8 percent in New York on Wednesday
afternoon, in line with a broader stock market decline.
     Shares of Transocean, which was also operator of the
Deepwater Horizon rig which burned and sank in 2010 after BP's
Macondo well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, dropped 3.4
percent.

&lt;p&gt;* Customs officials seized container at timber yard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Investigation continuing, three people arrested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Neil Marks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GEORGETOWN, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Drug enforcement agents in
Guyana found 360 kg (794 pounds) of cocaine hidden in a shipment
of timber destined for the Netherlands, one of the biggest ever
seizures in the South American country, officials said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customs agents had been holding the container for more than
a month at the Dutch-run Guyana Timber Products yard while they
ran checks, and on Tuesday they drilled into the wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 314 bricks of cocaine were found in seven of the
logs when they were pried open. Three people were detained, the
authorities said, including a Dutch national.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA) said the timber had been
inspected and certified by the state forestry commission, but
that staff from its Drug Enforcement Unit noticed discrepancies
between the paperwork and the container's contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The GRA is continuing its investigation of any possible
involvement by external agencies and the exporter in attempting
to secret the substance in the logs," it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country's biggest drugs bust was in 1998, when more than
three tonnes - 3,154 kg (6,940 pounds) - of cocaine was found
hidden in an empty fuel tank of a Panamanian-owned cargo ship
bound for the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guyana's political opposition has accused the government of
not doing enough to tackle trafficking and violence linked to
drugs gangs. The government rejects that and says it is working
to strengthen the nation's security forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. diplomatic cable from 2007, published by WikiLeaks,
says the United States was unable to advance on a proposal to
open a Drug Enforcement Administration office in Guyana due to
"lack of progress in addressing drug trafficking issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Daniel Wallis and Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

Walter Energy Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Results

BIRMINGHAM, AL--(Marketwire - February 20, 2013) - Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE:
WLT) (TSX: WLT), the world's leading, publicly traded "pure-play" producer of
metallurgical (met) coal for the global steel industry, today announced
results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2012 that reflect cost
control initiatives, aggressive production management and disciplined capital
spending, in light of significantly lower global pricing levels.

Revenues were $479 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, down from $703
million in the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily due to reduced demand and
pricing for met coal. The realized price of met coal declined 39% compared
with the fourth quarter of 2011. The Company reported a net loss for the
quarter of $71 million or $1.13 loss per diluted share. This loss includes
impairment and restructuring charges of $6.8 million primarily in connection
with a reduction in spending at the Aberpergwm mine in the United Kingdom.
Excluding these charges, adjusted net loss and adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) for the
quarter were $66 million and $7 million, respectively. Results for the quarter
also included a $71 million tax benefit.

For the year, the Company recorded revenues of $2.4 billion and a net loss of
$1.1 billion including impairment and restructuring charges of $1.1 billion.
Excluding these charges, the Company's adjusted net income was $31 million and
adjusted EBITDA was $412 million.

2012 Achievements

During 2012, the Company: 


Achieved record metallurgical coal production of 11.7- million metric tons
(MMTs) 
Improved cash cost per ton of production of met coal by 6% 
Enhanced liquidity and extended its debt maturities by issuing $500 million of
senior notes due 2020 
Improved the total reportable injury rate by 26% as compared with 2011 


"Walter Energy made solid operational progress during 2012, in the face of
challenging market conditions. We safely increased our production of met coal
to a record 11.7- MMTs, strengthened our senior management team and put in
place a highly competitive operating platform that reduced our cost of
production," said Walter Scheller, Chief Executive Officer. "In the fourth
quarter, we responded to the lower pricing and demand environment by executing
the strategy announced last quarter to reconfigure our Canadian operations in
order to lower production and reduce costs. Further, we reduced spending at
the Aberpergwm mine in the United Kingdom."

Mr. Scheller continued, "Although there are clear signs of improving trends in
global demand and pricing for met coal, our current outlook for 2013 remains
cautious and we are focused on driving further efficiency in our business. We
currently expect sales and production of met coal in 2013 to be in line with
2012. However, we are extremely well positioned to increase sales and
production to capitalize on anticipated improvements in pricing and demand
when market conditions warrant."

Production

In the fourth quarter of 2012, Walter Energy produced 2.5 MMTs of met coal,
down from a record third quarter 2012 production of 3.3 MMTs but an increase
from the 2.3 MMTs produced in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Hard coking coal production decreased to 2.0 MMTs in the fourth quarter 2012
as compared with 2.4 MMTs in the third quarter 2012 and 1.8 MMTs in the fourth
quarter 2011. Fourth quarter pulverized coal injection (PCI) production of
476,000 metric tons (MTs) decreased 51%, as compared to the 963,000 MTs
produced in the third quarter of 2012 and 3% from the 489,000 MTs produced in
the fourth quarter 2011.

Sales Volume and Price

In 2012, Walter Energy sold 10.4 MMTs of met coal, up 19% from 8.7 MMTs of met
coal sales in 2011. Fourth quarter 2012 met coal sales volume totaled 2.5 MMTs
as compared with 2.6 MMTs sold in the third quarter 2012 and 2.4 MMTs sold in
the fourth quarter of 2011.

Met coal prices averaged $149 per MT in the quarter, a decrease of 22% from
the average of $191 per MT in the third quarter of 2012 and a 39% decrease as
compared with the $242 per MT of the fourth quarter 2011.

The consolidated cash cost of sales for met coal was $135 per MT in the fourth
quarter of 2012, as compared with $132 per MT in the third quarter of 2012 and
$139 per MT in the fourth quarter of 2011.

In the U.S. operations, the cash cost of sales for met coal was $118 per MT in
the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared with $119 per MT in the third quarter
of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011.

2012 was $95 per MT, a 20% improvement as compared with $119 per MT in the
fourth quarter of 2011.

$74 per MT in the fourth quarter of 2012 from $77 per MT in the third quarter
2012 and $78 per MT in the fourth quarter of 2011. The cash cost of production
for mid-volatility hard coking coal was $102 per MT in the fourth quarter of
2012 as compared with $95 per MT in the third quarter of 2012 and $113 per MT
in the fourth quarter of 2011. The cash cost of production for low-volatility
PCI was $125 per MT in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared with $96 per MT
in the third quarter of 2012 and $204 per MT in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Capital Expenditures

The Company's capital expenditures were $60 million for the fourth quarter
2012 and $392 million for the year, compared with $121 million and $415
million, respectively in the prior year periods. For 2013, the Company
continues to expect capital expenditures of approximately $220 million.

Company issued $500 million in senior notes due in 2020 to enhance liquidity
and improve our debt maturity profile.

of locations are achieving lower total reportable injury rates. On a
consolidated basis, Walter's total reportable injury rate decreased by 26% in
2012 as compared with 2011.

During 2012, Walter Energy earned safety awards in Canada, West Virginia and

(1) Certain previously reported three months ended December 31, 2011
statistical information have been recast to reflect the effects of
finalizing the allocation of the Western Coal purchase price during the 2012
first quarter.
(2) Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton is based on reported Cost of Sales
and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other
similar production and sales cost items but excludes depreciation, depletion
and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost of Production per Ton is
based on period costs of mining and includes items such as manpower, fuel
and other similar production items but excludes depreciation, depletion and
post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost per Ton are non-GAAP financial
measures which are not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental to, and
not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in
conformity with GAAP. We believe Average Cash Cost per Ton are useful
measures of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts
in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and
future potential performance. Average Cash Costof Sales per Ton may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

(4) During the third quarter of 2012, in our Canadian and U.K. operations
 certain metrics around tons included in production were realigned to align
 with how we account for production in the U.S. operations. Historically,
 the Canadian and U.K. operations were not recording tons produced until
 they were deemed finished goods. We revised this methodology to include all
 tons mined, no matter if in process or finished, as produced based on a
 clean coal tonnage equivalent. Our Form 8-K filed on November 5, 2012,
 includes a reconciliation of production statistics previously presented as
 compared with the realigned methodology from the Western Coal acquisition
 date of April 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012.

 considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to
 financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that
 EBITDA is a useful measure as some investors and analysts use EBITDA to
 compare us against other companies and to help analyze our ability to

 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance
 with GAAP, and items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant in
 understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted
 EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net
 income, income from operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure
 of our profitability, liquidity or performance under generally accepted
 accounting principles. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a useful
 measure of our ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing
 operations. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts
 to evaluate our operating performance. Investors should be aware that our
 presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled
 measures used by other companies.

 income from discontinued operations, net of tax, goodwill impairment and
 asset impairment and restructuring charges, net of tax. Adjusted net
 income (loss) is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with

 net income (loss) are significant in understanding and assessing our
 results of operations. Therefore, Adjusted net income (loss) should not be

&lt;p&gt;  BIRMINGHAM, AL, Feb 20 (Marketwire) -- 
Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT), the world's leading, publicly
traded "pure-play" producer of metallurgical (met) coal for the global
steel industry, today announced results for the fourth quarter ended
December 31, 2012 that reflect cost control initiatives, aggressive
production management and disciplined capital spending, in light of
significantly lower global pricing levels. 

    Revenues were $479 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, down from $703
million in the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily due to reduced demand and
pricing for met coal. The realized price of met coal declined 39%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. The Company reported a net loss
for the quarter of $71 million or $1.13 loss per diluted share. This loss
includes impairment and restructuring charges of $6.8 million primarily
in connection with a reduction in spending at the Aberpergwm mine in the
United Kingdom. Excluding these charges, adjusted net loss and adjusted
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted
EBITDA) for the quarter were $66 million and $7 million, respectively.
Results for the quarter also included a $71 million tax benefit. 

    For the year, the Company recorded revenues of $2.4 billion and a net
loss of $1.1 billion including impairment and restructuring charges of
$1.1 billion. Excluding these charges, the Company's adjusted net income
was $31 million and adjusted EBITDA was $412 million.

    2012 Achievements

    During 2012, the Company: 


--  Achieved record metallurgical coal production of 11.7* million metric
    tons (MMTs)
--  Improved cash cost per ton of production of met coal by 6%
--  Enhanced liquidity and extended its debt maturities by issuing $500
    million of senior notes due 2020
--  Improved the total reportable injury rate by 26% as compared with 2011

    

"Walter Energy made solid operational progress during 2012, in the
face of challenging market conditions. We safely increased our production
of met coal to a record 11.7* MMTs, strengthened our senior management
team and put in place a highly competitive operating platform that
reduced our cost of production," said Walter Scheller, Chief Executive
Officer. "In the fourth quarter, we responded to the lower pricing and
demand environment by executing the strategy announced last quarter to
reconfigure our Canadian operations in order to lower production and
reduce costs. Further, we reduced spending at the Aberpergwm mine in the
United Kingdom."

    Mr. Scheller continued, "Although there are clear signs of improving
trends in global demand and pricing for met coal, our current outlook for
2013 remains cautious and we are focused on driving further efficiency in
our business. We currently expect sales and production of met coal in
2013 to be in line with 2012. However, we are extremely well positioned
to increase sales and production to capitalize on anticipated
improvements in pricing and demand when market conditions warrant." 

    Production

    In the fourth quarter of 2012, Walter Energy produced 2.5 MMTs of met
coal, down from a record third quarter 2012 production of 3.3 MMTs but an
increase from the 2.3 MMTs produced in the fourth quarter of 2011. 

    Hard coking coal production decreased to 2.0 MMTs in the fourth quarter
2012 as compared with 2.4 MMTs in the third quarter 2012 and 1.8 MMTs in
the fourth quarter 2011. Fourth quarter pulverized coal injection (PCI)
production of 476,000 metric tons (MTs) decreased 51%, as compared to the
963,000 MTs produced in the third quarter of 2012 and 3% from the 489,000
MTs produced in the fourth quarter 2011. 

    Sales Volume and Price

    In 2012, Walter Energy sold 10.4 MMTs of met coal, up 19% from 8.7 MMTs
of met coal sales in 2011. Fourth quarter 2012 met coal sales volume
totaled 2.5 MMTs as compared with 2.6 MMTs sold in the third quarter 2012
and 2.4 MMTs sold in the fourth quarter of 2011. 

    Met coal prices averaged $149 per MT in the quarter, a decrease of 22%
from the average of $191 per MT in the third quarter of 2012 and a 39%
decrease as compared with the $242 per MT of the fourth quarter 2011.

    Cash Cost of Sales

    The consolidated cash cost of sales for met coal was $135 per MT in the
fourth quarter of 2012, as compared with $132 per MT in the third quarter
of 2012 and $139 per MT in the fourth quarter of 2011. 

    In the U.S. operations, the cash cost of sales for met coal was $118 per
MT in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared with $119 per MT in the
third quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011. 

    In Canada, the cash costs of sales for met coal was $161 per MT in the
fourth quarter of 2012, as compared with $166 per MT in the third quarter
and $168 per MT in the fourth quarter of 2011. 

    Cash Cost of Production

    The consolidated cash cost of production for met coal in the fourth
quarter of 2012 was $95 per MT, a 20% improvement as compared with $119
per MT in the fourth quarter of 2011.

    The cash cost of production for low-volatility hard coking coal improved
to $74 per MT in the fourth quarter of 2012 from $77 per MT in the third
quarter 2012 and $78 per MT in the fourth quarter of 2011. The cash cost
of production for mid-volatility hard coking coal was $102 per MT in the
fourth quarter of 2012 as compared with $95 per MT in the third quarter
of 2012 and $113 per MT in the fourth quarter of 2011. The cash cost of
production for low-volatility PCI was $125 per MT in the fourth quarter
of 2012 as compared with $96 per MT in the third quarter of 2012 and $204
per MT in the fourth quarter of 2011. 

    Capital Expenditures

    The Company's capital expenditures were $60 million for the fourth
quarter 2012 and $392 million for the year, compared with $121 million
and $415 million, respectively in the prior year periods. For 2013, the
Company continues to expect capital expenditures of approximately $220
million. 

    Liquidity

    At the end of 2012, available liquidity was $445 million, consisting of
cash and cash equivalents of $117 million plus $328 million of
availability under the Company's $375 million revolving credit facility.
During the quarter, the Company issued $500 million in senior notes due
in 2020 to enhance liquidity and improve our debt maturity profile. 

    Safety and Stewardship Highlights

    Walter Energy's emphasis on safety continues to show results as the
majority of locations are achieving lower total reportable injury rates.
On a consolidated basis, Walter's total reportable injury rate decreased
by 26% in 2012 as compared with 2011.

    During 2012, Walter Energy earned safety awards in Canada, West Virginia
and in our Alabama operations including the Sentinels of Safety Award
sponsored by the National Mining Association, the Edward Prior Safety
Award from the Office of the Chief Inspector of Mines from the Ministry
of Natural Resource Operations in British Columbia, Canada and a Surface
Mine Reclamation Award co-sponsored by the West Virginia Coal Association
and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection.

(1) Includes the results of Western Coal since the April 1, 2011 date of
 acquisition. Certain previously reported three months ended and year ended 
 December 31, 2011 balances have been recast to reflect the effects of
 finalizing the allocation of the Western Coal purchase price during the
 2012 first quarter. Previously reported three months ended net income
 decreased by $3.5 million and diluted earnings per share decreased by
 $0.06 per share. Previously reported year ended December 31, 2011 net
 income increased by $14.4 million and diluted earnings per share increased 
 by $0.24 per share.
(2) The year ended December 31, 2011 includes $23.2 million of costs
 associated with the acquisition of Western Coal.
(3) The three months ended December 31, 2012 includes asset impairment and
 severance charges of $9.1 million in connection with plans to reduce
 development spending at the Aberpergwm underground mine in the U.K. and
 the year ended December 31, 2012 also includes an impairment charge of
 $40.0 million associated with the abandonment of a natural gas exploration 
 project.
(4) The year ended December 31, 2012 includes losses on the sale and
 remeasurement to fair value of equity investments. The year ended December 
 31, 2011 includes a gain recognized on April 1, 2011 of $20.6 million as a 
 result of remeasuring to fair value Western Coal shares acquired from
 Audley Capital in January 2011, partially offset by a net loss on the sale 
 and remeasurement to fair value of our other equity investments.
(5) Discontinued operations includes the gain on the sale of our closed
 Kodiak operations, net of tax.
(6) In periods of net loss, the number of shares used to calculate diluted
 earnings per share is the same as that used to calculate basic earnings
 per share.

statistical information have been recast to reflect the effects of
finalizing the allocation of the Western Coal purchase price during the 2012
first quarter.
(2) Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton is based on reported Cost of Sales
and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other
similar production and sales cost items but excludes depreciation, depletion
and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost of Production per Ton is
based on period costs of mining and includes items such as manpower, fuel
and other similar production items but excludes depreciation, depletion and 
post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost per Ton are non-GAAP financial
measures which are not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental to, and
not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in
conformity with GAAP. We believe Average Cash Cost per Ton are useful
measures of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts
in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and
future potential performance. Average Cash Costof Sales per Ton may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

(4) During the third quarter of 2012, in our Canadian and U.K. operations
 certain metrics around tons included in production were realigned to align 
 with how we account for production in the U.S. operations. Historically,
 the Canadian and U.K. operations were not recording tons produced until
 they were deemed finished goods. We revised this methodology to include all
 tons mined, no matter if in process or finished, as produced based on a
 clean coal tonnage equivalent. Our Form 8-K filed on November 5, 2012,
 includes a reconciliation of production statistics previously presented as 
 compared with the realigned methodology from the Western Coal acquisition
 date of April 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012.

(1) The December 31, 2011 balance sheet has been recast to reflect the
 effects of finalizing the allocation of the Western Coal purchase price
 during the 2012 first quarter. Retained earnings, a component of
 stockholders' equity, was increased by $14.4 million, primarily due to a
 decrease in mineral interests depletion net of income tax expense
 applicable to 2011.

 the effects of finalizing the allocation of the Western Coal purchase

 decrease in mineral interests depletion net of income tax expense
 applicable to 2011.

(2) EBITDA from continuing operations is defined as earnings from
 continuing operations before interest expense, interest income, income
 taxes, and depreciation and depletion expense. EBITDA from continuing
 operations is a financial measure which is not calculated in conformity
 with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be
 considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to
 financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that
 EBITDA is a useful measure as some investors and analysts use EBITDA to
 compare us against other companies and to help analyze our ability to
 satisfy principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs.
 EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
 companies.
(3) EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, interest income,

 financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. GAAP and

 to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that
 EBITDA is a useful measure as some investors and analysts use EBITDA to

 satisfy principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs.
 EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
 companies.
(4) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude
 goodwill impairment and asset impairment and restructuring charges.
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance
 with GAAP, and items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant in
 understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted
 EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net 
 income, income from operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure 
 of our profitability, liquidity or performance under generally accepted
 accounting principles. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a useful
 measure of our ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing
 operations. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts
 to evaluate our operating performance. Investors should be aware that our
 presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled
 measures used by other companies.
(5) Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding
 income from discontinued operations, net of tax, goodwill impairment and
 asset impairment and restructuring charges, net of tax. Adjusted net
 income (loss) is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with 
 generally accepted accounting principles, and items excluded from Adjusted 
 net income (loss) are significant in understanding and assessing our
 results of operations. Therefore, Adjusted net income (loss) should not be 
 considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income (loss) under
 generally accepted accounting principles.

investor concerns with the board's oversight" following more
than $6 billion of losses last year from bad derivatives trades
linked to a London-based trader - known as the London Whale for
the outsized bets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also cited other problems such as the
cease-and-desist orders the bank received from regulators last
month that require it to improve its internal controls, which
Dimon oversees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is impossible to imagine how board oversight of the

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO Feb 20 (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge dropped
criminal charges against Chevron Corp, Transocean Ltd
 and 17 employees resulting from a 2011 offshore oil
spill, three sources with direct knowledge of the case told
Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last March a Brazilian prosecutor filed criminal charges
against the companies and employees of both, including Chevron's
former Brazil unit president George Buck. The charges came after
 a 3,600 barrel spill in the Frade Field northeast of Rio de
Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources requested anonymity because their employers do
not allow them to speak about the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal charges carried potential jail terms of up to
31 years, and came in conjunction with civil lawsuits seeking as
much as 40 billion reais ($20.4 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors can still appeal the ruling dismissing the
charges, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frade field is 52 percent owned by Chevron, 30 percent
by Brazil's state-led Petroleo Brasileiro SA and 18
percent by Frade Jap&#227;o, a group owned by Japanese trading
companies Inpex Corp and Sojitz Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrobras, as the Brazilian company is known, Sojitz and
Inpex were never charged in relation to the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="Allison Martell" date="2013-02-20T15:16:33+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/uk-hedge-fund-to-launch-proxy-fight-agai-idUSLNE91J02420130220"><headline>Hedge fund to launch proxy fight against Walter Energy</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A British hedge fund announced plans on Tuesday to nominate five candidates to the board of Walter Energy Inc (WLT.N), saying investors have lost confidence in the metallurgical coal miner's current board, sending its shares higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy said it had received the notice of intent from an affiliate of hedge fund Audley Capital Advisors LLP. The company said in a statement it had no contact with Audley aside from the notice of intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following the acquisition of Western Coal Corp in November 2010, Walter Energy has consistently failed to deliver shareholder value as a result of questionable financial decisions and poor management," said Audley's statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy, which has operations in western Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, took a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter, largely related to the Western Coal deal. It is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent quarters, weak demand from steelmakers has hit metallurgical or "coking" coal miners' sales volumes and prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of these coal writedowns are market conditions, and almost all the mining acquisitions happen near the top, when you look back. Everyone's faced similar writedowns," said Iberia Capital Partners analyst David Beard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beard, who rates the company "sector perform," said proxy battles are difficult to win, but he also said the fight may boost the stock in the short term, reviving takeover rumors that have circulated "forever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audley said the company has fallen short of its earnings guidance, churned through chief executives and relied too heavily on debt financing when it should have issued equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it is "committed to creating value for all shareholders through the successful execution of the company's strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The date of Walter Energy's 2013 annual meeting has not yet been set. It currently has 10 board members: nine independent directors, and its chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHARED HISTORY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audley is no stranger to Walter Energy - it was a major shareholder in Western Coal. Under a purchase agreement announced in November 2010, Walter Energy was to buy 19.8 percent of Western Coal from the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Calder, Western Coal's chief executive, headed up Walter Energy after the acquisition, but he resigned after only three months. The company said then that he had cited "differences of opinion concerning management philosophy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Calder's resignation, Audley, which then had a 1.5 percent stake in Walter Energy, urged the miner to sell itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audley has only a small stake in Walter Energy, according to disclosures included with its release on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audley and several people affiliated with the fund are the beneficial owners of 128,500 shares, of which 82,500 are subject to call options. They have also sold put options on 70,000 shares. When it last reported results, the company said it had 62.6 million shares outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's major shareholders include J.P. Morgan Asset Management, with a 6.9 percent stake as of December 31, according to Thomson Reuters data, and Harris Associates LP, with a 5.0 percent stake as of December 31. The company's top 10 investors own just over 40 percent of its outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In separate statements on Tuesday, Walter Energy announced the retirement of veteran director Howard Clark Jr., effective Monday, and said consultant and former Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSa.L) director Nina Henderson would join the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy's shares closed up 5.4 percent at $39.96 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Allison Martell in Toronto; Editing by Gary Hill, Matthew Lewis and Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MANCHESTER, NH, Feb 20 (Marketwire) -- 
Scribe, the leading platform for cloud and on-premise CRM data
integration, today announced a new partnership with Datix, an Epicor 9
software services specialist. With Scribe, Datix will empower Epicor 9
customers, nearly 3,000 in the U.S. alone, with better access to business
critical data by fully integrating ERP data with Microsoft Dynamics CRM,
Salesforce.com and Znode eCommerce. All three companies will demonstrate
the integration at Microsoft Convergence 2013, March 18-21 in New
Orleans, LA, in Scribe booth 420.

    A software services company based in St. Louis, MO, Datix is an
authorized reseller of Epicor 9 software, specializing in helping
businesses migrate to Epicor 9 for process management. The company
provides a wide range of Epicor 9 support and business consulting
services to Epicor businesses throughout North and South America. Datix
chose Scribe over other data integration platform providers because of
Scribe's leadership in CRM data integration for on-premise, hybrid and
cloud environments, and its deep expertise in integrating with Microsoft
Dynamics ERP and CRM systems.

    In addition to opening up Epicor to the benefits of Dynamics CRM and
Salesforce.com users, Scribe and Datix also now tie-in to Znode, a
leading B2B and B2C ecommerce solution provider. Znode clients in turn
will be able to more easily integrate their Znode ecommerce platform with
back-office systems Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Salesforce.com.

    "Our partnership with Scribe is going to deliver real benefits to Epicor
customers by allowing them to fully integrate their Epicor ERP data with
Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Salesforce to be more nimble and responsive to
their end customers," said Bryan Sapot, CEO for Datix. "IT agility and
symmetry between internal and external systems, such as ERP and CRM,
powered by seamless data integration, is key to running a successful
business today. Access to critical customer data online and via mobile is
becoming the standard, and Scribe equips Datix to provide such varied
data access and reporting, bridging on-premise and cloud environments."

    "Datix is widely considered the industry's Epicor ERP software reseller
of choice," said Peter Chase, Founder and Executive Vice President for
Scribe Software. "We are thrilled to be working with them to help their
Epicor 9 customers streamline their business processes and increase
efficiency and productivity."

    "Partnering with Scribe and Datix enables Znode to deliver huge benefits
to our customers," said Marc Boston, Director of Strategic Partnerships
for Znode. "Expanding our partnership ecosystem in this way allows us to
create an environment in which our customers can more easily connect
Znode's Multifront(R) ecommerce solutions to their back-office systems
like Microsoft Dynamics and Epicor 9 and thereby empower them with a
clearer, more comprehensive view of business critical data."

    Today's announcement underscores continued momentum for Scribe. In
December, Scribe announced consistent momentum across the markets it
serves and consistent year over year growth, with Q3 2012 bookings up 22
percent over the same quarter in 2011. Just last month, the company
unveiled a new industry study focused on the state of CRM in the Small
Business (SMB) sector, and top SMB IT pain points and areas of investment
in 2013. Before that, the company announced record Q4 2012 bookings in
the public sector with seven major wins across state and federal
government agencies in deals that span more than 50,000 seats.

today the availability of version 4.6 of its award-winning Lavastorm Analytics
Engine, the company`s powerful, visual and versatile analytic development
environment. The latest version of the Lavastorm Analytics Engine adds a range
of functions and benefits for business analysts, including new support for
QlikTech QlikView and Microsoft Excel desktop data visualization tools to help
analyze data and publish results, streamlined data integration capability,
support for VMWare 5 virtual machines, and more. 

The Lavastorm Analytics Engine has long provided native facilities for data
visualization, and, through a partnership with QlikTech that was formalized in
2012, also offered the ability to export analytics built in the Lavastorm
Analytics Engine to compatible QlikView file formats. Release 4.6 builds on
these abilities by allowing users to use QlikView and Excel as their default
data viewer and visualization tools to analyze or publish data sets from any
point in an analytic model created with the Lavastorm Analytics Engine. Coupled
with Lavastorm`s powerful data management, analytic, ETL and data integration
software capabilities, as well as the visual approach to the data modeling
process that brings transparency to the underlying analytic logic, the Lavastorm
Analytics Engine gives business analysts a comprehensive, powerful, and easy to
use environment to develop complex analytics, completely trust their data,
discover insights, and publish results for information consumers. 

"Data discovery and visualization are hugely important for business users who
want a self-service, agile business intelligence environment," said Robin Bloor,
founder of Bloor Research. "Getting this right requires business and IT groups
to equip teams with the appropriate tools, skills and processes, but it`s
important to avoid taking a one-size-fits-all approach. This integration by
Lavastorm is a great example of how to marry effective data integration and
analytic capabilities to serve the needs of both information producers and
information consumers so that a broader user group within organizations can
quickly understand and derive value from their data." 

The new QlikView and Excel integrations can be seen in action by viewing two new
video demonstrations:

* See the Excel integration here: http://bit.ly/VtdDq9

In addition to these new visualization options, Lavastorm Analytics Engine 4.6
also adds a number of other beneficial capabilities that help make it even
easier to learn and use, some of which include:

* Drag-and-drop file acquisition so thatdata files can be dropped directly into
the Lavastorm Analytics Engine interface and automatically configured. 
* Virtual environment support for server-based versions of the Lavastorm
Analytics Engine through new compatibility VMWare 5 and Red Hat Linux 6 virtual
machines. 
* Excel node enhancements for full support of the .XLSX format, allowing for
direct, automatic updating of existing Excel sheets from within the Lavastorm
Analytics Engine analytic flow, as well as for appending Lavastorm Analytics
Engine data to existing workbooks. 
* Simplified license administrationwhereby all users now receive the same
software package, with access to features controlled by the software license.

Lavastorm has also updated the Lavastorm Analytics Engine`s help system so that
users can learn and leverage the Lavastorm Analytics Engine faster and more
effectively. The help system now uses a unified browser window and features
improvements to the HTML renderings that make it easier to navigate.
Additionally, Lavastorm has added a series of multimedia tutorials, including
technology notes, graphs, data, and video content. 

"Every enterprise BI team endeavors to make data and analytics more easily
accessible to the people who need to make decisions quickly, and Lavastorm
Analytics Engine 4.6 is all about making this self-service analytics notion a
bigger reality," said Drew Rockwell, CEO, Lavastorm Analytics. "Stronger
visualization abilities let business analysts work with data more intuitively,
and support for virtual environments enables IT teams to grant these enhanced
capabilities to their business partners more flexibly. In combination, Lavastorm
Analytics Engine 4.6 will help teams improve their analytic agility and find the
value in their data even faster."

MWR, Sponsors, and Tracks to Offer Loyal Race Fans Exclusive Content and
Promotions
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Michael Waltrip Racing (MWR) has teamed up with CardStar from Constant Contact,
Inc. (NASDAQ: CTCT) to give key sponsors and NASCAR partners an easy way to
reward loyal fans through the CardStar app. The program kicks off this week at
DAYTONA and will continue throughout the 2013 race season, offering everything
from exclusive pictures and video content of MWR drivers, specials on MWR
merchandise, sponsor discounts, and fan giveaways. 

"NASCAR drivers have some of the most enthusiastic and supportive fans in sports
- we can`t say enough good things about them," said Michael Waltrip, MWR founder
and co-owner. "And we want to thank them for their loyalty to NASCAR. With
CardStar, we can do just that, and we can help drive new customers to our
sport`s fantastic sponsors at the same time. It`s a win-win for us." 

With loyal MWR supporters flocking to DAYTONA, MWR has a perfect opportunity to
reach fans with targeted content and promotions through the one thing consumers
carry with them at all times: their smartphone. Race fans can become an MWR
Insider anytime by downloading the CardStar app and the MWR Insider Card. The
card gets them access to MWR merchandise and exclusive offers from partners and
sponsors, like Aaron`s, 5-Hour ENERGY, and Monte Carlo Resort and Casino, right
from their phone. The program will also drive foot traffic through geo-fencing
capabilities that push special offers directly to the phones of consumers who
are near participating local businesses. 

"Recent research suggests that there are currently more than 114 million
smartphone users in the US alone," said Andy Miller, director of mobile products
at Constant Contact. "That`s a huge opportunity for local businesses, letting
them reach consumers with relevant offers when and where they are shopping. Our
partnership with MWR demonstrates how easy that can be - so that you are
delivering real value to fans, while also providing local merchants and
franchises an opportunity to attract new customers." 

"Our sponsorship of MWR is valuable to our organization, and this program gives
us some real dollars and cents to attribute to MWR. We`ll be able to see exactly
how MWR is getting fans to our door," said Mike Pistana, vice president of sales
and marketing at Monte Carlo Resort and Casino. "We love the combination of
rewarding our own loyal customers and attracting new customers at the same
time." 

CardStar's free mobile loyalty application is available on all major mobile
platforms, including iPhone and Android. CardStar has more than 3 million active
users, and with users in all 50 U.S. states and 173 countries worldwide,
CardStar has become one of the most widely used mobile loyalty applications in
the world. Smartphone users can download the app from the iTunes Marketplace or
Google Play and add their rewards or membership cards with the tap of a button.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Feb 20 (MARKET WIRE) --
Canada issued a record number of visitor visas in 2012 with almost 1
million visas approved, Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship,
Immigration and Multiculturalism, and Maxime Bernier, Minister of State
for Small Business and Tourism, announced today.

    "The Government is committed to attracting an increasing number of
visitors to Canada as part of our plan to grow the Canadian economy and
create jobs," said Minister Kenney. "We strive to issue visas as quickly
as possible to facilitate travel for genuine visitors - to welcome
tourists, to reunite families - and benefit from the economic spinoff
they bring to Canada." 

    The number of visas issued in 2012 represents an increase of almost 40%
since 2004. This steady increase over the last few years reaffirms the
fact that Canada continues to be a destination of choice for visitors.

    "Welcoming more international travelers to Canada creates jobs and growth
in our country," added Minister of State Maxime Bernier. "Receiving a
visa in a timely and efficient manner is important to our visitors, and
helps position Canada competitively as a destination of choice in the
world." 

    The Government has employed several new tools to attract visitors to
Canada and facilitate their travel. For example, in July 2011, the
duration of multiple-entry visas was extended from five years to 10
years. This allows visitors to enter and exit Canada for up to six months
at a time over 10 years. In addition, parents and grandparents of
Canadian citizens and permanent residents are eligible to apply for the
new Parent and Grandparent Super Visa, which is also valid for up to 10
years and allows parents and grandparents to remain in Canada for up to
24 months at a time.

Healthcare Reform, Rising Costs Prompt Higher Contributions; J.P. Morgan Exceeds
One Million Health Savings Accounts Under Management
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
As national healthcare reforms take effect and costs continue to climb,
consumers are getting wiser about medical savings, according to J.P. Morgan`s
(NYSE:JPM) fourth annual health savings account (HSA) program snapshot released
today. Higher deductibles, rising healthcare costs and continued tax benefits
have spurred HSA growth. J.P. Morgan currently manages more than one million
accounts - the largest pool in eight years. 

J.P. Morgan expects that the clarity around healthcare reform will continue to
drive demand for HSAs across all segments of the market, which should continue
into 2014. Employers will take a much more active role in educating employees on
the long-term value of these accounts. 

The 2012 HSA program snapshot report provides a transparent view of HSA usage
patterns and trends among JPMorgan Chase HSA account holders. The report also
provides first-hand insight into how HSAs have become an integral part of
helping consumers save and pay for medical expenses. 

2012 highlights include:

* The average accountholder is saving approximately $500 in taxes annually
(assuming a 28 percent federal income tax rate). Average balances are also
increasing by approximately $500 per account per year an account is open 
* The average balance in 2012 for new HSA accounts rose to its highest level in
eight years growing two percent from 2011 to $1,009 
* The average HSA balance in 2012 was $1,736 - up six percent from 2011 
* The average account contribution in 2012 was $1,800 while the average
distribution was $1,417, resulting in 71 percent of accountholders contributing
more than they spent last year 
* On average per month in 2012, 66 percent of accounts made contributions and 43
percent of accounts made a distribution 
* Total investment program balances grew 31 percent in 2012, up more than 177
percent since 2009

J.P. Morgan administers HSA programs in conjunction with many of the largest
health insurance companies in the United States as well as Fortune 500
companies, small businesses and individuals across the nation. For more
information about J.P. Morgan`s HSA Program, please visit www.jpmorgan.com/hsa. 

A full copy of J.P. Morgan`s HSA Program Snapshot is available at

in cleared interest rate swap notional principal outstandings from LCH
SwapClear, the largest ever triReduce compression cycle in JPY interest rate
swaps. Since TriOptima began offering its triReduce early termination service in
JPY in 2004, almost JPY1,600 trillion (USD18.3 trillion) in cleared and
uncleared swaps have been eliminated. 

"The banks, LCH SwapClear and TriOptima worked together to achieve these
record-breaking results," said Ken Nishimura, head of TriOptima Japan.
"Contributing to the success of the cycle was an increase in participants as
institutions recognize the benefits of compression. We anticipate continued
expansion of the process in 2013." 

About triReduce Compression

Compression services are offered through TriOptima`s triReduce service to swap
market participants with significant two-way flow. In triReduce, participants
are able to tear up their existing trades at their own mid mark-to-market
valuations avoiding the difficult negotiation process of bilateral termination.
Multilateral terminations leverage off the expanded number of participants and
result in increased numbers of terminated trades. 

Eliminating unnecessary swaps in an OTC derivatives clearinghouse promotes the
efficient use of capital and collateral and contributes to overall financial
stability by moderating the pace of growth in outstanding notional principal in
the market.

&lt;p&gt;* Sony to host PlayStation event in New York on Wednesday
2300 GMT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Sony expected to unveil PlayStation 3 successor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Analysts expect new streaming features on new Sony game
console&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tim Kelly and Malathi Nayak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Sony Corp is expected to
showcase a new PlayStation console on Wednesday in a pre-emptive
strike against Microsoft Corp's bid to make its Xbox
the world's leading hub for household entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rare PlayStation event in New York comes amid industry
speculation that Microsoft is set to unveil the successor to its
Xbox 360, which beats the seven-year-old PlayStation 3's online
network with features such as voice commands on interactive
gaming and superior connectivity to smartphones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their focus is on establishing a beachhead for the next
generation of consoles, and that's what Feb. 20 is all about,"
said P.J. McNealy, CEO and founder of Digital World Research.
"The reality is they have been playing catch-up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushing ahead of Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo Co Ltd's
 new Wii U could help Sony revive an electronics
business hurt by a dearth of hit gadgets, a collapse in TV sales
and the convergence of consumer interest around tablets and
smartphones built by rivals Apple Inc and Samsung
Electronics Co Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tablets and smartphones already account for around 10
percent of the $80 billion gaming market. Those mobile devices,
analysts predict, will within a few years be as powerful as the
current slew of game-only consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six years, Sony PlayStation sales are just shy of
Xbox's 67 million installed base and well behind the 100-million
selling Wii, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lacklustre launch in November of the Wii successor, the
Wii U, gives Sony a chance to focus on toppling Microsoft as all
three battle the encroachment of casual gaming on tablets and
smartphones. Nintendo cut its sales target to 4 million machines
from 5.5 million for the year ending March 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STREAMING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's answer to the casual gaming threat has been
software that gives users extra content and allows them to surf
the Internet from their mobile devices. The Xbox already streams
Netflix and ESPN and links to tablets and smartphones using
Windows or Apple's iOS and Google Inc's Android. Sony's
PS3 online network has lagged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Sony, they have to come out and make this PlayStation
event the definitive statement of why gamers need to adopt the
PlayStation 4 or PlayStation Orbis or whatever they end up
calling it," said Greg Miller, PlayStation executive editor at
video game site IGN.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony's purchase in July of U.S. cloud-based gaming company
Gaikai for $380 million hints that the Japanese company will
pursue a similar streaming strategy to Microsoft. Sony, industry
watchers say, may also offer an expanded range of free games to
counter the threat from casual gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony, which under its CEO Kazuo Hirai is focusing on gaming,
mobile devices and cameras, needs a hit product. But by betting
on a PS3 successor, Hirai, whose most profitable business is
life insurance, risks deepening consumer electronic losses as he
will have to sell consoles at below the manufacturing cost to
gain market traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That choice is made harder because the other two pillars of
Hirai's new Sony - cameras and mobile - are losing money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony expects to post a $1.4 billion operating profit in the
current fiscal year. Yet, much of that rebound is gains from
offloading real estate, including $1.1 billion for its New York
headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PlayStation event in New York starts at 2300 GMT (1800
EST).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

BRUSSELS--(Business Wire)--
The European Commission Directorate General for Home Affairs has awarded a
consortium of Accenture (NYSE: ACN), Morpho (Safran) and HP, a contract to
maintain the European Visa Information System (VIS). The contract is for three
years with a possible one-year extension to a maximum value of &#8364;70 million
(approx.US$93 million). 

The project will support the exchange of visa data across border management
authorities by ensuring the processing capacity of the system and the
availability of high levels of search and matching capabilities required for
visa applications. The VIS system went live, on schedule, in October 2011 and
has since experienced increased usage by consulates in non-EU countries and
external border crossing points of Schengen states. 

"Accenture has in-depth experience working with border agencies around the world
in helping them meet the challenges of managing the growing numbers of travelers
and increased visa application complexity," said Mark Crego who leads
Accenture`s global Border and Identity Management business. "We are pleased to
have been chosen by the European Commission to lead this consortium of suppliers
over the coming years." 

As consortium lead, Accenture will assume overall project responsibilities,
overseeing the integration of functional, technical and operational maintenance
to the VIS, and Morpho will provide biometric matching services. Accenture and
Morpho (as the Bridge Consortium) have worked with the European Commission since
2007 on the development and support of the biometric matching engine of the VIS.


"Morpho is proud to have been chosen, once again, to supply the biometric
matching services for the VIS," said Jean-Paul Jainsky, chairman and chief
executive officer of Morpho. "Biometrics has become a key element for effective
border management, and as the world leader in biometric technology, we are
committed to developing state-of-the-art solutions to meet the current and
emerging needs of this market." 

HP has worked with the European Commission since 2005, deploying the HP
Converged Infrastructure solution and associated technology services for the VIS
as well as the archiving and back-up solution. Under the new contract, there is
the potential for additional HP network support with associated consulting and
IT support services. Subcontractors to Accenture are Daon and WCC Smart Search
and Match who will provide IT support and services. 

Border security and citizen protection is becoming increasingly important,"
stated Peter Ryan, senior vice president and managing director, HP EMEA. "HP`s
mission-critical Converged Infrastructure is key to delivering multi-national IT
projects in the public safety domain." 

VIS is at the core of the visa application process to the Schengen area and
enables Schengen States to store and exchange alphanumeric and biometric data
relating to visa applications of third-country citizens. As a subcomponent of
VIS, a Biometric Matching System (BMS) enables the accurate identification of
visa applicants through matching biometric data, such as fingerprints, to
identities to establish and verify visa applications.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) has raised questions about the involvement of a senior lawyer from the New York Attorney General's office in one of the few government lawsuits alleging wrongdoing by banks in the run-up to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against JPMorgan is similar to one that the lawyer had worked on before joining the Attorney General's office, JPMorgan said in court papers this week, raising the possibility of a conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it had asked New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman "whether there is additional information about this lawyer's involvement ... before deciding what further action is warranted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank did not specify what action it could take, but legal experts said JPMorgan could argue that the New York Attorney General's office had a conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman's office did not immediately comment on JPMorgan's request for information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's court filing did not identify the lawyer by name but gave the title of executive deputy attorney general for economic justice - the position held by former Paterson Belknap Webb &amp; Tyler partner Karla Sanchez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While at Paterson Belknap, Sanchez helped bring a case by bond insurer Ambac against JPMorgan over the sale of toxic assets by its Bear Stearns unit before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman brought the new, similar case against JPMorgan in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanchez joined Schneiderman's team in January 2011. On June 7, 2011, the AG's office barred her from working on its probe of mortgage-backed securities, citing her work in private practice, according to documents obtained by Reuters under New York's Freedom of Information Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AG's office lifted the restriction on April 23, 2012, according to the documents, allowing her to work on the Bear Stearns investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, on November 9, 2012, she was once again banned from certain mortgage-backed securities cases, according to the documents. In its court filing this week, JPMorgan said the attorney general's office apparently reimposed the ban after the bank raised concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanchez did not respond to a request to comment on her involvement in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Freedland, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said recusal decisions are based on the facts at any given time. "These decisions were made not only out of an abundance of caution, but also based on changing circumstances," Freedland told Reuters in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bennett Gershman, an expert on prosecutorial misconduct at Pace University Law School, called it "highly unusual" for a lawyer in the attorney general's office to be recused from working on a probe, then back on the case, and then recused again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think a judge would be seriously concerned," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan could bring a motion to disqualify Schneiderman's office from the case, Gershman said. The bank could argue that an irreparable conflict of interest exists, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear which other probes of mortgage-backed securities Sanchez has worked on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman filed a similar lawsuit against Credit Suisse in November.

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Feb 21 (MARKET WIRE) --
CDRD Ventures Inc. (CVI), the commercialization vehicle of The Centre for
Drug Research and Development (CDRD), and Pfizer Inc. today announced a
strategic collaboration designed to provide new resources to advance
Canada's most innovative and therapeutically promising health
technologies towards commercialization.

    Through this collaboration, Pfizer will have the opportunity to support
mutually-selected CVI R projects with the goal of commercializing the
programs and resulting intellectual property. This new collaboration
follows previous investments by Pfizer Canada Inc. into CDRD whereby a
Pfizer-CDRD Innovation Fund was first established in 2007 to support
innovative projects with therapeutic potential stemming from academic
discovery. This new CVI partnership is an extension to the original CDRD
relationship, and together, the two represent a continuum of support for
health research projects, whether they are very early projects in CDRD or
more mature projects that have been advanced into CVI.

    Natalie Dakers, President and CEO of CVI, commented, "Pfizer was our
pioneering industry partner making critical early investments in CDRD,
thus enabling its evolution to become Canada's national drug development
and commercialization centre. By now extending Pfizer's partnership into
CVI (its third such industry partnership), we have further validated the
CDRD/CVI model, and built a continuous and robust means to support the
most exciting new health technologies through their full development
cycle."

    "We are encouraged by the B.C.'s government's openness to work
collaboratively with our industry, and coupled with the great scientific
leadership coming from the province, it has resulted in today's
collaboration announcement," said John Helou, President, Pfizer Canada.
"CDRD Ventures Inc. builds on the strength of hundreds of researchers and
applies business discipline and scientific rigor to select promising
technologies for development, giving Canada and British Columbia an edge
towards a prosperous knowledge-based economy which is critical to
ensuring Canada's global competitiveness."

    "At Pfizer we know that emerging science is happening at a rapid pace in
innovation clusters throughout the world," said Uwe Schoenbeck, Chief
Scientific Officer, External R Innovation at Pfizer. "This partnership
with CDRD Ventures Inc is an important example of our focus on partnering
globally to identify and advance potential therapies that can
significantly improve patient lives."

    The role of CDRD is to transform promising health research discoveries
into viable commercial opportunities. CVI then in turn, transforms those
opportunities into real and measurable value, thus providing a
self-sustainability mechanism for CDRD, and providing long-term support
for the commercialization of Canadian health research. This innovative
partnership will support those efforts by providing the necessary funding
to pursue the continued commercialization of innovative products for
patients.

    About CDRD Ventures Inc. (CVI)

    CVI is the commercialization vehicle of The Centre for Drug Research and
Development (CDRD). With a first right to negotiate for any of the
technologies developed at CDRD, CVI has a continuous and unparalleled
pipeline of the most innovative and commercially-promising pre-validated
and thus de-risked technologies in Canada. From CDRD's drug development
projects and/or external opportunities, CVI licenses select promising
technologies with the goal to further advance them to a stage where they
can attract licensing partners, form the foundation for a new spin-off
company, or secure the investment needed for clinical development.

    About The Centre for Drug Research and Development (CDRD)

    CDRD is Canada's fully-integrated national drug development and
commercialization centre, providing expertise and infrastructure to
enable researchers from leading health research institutions to advance
promising early-stage drug candidates. CDRD's mandate is to de-risk
discoveries stemming from publicly-funded health research and transform
them into viable investment opportunities for the private sector - thus
successfully bridging the commercialization gap between academia and
industry. CDRD is the only fully-integrated centre of its kind in the
country - and one of a handful in the world - with the full expertise and
infrastructure to source, evaluate, develop and commercialize both small
molecule and biologic innovative technologies in virtually any
therapeutic area. Canada's Networks of Centres of Excellence Program has
recognized CDRD as a Centre of Excellence for Commercialization and
Research (CECR). www.cdrd.ca

VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(Business Wire)--
BIOTECanada, the national industry association representing 250 biotechnology
companies today congratulates CDRD Ventures Inc., (CVI), the commercialization
vehicle of The Centre for Drug Research and Development (CDRD) and Pfizer on
their announcement of a new strategic collaboration aimed at advancing Canada`s
most promising health technologies towards commercialization. 

"Canada is home to hundreds of research enterprises in almost every region
across the country developing truly game-changing therapies and treatments to
significantly improve health care for thousands of Canadians, and thousands more
globally, who suffer from debilitating or life threatening illnesses," commented
Andrew Casey, President and CEO BIOTECanada. "The success of these undertakings
is highly dependent on capital and partnerships with larger biotechnology
companies. The CVI-Pfizer partnership announced today serves as an excellent
example of the new biotech-health business model where commercialized companies
interconnect with smaller companies and research enterprises fostering an
eco-system to move research from an idea in the lab to a bona fide treatment in
the health care system." 

Biotechnology plays an important role as a preventative tool and modern
treatments for cancer, blood disorders and respiratory illness in the health
care system. Screening patients for susceptibility to disease and providing
vaccinations has impacted millions of Canadians. With biotechnology, we can
glean understanding of our genetic code, improving our collective health. These
advances offer doctors the tools to prevent and cure diseases with a
personalized approach. 

The Canadian life sciences sector continues to show determination and
resiliency. The industry is seeking in excess of $1 billion of capital to help
Canadian companies grow and develop. Through diverse products and process
developments, Canadian biotechnology companies are boosting commercial
productivity in agriculture, healthcare, energy, and advanced manufacturing. 

BIOTECanada is the national industry association with nearly 250 members located
nation wide, reflecting the diverse nature of Canada`s health, industrial and
agricultural biotechnology sectors.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The largest American union and the country's biggest business lobby group said Thursday they agreed on principles for revamping the low-skilled worker visa program, a move hailed as major progress that could hasten immigration reform in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said they agreed on three points that would ensure that American workers get the first opportunity at jobs, create a new guest worker program and establish another bureaucracy to analyze labor trends and advise Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the principles were vague. And although the AFL-CIO and chamber said they would continue to work together, there was no talk of producing a document to address tricky details such as how to determine there are no qualified American workers for a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more you get into the details of implementation the harder it gets," said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank who specializes in immigration policy. The principles "leave a lot of the hard stuff to be resolved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of Democratic and Republican Senators is trying to craft a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would include giving the 11 million illegal immigrants a way to earn citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bipartisan group had been counting on labor and business to resolve longstanding issues that have hampered past efforts to rewrite U.S. immigrations laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we are encouraged by today's announcement, there is much work left to ensure we end this process with an effective guest worker program in place," said a spokesman for Republican Marco Rubio, who is part of the Senate group and has helped garner support from conservatives traditionally opposed to immigration reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONCESSIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principles represented concessions from both sides. Unions, which oppose temporary guest worker programs because they say they allow employers to exploit workers, agreed to create a new worker visa program that does not keep all workers in a permanent temporary status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And businesses, which want the freedom to hire whom they want and normally oppose further government intervention, agreed that a "professional bureau" in a federal agency was needed to inform lawmakers and the public on labor shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two sides have been negotiating for weeks in parallel with the bipartisan Senate group, which is aiming to unveil legislation before April. Lawmakers said the new agreement will strengthen their hand because it demonstrates backing by two key constituencies for the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that business and labor have agreed on principles is a major step forward," said Democrat Charles Schumer, another member of the bipartisan Senate group. "We are very hopeful that an agreement can be reached on a specific proposal in the next few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Rachelle Younglai; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The teenage star of the Oscar-nominated Canadian drama "War Witch" will get to travel from her native Congo to the Academy Awards in Los Angeles after she received a last-minute visa, the film's U.S. distributor said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amateur actress Rachel Mwanza, 16, who grew up an orphan on the streets of capital Kinshasa, received her visa to the United States earlier in the week and will arrive in Los Angeles on Friday, two days ahead of Sunday's Oscar ceremony, a spokeswoman for distributor Tribeca Film said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French-language film is nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at Hollywood's annual Academy Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To have her (Mwanza's) journey end on the red carpet is beyond anything she could have dreamed of," director Kim Nguyen said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mwanza will also visit Canada in the coming weeks for the Canadian Screen Awards and Quebec's Jutra Award for Francophone cinema in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"War Witch," set in sub-Saharan Africa, focuses on Mwanza's character Komona, who at the age of 12 is forced by anti-government rebels to kill her parents and fight as a child soldier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mwanza won Best Actress awards at the Berlin and Tribeca film festivals last year for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film, titled "Rebelle" in French, touches on family, love and the possibility of finding happiness after years of trauma and war and has been praised by critics for its poignancy and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Eric Kelsey; Editing by Jill Serjeant and Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Rich Kruger to replace Bruce March next month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* March named senior VP at ExxonMobil Chemical Co&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shuffle comes after oil sands budget woes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares drop 27 Canadian cents in Toronto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jeffrey Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Imperial Oil Ltd
 has named Exxon Mobil Corp executive Rich
Kruger to replace Bruce March as CEO of Canada's No. 2 oil
producer and refiner as it readies to start up its C$12.9
billion ($12.7 billion) Kearl oil sands mine against a backdrop
of weak heavy-crude prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March, who ran Imperial Oil for five years, will become
senior vice-president at Exxon's chemical unit, Imperial said on
Thursday. Kruger, currently president of ExxonMobil Production
Co, will take over at the Canadian company on March 1. Exxon
Mobil has a 69.6 percent stake in Imperial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March, 56, laid the groundwork for a big expansion of
Imperial's oil production as he completed construction of the
Kearl project in northern Alberta, which is expected to begin
producing before the end of March. A second phase is scheduled
to start up in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his tenure, he took on a more public persona than his
predecessors, often taking center stage in the industry's
campaign to persuade the public it is moving quickly to improve
environmental performance despite growing criticism from green
groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kruger, a 53-year-old Minnesota native and hockey fan, said
he did not plan major changes in leadership style or corporate
strategy, central to which is a push to double oil and gas
production over the next decade from such assets as the Kearl
and Cold Lake oil sands holdings in Alberta and shale gas fields
in British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imperial is also known for its four refineries and national
chain of Esso service stations in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think you'll find that Bruce and I are cut from the same
cloth in that regard," he told reporters. "You don't need a
great memory if you always tell the truth and tell it straight.
We've been developed in the same business model."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kruger and March have known each other for a decade, having
taken Exxon Mobil management training together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 110,000 barrel a day Kearl project, a 50-50 joint
venture with Exxon Mobil, is nearing start-up and will use
production technology that allows the oil sands' tar-like
bitumen to flow to market without the need for upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COST OVERRUN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the project has been plagued by cost overruns that
pushed the budget two-thirds above Imperial's original C$7.9
billion estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final, C$2 billion overrun announced earlier this month
was blamed on frigid northern Alberta winter temperatures and a
series of court challenges in the U.S. Pacific Northwest that
delayed the transport of huge foreign-made processing modules to
the Kearl site, forcing a change in construction schedules and
increasing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wonder whether Mr. March's departure from Imperial Oil
is related to the cost overruns at Kearl," Michael Dunn, an
analyst at FirstEnergy Capital, wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March said the transition had nothing to do with the cost
hikes, which have plagued oil sands construction projects for
more than a decade. The Kearl start-up represents a good time to
make the change, the executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does come, however, as Canadian heavy crude prices are
being heavily pressured by tight pipeline capacity to
traditional markets such as the U.S. Midwest, a situation that
has hurt bottom lines and shares across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March also oversaw a push into unconventional gas that began
when Imperial moved into the Horn River shale gas field in
northeastern British Columbia and will expand when the company
and Exxon Mobil complete the C$2.6 billion purchase of Celtic
Exploration Ltd, a deal that was approved by the
Canadian government on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One long-running initiative that remains unfulfilled is the
C$16.2 billion Mackenzie Gas project, which would move large
volumes of the fuel to southern markets from Canada's Mackenzie
Delta on the Beaufort Sea Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imperial, which leads a consortium of companies that
proposed the project, has yet to say what its fate will be as
North American gas prices remain low due to the rapid
development of shale supplies much closer to major markets,
squeezing Mackenzie's economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March gave no indication that conditions were conducive to
proceeding. According to the 2010 National Energy Board
approval, the partners must give an updated cost estimate and
report on their decision to build by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a set of conditions that we're going to comply
with, if and when it gets developed, and it really needs a
(favorable) gas market, with the tolls for the pipeline, to get
into the market," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We maintain our aboriginal relations - we still have good
relations with the aboriginal communities along the pipeline
route and up in the Inuit area - and we look forward to having
the market be more amenable to making Mackenzie an operating
asset."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kruger started his career with Exxon in 1981 and has held
positions in Russia, Africa and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imperial shares fell 27 Canadian cents to C$42.55 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 21 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Advent International

billion pounds, Sky News reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advent International, which took D private for 524 million
pounds ($799 million) in 2007, was likely to pursue a sale of
the company rather than opt for a stock market listing, Sky News

Advent was keeping its options open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale process for D, which according to the company's
website protects 7.5 million appliances, would be launched later
this year, Sky News said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advent International could not immediately be reached for
comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company today announced legendary
businessmen Donald R. Keough and James B. Williams will not stand for
re-election to the Board at the Company`s Annual Meeting of Shareowners in
April. The leaders retire after decades of distinguished service to The
Coca-Cola Company.

Incorporated (Photo: Business Wire)

Keough, 86, served as President and Chief Operating Officer of The Coca-Cola
Company from 1981 to 1993, though his Coca-Cola history dates to 1950 when he
joined Butter-Nut Coffee, which was first acquired by Duncan Foods, and then by
The Coca-Cola Company in 1960. During his tenure with Coca-Cola, Keough served
as head of The Coca-Cola Foods Division from 1971 to 1973, as Chairman of the
Board of Coca-Cola Enterprises from 1986 to 1993, and as Chairman of Columbia
Pictures, Inc., from 1982 to 1989. He retired as President, Chief Operating
Officer and a Director of the Company in April 1993. He was again elected as a
Director in 2004. 

Keough is known for his many business and personal accomplishments, having
successfully steered the Company through the `cola wars` of the 1980s. During
his tenure, the Company and the system saw rapid international expansion and
significant shareowner value was created. Keough was also known for his keen
ability to connect with and cultivate relationships with all those who came in
contact with Coca-Cola. He is regarded as one of the most successful leaders in
the Company`s 126-year history. 

For the past 20 years, Keough has served as non-executive Chairman of the Board
of Allen &amp; Company Incorporated, a privately held investment firm. He also is
Chairman of DMK International, and a Director of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and
IAC/InterActive Corp. Keough also has served as non-executive Chairman of the
Board of Allen &amp; Company, and has served on the Boards of McDonald`s, The
Washington Post Company, H.J. Heinz Company, Convera Corporation and The Home
Depot. He is Chairman emeritus of the Board of Trustees and a Life Trustee of
the University of Notre Dame. 

James B. Williams, 79, is a respected banking executive who has served as a
Director of The Coca-Cola Company since 1979 and as Chairman of the Board`s
Finance Committee since 1985. He is the former Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of SunTrust Banks, Inc., a position he held from 1991 to 1998. He also
served as Chairman of the Executive Committee of SunTrust Banks, Inc. from 1998
to 2004. 

Williams` role as Director with Coca-Cola has been a natural connection between
the Company and the financial institution that financed the sale of the Company
in 1919 and safeguarded the secret formula for Coca-Cola in an Atlanta vault for
more than 80 years. 

Williams graduated from Emory College in 1955, joined Trust Company Bank, and
quickly rose through the ranks to become President. In 1979, he was asked by
Robert Woodruff, legendary leader of The Coca-Cola Company, to become a member
of the Board of Directors and to chair Emory University's capital campaign. He
is credited with contributing to Emory medical school's dramatic rise to one of
the nation's top 20 research-oriented medical schools. 

In addition to Coca-Cola, Williams serves as a Director of Marine Products
Corporation, Rollins, Inc., and RPC, Inc. He has also served on the Boards of
Georgia Pacific, Genuine Parts and Sonat, Inc. 

"It`s hard to imagine Coca-Cola without Don and Jimmy," said Muhtar Kent,
Chairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company. "We are grateful to both of them for
the immeasurable leadership they`ve brought to our Company for decades. Many of
our current Coca-Cola leaders learned this business under Don, and I have
personally benefited from his guidance, mentorship and friendship for more than
30 years. Likewise, Jimmy has been a great advisor to me and the Board, and we
have all gained from his clear direction and wise counsel."

Wireless carriers will continue to drive the backhaul market as operators
augment backhaul capacity outside of urban areas, according to a new
Visant Strategies study. And, due to 3.5G and 4G usage, mobile carriers
will further increase high-capacity backhaul in urban areas that have
already been addressed with improved backhaul, according to "US Mobile
Backhaul 2013: Broadband Wireless Realized." 

    "By year-end 2017 we foresee US mobile carriers almost doubling the
percentage of their urban and near-urban BTS sites utilizing backhaul
capacity between 301 Mbps and 622 Mbps," said Andy Fuertes of Visant
Strategies.

    Overall mobile wireless carriers have embraced fiber backhaul carriage in
urban areas in order to offer capable and affordable backhaul in the ten
percent of cell sites which receive most of the peak network traffic. US
Mobile carriers have now reached over eighty percent of these urban base
stations with fiber coverage. 

    "Carriers will continue using a mix of technologies for better backhaul
due to a greater diversity of backhaul capacity needs, which of course
depends on the location of the base station in the network," said Larry
Swasey of Visant Strategies. Limited fiber availability outside of major
metro areas will require carriers to look to PTP solutions, the study
finds. 

    Backhaul capacity per site, per base station and to the switches that
connect these network elements will increase through 2017, the report
finds. Nearly forty percent of middle network switches are expected to
require more than 1 Gbps of capacity by year-end 2017 while base station
sites requiring less than 45 Mbps will decline by over 50% by 2017. 

    The report details the current and future US mobile backhaul market
through subscribers, 3.5G and 4G subscribers, base stations, base
stations by backhaul capacity, base stations per site, BTS sites and
technology choice for backhaul. The report also defines the growth of
network elements and the backhaul needs for these elements. Also given
through 2017 are backhaul costs to the operator, operating and backhaul
cost per subscriber and voice, data and overall ARPU. Also provided are
backhaul cost per last mile, tower rental revenues and market share by
backhaul technology and by ILEC, MSO or CLEC, among other figures.

Board Approves 51st Consecutive Annual Dividend Increase

Elects Ahmet Bozer, Steve Cahillane, Sandy Douglas as Officers
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company today approved the Company's
51st consecutive annual dividend increase, raising the quarterly dividend 10
percent from 25.5 cents to 28 cents per common share. This is equivalent to an
annual dividend of $1.12 per share, up from $1.02 per share in 2012. The first
quarterly dividend is payable April 1, 2013, to shareowners of record as of
March 15, 2013.

of Coca-Cola International (Photo: Business Wire)

The increase reflects the Board's confidence in the Company's long-term cash
flow. The Coca-Cola Company returned $9.1 billion to shareowners in 2012,
through $4.6 billion in dividends and $4.5 billion in share repurchases,
bringing to $24.9 billion the amount returned to shareowners through dividends
and share repurchases since Jan. 1, 2010. 

The Board today also elected Ahmet C. Bozer, President, Coca-Cola International,
and Steven A. Cahillane, President, Coca-Cola Americas, as Executive Vice
Presidents of the Company, and J. Alexander "Sandy" Douglas, Jr., Global Chief
Customer Officer, as a Senior Vice President of the Company. These Board
elections are effective immediately. 

Bozer, Cahillane and Douglas each assumed their current roles effective Jan. 1
as part of the Company`s new global operating structure announced last July. 

Bozer, 52, oversees Coca-Cola International, which consists of the Company`s
Europe, Pacific and Eurasia &amp; Africa operations. Before assuming his current
role, Bozer served as President, Eurasia &amp; Africa Group, where he led the
Company`s business activities in more than 90 countries. 

Bozer began his career with The Coca-Cola Company in 1990 as a Financial Control
Manager in Atlanta then moved to Turkey in 1992 as Region Finance Manager. In
2000, he became President of the Eurasia Division and six years later assumed
responsibility for the Russia, Ukraine and Belarus Division. In 2007, with the
addition of the India and South West Asia Division under his responsibilities,
he was named President of the Eurasia Group. In 2008, with the merger of the
Eurasia and Africa Groups, he assumed Group Presidency of the Eurasia and Africa
Group. 

Cahillane, 47, oversees Coca-Cola Americas, which consists of the Company's
North America and Latin America operations. Before assuming his current role,
Cahillane served as President and CEO of Coca-Cola Refreshments (CCR), an
operating unit representing nearly 90 percent of the North American business of
The Coca-Cola Company. 

Prior to leading CCR, Cahillane was President of Coca-Cola Enterprises` (CCE)
North American business. He has spent his entire career in the beverage industry
in North America and Europe, including leadership roles at Coors and InBev.
Labatt USA, and Interbrew UK and Ireland. In 2007, he was appointed President of
the Europe Group for CCE and in 2008 he was named President of CCE's North
American Business Unit. 

As Global Chief Customer Officer, Douglas, 51, leads strong, strategic
relationships with customers around the world to ensure that Coca-Cola is known
globally as an organization that delivers world-class value and service to
customers. He also continues to lead the North America franchise strategy. Prior

Delivering Easier Access to Microsoft Programs Through One Collaborative
Platform
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Socialtext, a leading provider of enterprise social software, today announced
its enhanced integration feature Microsoft SharePoint to provide customers easy
access to Microsoft documents. With SharePoint`s streamline integration,
Socialtext enables the ability to upload, view, and edit Microsoft PowerPoint,
Excel, and Word files within a browser window through the collaboration
platform. 

This advanced integration offers customers access to a complete documents
library that syncs with the Socialtext platform, allowing for storage of
attachments inside SharePoint instead of Socialtext. Shared documents not only
can be stored, but also referenced and are easily searchable with its simple
search feature. In addition, bulk documents can be uploaded, dragged and dropped
to the desired location along with PowerPoint, browser enabled Excel, Word
documents that are easy to upload through the integration feature for optimum
enterprise collaboration. 

"Companies are increasingly realizing the benefits of social through integration
with legacy systems of record. The SharePoint integration is a further example
of how our customers are using Socialtext as a social layer in their enterprise
architecture," says Michael Idinopulos, General Manager and Chief Customer
Officer of Socialtext. "With SharePoint users now have a convenient way to
access and share commonly used Microsoft documents, delivering an even more
effective social software platform." 

SharePoint provides customers with three simple integration capabilities. Once a
logged-in user uploads a file to a page, Socialtext keeps a record of the
attachment but the actual file is stored inside SharePoint. Updates and changes
to the file can be made in Socialtext or a new version can be uploaded directly
to SharePoint. The three integration points include:

* For an optimized SharePoint experience, Web Parts conveniently surface the
user content that`s stored on the collaboration platform 
* SharePoint events can be integrated in the Socialtext activity stream for
greater enterprise-wide visibility 
* SharePoint is utilized as the document store behind the Socialtext interface

"Connecting to other enterprise platforms has always been convenient with
Socialtext`s API and now providing our customers with SharePoint integration
capabilities will increase employee engagement firsthand with our
industry-leading collaboration platform," said Idinopulos. 

With an advanced API, Socialtext has the capability to provide customers an out
of box integration with SharePoint. Connection is simple and, as with any of
Socialtext`s standard connectors, just requires an administrator to assign the
server URL and service account`s username and password for instant access. This
delivers another real time social tool for companies to eliminate information
silos, make business more flexible with 24/7 access. 

About Socialtext

Established in 2002, Socialtext, a Bedford Funding portfolio company, was the
first company to deliver social software to businesses. By unlocking knowledge,
expertise, ideas and data, Socialtext eliminates information silos across the
enterprise to drive superior business performance. Socialtext's enterprise
social networking products - including microblogging, blogs, wikis, profiles and
social spreadsheets - provide simpler ways for employees to share vital
information and work together in real-time. Delivered in a variety of hosted
cloud services, as well as on-site appliances, enterprise customers are provided
with flexible deployment options that meet their security requirements. Built on
a flexible, web-oriented architecture, Socialtext integrates with virtually any
traditional system of record, such as CRM and ERP, enabling companies to
discuss, collaborate, and take action on key business processes. More than 6,500
businesses worldwide have accelerated their business performance with
Socialtext, including Getty Images, Symantec, Meredith Corporation, NYU Stern,
OSIsoft, and Epitaph Records. To learn more, visit www.socialtext.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sony Corp said it will launch its next-generation PlayStation this year, hoping its first video game console in seven years will give it a much-needed head start over the next version of Microsoft's Xbox and help revive its stumbling electronics business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new console will have a revamped interface, let users stream and play video games hosted on servers, and allow users to play while downloading titles as well as share videos with friends. Its new controller, dubbed DualShock 4, will have a touchpad and a camera that can sense the depth of the environment in front of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony, which only displayed the controller but not the console, said on Wednesday the PlayStation 4 would be available for the year-end holiday season and flagged games from the likes of Ubisoft Entertainment SA and Activision Blizzard Inc, whose top executives also attended the glitzy launch event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not disclose pricing or an exact launch date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony's announcement comes amid industry speculation that Microsoft Corp is set to unveil the successor to its Xbox 360 later this summer. The current Xbox 360 beats the seven-year-old PlayStation 3's online network with features such as voice commands on interactive gaming and better connectivity to smartphones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all video game console makers are grappling with the onslaught of mobile devices into their turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tablets and smartphones built by rivals such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd already account for around 10 percent of the $80 billion gaming market. Those mobile devices, analysts predict, will within a few years be as powerful as the current slew of game-only consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks good and had a lot of great games but the industry is different now," Billy Pidgeon, an analyst at Inside Network Research, said of the new PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll be a slow burn and not heavy uptake right away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIGRATION TO MOBILE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Console makers will also have to tackle flagging video game hardware and software sales, which research firm NPD group says have dropped consistently every month over the last year as users migrate to free game content on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PlayStation 4 will have an app on Android and Apple mobile devices that connects to console games and can act as a second screen, Jack Tretton, President and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment of America, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Playstation 4 ... really connects every device in the office and the smartphone and the tablet out there in the world," Tretton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The console, which has been in development for the last five years, will have 8 GB of memory and will instantly stream game content from the console to Sony's handheld PlayStation Vita through a feature called "Remote Play," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Sony is banking on is the ease of the use of this system," Greg Miller, PlayStation executive editor at video game site IGN.com, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six years, Sony PlayStation sales are just shy of Xbox's 67 million installed base and well behind the 100 million Wii consoles sold by Nintendo Co Ltd, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tretton said it would be a big undertaking to manufacture and distribute the console in Sony's four major markets by the end of the year, adding that it would be a "phased rollout" that starts before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia predicted Sony would probably get a couple of million units of the PlayStation 4 out by the 2013 holiday season and 7 million or 8 million out a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony also announced a strategic partnership with video game publisher Activision Blizzard to take its Diablo III game to the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activision's upcoming sci-fi shooter game "Destiny" in development by its Bungie Studio will also be available on PlayStation consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Gary Hill, Bernard Orr and Edwina Gibbs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Karen Freifeld and Aruna Viswanatha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is
investigating JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co over allegations that
Bear Stearns provided misleading information about its mortgage
products during the lead-up to the financial crisis, according
to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns in a 2008 fire sale
encouraged by the government, and has pushed back against
various government suits that have sought to hold JPMorgan
accountable for the failed investment bank's alleged
mortgage-related misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this investigation, civil lawyers in the Justice
Department are looking into whether Bear Stearns altered due
diligence information that third parties provided about the
quality of mortgage loans packaged into securities, said the
people, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the
probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation, which is in early stages, shows that
enforcement authorities are still actively building cases amid
criticism that institutions have not adequately been held to
account for their role in causing the 2007-2009 financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. DOJ spokeswoman Adora Andy also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department last year issued more than a dozen
civil subpoenas to top financial institutions as part of an
inquiry into the packaging and sale of home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pending inquiries at the Justice Department are largely an
outgrowth of a state-federal initiative known as the Residential
Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, which President Barack
Obama announced during his 2012 State of the Union speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the co-chairs of the group, New York Attorney General
Eric Schneiderman, already sued JPMorgan for fraud over Bear
Stearns' packaging and sale of mortgage securities in the run up
to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the recent Justice Department
investigation into JPMorgan will result in enforcement action or
might merge with mortgage-related probes by other agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sign of how important the department appears to view
these cases, the JPMorgan inquiry involves lawyers close to
acting associate attorney general Tony West, according to people
familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West led the department's civil division until last February
when he was promoted to his current post as the agency's third
in command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another sign U.S. authorities are actively pursuing
mortgage-related inquiries, the inspector general's office of
the Federal Housing Finance Agency is hosting a training session
this week with members of the RMBS working group, including
federal prosecutors, members of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, special agents and others, a person familiar with
the training said. The group has held several similar sessions
in the past year, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIVATE SUITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ inquiry into the due diligence performed for Bear
Stearns tracks accusations detailed in private lawsuits against
the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns hired Mortgage Data Management Corp to review a
sample of loans in a 2006 mortgage securitization, according to
a case filed against JPMorgan last year by bond insurer MBIA Inc
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers concluded that around one-third of the loans had
serious credit and compliance problems, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bear Stearns altered the electronic spreadsheets to
conceal the problems, according to the lawsuit, which was filed
in New York State Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns removed 50 columns of information from the
spreadsheet that showed the issues and then sent the altered
report to MBIA, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its answer to the MBIA complaint, JPMorgan denied the
allegations that it had altered the spreadsheets. That case is
pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LATEST LEGAL HEADACHE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has recently been hit by a wave of lawsuits over
the conduct of Bear Stearns that appear to have some overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York's case, filed in October, accuses Bear Stearns of
causing some $22.5 billion in losses to investors of
mortgage-backed securities by failing to ensure the quality of
the underlying loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, the U.S. credit union regulator sued the bank
over $3.6 billion in securities sold by Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in November, JPMorgan paid $296.9 million to settle a
case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that
accused Bear of failing to disclose it had arranged discounted
cash settlements with originators that left investors stuck with
problem loans. The SEC also accused JPMorgan itself of
overstating the quality of home loans that backed a $1.8 billion
residential mortgage-backed securities offering it underwrote in
2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's chief executive Jamie Dimon has said the bank is
continuing to pay the price for doing "a favor" for the Federal
Reserve in agreeing to rescue Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inquires are the latest legal headache for JPMorgan,
which also faces separate investigations from a trading loss of
$6.2 billion that sprung from a botched hedging strategy carried
out in its London office, and inquiries into whether its traders
manipulated benchmark interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/dzsbbl/u_s_emv_timeline) has
announced the addition of the "U.S. EMV Timeline Beyond the Road Maps: How Long
Will Conversion Really Take?" report to their offering. 

In the spring of 2011, Visa issued a road map for the U.S. adoption of a smart
card-based payments ecosystem. Since then, the other three major U.S. payments
networks have followed suit. These road maps provide milestones for merchants,
acquirers, and processors, along with dates on which these milestones are
expected to be met. In theory, the road maps should serve as a reasonable
expectation for when the U.S. will fully adopt EMV, but judging by past
experience, that likely won't be the case. 

U.S. EMV Timeline Beyond the Road Maps: How Long Will Conversion Really Take?
explains the motivation for the U.S. to adopt EMV at this time and clarifies the
card networks' road maps for U.S. EMV adoption. The report considers previous
experiences (both with road maps other regions used for EMV adoption and road
maps the U.S. used for other changes in its payment environment) to forecast a
more realistic schedule for the U.S. conversion to EMV. 

"The roadmaps laid out by the networks intend to convert the U.S. payments
ecosystem to EMV by 2015, four years after the first road map was developed,"
says Dave Kaminsky, senior analyst in Mercator Advisory Group's Emerging
Technologies Advisory Service and author of the report. "Judging by the
experience of other countries in trying to implement EMV, as well as the
experience of the networks' previous attempts to influence changes among U.S.
merchants, that time frame likely will not be met." 

Highlights of the report include: 

- Analysis of why the U.S. did not convert to EMV when many European countries
did and why the U.S. is currently motivated to adopt EMV 

- Detailed breakdown of the current road map, including explanations of all
major milestones, deadlines each network has set for each milestone, and
penalties for noncompliance 

- Forecast of U.S. EMV conversion based on the networks' timeline and the actual
adherence of merchants, financial institutions, payments service providers, and
consumers to previous timelines in the U.S. and abroad

Key Topics Covered:

&lt;p&gt;* Reuters/IPSOS poll finds Facebook, Apple remain popular
    * Older PC generation static in brand perception

    By Gerry Shih
    SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is
cooler than you might think.
    A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that just under half of 853
respondents between the age of 18 and 29 thought Microsoft is
cooler now than it was a year or two ago.
    The software maker, often derided in Silicon Valley for
failing to dream up products that captivate a new generation of
social media and mobile savvy consumers, managed to pip Facebook
Inc in the survey - only 42 percent of young adults
thought the world's largest social network is cooler now than in
the past. Twitter scored 47 percent, below Microsoft's 50
percent.
    Part of Microsoft's lift appears to stem from a
well-coordinated marketing blitz around its all-new Surface
tablets, which have revamped the familiar Windows interace with
a tile-based, mobile app-friendly look and feel. Its Xbox gaming
console and "Kinect" accessory, which can respond to gestures
and voice commands, has in the past year also burnished its
image around younger consumers.
    Josh Johnson, a 24-year-old media arts student at the
University of South Carolina and self-professed gaming
aficionado, said he has been impressed with Microsoft's
consumer-oriented push with Windows 8.
    "It's more customizable, and not as rigid as an Apple phone,
where you have to buy all the products from Apple," Johnson
said. "If you want a ringtone, you don't have to pay iTunes." 
    He added: "I know Apple is the cool, hip brand right now,
but if Microsoft keeps coming out with new tech I'm sure it'll
be back soon."           
    Apple Inc, despite falling out of favor with many
Wall Street investors, still scored well in the Reuters/Ipsos
poll, the first in a series that aims to measure brand
perception and usage over time for major consumer tech brands.
    About 60 percent of 18- to 29-year-old respondents still
thought Apple was cooler now than in the past. But Google Inc's
 Android brand did even better, with a full 70 percent
giving it the thumbs up. 
    Although "coolness" remains, at best, an amorphous concept,
consumer perceptions are pivotal in determining the longevity of
products, particularly in the fast-moving consumer electronics
industry.
    Microsoft dominates the personal computing industry and is
still far larger than most other tech corporations on the
planet. But it has seldom won plaudits for cutting-edge consumer
technology and its share price has plateaued for a decade under
CEO Steve Ballmer's watch.
    Apart from Xbox and Kinect, Microsoft's past is littered
with failed attempts to conquer the consumer gadget marketplace,
from clunky early tablets and wrist-watch computers to the Zune
music player and Kin phone. 
    Gartner estimates that Microsoft sold fewer than 900,000
Surface tablets in the fourth quarter, a fraction of the 23
million iPads sold by Apple. Windows phones now account for 3
percent of the global smartphone market, Gartner says, far
behind Google's Android with 70 percent and Apple with 21
percent.
    The survey "definitely shows that Microsoft's efforts are
paying off, but we'll have to see how cool translates into
customers," said Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg. "It's also
hard to compare 'cool' factor as a quantitative measure against
Apple, a company, and Android, a platform."
   
    
    SOCIAL MEDIA
    The poll of about 4,800 people produced fewer surprises in
other areas.
    In social media, 90 percent of 18- to 29-yearolds said they
log in to Facebook, including 54 percent who use it
"continuously throughout the day." Nearly 30 percent of
respondents in their 50s, and 18 percent of those over 60, also
say they use it nonstop. 
    Facebook's usage figures dwarf those of Twitter and Tumblr,
as well as new kid on the block Pinterest, the visual "pinboard"
sensation. Despite its influence in media discourse, 50 percent
of young adults say they do not use Twitter. By comparison, 58
percent said they do not use Pinterest and 68 percent said they
do not use Tumblr.
    Harley Pruitt, an 18-year-old high school student in Newnan,
Georgia, said Facebook remains the only social network she logs
onto because it's the easiest way to contact friends from many
years ago, while other social networks feel less accessible.
    "Myspace is long gone and Twitter is confusing as all
get-out," Pruitt said. "I'm a creature of habit, so I can't
predict that Facebook will fade off."
    The poll, which will be repeated in coming months, included
responses from 4,798 people surveyed between Feb. 5 and Feb. 19.
The data is collected online from a pool of pre-screened
candidates. 
    The accuracy of the poll is measured using a survey
technique called a "credibility interval" and is precise to
within 1.6 percentage points. Among the young adult aged 18 to
29 subset, the credibility interval was 3.8 percent.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 22 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp is about to make a
final call on a Republic of the Congo offshore project that
could ultimately produce an estimated 127,000 barrels per day of
crude oil after its anticipated start up in 2015, the company
disclosed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said a final investment decision (FID) on the Moho
Nord project, including a facilities hub and a tieback to the
existing Moho-Bilondo floating production unit, is due by the
end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the development accompanied a number of new Chevron
plans for Africa, along with updates on existing projects in the
second-largest U.S. oil company's annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, Chevron said the first part of a natural gas
processing complex at Chuandongbei would start up by the end of
this year, with a second phase to follow for a total capacity of
558 million cubic feet per day. The total cost of the project,
in which Chevron owns 49 percent, is estimated at $6.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off the coast, Chevron said it relinquished in November two
South China Sea blocks after drilling dry holes there last year.
A third block is still under evaluation, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off Angola, the company expects FID on Lucapa in 2014.
Development plans at the field in Block 14 include a floating
production unit and 17 wells, with a design capacity of 80,000
barrels of crude oil per day, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint Angola-Congo development area, Chevron said it
has a 31.3 percent interest in the Lianzi zone, where it plans
four producing wells, three water injection wells, and a subsea
tieback to a platform in Block 14. First oil is expected in
2015, with a maximum daily output of 46,000 barrels of crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Nigeria, Chevron said a gas-to-liquids plant is still on
track to start this year, having been delayed for three years
and seen its estimated cost already more than double. Another
$1.1 billion was added to the cost estimate, now $9.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, Chevron is evaluating a second stage of its
Jack/St Malo Gulf of Mexico development, which is due to start
up in 2014. The new stage is set to include four development
wells, and early engineering work will start this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But elsewhere in the Gulf, drilling at its Moccasin
discovery had just been placed on hold for equipment repair and
was expected to resume later this year. Moccasin and the nearby
Buckskin discovery could be jointly developed upon successful
completion of the new appraisal drilling, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also said in the annual report that FID on the Block
B Gas Development, off the southwest coast of Vietnam and
expected to reach maximum daily production of 490 million cubic
feet, is still pending as Chevron works out commercial terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite a freeze on some of its assets in Argentina
related to enforcement of its long-running pollution case in
Ecuador, Chevron said it had started a third exploratory well in
the Vaca Muerta formation in Argentina, and plans to drill three
more appraisal wells there this year.&lt;/p&gt;

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and the debt
ratings of The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its subsidiaries as follows: 

The Coca-Cola Company 

--Long-term IDR at 'A+'; 

--Bank credit facilities at 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1'; 

--Commercial paper (CP) at 'F1'. 

Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR) 

--Long-term IDR at 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; 

--Senior shelf at 'A+'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's actions affect approximately $32.6 billion
of debt as of Dec. 31, 2012. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Coca-Cola ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest global
beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has fifteen $1
billion brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute Maid,
and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's
beverage portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in
the U.S. and modest CSD growth in other developed countries. However, this risk
is mitigated by Coca-Cola's market strength in developing, high-growth
geographies. 

Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to consistently generate
considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash flow (FCF).
Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency with topline and cash
flow growth driven by increasing volume, price/mix and improved operating
expense leverage, despite persistent global macroeconomic pressure. Consequently
Coca-Cola generated $10.6 billion and $3.3 billion of CFFO and FCF,
respectively, for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012, after generating $9.5 billion
and $2.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011. 

Fitch expects Coca-Cola's FCF to exceed $3 billion in 2013. Management continues
to meet or exceed its long-term financial targets of 3% - 4% worldwide volume
and 6% - 8% operating income growth. Moreover, Coca-Cola should continue
capturing growth and increasing beverage per capita consumption outside of the
U.S. as consumer sentiment improves and the global recovery progresses. 

Fitch is concerned about the significant growth in Coca-Cola's CP balance over
the past year. CP reached $16.3 billion at the end of 2012 compared to $12.9
billion in 2011 and as a result represents approximately 50% of the firm's
overall capital structure. Despite the company's strong liquidity and good
market access, Fitch believes this level of CP could result in modestly higher
financial risk over the longer term. 

The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch between its U.S.
cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows which the company
has been reluctant to repatriate. Coca-Cola maintains a comparable cash balance
along with its committed bank lines to provide backup to its CP borrowings. At
Dec. 31, 2012, Coca-Cola's liquidity position of $22.9 billion consisted of
$13.5 billion of cash, $3.1 billion of short-term investments, and $6.3 billion
of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving credit facility. 

Coca-Cola has committed to $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion of net share repurchases
in 2013, after repurchasing a net $3.1 billion in 2012, but has paced share
repurchases to FCF generation. While not anticipated, a material reduction in
Coca-Cola's cash balance without a commensurate reduction in debt could result
in a negative rating action. 

At Dec. 31, 2012, Coca-Cola's leverage was 2.4 times (x) on a total debt to
operating EBITDA basis, up from 2.2x a year ago. Fitch considers leverage above
2.0x as weak for the rating category but ratings incorporated the fact that
Coca-Cola's net leverage at Dec. 31, 2012 was 1.2x. Fitch believes Coca-Cola
should address its large CP balance in the near-to-intermediate term with any
reduction in cash matching any corresponding reduction in CP levels. 

Ratings also consider the potential of future acquisitions given the company's
transaction history. Fitch recognizes Coca-Cola's acquisitions could be
partially funded with debt, but believes the company would likely restore credit
measures back in line within a reasonable timeframe given its excess cash
generation and cash flow growth. For large transactions, Fitch would expect
Coca-Cola to curtail share repurchases. 

Coca-Cola has a manageable maturity schedule and robust access to the capital
markets. Fitch expects Coca-Cola to opportunistically refinance the approximate
$1.5 billion and $2.6 billion of long-term debt due in 2013 and 2014. 

RATINGS SENSITIVITIES 

Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to
positive rating include: 

Coca-Cola's ratings could be positively affected by the company attaining total
debt to operating EBITDA below 1.5x in combination with a stated commitment to
maintain stronger credit protection measures. 

Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to
negative rating include: 

Coca-Cola's ratings would be negatively affected by a large debt-financed
acquisition or share repurchase program or a reduction in cash and cash
equivalents without a commensurate reduction in CP balances. Fitch notes that
while Coca-Cola has more CP outstanding than capacity under its various
committed facilities, the company has consistently maintained a large cash
balance, and the combination of cash and facility availability provide adequate
backup for the CP. Coca-Cola had $16.3 billion of CP and other short-term
borrowings at Dec. 31, 2012. 

Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola
Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations since default risk is very low
at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the
notes issued by Coca-Cola. 

Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of
preliminary ratings for the JPMCC 2013-C10 transaction (see ratings list below).
JPMCC 2013-C10 is a $1.28 billion CMBS conduit transaction collateralized by 50
fixed rate commercial mortgage loans that are secured by 101 properties. 

The loans have principal balances that range from $3.0 million to $130.0 million
for the largest loan in the pool, which is secured by The Shops at Riverside
(10.2%), a 771,233 square foot regional mall, of which 473,549 square serves as
loan collateral. The property is located in Hackensack, New Jersey. The top five
loans, which also include Gateway Center (8.8%), EIP Industrial Portfolio
(7.1%), 111 West Jackson (6.3%) and Pots-Nets MHC Portfolio (4.8%), represent
37.0% of the initial pool balance, while the top 10 loans represent 52.5%. The
properties are geographically diverse and located across 28 states with the
three largest state concentrations being New Jersey (14.0%), Illinois (11.6%)
and Pennsylvania (11.4%). The pool has exposure to two property types with
concentrations in excess of 10%: retail (35.2%) and office (33.9%). 

KBRA`s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower rating
process that begins with our analysts' evaluation of underlying collateral
properties' financial and operating performance, which determine KBRA`s estimate
of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA value. The analysis incorporates a
detailed evaluation of underlying collateral properties` financial and operating
performance using our CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines to determine Kroll Net
Cash Flow (KNCF), which is a key input used in our credit modeling process. On
an aggregate basis, KNCF was 3.3% less than the issuer cash flow. KBRA
capitalization rates were applied to each asset`s NCF to derive values that
were, on an aggregate basis, 33.4% less than third party appraisal values. The
pool has an in-trust KLTV of 97.8% and an all-in KLTV of 101.5%. The model
deploys rent and occupancy stresses, probability of default regressions, and
loss given default calculations to determine losses for each collateral loan,
which are then used to assign our credit ratings. 

The KBRA credit model deploys rent and occupancy stresses, probability of
default regressions, and loss given default calculations to determine losses for
each collateral loan, which are then used to assign our credit ratings. 

For complete details on the analysis, please see our presale report, JPMCC
2013-C10 published today at www.krollbondratings.com. 

The preliminary ratings are based on information known to KBRA at the time of
this publication. Information received subsequent to this release could result
in the assignment of final ratings that differ from the preliminary ratings.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on the JPMCC 2013-C10 commercial
mortgage pass-through certificates. 

Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as follows: 

--$63,440,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$87,164,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$22,445,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$185,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$430,080,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$106,694,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$107,059,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$1,001,882,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

--$30,360,000a class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$12,783,000a class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable. 

a Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A. 

b Notional amount and interest-only. 

The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of Feb.
20, 2013. Fitch does not expect to rate the $44,741,391 non-rated class or the
$276,436,391 class X-B. 

The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, primary assets
of which are 50 loans secured by 101 commercial properties having an aggregate
principal balance of approximately $1.138 billion as of the cutoff date. The
loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National
Association, CIBC Inc. and Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation. 

Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, including
site inspections on 78.9% of the properties by balance, cash flow analysis of
78.7%, and asset summary reviews on 78.7% of the pool. 

The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of
1.28x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 101.8%, and a Fitch debt yield of
8.7%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a variance of 8.18% to issuer
cash flows. 

The Master Servicer and Special Servicer will be Midland Loan Services, Inc. and
CWCapital Asset Management LLC, rated 'CMS1' and 'CSS1-', respectively, by
Fitch. 

The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 

Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds April loading program details, quotes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 22 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has
lifted a force majeure on the Nigerian Qua Iboe crude stream put
in place on Feb. 7, the company said in a statement on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said that pipeline work had prompted the
declaration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mobil Producing Nigeria, operator of the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC)/MPN Joint Venture today confirms
that it has lifted the Force Majeure it declared on February 7,
2013," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We express gratitude to all customers, purchasers and Joint
Venture partner, the NNPC for their understanding during the
temporary disruption in supply," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Friday, trade sources said exports of the key
benchmark grade will be down by nearly 40 percent in April as
the force majeure had cut oil flows from Africa's top producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country will export around 222,000 barrels per day of
Qua Iboe in April, trade sources said, down from a planned
368,000 bpd in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trade source said that around four Qua Iboe cargoes from
March had been deferred to April and that delays were between
four and 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OPEC member suffered major outages late last year due to
rampant oil theft and the worst floods Nigeria had seen in 50
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria typically produces around 2 million to 2.4 million
bpd, and its oil is sold to customers in the United States and
Asia.

&lt;p&gt;  ESPOO, FINLAND, Feb 22 (Marketwire) -- 
Nokia has announced that Nokia Lumia smartphones will be used by select
sales forces of The Coca-Cola Company in Vietnam and Cambodia. The
devices will be used on a daily basis by sales associates in those
markets for order processing, equipment validation and market execution
improvement.

    Nokia Lumia smartphones offer Coca-Cola employees full support for
Microsoft(TM) Office on the Microsoft(TM) Windows Phone 8 platform,
allowing easy synchronization with Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, Lync
and Office365 as well as seamless integration with Outlook. The features
enable employees to work flexibly and remotely with secure access to all
their corporate data and systems.

    Business level security also comes as standard on Nokia Lumia, with
hardware-accelerated encryption, secure boot, sandboxed apps and remote
device management capabilities. The high level security means that should
an employee misplace their smartphone, confidential company information is
still protected.

    "Our collaboration with Nokia and Microsoft enables us to utilize our
sales automation and market execution tools on two very progressive
platforms," said Javier Polit, Chief Information Officer of the Bottling
Investments Group, The Coca-Cola Company. "We will be able to activate
our teams with capabilities that enable us to further improve our
execution and customer services by obtaining actionable insights. The
Nokia Lumia and Microsoft platform fit our enterprise landscape well."

    "By combining the Windows 8 platform with eye-catching design and
innovative technologies, we have created smartphones that ensure Coca-Cola
employees can operate flexibly across multiple geographies and time zones
and still remain fully productive," said Stephanie Mosticchio, enterprise
sales manager for North America at Nokia. "Providing seamless
synchronization with Windows Phone 8 and Microsoft Office, Nokia Lumia
smartphones enable Coca-Cola employees to work as effectively on the go as
they would in the workplace."

    Nokia for Business

    With the Nokia Lumia range, Nokia offers business users the ability to
work on their mobile as they would on their PC. With the Windows Phone 8
platform, Microsoft Office and Outlook are built in allowing employees to
create and edit PowerPoint, Excel and Word documents wherever they are

out, business level security as standard, and a range of Qi standard
wireless charging solutions, the Nokia Lumia is the most innovative
smartphone for businesses on the market today.

* Accelerates the deployment of innovative payment solutions globally 
* Enables financial institutions and merchants to take advantage of new payment
technologies, such as mobile NFC payments, mobile point-of-sale acceptance
solutions 
* Visa Ready symbol will identify new payment devices and solutions approved by
Visa

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Visa today launched a new partner program designed to accelerate the
introduction of innovative payment solutions globally and further drive the
global migration from cash to electronic payments. The Visa Ready Partner
Program paves the way for mobile device manufacturers, technology partners,
mobile network operators, and others, to easily navigate the complexities of the
payments ecosystem, and to gain access to Visa IP, licenses and best practices. 

"The pace of innovation in the payments industry requires a new approach that
ensures innovative payment methods can be tested, approved and commercialized
quickly," said Jim McCarthy, global head of product, Visa Inc. "While it is
critical that we ensure new payment methods are secure and reliable, it is
equally important to allow great ideas to become new ways to pay and be paid." 

The Visa Ready Partner Program is designed to provide innovators a path to
ensure that devices, software and solutions used to initiate or accept Visa
payments are compatible with Visa`s requirements, which may vary by country. It
also provides a framework for the collaboration with Visa, as well as guidance
and best practices to access the power of the Visa network. Mobile point-of-sale
acceptance (mPOS) providers, mobile NFC-enabled device manufacturers, and chip
and platform providers are among the stakeholders that are already playing a
critical role in enabling new ways to pay and that will benefit from the Visa
Ready Partner Program. 

For financial institutions and merchants, the Visa Ready Partner Program will
make it easier for them to adopt new, innovative payment methods that are
approved by Visa and can help them drive business growth by expanding the use
and acceptance of electronic payments globally. The program will use existing
approval and certification processes from payments industry standards bodies and
will rely on labs certified by EMVCo and the Payment Card Industry Security
Standards Council (PCI SCC) to conduct testing of new payment solutions. 

At launch, the Visa Ready Partner Program encompasses Visa`s existing program
for the approval of mobile NFC-enabled devices, as well as a new program to
enable mobile point-of-sale acceptance solutions that meet local requirements.
In addition, Visa has developed the Visa Ready symbol to identify payment
devices and solutions approved for use with Visa payments. 

Visa Ready for Mobile Acceptance (mPOS) Solutions

Mobile technology is enabling merchants of all sizes to accept card payments.
Used everywhere from the local farmers market to soft drink distributors, mobile
devices paired with payment card readers are expanding the reach of electronic
payments globally. As part of the Visa Ready Partner Program, Visa is paving the
way for mPOS providers to accelerate the deployment of mobile point-of-sale
acceptance solutions by:

* Defining mPOS requirements and best practices to support the open development
of commercially viable solutions and services, while upholding Visa`s principles
of security, brand integrity and interoperability. 
* Providing applications, tools and services to enable the development of mobile
acceptance solutions compatible with magnetic-stripe, EMV-chip, and
contactless-card payments. 
* Making available open API (Application Program Interface) and SDK (Software
Development Kit) to allow mPOS solutions providers in select markets to connect
to Visa via a number of payment gateways, including CyberSource and
Authorize.Net, acquired by Visa Inc. in 2010. 
* Providing access to documentation and resources to guide partners and vendors
through the Visa approval process. 
* Providing access to the Visa Ready symbol, collateral and brand-usage
guidelines that can be used to market and promote Visa-approved mPOS solutions.

Visa Ready for Mobile (NFC) Payments

Mobile phones are also transforming the consumer shopping experience, allowing
consumers to make purchases with a wave of their smartphone. Near Field
Communication (NFC) technology, the short-range communications standard that
transforms mobile phones into payment devices, is expected to reach critical
mass in 2013. According to ABI Research, more than 280 million NFC-enabled
devices are expected to ship in 2013.1

As part of the Visa Ready Partner program, Visa is streamlining its compliance
testing process for both mobile NFC devices and secure chips that host the Visa
payWave application by:

* Establishing clear guidelines for extensive technical, security and usability
testing with respect to the Visa payment functionality. 
* Ensuring Visa transactions initiated with NFC mobile devices are compliant
with the global standard for chip-enabled payments. 
* Establishing a required signal range for mobile NFC-enabled devices hosting
the Visa payWave application. 
* Providing NFC device manufacturers with a Visa Ready symbol that can be used
to market and promote mobile devices as approved for use with Visa payWave.

Visa has played a leadership role in establishing global standards for new and
emerging payment methods that are compatible with existing technology and
security standards in countries around the world. The Visa Ready Partner Program
will enable Visa and our partners to innovate responsibly, developing solutions
that offer the same high degree of security, reliability and scale consumers
have come to expect from Visa.

PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE: POR)today reported net income of $141
million, or $1.87 per diluted share, for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012, compared
with $147 million, or $1.95 per diluted share, for 2011. Net income was $28
million, or 38 cents per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared
with $29 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, for the comparable period of
2011. The decreases in net income were largely due to decreased residential
energy deliveries from warmer weather during the heating season, increased
pension expense and higher income taxes, partially offset by a deferral of costs
related to four capital projects. 

"I`m pleased with PGE`s operating performance in 2012," said Jim Piro, president
and chief executive officer. "Our delivery system and generating facilities
operated extremely well. We are making investments in our distribution
infrastructure to increase the reliability and resilience of our system and have
made significant progress on our strategic initiatives, including the selection
of Port Westward Unit 2 as our capacity resource." 

Recent developments

* General Rate Case-On Feb. 15, 2013, PGE filed a general rate case with the
Public Utility Commission of Oregon for a $105 million, or approximately 6
percent, overall increase in customer prices, based on a 2014 test year. The
goal of the general rate case is to request prices that allow for the recovery
of costs necessary to provide safe, reliable and sustainable power to customers.
Factors driving the request include improvements to existing power plants and
wind forecasting, new Clackamas River fish-sorting facilities, a
disaster-preparedness center, technology investments, employees benefit costs
and new federal regulations. The request assumes a capital structure of 50
percent debt and 50 percent equity, a return on equity of 10 percent, and an
average rate base of $3.1 billion. A final order from the OPUC is expected
before the end of 2013, with new customer prices expected to be effective Jan.
1, 2014. 
* Request for Proposals for Energy and Capacity Resources-On Jan. 31, 2013, PGE
announced that its proposed Port Westward Unit 2 flexible generating resource
was selected as the successful bid in the capacity request for proposals.
Construction of the 220 megawatt plant will begin this year with an estimated
total cost between $300 million and $310 million and an online date expected in
2015. The request for proposals also sought 300 - 500 megawatts of baseload
energy resources, as well as seasonal capacity resources. The company is in the
process of negotiating with the top bidder from the final short list of baseload
energy projects with a final decision expected by mid-2013. The company will
also conduct negotiations to secure power purchase agreements for the seasonal
capacity resources. 
* Request for Proposals for Renewable Resources-PGE is evaluating the bids
received for the renewables RFP and expects to have a final short list in early
March 2013, and a final resource selection expected by mid-2013. 
* Cascade Crossing Transmission Project-On Jan. 11, 2013, PGE and Bonneville
Power Administration signed a memorandum of understanding to pursue a
modification to PGE`s proposed Cascade Crossing Transmission Project. PGE
initially proposed a 215-mile transmission project from Boardman, Ore. to Salem,
Ore. Under the MOU the line would be shortened to approximately 120 miles and
run from Boardman to a new substation called Pine Grove near Maupin, Oregon.
Terms of the MOU provides for PGE to invest in grid enhancements and/or exchange
assets with BPA. PGE expects the cost of the full project scope, as modified, to
be at least $800 million. Construction of the 120 miles of new transmission
would take at least two years and could start as early as 2017. As the parties
continue negotiation of the terms and conditions of the modified proposal, the
estimated costs and timeline of the project will be clarified.

Fourth quarter operating results

Total revenues decreased $16 million, or 3 percent, in the fourth quarter of
2012 compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. This was largely due to a 2
percent decrease in the volume of energy sold and delivered, due to warmer
weather, and a 2% retail price decrease, reflecting lower expected power costs.
Residential energy deliveries decreased 6 percent, due to warmer temperatures in
the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with 2011, partially offset by a 1 percent
increase in commercial and industrial deliveries combined. Adjusting for the
effects of weather, total retail deliveries were up approximately 1.4 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. 

Purchased power and fuel expense decreased $22 million, or 10 percent, in the
fourth quarter of 2012 compared with the fourth quarter of 2011, with $16
million related to an 8 percent decrease in average variable power cost and $3
million related to a 1 percent decrease in total system load. The average
variable power cost decreased to $36.79 per megawatt hour in the fourth quarter
of 2012 from $39.91 per megawatt hour in the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily
driven by favorable hydro conditions and lower wholesale power and natural gas
prices, offset by decreased wind energy received from Biglow Canyon. 

Total production, distribution, administrative and other expenses (operating and
maintenance expenses) totaled $114 million for the fourth quarter of both 2012
and 2011. 

Income taxes increased $5 million, or 31 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2012
compared with the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to an adjustment to
increase the Company`s net deferred income tax liability, which was driven by an
increase in PGE`s composite state tax rate. 

2012 annual operating results

Total revenues decreased $8 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to
the net effect of the following:

* A $34 million decrease related to the volume of retail energy sold and
delivered, with total volume down approximately 1 percent from 2011. Residential
volume was down 3 percent due to warmer temperatures during the 2012 heating
season, which was partially offset by a 1 percent increase in commercial and
industrial. Adjusting for the effects of weather, total retail deliveries were
up approximately 0.6 percent; 
* A $15 million decrease in average retail price driven by lower expected power
costs as established in the annual power cost update tariff, partially offset by
an increase related to the shortened operating life of the Boardman plant; and 
* An $11 million, or 18 percent, decrease in wholesale revenues consisting of a
22 percent decline in average price of wholesale power, partially offset by a 5
percent increase in the volume sold; partially offset by 
* A $32 million increase related to $18 million of tax credits refunded to
customers in 2011, with no comparable amount in 2012, and a $10 million
estimated refund to customers recorded in 2011 pursuant to the power cost
adjustment mechanism compared with a reduction in such estimate of $4 million
recorded in 2012; and 
* A $20 million increase resulting from the impact of various other regulatory
items, of which the largest contributors were $5 million for the recovery of
costs under the solar Feed-In Tariff and $3 million for the recovery of expenses
related to the Trojan refund, and a $2 million increase in other operating
revenues.

Purchased power and fuel expense decreased $34 million, or 4 percent, in 2012
compared with 2011, largely due to a 3 percent decrease in average variable
power cost and a 1 percent decrease in total system load. The average variable
power cost decreased to $34.25 per megawatt hour in 2012 from $35.15 per
megawatt hour in 2011, primarily driven by lower wholesale power and natural gas
prices, partially offset by a decrease in energy received from the Biglow Canyon
Wind Farm. 

Production and distribution expense increased $10 million, or 5 percent, in 2012
compared with 2011, primarily due to higher maintenance costs of the company`s
generating plants and distribution system, as well as higher distribution system
labor costs. In addition, an insurance recovery in 2011 related to the selective
water withdrawal project contributed to the increase. 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $21 million, or 9 percent, in
2012 compared with 2011, largely due to the amortization of the refund of tax
credits (offset in retail revenues) in 2011 and increased depreciation expense
related to the shortened operating life of Boardman and other capital additions.
These increases were partially offset by the deferral of costs for recovery in
future customer prices related to four capital projects as authorized in the
company`s 2011 General Rate Case. 

Taxes other than income taxes increased $4 million, or 4 percent, in 2012
compared with 2011, primarily due to higher property taxes, resulting from both
increased property values and tax rates, as well as higher city franchise fees. 

Other income, net increased $4 million, or 67 percent, in 2012 compared with
2011, primarily driven by higher earnings and returns from the company`s
non-qualified benefit plan trust. 

Income taxes increased $6 million, or 10 percent, in 2012 compared with 2011,
due to an increase in the company`s effective tax rate to 31.4 percent in 2012
compared with 28.3 percent in 2011. The increases primarily resulted from an
adjustment to increase the company`s net deferred income tax liability, which
was driven by an increase in PGE`s composite state tax rate. The change in the
apportionment was caused by lower wholesale sales in Washington, which has no
corporate income tax, resulting in more taxable income being apportioned to
Oregon. 

Changes in management

On February 20, 2013, PGE`s board of directors appointed Maria M. Pope senior
vice president of power supply, power operations and resource strategy and James
F. Lobdell senior vice president of finance, chief financial officer and
treasurer. These changes reflect the company`s desire to build capacity within
the management team and provide opportunities for leaders to take on new roles
and responsibilities, broadening their expertise. 

Mr. Lobdell, 54, has been an employee of PGE since 1984. He has served as vice
president, power operations and resource strategy; vice president of risk
management and as vice president of two former PGE affiliates: Portland General
Distribution Co., and Portland General Holdings. He has also had leadership
roles in business development, internal audit, financial risk management and
pricing. 

Ms. Pope, 48, has been an employee of PGE since 2009, serving as senior vice
president of finance, chief financial officer and treasurer. The appointments
are effective March 1, 2013.

&lt;p&gt;* Asia needs $8 trillion in infrastructure investments by
2020- ADB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan raised about $860 mln in first pan-Asia
infrastructure fund in 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Indulal PM and Stephen Aldred&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI/HONG KONG, Feb 22 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
 is seeking to raise between $1 billion and $1.5 billion
in a dedicated fund to invest in core infrastructure assets
across Asia, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank's second pan-Asian infrastructure fund
is nearly double the size of its first fund raised in 2010,
which is now nearly fully invested, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global asset managers including Invesco, Eastspring, KBC
Asset Management and AMP Capital have Asia-focused
infrastructure funds aiming to benefit from the region's surging
 demand for investments in ports, roads and power stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asian Infrastructure &amp; Related Resources
Opportunity Fund II will invest in transportation, power
generation, water and social infrastructure across China, India,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and South Korea, the
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised about $860 million in its first dedicated
Asia infrastructure fund. The latest fund raising comes as
Asia's biggest economies are pouring trillions of dollars into
improving creaky infrastructure to keep up rapid growth. The
Asian Development Bank estimates the region will require about
$8 trillion in infrastructure by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China and India, Asia's top two emerging economies,  have
announced $2.5 trillion worth of projects to improve their
ports, roads and other infrastructure from 2011 to 2017,

 is targeting to raise between $1 billion and $1.5
billion in a dedicated fund to invest in core infrastructure
assets across Asia, sources familiar with the matter told
Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, JPMorgan Asian Infrastructure &amp; Related Resources

&lt;p&gt;PERTH Feb 25 (Reuters) - The U.S.-based Chevron Corp
 became the latest in a string of oil majors that have
decided to invest in Australian shale, announcing on Monday that
it has bought interest in two gas blocks in the Cooper Basin
from Beach Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it will initially acquire a 30 percent working
interest in block PEL 218 in South Australia, and 18 percent
working interest in block ATP 855 in Queensland. The deal gives
Chevron the option of later increasing its interest in PEL 218
to 60 percent and the interest in ATP 855 to 36 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beach Energy will receive up to $349 million over
two stages spanning several years for interest in the two gas
blocks, Beach Energy said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Cooper Basin is an established petroleum producing
basin and provides the opportunity to leverage our expertise in
tight gas," Roy Krzywosinski, Chevron Australia managing
director, said, adding that it could also add to the company's
natural gas portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cooper Basin is considered to be one of Australia's best
prospects for commercially producing shale gas given its
proximity to the country's eastern population centres and export
infrastructure at the port of Gladstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos became the first to commercially produce
shale gas from the Cooper Basin late last year from its
Moomba-191 well, in which Beach Energy holds an interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is currently building two of Australia's largest
liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants, Gorgon and Wheatstone, with
a combined capacity of nearly 25 million tonnes per annum, in
Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is already a large player in natural gas on
Australia's west coast. It is new both to unconventional gas
development in Australia as well as to the country's east coast
natural gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new acquisition, Chevron may also be looking to
partner with other gas developers on the east coast, including
those developing LNG plants at Queensland state's Gladstone
port, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Christoph Waltz on Sunday won his second Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in four years under the direction of Quentin Tarantino, this time as a German bounty hunter in the slave revenge tale "Django Unchained."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We participated in a hero's journey, the hero here being Quentin," a choked up Waltz said as he accepted his award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Austrian actor first burst into Hollywood as a charming yet evil Nazi colonel in Tarantino's "Inglourious Basterds," and walked away with the Academy's supporting statuette in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waltz's win Sunday gives him an enviable career record of two Oscars for two nominations. He also prevailed this year over veteran Hollywood names like Robert De Niro and Tommy Lee Jones and clinched a nomination while "Django" co-stars Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until he was introduced to Tarantino, the 56-year-old son of set designers worked for 30 years mostly in German theater, TV and film, while attempts to cross into English-language production proved unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In "Django," Waltz plays the German immigrant dentist-turned-bounty-hunter Dr. King Schultz who pairs up with Foxx's freed slave Django to track down and kill outlaws and then rescue Django's enslaved wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month Waltz stirred up controversy as a guest on comedy show "Saturday Night Live," playing "Djesus Uncrossed" in a spoof of Tarantino's trademark bloody films. "No more mister nice Jesus," he said, wearing a white robe and holding a machine gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Mary Milliken; Editing by Sandra Maler)&lt;/p&gt;

3.105 billion pesos ($241 million) from 2.586 billion pesos in

net profit to shareholders was 2.998 billion pesos, up 36
percent from the same period in 2011, Televisa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financing costs fell to almost 18 million pesos from nearly
1 billion pesos in the final months of 2011 due to a stronger
peso that curbed dollar debts and a higher value of a stake in
Broadcasting Media Partners, which controls U.S.
Spanish-language broadcaster Univision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose just over 8 percent to 19.793 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company ended 2012 with 5.153 million satellite

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc will begin its annual job cutting process as early as this week, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday, with its equities-trading business bracing for bigger cuts than fixed-income trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank usually culls out the weakest 5 percent of its employees around now. But the cuts will likely be deeper in some businesses, particularly equities trading, where volumes and earnings are weak. The number of shares traded on major U.S. exchanges so far this year is down 7.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading at Goldman, which took big hits last year but has had better volumes this year, will likely see cuts of less than 5 percent, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In totality, cuts across the company will be roughly in line with Goldman's typical 5 percent culling and are not part of a bigger cost-cutting plan, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As market activity has picked up in certain areas, we remain focused on prudently managing expenses and allocating resources to ensure we are best able to meet our clients' needs and generate good returns for our shareholders," said Goldman spokesman David Wells, who declined to comment on layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts underscore how even as Wall Street shows some signs of recovering, banks are looking to thin their ranks to boost profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, and UBS AG, have been cutting staff for the past few years, after revenue has been under pressure in multiple businesses. Regulations, meanwhile, are increasing banks' costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, Goldman has cut its workforce by 9 percent, or 3,300 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Goldman's new chief financial officer, Harvey Schwartz, said that laying off more workers may be the way for banks to generate higher returns on equity for shareholders. The measure is important because it shows how much profit banks can squeeze from their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman's return-on-equity was 10.7 percent, an improvement from 2011, but still well below pre-financial crisis highs above 30 percent. Schwartz said he does not see Goldman's returns last year as "aspirational for the long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the industry will migrate to higher returns because they will have to," Schwartz said, adding that it might be "a question of excess capacity coming out of the industry over a period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGH PROFILE EXITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Goldman has experienced a wave of departures of partners and managing directors, who are typically the company's biggest earners. Some of those departures have been ordinary attrition, while other executives left to make way for up-and-comers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some big-name departures that have either occurred this year or were announced in internal memos. They include Jim O'Neill, the chairman of asset management, Henry Cornell, who retired as vice chairman of the merchant banking unit, Nick Burgin, who had been head of foreign-exchange, Scott Stanford, a co-head of global internet investment banking, and Ned Segal, who headed global software investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman CFO David Viniar, who retired at the end of January, has said that, many of the executives leaving had been with Goldman for an atypically long time because of the crisis and its aftermath, and were ready to move on. But such departures have also helped the bank cut compensation costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman's paid out 37.9 percent of its revenue to employees, down from 42.4 percent the previous year. The lower compensation ratio was cheered by investors and analysts, who had been questioning the bank about cost-cutting for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares fell 4.2 percent on Monday, to close at $147.65. The stock is up 16 percent year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Katya Wachtel; Additional reporting by Olivia Oran; Editing by Kenneth Barry, Maureen Bavdek, Dan Wilchins and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) named a new head of auto finance on Monday as the bank tries to boost its lending in a red-hot area where it has lost market share in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thasunda Brown Duckett, 39, said in an interview that she hopes to help the bank make profitable car loans without taking too much risk by looking at factors that lenders may not have traditionally considered in evaluating a borrower's ability to pay. JPMorgan may find it is okay to lend to more customers with lower scores, Duckett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duckett replaces Marc Sheinbaum, whom the bank said had "asked to pursue other opportunities." Sheinbaum told Reuters in May 2011 that competition for auto loans had already come back aggressively after retreating in the financial crisis, and that lenders' margins were being squeezed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stopped short of saying that competitors were becoming reckless in lending money to consumers who couldn't repay loans, but JPMorgan Chase has given up market share in recent years. Its auto loan balances rose just 3 percent between December 2010 and the end of 2012. Industry-wide, outstanding loans rose about 13 percent over that period to $719 billion, according to data from consumer credit rating service Experian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase is the biggest bank in the United States by assets, but is only the fourth-biggest auto lender by Experian's count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheinbaum did not return a call seeking comment on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift in leadership shows the needle that JPMorgan Chase must thread as the auto lending market heats up. The bank, like most lenders, is under pressure to boost profits, and staying relatively cool on the auto loan market could result in the bank lagging its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in any lending cycle, some banks will eventually take too many risks, whether it be on subprime mortgages that triggered the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008, or commercial real estate that sapped the strength of banks in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duckett, known in the bank as "T," said she believes there are "opportunities for us to expand that credit box to be able to help more customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help build the bank's loan book, Duckett said she will strengthen JPMorgan Chase's relationships with manufacturers and with car dealers who can send customers to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also plans to step-up marketing of car loans to people who use JPMorgan products and its network branches. The company has some 5,600 branches, the second-most of any U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also hopes to capture some of the pent-up demand for new cars from dependable customers who have put off financing purchases until they were more confident about the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duckett was previously JPMorgan Chase's national retail sales executive for mortgage banking, a post in which she managed 4,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Gupta's lawyer says plans to appeal repayment order&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Also to appeal insider trading conviction, prison term&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 25 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday ordered former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc director Rajat Gupta to reimburse
$6.22 million to help the Wall Street bank cover its legal
expenses related to his criminal insider trading case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had sought to recover $6.91 million, and U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said the bank had proved
it was entitled to 90 percent of what it requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 64, is appealing his June 15, 2012 conviction and
two-year prison term for feeding confidential information he had
learned at Goldman board meetings to Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon
Group hedge fund manager and former billionaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam has been a central figure in a multi-year U.S.
government crackdown on insider trading. Gupta is a former
global managing director of the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co,
and is the highest corporate executive convicted in the probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jurors found Gupta guilty of leaks during the second half of
2008, including news related to a crucial $5 billion investment
in Goldman by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc 
 at the height of the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had sought to recover fees it had paid its law firm
Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in connection with Gupta's criminal case and
related matters. It cited the federal Mandatory Victims
Restitution Act, which requires restitution in some fraud cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta opposed restitution but Rakoff, who presided over the
criminal trial, said nearly all of what Goldman sought was a
"necessary, direct, and foreseeable result of the investigation
and prosecution of Gupta's offense of conviction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rakoff said Goldman could also recover legal costs linked to
a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case
against Gupta, and to the criminal case against Rajaratnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Gupta's opposition to the latter "ignores the
glaring fact" that he had been convicted of conspiring with
Rajaratnam to commit securities fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the judge said Goldman did not deserve all it sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rakoff said some entries in the "voluminous" 542 pages of
billing records he reviewed did not qualify because they
involved depositions in civil cases that followed the criminal
conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Rakoff said Goldman on "a few occasions" assigned too
many lawyers to the case - "perhaps perfectly appropriate on the
assumption that Goldman Sachs wished to spare no expense on a
matter of great importance to it," but more than reasonably
necessary under the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said: "We are pleased that
the court ordered Mr. Gupta to pay restitution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Davis, a lawyer for Gupta, said his client plans to
appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is separately appealing his criminal conviction
and 11-year prison term, saying FBI wiretap evidence should not
have been admitted by U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell at his

* All-expenses-paid, two-week educational camps offered to 1,000 middle-school
students nationwide 
* Since 2006, program has increased interest in math and science, encouraged
nearly 7,000 youth to pursue higher education 
* Middle-school students encouraged to apply at www.theharrisfoundation.org

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
One thousand middle-school students will be offered a chance to participate in
interactive science and math camps at 20 university campuses nationwide this
summer with support from Dr. Bernard A. Harris Jr., the first African American
to walk in space, and the ExxonMobil Foundation. 

Students attending the ExxonMobil Bernard Harris Summer Science Camps will test
and develop their engineering and science prowess during daily activities that
emphasize development of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)
skills. 

"The Harris Foundation inspires kids to pursue STEM careers by providing them
with hands-on science and engineering activities that help them sharpen their
problem-solving skills and envision themselves in these careers," said Dr.
Bernard Harris Jr., president, The Harris Foundation. 

Students live on campus during the two-week camp and participate in classes
taught by university faculty, secondary teachers and local STEM professionals.
As part of the interactive, inquiry-based curriculum, campers also enjoy the
added benefit of exploring local museums, nature centers and ecosystems,
allowing them to discover science at work in their communities. 

According to a recent Harris Foundation study of camp alumni who are currently
enrolled in college, 96 percent credit the program for influencing their
decision to pursue higher education. Of those college students, 85 percent plan
to pursue a STEM-related degree. 

"ExxonMobil is committed to helping students strengthen their math and science
capabilities," said Suzanne McCarron, president, ExxonMobil Foundation. "These
camps are one way to equip our nation`s youth with skills needed to be
competitive in an increasingly global economy." 

Since 2006, the ExxonMobil Foundation and The Harris Foundation have helped more
than 7,000 students enhance their interest in science and math through the
program. As part of the effort to increase interest in STEM, students also learn
about the rewarding career options in these fields from local professionals -
fields that will continue to need skilled workers over the next ten years
according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

Eligible applicants must be entering sixth, seventh or eighth grades in the fall
of 2013. Additional information regarding application requirements and
submission instructions for each camp are available at
www.theharrisfoundation.org. 

In 2013, camps will be hosted at the following locations:

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc will begin a fresh round of job cuts as early as this week, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday, with its equities-trading business bracing for bigger cuts than fixed-income trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank usually culls out the weakest 5 percent of its employees around now. But the cuts will likely be deeper in some businesses, particularly equities trading, where volumes and earnings are weak. The number of shares traded on major U.S. exchanges so far this year is down 7.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading at Goldman, which took big hits last year but has had better volumes this year, will likely see cuts of less than 5 percent, the sources said. It is unclear whether the cuts in totality will be larger than Goldman's typical 5 percent culling across the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As market activity has picked up in certain areas, we remain focused on prudently managing expenses and allocating resources to ensure we are best able to meet our clients' needs and generate good returns for our shareholders," said Goldman spokesman David Wells, who declined to comment on layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts underscore how even as Wall Street shows some signs of recovering, banks are looking to thin their ranks to boost profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, and UBS AG, have been cutting staff for the past few years, after revenue has been under pressure in multiple businesses. Regulations, meanwhile, are increasing banks' costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, Goldman has cut its workforce by 9 percent, or 3,300 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Goldman's new chief financial officer, Harvey Schwartz, said that laying off more workers may be the way for banks to generate higher returns on equity for shareholders. The measure is important because it shows how much profit banks can squeeze from their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman's return-on-equity was 10.7 percent, an improvement from 2011, but still well below pre-financial crisis highs above 30 percent. Schwartz said he does not see Goldman's returns last year as "aspirational for the long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the industry will migrate to higher returns because they will have to," Schwartz said, adding that it might be "a question of excess capacity coming out of the industry over a period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGH PROFILE EXITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has also experienced a wave of departures of partners and managing directors, who are typically the company's biggest earners. Some big-name departures that have either occurred this year or were announced in internal memos. They include Jim O'Neill, the chairman of asset management, Henry Cornell, who retired as vice chairman of the merchant banking unit, Nick Burgin, who had been head of foreign-exchange, Scott Stanford, a co-head of global internet investment banking, and Ned Segal, who headed global software investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman CFO David Viniar, who retired at the end of January, has said that the departures are a natural progression of senior executives leaving to make way for more junior employees to move up the ranks, though they have also helped the bank cut compensation costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman's paid out 37.9 percent of its revenue to employees, down from 42.4 percent the previous year. The lower compensation ratio was cheered by investors and analysts, who had been questioning the bank about cost-cutting for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares were down 2.3 percent on Monday afternoon, at $150.54. As of Friday's close, the stock was up 21 percent year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Katya Wachtel; Additional reporting by Olivia Oran; Editing by Kenneth Barry, Maureen Bavdek, Dan Wilchins and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Feb 25 (Marketwire) -- 
Wood Partners announces the grand opening of its newest multifamily
community, Alta at Lake Eve, featuring the latest in resort-style
amenities, from a private movie theater and state-of-the-art fitness
center to high-efficiency washer-dryer units in every residence. 

    The 264-unit luxury apartment community consists of four 4-story midrise
buildings and two 2-story carriage home buildings. Currently, 60
apartment homes are ready for move-in, and the remaining units are
available for pre-lease. A special incentive of one-month's free rent is
offered for a limited time. 

    The controlled-access development boasts one of the area's best
locations, at 12515 Lake Square Circle, two miles from Walt Disney World
and about five miles from Universal Studio, Sea World and the Orange
County Convention Center. Residents are just steps from the I-Ride
trolley, which will pick up and drop off at Orlando Premier Outlet Mall
and hundreds of restaurants and night spots.

    "Location is a major selling point, but this development is unique and
has a WOW factor from the moment you walk in the door," said Joe Garibay,
Southeast Regional Property Manager for Wood Residential Services. "Alta
at Lake Eve is a very modern midrise with wood-plank flooring, espresso
cabinets, elevators and high-end outdoor features." 

    Other standard features include nine-foot ceilings, brushed nickel track
and pendant lighting, ceramic tile in the bathrooms and large soaking
garden tubs. 

    The community's modern vibe includes its conservation efforts, Garibay
said. All appliances are ENERGY STAR(R), and lighting is low-energy
fluorescent. The leasing office is paperless, and the builder made
extensive use of recycled materials. Wood Partners is also working with
the Florida Department of Conservation to help clean and monitor the
water in nearby Lake Eve.

    The 9.69-acre community is Wood Partners' 11th project in Orlando. Since
1998, the company has developed 27 projects with a total valuation of
$1.1 billion in Florida. 

    Common amenities at Alta at Lake Eve include elevators, concierge
services and surface parking. Outdoors, residents can swim in the pool or
soak up the sun on the expansive deck and open-air "living room,"
featuring a fire pit and courtyard. Residents are invited to use the
croquet lawn and pet park.

    The luxuriously appointed two-story clubroom features a conference room,
executive business center, coffee lounge, reading room, billiards room,
game room, and movie theater with daily "red carpet" events.

    Residents will have use of top-of-the-line cardio equipment in the
fitness center, and pet owners can bathe Fido in the pet-grooming room.

    Apartments include executive suites; 656-square-foot one-bedroom models;
1,132- to 1,200-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bath models; and
1,476-square-foot three-bedroom, two-bath models. Patios, balconies and
sunrooms are available, as are garages.

    Wood Partners' Florida construction branch, Wood Florida Builders, LLC,
was the builder, and Charlan Brock &amp; Associates was the architect. HSBC
Bank USA, N.A. provided construction financing for the $32.7-millon
project, which is expected to be completed in April 2013.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/rp3dpb/pharmaceutical) has announced
the addition of the "Pharmaceutical Industry in Taiwan" report to their
offering. 

The birth origins of the Pharmaceutical Industry can be traced back to more
humble antecedents than just chemistry labs. The earliest incidents of
recognition of the antiseptic properties of the dyestuffs is around the late
19th century. The invention of penicillin can yet be recognized as a major
milestone for the emergent industry which firmly consolidated its R efforts in
the 1950's. Further in the 1960's the patent regulation support gave a further
impetus to the industry in new discoveries and relaxed controls on clinical
development with the booming spend on healthcare as economies boomed globally. 

The global presence of the pharmaceutical industry is evident with the roll out
of continent specific R programs and drugs which help companies maximize
penetration of markets and garner increased revenues with intercontinental
treatment demand of patients being serviced from often one or two mega research
centers in the continent. 

The pharmaceutical industry is under mounting scrutiny because of rapidly
increasing expenditures for drugs worldwide. Drug expenditures are now the
fastest-growing component of health care costs, increasing at the rate of about
15 percent per year. They account for about eight percent of health care
spending, and at their current rate of increase, they will soon surpass spending
for physicians' services and, for many health care organizations, the costs of
hospitalization. 

This R'search brings you a complete analysis of the Pharmaceutical Industry in
Taiwan. The report covers a brief profile of the global pharmaceutical industry,
the TRIPS agreement, offshoring in the pharmaceutical industry, economic trends
in the industry, competition in the industry, and the key players in the
pharmaceutical industry in Taiwan - complete with a SWOT analysis of the leading
companies in the market.

merchant categories, and by making it easier for merchants and acquirers to take
advantage of secure mobile acceptance solutions. 

ROAM is a leading provider of mobile acceptance technology, delivering hardware
peripherals, applications, and services that enable merchants to realize the
benefits of electronic commerce. As part of the agreement with Visa, ROAM will
participate in the Visa Ready Partner Program and has agreed to bundle its
mobile point-of-sale hardware peripherals with Visa`s acceptance solutions to
offer merchants globally a cost-efficient and secure way to accept card
payments. 

"Displacing cash payments with the security and efficiency of electronic
payments continues to be a primary driver of growth for the global payments
industry," says Jim McCarthy, Global Head of Product, Visa Inc. "Visa, through
its mPOS partner program, is committed to accelerating the use of mobile
technology to enable merchants worldwide to accept Visa payments. Our agreement
with ROAM will help us reach that goal globally." 

The growing popularity of mobile point-of-sale acceptance solutions among
merchants of all sizes is helping to drive the migration from cash to electronic
payments, a trend that can benefit consumers and businesses globally. A study
released by Moody`s earlier this month revealed that the expanded use of credit
and debit cards added $983 billion to global Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
between 2008 and 2012 - the equivalent of creating 1.9 million new jobs. 

"We are enthused to be collaborating with Visa and believe that the
complementary strengths of our respective offerings will help drive the
proliferation of mobile commerce acceptance throughout the world," said Ken
Paull, CEO of ROAM. "Security is a primary focus for us at ROAM and we fully
embrace the Visa Ready Partner Program as a way to identify the differentiation
of our mag stripe and EMV solutions." 

Visa`s agreement with ROAM aims to displace cash globally

The agreement with ROAM is Visa`s first under the Visa Ready Partner Program,
which is designed to enable growth of Visa acceptance and usage in key
geographies and merchant segments worldwide. According to the agreement, ROAM
and Visa will focus on several areas to displace the use of cash globally using
mobile point-of-sale acceptance technology:

* Preferred Brand Collaboration: The companies have agreed to work together on a
multinational basis to promote Visa`s and ROAM`s respective mobile acceptance
solutions 
* Visa Ready: ROAM`s mobile point-of-sale hardware devices, which it white
labels globally for other companies to market under their own brands, may bear
the Visa Ready symbol that can be used to promote and market the devices as
approved for use with Visa payments. 
* Direct connection to Visa: In select countries, Visa will provide ROAM with
APIs (Application Program Interfaces) and SDKs (Software Development Kits) in
order to connect to Visa via a number of payment gateways, including CyberSource
and Authorize.Net merchant payment management platforms acquired by Visa in
2010. This will enable merchants of all sizes to accept and process Visa`s
transactions. 
* White Label: ROAM has agreed to develop and provide Visa acquirers and
merchants globally with white label mobile acceptance devices that are fully
approved for use with Visa EMV-chip, contactless and magnetic stripe card
payments, and compatible with CyberSource and Authorize.Net mobile point-of-sale
solutions.

During Mobile World Congress 2013 in Barcelona, February 25-28, the two
companies will offer mobile point-of-sale acceptance demonstrations using a ROAM
mobile acceptance device. For more information, visit Visa`s stand at Mobile
World Congress, Hall 6, Stand 6E40.

Financial institutions will be offered a secure service to download payment
account information to Samsung`s mobile devices.
FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Visa and Samsung today announced a global alliance that combines Visa`s
expertise in payments with Samsung`s leadership in mobile device technology - an
alliance that has the potential to significantly accelerate the availability of
mobile payments globally. 

According to the agreement, financial institutions that are planning to launch
mobile payment programs will be able to use the Visa Mobile Provisioning
Service1 to securely download payment account information to NFC-enabled Samsung
devices. In addition, Samsung has agreed to load the Visa payWave applet onto
its mobile devices featuring NFC technology. Visa payWave is Visa`s mobile
payment applet that enables consumers to make "wave and pay" contactless
payments using mobile devices. 

"Samsung devices enabled with Visa payment functionality will no doubt be a
powerful product offering - especially in markets where paying with a mobile
device is becoming commonplace," said Jim McCarthy, global head of product, Visa
Inc. "However, the key to making mobile payments broadly available all over the
world is to offer financial institutions a secure way to provision millions of
smartphones with payment account information - and that is exactly what Visa and
Samsung are ready to deliver." 

"Samsung has been a pioneer in NFC devices and is again leading the way in
enabling NFC-based mobile payments. The partnership with Visa represents a step
towards a global mobile payment platform," said Dr. Won-Pyo Hong, President and
Head of Media Solution Center, Samsung Electronics. "We believe that we have a
strong value proposition for financial institutions that will ultimately allow
consumer choice in NFC payments." 

Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is the global communication standard
that enables mobile devices to securely communicate with a payment terminal. ABI
Research forecasts that a total of 1.95 billion NFC-enabled devices will ship in
20172. The Visa Samsung global alliance is a first of its kind between a leading
NFC handset manufacturer and payment network that is paving the way for the
implementation of large scale mobile payment programs. The initial areas of
engagement that the two companies have agreed to include:

* Global Strategic Alliance
Visa and Samsung have agreed to work together to enable the next generation of
Samsung mobile devices with Visa payment technology, and to partner with
financial institutions to accelerate the availability of mobile payment
solutions globally.

* Samsung to Connect to Visa`s Mobile Provisioning Service
In order to enable financial institutions to launch large scale mobile (NFC)
payment programs, Samsung will offer banks the ability to load payment account
information over-the-air to a secure chip embedded in Samsung devices, using
Visa`s Mobile Provisioning Service3 which is linked to Samsung KMS (Key
Management System) - a service that creates secure data storage domains for
issuers.

* Samsung Awarded Global Visa payWave License
The Visa payWave mobile applet will be preloaded onto selected next-generation
Samsung mobile devices featuring NFC technology and an embedded secure element.
Off the shelf, these devices are ready to be personalized with Visa payment
account information - a simple step that consumers will be able to initiate
using a mobile payment application provided by their financial institution.

At Mobile World Congress 2013 in Barcelona, February 25-28, Visa will
demonstrate Visa payWave for mobile and its Mobile Provisioning Service that can
be used by financial institutions to securely load payment account information
to NFC-enabled Samsung mobile devices. For more information, visit Visa at
Mobile World Congress, Hall 6, Stand 6E40.

- Ancestry.com Subscriber Growth of 18% Year-Over-Year -

- 2012 Total Adjusted Revenue $488 million, up 22% Year-Over-Year -

PROVO, Utah, Feb. 25, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ancestry.com Inc., the world's largest online
family history resource, is presenting today at the J.P. Morgan High Yield &amp; Leveraged Finance
Conference in Miami, Florida.

Howard Hochhauser, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of Ancestry.com will
present at the conference. "We are pleased with the revenue and subscriber results in 2012," said
Hochhauser, "Non-GAAP revenue1 was $488 million, an increase of 22% over the full year 2011, and
year-end subscribers totaled 2,016,000, up 18% over the end of 2011."

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

The Company believes that non-GAAP revenue is a useful measure of operating performance because it
excludes items that the Company does not consider indicative of its core performance.
Specifically, non-GAAP revenue is calculated by adding the impact of purchase accounting
adjustments to GAAP revenue. However, this non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to,
not as a substitute for or superior to, revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The Company uses non-GAAP to provide consistency and comparability with the Company's past GAAP
reported financial performance; to facilitate a comparison of its results with those of other
companies; and in communications with its board of directors concerning its financial
performance.

About Ancestry.com

Ancestry.com Inc. is the world's largest online family history resource, with approximately 2
million paying subscribers. More than 11 billion records have been added to the site in the past
16 years. Ancestry users have created more than 44 million family trees containing more than 4
billion profiles. In addition to its flagship site www.ancestry.com
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10022899=9=www.ancestry.com=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ancestry.com

and share their family history.

1Non-GAAP revenue is calculated as revenue determined in accordance with GAAP plus the impact of
purchase accounting adjustments on revenue, as follows:

       GAAP Revenues  Purchase Accounting Adjustment  Non-GAAP Revenue  
 2011  $399.7         - 0 -                           $399.7            
 2012  $487           $0.6                            $487.6

WAYNE, Pa.--(Business Wire)--

you do it and which solution you select," said Scott Kinka, Chief Technology
Officer at Evolve IP. "No single provider`s technology works for every company,
and each solution needs to be evaluated on its own merits. Our VDI Decision
Guide helps IT leaders clearly see the differences so they can understand how

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. soft drinks company Coca-Cola have extended their 45-year sponsorship deal with Bayern Munich by another three years, the duo said on Monday, underlining the financial health of the German club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No financial details of the agreement were released but the deal will further aid the Bavarian club who are expecting another bumper financial year after posting their best financial results in 112 years with a profit of 11.1 million euros ($14.61 million) for the 2011/12 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German champions and four-times European Cup winners boosted their turnover by more than 40 million, up from 290.9 million euros for 2010/11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayern have also almost doubled their registered members within nine years from 96,440 in 2002/3 to more than 187,000 in 2011/12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayern hold a 17-point lead in the Bundesliga and are also still in the running for the Champions League and German Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7598 euros)   (Reporting by Karolos Grohmann.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Feb 25 (Marketwire) -- 
SPYRUS announced today the availability of PocketVault 3X, a portable USB
3.0 Encrypting SSD featuring the same high-assurance hardware encrypting
security designed into their Windows To Go certified USB 3.0 SSD drives.

    This latest member of the Secured by SPYRUS(TM) family of USB encrypting
devices incorporates advanced military grade hardware security to provide
the most secure use-anywhere high performance USB storage drive available
today. Like the USB 2.0 PocketVault P-384, it provides secure cross
platform portability of data providing support for Microsoft Windows, Mac
OSX, Linux and mobile operating systems. Secured By SPYRUS(TM) technology
implements the cryptographic base used by the United States Government to
protect Data at Rest. During full disk encryption, every sector of the
device's memory is protected with the XTS-AES 256-bit hardware encryption
mode recommended by IEEE 1669 and referenced by the NIST SP800-38E
standard. 

    PocketVault 3X SSD uses the Rosetta Micro(TM) hardware security module
that is built into all SPYRUS encrypting USB product lines for key
management and is designed to meet FIPS 140-2 Level 2 and Level 3
specifications to protect user data against unauthorized access to the
device.

    Unlike competing use-anywhere encrypting USB flash drives,
SPYRUS-proprietary key management technology used in the Rosetta Micro
never stores a copy of your password anywhere, not on your drive or on a
network storage device where your confidential information can be at
significant risk from internal or external attacks. Additional
authentication and data security applications using the Rosetta Micro
onboard PocketVault 3X SSD will be released to be compatible with
PocketVault Encryptor applications used on Android, Surface RT, Surface
Pro and iPad.

    PocketVault USB 3X SSD can also be used as a separate, secondary secure
data storage device with the SPYRUS Secure Pocket Drive(TM) that boots
Windows Embedded Standard 7 or Linux or with the Secure Portable
Workplace(TM) and Portable Workplace(TM) Windows To Go Certified USB 3.0
drives. When used in this manner, PocketVault 3X SSD can provide the
significant benefits of greatly increased SSD memory capacities to 100GB
and lightning-fast performance for productivity applications. 

    SPYRUS will be previewing their new high assurance security devices in
booth 2333 at the RSA Security Conference 2013 in San Francisco, CA,
February 25-28.

&lt;p&gt;* Payrolls cut in mortgages, retail banking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Bank reducing staff per branch even as it adds branches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Some job additions in cards and business lending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Net reductions represent 6.6 pct of JPMorgan overall
staffing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
said on Tuesday that it plans to cut 17,000 jobs by the end of
2014, representing about 6.6 percent of the company's overall
workforce, as the bank sheds staff that helped it deal with bad
home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is optimistic that it can generate record income
this year and is planning to add 4,000 employees in commercial
and investment banking and credit cards to help it win business,
bank executives said at an investor conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That hiring will be more than offset by job cuts in areas
like mortgage servicing and retail banking, where the bank is
positioning for a recovering housing market and new forms of
branch banking. The net impact of the additions and cuts will be
17,000 fewer employees on the bank's payrolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job cuts reflect the pressure that banks are under, even
as the U.S. housing market and overall economy show signs of
recovery. Many banks are looking to automate more of their
businesses to make their staff more productive and improve
profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, at JPMorgan's branches, where it plans to cut
about 6,000 tellers and other employees, the bank hopes
customers will use automated teller machines for every day
transactions and that remaining staff can focus on higher-margin
activities like selling wealth management services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is one of the few big U.S. banks that is still
adding branches to its network, but it is hoping to staff the
branches with fewer workers. The bank's 5,614 branches have
63,500 employees, representing about a quarter of JPMorgan
Chase's total. Chase's branch network is second to Wells Fargo &amp;
Co's in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For overall staffing levels, JPMorgan Chase had 258,965
employees globally at the end of 2012. Its headcount rose
following the financial crisis to 262,882 in the second quarter
of 2012 from 219,569 in the first quarter of 2009. Since last
year's second quarter, staffing levels have drifted lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase overall earned $21.9 billion last year,
excluding accounting charges linked to changes in the value of
its debt. The bank said it has the potential to earn about $27.5
billion, thanks in part to efficiency gains. It aims to cut
overall expenses by $1 billion in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach the $27.5 billion profit figure, the bank is also
counting on costs for lawsuits to fall as disputes over bad
mortgages are resolved, as well as seeing a one percentage point
rise in interest rates, said Chief Financial Officer Marianne
Lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The profit scenario also depends on the bank not being hit
by another trading debacle like the $6.2 billion loss last year
on derivatives trades placed by the London Whale, the nickname
given a London-based JPMorgan trader for the size of the
positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Jamie Dimon acknowledged that many of his
top lieutenants who spoke to investors on Tuesday were in new
jobs after changes he made last year in his management team and
the bank's divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a little bit too much change in one year," Dimon
said. "Some of it was the Whale. Some of it was the re-org" to
better align product divisions with customer interests, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the top executives, however, have been at the company
several years and know its businesses, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase shares were down 0.2 percent at $47.60 at the
close of trading on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

JPMorgan's overall staffing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
plans to cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs in its consumer bank in 2013,
representing about 1.5 percent of the company's overall
workforce, as the bank tries to improve the profitability of its
branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts will come mainly through attrition, spokeswoman
Kristin Lemkau said. The bank's branches have 63,500 employees,
representing about a quarter of JPMorgan Chase's total
employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is one of the few big U.S. banks that is still
adding branches to its network, but to boost profit it plans to
scale back the tellers it has on hand for routine transactions
and to add some salespeople for products and services like
wealth management that can boost revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The net effect will be to reduce staff per branch by 20
percent through 2015, the company's head of consumer banking,
Ryan McInerney, said in a presentation to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In JPMorgan Chase's mortgage business, that company said on
Tuesday that it planned to shed 13,000 to 15,000 jobs by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase had 5,614 branches at the end of 2012, and
plans to increase its network by about 100 branches a year, it
said. Chase's U.S. branch network is second to Wells Fargo &amp;
Co's in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is hoping to focus on selling more to wealthy
depositors. Its average consumer checking account has a balance
of $4,276, and about half of all affluent U.S. households are
within two miles a Chase branch or automated teller machine, the
bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase overall earned $21.9 billion last year,
excluding accounting charges linked to changes in the value of
its debt. The bank said it has the potential to earn about $27.5
billion, thanks in part to efficiency gains. It aims to cut
overall expenses by $1 billion in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For overall staffing levels, JPMorgan Chase had 258,965
employees globally at the end of 2012. Its headcount rose
following the financial crisis, to 262,882 in the second quarter
of 2012 from 219,569 in the first quarter of 2009. Since last
year's second quarter, staffing levels have drifted lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase shares were down 1.3 percent at $47.08 on
Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Feb 26 (Reuters) - Congress should create a visa
program, valid for at least three years, for foreigners willing
to work year-round on poultry farms or in meatpacking and
processing plants, an industry group said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meat industry coalition pushed for the work visa as a
way to assure "a stable and permanent" workforce, during a House
of Representatives hearing on potential replacements for the
current H-2A guestworker program, which issues visas for up to
10 months for farm labor, such as those picking fruit and
vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many or even most of the 1.5 million agricultural laborers
in the United States are thought to be undocumented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chairman Bob Goodlatte of the House Judiciary Committee, who
is from a poultry-growing region of Virginia, said designing a
work program for agriculture was a critical part of overall U.S.
immigration reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the H-2A program fails to provide enough workers on
time for growers and sets their wages well above local rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Brown, president of the National Chicken Council,
called for a work visa good for at least three years "to
recognize that employer needs in industry are permanent in
nature, not temporary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNION WARNS OF SECOND-CLASS LEGAL STATUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown spoke on behalf of the Food Manufacturers Immigration
Coalition, which is composed of poultry producers and meat
processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longer-term visa is needed to offset the expense of
training meat industry workers, Brown said. The workers could
apply for visa extensions and there would be "a path to
permanency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giev Kashkooli, vice president of the The United Farm
Workers of America union said he was opposed to expanding an
agricultural worker program to include processing plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In written testimony, he said that if a new guest worker
program for agriculture workers is created the workers deserve
job mobility, strong labor and wage protection and the chance to
eventually become a citizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seen Europe's failed experiment of second-class
legal status," said Kashkooli, referring to foreign workers in
European factories. He said comprehensive immigration reform
should also give current farm workers a reasonable opportunity
to earn legal status and citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dozen farm and landscaping groups, working as the
Agriculture Workforce Coalition, provided new details of their
proposal for a guestworker program. It would allow workers to
stay in the country for up to three years if they are under
contract with an agricultural employer. An 11-month visa would
be available for workers who want to move job to job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coalition said also undocumented agricultural workers
should be granted work authorization that carries "a minimum
commitment to agriculture for a five-year set term." After that,
they could continue to work "under the Ag Card", which gives
them legal status to work in the U.S. or "access immigration
channels to adjust to a permanent status."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - A top Microsoft Corp executive side-stepped questions on Tuesday about any plans the software maker may have to bring its Office suite of applications to Apple Inc's iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk has circulated for more than a year that Microsoft wants to bring native versions of its most profitable product to the hot-selling iPad, which one analyst estimates could generate $2.5 billion in extra revenue for Microsoft per year, but would remove an incentive to buying Windows-based tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't take it from the point of view, 'Do we need to have the PC software that's running on every single device?', we look very much at 'What is the experience that we are looking to have on those devices'," said Kurt DelBene, head of Microsoft's Office unit, asked about Office on the iPad at the Morgan Stanley technology investor conference in San Francisco, which was Webcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DelBene, who took over leadership of Office from Stephen Elop who left to lead phone maker Nokia in 2010, did not directly address putting native versions of Office applications on the iPad, a subject Microsoft has steered clear of in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked specifically about the availability of Office on Apple's iOS mobile system - which powers iPads and iPhones - DelBene instead stressed online versions of Office apps, which can be accessed via a browser but do not offer the full richness of installed software or an app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've actually done a lot of work on iOS devices this time around," said DelBene.

look very much at 'What is the experience that we are looking to

Office unit, asked about Office on the iPad at the Morgan
Stanley technology investor conference in San Francisco, which
was Webcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DelBene, who took over leadership of Office from Stephen
Elop who left to lead phone maker Nokia in 2010, did
not directly address putting native versions of Office

Apple's iOS mobile system - which powers iPads and iPhones -

Apple would take on sales of Office through its App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the risk for Microsoft is that putting Office on the
iPad takes away one of the key advantages of its own Surface and
other Windows tablets, that already run Office natively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing incentives to buy Windows tablets would be a blow
to Microsoft's flagship Windows unit, which although less
profitable than Office, is still key to the company's overall
strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked by one investor at the conference when he would be
able to use Excel on his iPad, DelBene instead pointed the
questioner toward Microsoft's own Surface RT and Surface Pro
tablets and urged him to use Web-based versions of Office apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we've done a great job on both the consumer side,
particularly with the Web apps that we are building, and on the
enterprise side as well," said DelBene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Barbara Walters said on Tuesday she will return to the daytime TV talk show "The View" next week after more than a monthlong absence due to illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Televisa says it can benefit from broadcasting competition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Company also hopes to see increased telecom competition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Investment in Iusacell to some extent depends on reform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa
, the world's biggest producer of Spanish-language
content, said on Tuesday it supports planned reforms in Mexico
that will increase competition in television and phone markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's mobile and fixed-line phone market is dominated by
tycoon Carlos Slim's America Movil, while Televisa has
said it controls about 70 percent of the country's broadcasting
market, with rival TV Azteca controlling the
rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto took office late last
year pledging to shake up competition in Mexico, and the
country's three main political parties in December signed a pact
committing to reforms such as strengthening the telecom
watchdog, launching new television channels, and increasing
competition in phone markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called Pact for Mexico calls for introducing reform
to the country's telecom law this year, but details are not yet
available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are used to competition and we believe that competing
with our content and all our assets and energy on the
broadcasting side will be good for us," Alfonso de Angoitia,
Televisa executive vice president, told analysts on a conference
call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa has competed with TV Azteca since its smaller rival
 was privatized by the government about 20 years ago, forcing
Televisa to trim costs and improve broadcasting quality. That
has made Televisa more profitable, de Angoitia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Additional broadcast networks will result in healthy
competition for us," he said. "We basically support a reform
that will bring competition to broadcasting but also effectively
levels the playing field on telecommunications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IUSACELL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, de Angoitia was a little more hesitant about the
prospects for increased competition in Mexico's phone markets,
saying some of Televisa's planned investment in mobile phone
company Iusacell will depend on the success of reform in the
sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a $1 billion investment plan for 2013, Televisa
has set aside $565 million for its cable and telephone
businesses, which include its 50 percent stake in Iusacell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some capital may be contributed (to Iusacell) in the first
(six months) of 2013, but that will be a smaller amount of
money," de Angoitia said. "We are going to see what happens in
terms of the implementation of the Pact for Mexico and the
regulatory changes to see if ... the playing field will be
leveled or not, to see if it makes sense to invest more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition authorities in Mexico last year signed off on
Televisa's joint venture with Iusacell's co-owner, Grupo
Salinas, which also controls TV Azteca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa said in October that Iusacell will need $800
million in investments in the coming three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iusacell's share of the Mexican mobile phone market rose to
more than 6 percent in the third quarter of 2012 from 4.4
percent in the third quarter of 2011, de Angoitia said on a
third-quarter results conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compares to the about 70 percent of the market
controlled by Slim's America Movil and around 20 percent
controlled by Spain's Telefonica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa said late on Monday that its fourth-quarter profit
rose to 3.105 billion pesos ($241 million) from 2.586 billion
pesos in the year-earlier quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, de Angoitia told investors that in spite of the
strong results, the company is not planning a special dividend,
preferring instead to keep money on hand for possible
acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa shares were down 1.36 percent at 66.85 pesos in
late-morning trading. The shares have recently been close to a
year high of around 73 pesos, reached at the start of this
month. Mexico's benchmark IPC index was down 0.38
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Third Full-Length Album "Portrait of a Chameleon" In The Works
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Singer, songwriter, composer and producer Blake Lewis has signed to Republic
Records, it was announced today, simultaneously with the release of his newest
single, "Your Touch." The new track, which is available exclusively through Xbox
Music for the first week of its release and will become available via iTunes and
all digital retailers beginning March 5, is the first introduction to music from
Lewis` forthcoming third full-length studio album, Portrait of a Chameleon. 

"Your Touch," an intoxicating dose of what Lewis appropriately dubs as "future
pop," debuts today as the soundtrack to Microsoft Internet Explorer`s "Explore
Touch" ad campaign. Also available today for Windows 7 users is Internet
Explorer 10 a massive upgrade to the web experience for over 700M Windows
customers. The track rolls from pulsating electronic bass into an utterly
unforgettable hook perfect for the dance floor with lyrics that are the perfect
audio companion to director Keith Rivers` vision for the ad, showcasing a more
fast, fluid web that`s perfect for touch. Last year, at Lewis' suggestion to
Rivers, a similarly perfect audio-visual pairing was made when label-mate Alex
Clare's "Too Close" drove the visuals for Microsoft`s "A More Beautiful Web" ad
campaign. Backed by this catchy new single, Lewis appears in this new worldwide
ad campaign as he demonstrates the touch capabilities of Internet Explorer 10
and Windows 8, showcasing how fast and fluid the web can be. 

"Your Touch," is the first single off of Lewis` aptly named Portrait of a
Chameleon, which he is currently working on. Portrait of a Chameleon will
demonstrate Lewis` eclectic skills as a songwriter and producer with tracks that
draw from dance and electronic influences with infectious pop hooks. 

This new ad campaign and single for Lewis are indicative of how the artist
continues to move towards the future. The singer, songwriter and producer has
evolved immensely since he rose to prominence on the sixth season of American
Idol with his impressive vocal and beatbox abilities, making a name for himself
as the first contestant to ever arrange his own performances. The runner-up
released his 2007 debut, Audio Day Dream, moving over 350,000 copies in the
process, which was followed with Heartbreak on Vinyl in 2009, and he proceeded
to tour and perform alongside everyone from pop powerhouses Lady Gaga, Katy
Perry, and Wyclef Jean to electronic luminaries BT and The Crystal Method. He
was the first former American Idol to reach #1 on both Billboard's Hot Dance
Airplay Chart and Dance/Club play chart, and he's even taught First Lady
Michelle Obama how to beatbox at a luncheon in her honor. 

Get ready to feel Blake Lewis` "touch" like never before. 

"Your Touch" is available now for free streaming on exploretouch.ie and also
available exclusively for the next week through Xbox Music for free download and
streaming today and will become available through all digital retailers
beginning March 5th.

MENTOR, Ohio, Feb. 26, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CardinalCommerce, the world-leader in enabling
remote commerce (internet, mobile, etc.), and Visa today announced the integration of V.me by
Visa, enabling Cardinal's thousands of merchant customers the ability to add V.me through their
existing relationships with Cardinal.

V.me provides merchants with the secure, hassle-free, checkout experience that merchants and
customers demand. The payment method is now live with the Scentiments.com standard eCommerce and
mCommerce sites and is also now available to all CardinalCommerce enabled merchants. "Providing a
single, cross-channel solution is necessary with today's shoppers moving fluidly between devices
when making purchases whenever and wherever they'd like," said Howard Wyner, Chief Executive
Officer, Scentiments.

The inclusion of V.me in Cardinal's flagship platform,  Cardinal Centinel, allows eCommerce
merchants the ability to accept the payment product with little to no disruption to their backend
payment processes. "Our Centinel platform offers merchants streamlined integration to all
alternative payment and checkout methods, authentication and a variety of other payment services"
said Tim Sherwin, Executive Vice President/Co-Founder, CardinalCommerce. "Supporting V.me is a
natural extension of our mission to normalize payments through a single integration with little to
no effort or time on the part of our customers. Cardinal's existing Centinel merchants can
leverage the framework already in place to easily add V.me to their desktop, mobile, or tablet
checkout environment."

A Streamlined Consumer Checkout Experience

V.me simplifies the payment experience for customers, allowing them to checkout with a username
and password. "We feel that V.me meets the growing needs of our customers and will help convert
our ever growing tablet and mobile device shoppers," said Wyner. "It complements our existing
payment solutions and shows our customers that we are growing and changing with them." Customers
can store Visa and other payment card accounts and shipping addresses in their V.me account. In
just a few clicks, consumers can confirm their payment details and complete their checkout without
ever leaving the merchant's environment. "To us it's all about the customer experience. When
hearing about the simplicity and security of V.Me we looked to Cardinal to help integrate because
they also host our mobile website and being an existing Centinel customer made it a seamless and
integration free experience," said Wyner.  

Increased Conversions for Merchants

"The entire checkout process stays on the merchant's page with minimal steps to maximize
conversion when using V.me," said Jennifer Schulz (@Jen_Schulz), Global Head of eCommerce, Visa
Inc. "V.me frees online shoppers from having to repeatedly enter account number, and
bill-to/ship-to information when making a purchase online. We believe shopping online should be
simple, secure, and personal, and V.me delivers on that promise." In addition to offering users a
simplified checkout experience, V.me account holders can set personalized transaction alerts based
on spending thresholds and other criteria on enrolled Visa accounts.

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced that the
companies have agreed to a letter of intent for a new and expanded 10-year
renewable partnership agreement. The partnership is designed to accelerate the
growth of electronic payments, deliver added value to merchants and provide a
better experience for cardholders. 

Under terms of the planned deal, JPMorgan Chase will launch Chase Merchant
Services, a payments platform powered by Visa that JPMorgan Chase will use to
create more differentiated experiences for its merchants and cardholders. The
platform will process transactions initiated with JPMorgan Chase-issued Visa
cards at merchants that JPMorgan Chase enrolls in Chase Merchant Services. 

Chase Merchant Services combines the capabilities of JPMorgan Chase`s acquiring
business, support functions and extensive card portfolio with a customized
processing solution that Visa and JPMorgan Chase will create using Visa`s
network, VisaNet. 

As part of the agreement, JPMorgan Chase also will shift additional credit and
debit card volume to Visa, driving more transactions on the Visa network. 

"We look forward to expanding our partnership with JPMorgan Chase and further
driving the migration to electronic payments by offering superior and unique
value to merchants and cardholders," said William Sheedy, Group President,
Americas, Visa Inc. "As technology drives the evolution of the payments industry
there are more opportunities to deliver value for merchants and cardholders at
the point-of-sale. Visa is focused on innovating to allow clients of all sizes
to differentiate based on their strategy, priorities and customer needs. This
effort with JPMorgan Chase is one example of Visa`s increased flexibility and
desire to partner with financial institution and merchant clients to provide
greater service to cardholders through tailored and value-added solutions." 

"We are pleased to extend our long-term partnership with Visa," said Gordon
Smith, CEO of Consumer &amp; Community Banking, JPMorgan Chase. "Chase Merchant
Services enables us to build direct relationships with merchants and give
enhanced benefits, such as targeted offers and discounts to Chase Visa
cardholders." 

Chase Merchant Services is expected to be operational by the end of the year.

&lt;p&gt;  SUNNYVALE, CA, Feb 26 (Marketwire) -- 
Project Hosts, the leader in Custom Cloud hosting of Microsoft PPM, CRM
and SharePoint solutions, today announced that the company is now
supporting the latest release of Microsoft Project and Portfolio
Management, Microsoft Project Server 2013. Customers now have three
distinct cloud options for Project Server 2013: hosting their own
on-premise "private cloud," a Project Hosts' Custom Cloud, or Microsoft's
Project Online "standard multitenant cloud." 

    "Project Sever 2013 is another great step forward from Microsoft, the
industry leader in project management solutions," said Scott Chapman,
president and co-founder of Project Hosts. "Project Server 2013 offers
many new compelling features such as improved SharePoint project
management, the ability to create workflows using SharePoint designer,
the PWA timeline view, and the new app model with its integrated
marketplace."

    With this release customers can now choose from three distinct Project
Server 2013 cloud-based options, each tailored to a company's specific
business and technology needs. Customers have the option to choose the
just-released Microsoft Project Online offering, a "standard multitenant
cloud" that delivers an on-demand solution for companies who don't need
dedicated servers, high levels of customization, white-glove service, or
support for custom code.

    Customers can also choose to host their own "private cloud" instance of
Project Server 2013, either on-premise or in their own data center
facility. A Project Server 2013 private cloud offers the maximum degree
of customization and configuration to support an organization's specific
security requirements, dedicated solutions architecture, third party
applications, custom code, and specialized reporting. 

    Project Hosts offers another cloud option for Project Server 2013 that
combines the benefits of both a standard cloud and private cloud for
enterprise customers. Project Hosts' "PPM Custom Cloud" delivers the
business and technology advantages of a private cloud, but without all
the costs and complexities of a similarly configured on-premise
environment. A PPM Custom Cloud from Project Hosts is designed to allow
both Microsoft partners and enterprise customers to precisely define
their solution architecture, while also having the ability to directly
access and control critical elements of the hosted solution. 

    Project Hosts' PPM Custom Cloud for Project Server 2013 allows for the
precise definition and control over the following elements: 

    Your Dedicated Solutions Architecture 


--  Standard Cloud services, plus:
--  Virtual or physical dedicated servers
--  Separate development/test environments
--  Dedicated active directory domains
--  Automated user provisioning
--  Custom backup plans

    

Your Trusted Applications Support


--  Standard Cloud services, plus:
--  Ability to install 3rd party apps directly on servers
--  Custom Web Parts
--  OS and DB admin access privileges on dedicated servers

    

Your Specific Security Requirements


--  Standard Cloud services, plus:
--  Customer-defined policies such as passwords and encryption
--  IP access restrictions
--  Customer-defined security audits and scans

    

Your Real-Time Reporting &amp; Customization


--  Standard Cloud services, plus:
--  OLAP Cubes
--  SQL Reporting Services
--  Performance Point Services
--  Direct database access
--  Automatically updating real-time reports

    

Project Hosts Custom Cloud solutions are backed by a 99.9% uptime
guarantee, flexible business terms and the company's renowned
Person-to-Person(TM) support with published response times. For more

architecture, application integration, or security requirements. Many of

that SmartMetric is welcoming the trial by Jury that it requested, noting
that when the 12 good Citizens of California are presented with the facts
of our case up against the legal might of Visa and MasterCard that
justice will prevail.

integrating Microsoft Dynamics AX as a strategic component of their
infrastructure, they will have the tools needed to reach their goals in the
American markets while supporting their existing processes and streamlining
efficiencies." 

Microsoft Dynamics AX is a powerful, agile, easy-to-use ERP solution that
supports industry-specific and operational business processes, together with
comprehensive functionality for financial and human resources management.

construction of the final product.

all located in Italy; highly skilled tailors, well-versed in the tradition of
fine tailoring, constantly strive to achieve the utmost in quality.

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman sees gold at $1,600/oz in 2013 vs $1,810/oz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Bank cuts 2014 price view to $1,450/oz vs $1,750/oz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Reiterates call for turn in gold's bull cycle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jan Harvey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its 2013
gold price forecast to $1,600 an ounce from $1,810 an ounce,
saying the metal's recent price drop and an increase in U.S.
real interest rates have led it to bring forward its projections
for a decline in the metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that projection proves accurate, it will mark the first
year gold has recorded a lower average price year-on-year since
2001, when its record-breaking 12-year bull run began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gold prices sold off sharply over the past two weeks,
extending the decline that started last October," the bank said
in a note dated Feb. 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of this price decline has coincided with a gradual
increase in U.S. real rates, reflecting the combination of
better-than-expected U.S. economic data, a more hawkish
interpretation of recent Fed communication and a lower level of
U.S. fiscal and European sovereign risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Net, these moves in gold and real rates have anticipated
the turn in the gold cycle that we had expected for the second
half of 2013."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman predicted a turn in gold's bull cycle in December,
saying a rise in real interest rates on the back of improved
growth could offset any further balance sheet expansion from the
Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also cut its 2014 forecast to $1,450 an ounce from
$1,750 an ounce. It reduced its three-month price view to $1,615
an ounce from $1,825 an ounce, its six-month forecast to $1,600
from $1,805, and its 12-month view to $1,550 from $1,800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold prices have fallen nearly 5 percent this year,
touching a seven-month low last week of $1,554.49 an ounce after
minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting suggested some
officials thought the bank might have to slow or stop buying
bonds even before a pick-up in hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The decline in prices since last fall and our updated
forecast suggests that the turn in the gold price cycle is
likely already underway," Goldman said. "As a result, although
our U.S. economic forecasts point to modest near-term upside to
gold prices, we believe that a sharp recovery in prices to our
previous price forecast is unlikely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In fact, we suspect that if indeed our forecast for further
declines in gold prices proves correct, the fall in prices could
end up being faster and larger than we expect as net long
positions across COMEX futures and ETFs remain near their record
highs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 26 (Reuters) - Recruitment company Robert Walters Plc
 reported a 3 percent rise in its full-year gross profit,
driven by revenue growth in Asia-Pacific and its move away from
hiring for the struggling banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters said its net fee income, or gross profit,
rose to 188.4 million pounds in the year ended Dec. 31 from
183.4 million pounds a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 7.5 percent to 567.8 million pounds. In
Asia-Pacific it jumped 14 percent to 280.6 million pounds,
making up  49 percent of revenue, up from 47 percent in the
previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's overall headcount rose 9 percent but it cut
its financial services team by 18 percent, reflecting a sharp
contraction in hiring in financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Britain, net fee income increased 5.7 percent, as the
country's labour market has proven surprisingly resilient over
the past year. It inched up less than a percent in the
Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company closed at 200.75 pence on the London
Stock Exchange on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

Essextec (Essex Technology Group, Inc.) was named a winner of a 2013 IBM Beacon
Award for Outstanding Services Solution with Global Technology Services. This
honor is awarded each year in recognition of a select number of IBM Business
Partners who have delivered not only innovative solutions, but have set the
standards for business excellence, ingenuity, and creation of an exceptional
client experience. 

"We are honored to receive the Beacon Award," states Jim Torney, President of
Essextec. "The recognition is confirmation of our strategy over the last ten
years to invest in and capitalize on the industry trend of customers moving away
from owning IT assets and toward implementing managed IT services solutions. The
market has matured to such a point now that the majority of our customers want
to evaluate a services based solution. In 2012, we collaborated with IBM to
create a new model for market penetration and delivery of highly integrated GTS
and Essextec solutions in the areas of security, cloud managed services,
business continuity and resiliency. Curtis Lumber, for instance, implemented a
new infrastructure solution designed by Essextec and managed in a private cloud
environment by IBM." 

The Beacon Awards are a vital element of IBM`s Business Partner recognition
program. Announced at the IBM PartnerWorld Leadership Conference in Las Vegas,
Nevada, United States and selected by leading industry influencers and IBM
executives from among hundreds of nominations, IBM's Beacon Awards recognize IBM
Business Partners who have demonstrated business excellence in delivering IBM
based solutions resulting in client transformation and business growth. This
year`s awards recognized Business Partner achievements across 30 award
categories. 

"Everyday, IBM Business Partners around the world provide innovative solutions
to their clients based on IBM products and services," said Mark Hennessy,
General Manager, IBM Global Business Partners. "The winners of this year`s
Beacon Awards are Business Partners who not only delivered superior innovation
through their award winning solution, but also offered unique client value by
using their skills and expertise to deliver the business capabilities their
clients need to achieve success in their own business ventures. We congratulate
Essextec on winning the Beacon Award for Outstanding Services Solution with
Global Technology Services and demonstrating its ability to provide value by
incorporating a highly innovative and unique model for delivery of integrated
GTS and Essextec solutions in the areas of resiliency, security, and cloud
managed services."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Mexico's Coca-Cola Femsa (KOFL.MX), the world's largest Coke bottler, said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter profit rose nearly 35 percent, helped by a pickup in sales driven by recent acquisitions in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, a joint venture of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Mexican retailer and beverage company Femsa (FMSAUBD.MX), said fourth-quarter profit jumped to 4.324 billion pesos ($336 million) from 3.212 billion pesos in the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 10.4 percent in the quarter to 39.86 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volume of bottled drinks sold increased 10.6 percent from the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by a pickup in sales of still beverages such as juices, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke Femsa has been snapping up smaller bottlers in Mexico in the last two years and it recently made its first foray outside of Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the company completed a $688.5 million acquisition of a 51 percent stake in Coca-Cola Co's bottling operations in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in January, Coke Femsa had agreed to buy Mexico's Grupo Yoli, the maker of a popular lime-flavored soft drink, in a deal valued at around $700 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisitions of smaller rivals Grupo Tampico and Grupo Cimsa in 2011 also boosted Coke Femsa's sales in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company expects to invest $800 million in its business this year, up slightly from $750 million last year, as it completes the construction of two production plants, Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevi&#241;o told analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment in the Philippines business will be an additional $100 million to $120 million, but that will come from money generated by the operation there, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;* Q4 profit 4.324 bln pesos vs 3.212 bln pesos yr ago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Quarterly revenue rises 10.4 pct to 39.86 bln pesos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 27 (Reuters) - Mexico's Coca-Cola Femsa, the

a deal valued at around $700 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisitions of smaller rivals Grupo Tampico and Grupo
Cimsa in 2011 also boosted Coke Femsa's sales in the fourth
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company expects to invest $800 million in its business
this year, up slightly from $750 million last year, as it
completes the construction of two production plants, Chief
Financial Officer Hector Trevi&#241;o told analysts on a conference

SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
RSA Conference 2013 (Booth 1017) - TITUS, a leading provider of information
security and data governance software, today announced that the latest version
of the TITUS SharePoint Security Suite is fully compatible with Microsoft
SharePoint 2013. 

"SharePoint has become an increasingly critical platform for enterprise
collaboration, content management and records keeping," said Antonio Maio,
Senior Product Manager at TITUS and Microsoft SharePoint Server MVP. "With
Microsoft`s latest release, SharePoint 2013 has greatly increased our ability to
share content throughout the entire organization much more easily, from the
chief executives right down to the information workers. However administrators
and content owners are faced with ever increasing challenges to protect
sensitive content that is housed in SharePoint in order to prevent data breaches
and compliance issues. That is where our TITUS SharePoint security products come
in." 

TITUS Security Suite for SharePoint enhances SharePoint security by
automatically enforcing fine-grained access control policies and applying visual
labels - promoting strong, consistent data governance for SharePoint content.
TITUS products leverage existing document metadata combined with trusted user
claims to ensure that security is applied automatically and consistently across
all SharePoint content. 

TITUS Security Suite for SharePoint is made up of two products that can be
purchased individually or together:

* TITUS Metadata Security automatically controls access to sensitive content,
allowing organizations to ensure that the right people are accessing the right
information. 
* TITUS Document Policy Manager automatically applies visual security labels and
converts documents to PDF to enhance security and raise awareness when users are
accessing sensitive content.

Both products are now fully supported on Microsoft SharePoint 2013, both Server
and Foundation. 

TITUS Security Suite for SharePoint is focused on making SharePoint a more
secure platform for organizations. The products simplify SharePoint security for
administrators and add new critical security features to the native SharePoint
security model. The latest version includes a number of new and enhanced
features, including:

* Dynamic policies: Goes beyond basic SharePoint permissions to provide an
access control method that evaluates and enforces policies dynamically, as the
user navigates SharePoint. Dynamic policies enable a true "deny" capability that
can block users from accessing sensitive content even if they are part of a
group that has access. 
* Centralized policy administration: Provides powerful administration options
integrated into SharePoint for applying policies across site collections, sites,
libraries, or folders. Policy administration can also be delegated to content
owners or site owners. 
* Auditing and logging: Enables effective data governance through integration
with standard SharePoint auditing and diagnostic logging capabilities.

* Visual marking enhancements: Raises end user awareness by adding visual
markings (headers, footers, watermarks) to documents protected by IRM/Microsoft
AD RMS, and promotes user accountability by adding usernames and timestamps to
downloaded PDFs and Office documents. 
* SharePoint Security Suite Software Development Kit: Provides a method to
integrate TITUS security policies into existing applications and easily protect
large numbers of libraries.

System Requirements
In addition to Microsoft SharePoint 2013, TITUS Security Suite for SharePoint is
also compatible with Microsoft SharePoint 2010 (Server and Foundation) and
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. 

About TITUS
TITUS is a leading provider of security and data governance software that helps
organizations share information securely while meeting policy and compliance
requirements. With over 2 million users worldwide, our solutions enable
enterprises, military and government organizations to classify information and
meet regulatory compliance by securing unstructured information. Products

classification and labeling solutions that enhance data loss prevention by

email solution for securely sending email and viewing attachments on mobile
devices; and the TITUS family of classification and security solutions for
Microsoft SharePoint. TITUS solutions are deployed within over 500 organizations
around the world, including Dow Corning, United States Air Force, NATO, Pratt
and Whitney, Canadian Department of National Defence, Australian Department of
Defence, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. For more information,

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the Kauffman foundation for crunching the numbers on a key part of Jerry Morans clumsily-named Startup Act 3.0  the new visa for immigrant entrepreneurs. I dont have an opinion on the rest of the bill, but it does have two sections which are something of a no-brainer when it comes to immigration reform. One is the immigrant-entrepreneur visa; the second is the idea of giving green cards to up to 50,000 foreign students who graduate from an American university with an advanced degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics  so long as they remain in that field for five consecutive years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immigrant-entrepreneur visa is pretty simple. You create a pool of 75,000 such things, available to anybody whos here already on an H1-B or F-1 visa. When those people switch from their old visa to their new one, they have to start a new company; employ at least two full-time, non-family member employees at a rate comparable to the median income of employees in the region, and invest or raise at least $100,000. After that, they have to continue adding employees at a rate of one per year, so that after three years, there must be at least five employees. At the end of three years, you graduate to a green card, and with it the standard path to citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visa addresses the main problem which Ross Eisenbrey has with H1-B visas: the fact that people on such visas are more or less indentured, tied to their job and whatever wage the employer decides to give them. The new visa would create an employer exit strategy for H1-Bs, allowing workers to leave companies which pay too little or offer too few opportunities, and instead strike out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course  by definition  it would create jobs. The Kauffman foundations math is solid, here: they conservatively estimate job creation at somewhere between 500,000 and 1.6 million new jobs after ten years, and possibly substantially more. (Those estimates dont include jobs created by the new firms after theyve left the program, for instance.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also like the fact that the new immigrants created by this program would go overwhelmingly to the parts of America where immigration is wanted and embraced: big cities and research hubs. This plan is full of positive externalities: it improves tax revenues, from all the new employment and consumption; it improves Americas share of global innovation, and of course it helps to position America once again as the land of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kauffman foundation is understandably worried that the visa would unfairly punish failure in an inherently risky world, but were living in a world of pivots, these days, where a gay social network can become a discount shopping site  and so long as the immigration people are OK with pivoting business plans, I think the failure problem will be manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most fundamentally, however, this visa is a great idea just because without it, the incentives are all wrong. As Stuart Anderson demonstrates, in a practical sense, it may be easier to stay in the United States illegally and start a business than to start a business and gain legal temporary status and permanent residence (green card) as the owner of that business. If we want to reduce illegal immigration, we obviously have to make it less attractive than legal immigration: as Jeb Bush and Clint Bolnick point out, you can only realistically ask illegal immigrants to return to their native countries and wait in line like everyone else insofar as there is, actually, a line to wait in. Right now, there isnt one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only real question, when it comes to this visa, is how its going to get signed into law. The proponents of immigration reform tend to fall into one of two groups: US employers, on the one hand, who are looking to increase the size and/or quality of the pool of potential employees theyre choosing from; and illegal immigrants, on the other hand, along with their families and friends, who want to stop living in the shadows. Neither group has much incentive to support an immigrant-entrepreneur visa. But lets hope we manage to get one somehow, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

Global financial services leader has over 430 development teams leveraging
Apprenda`s private PaaS for more than 2,000 custom applications worldwide
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Apprenda, the leader in enterprise private platform-as-a-service, today
announced JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), a leading global financial services
firm with assets of $2.4 trillion and operations worldwide, has selected
Apprenda`s platform to develop, deliver and manage its portfolio of internal
applications, custom-built in .NET and Java. This significant deal is the
largest private PaaS implementation to date, setting a benchmark for how
enterprises modernize and deliver data-sensitive private cloud applications. 

JPMorgan Chase chose Apprenda`s best of breed private PaaS as a way to reduce
costs, achieve faster time to market for applications and standardize and
modernize their application architectures. 

"JPMorgan Chase needed an enterprise grade private cloud solution to accelerate
our time to market for applications, improve our infrastructure efficiency and
increase our developer productivity," said JPMorgan Chase Chief Information
Officer Guy Chiarello. "We are pleased with our selection of Apprenda`s product
suite and look forward to realizing benefits across our global portfolio." 

Today, Apprenda is powering JPMC`s internal applications vital to supporting the
firm`s financial product offerings. Apprenda is deployed at a number of
production sites globally and across growing server clusters already totaling
several terabytes of memory. More than 430 development teams are using the
platform for its 2000 .NET and Java applications, which are now running live. 

Apprenda`s enterprise grade platform, plugged into JPMC`s existing IT
infrastructure, modernized it as a way to catapult the firm`s next generation
internal private cloud for both their .NET and Java applications. JPMC benefits
in the following ways from leveraging Apprenda:

* Enterprise Grade - JPMC`s private cloud PaaS operates at scale for thousands
of applications and provides guaranteed availability and global
failover-integrating seamlessly with existing IT investments. 
* "Just Bring Your App" PaaS - removed the friction between developers and IT
through single-click application deployment and isolated developers and their
applications from the infrastructure. 
* Unprecedented Time to Market - application deployment was reduced from many
weeks to fewer than five minutes per application. 
* Fine Cost Control - created a way to allocate and assign surface resources to
developers on an internal "pay as you go" model to keep costs in check and
maximize utilization.
* Standardization of Productivity and Architecture Patterns - achieved an
unprecedented ability to write hundreds of new custom applications per year that
would leverage the platform and support common application management, in
addition to offering platform services such as messaging and caching and cloud
architecture patterns.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - A top Microsoft Corp executive side-stepped questions on Tuesday about any plans the software maker may have to bring its Office suite of applications to Apple Inc's iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk has circulated for more than a year that Microsoft wants to bring native versions of its most profitable product to the hot-selling iPad, which one analyst estimates could generate $2.5 billion in extra revenue for Microsoft per year, but would remove an incentive to buying Windows-based tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't take it from the point of view, 'Do we need to have the PC software that's running on every single device?', we look very much at 'What is the experience that we are looking to have on those devices'," said Kurt DelBene, head of Microsoft's Office unit, asked about Office on the iPad at the Morgan Stanley technology investor conference in San Francisco, which was Webcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DelBene, who took over leadership of Office from Stephen Elop who left to lead phone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE) in 2010, did not directly address putting native versions of Office applications on the iPad, a subject Microsoft has steered clear of in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked specifically about the availability of Office on Apple's iOS mobile system - which powers iPads and iPhones - DelBene instead stressed online versions of Office apps, which can be accessed via a browser but do not offer the full richness of installed software or an app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've actually done a lot of work on iOS devices this time around," said DelBene. "We have enhanced the web applications pretty substantially, in partnership with Apple."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does offer native iOS versions of some Office applications, including its OneNote note-sharing software, Lync communication suite and SharePoint collaboration site, as well as its SkyDrive online storage service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the more than 100 million iPad owners, many of whom want to bring their devices to work, have to use the limited online versions of desktop staples Word, Excel and PowerPoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Holt estimated earlier this month that Microsoft could generate $2.5 billion in extra annual revenue from Office on iPad by next year, less the commission Apple would take on sales of Office through its App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the risk for Microsoft is that putting Office on the iPad takes away one of the key advantages of its own Surface and other Windows tablets, that already run Office natively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing incentives to buy Windows tablets would be a blow to Microsoft's flagship Windows unit, which although less profitable than Office, is still key to the company's overall strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked by one investor at the conference when he would be able to use Excel on his iPad, DelBene instead pointed the questioner toward Microsoft's own Surface RT and Surface Pro tablets and urged him to use Web-based versions of Office apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we've done a great job on both the consumer side, particularly with the Web apps that we are building, and on the enterprise side as well," said DelBene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Bill Rigby; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) said on Tuesday that it plans to cut 17,000 jobs by the end of 2014, representing about 6.6 percent of the company's overall workforce, as the bank sheds staff that helped it deal with bad home loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is optimistic that it can generate record income this year and is planning to add 4,000 employees in commercial and investment banking and credit cards to help it win business, bank executives said at an investor conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That hiring will be more than offset by job cuts in areas like mortgage servicing and retail banking, where the bank is positioning for a recovering housing market and new forms of branch banking. The net impact of the additions and cuts will be 17,000 fewer employees on the bank's payrolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job cuts reflect the pressure that banks are under, even as the U.S. housing market and overall economy show signs of recovery. Many banks are looking to automate more of their businesses to make their staff more productive and improve profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, at JPMorgan's branches, where it plans to cut about 6,000 tellers and other employees, the bank hopes customers will use automated teller machines for every day transactions and that remaining staff can focus on higher-margin activities like selling wealth management services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is one of the few big U.S. banks that is still adding branches to its network, but it is hoping to staff the branches with fewer workers. The bank's 5,614 branches have 63,500 employees, representing about a quarter of JPMorgan Chase's total. Chase's branch network is second to Wells Fargo &amp; Co's (WFC.N) in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For overall staffing levels, JPMorgan Chase had 258,965 employees globally at the end of 2012. Its headcount rose following the financial crisis to 262,882 in the second quarter of 2012 from 219,569 in the first quarter of 2009. Since last year's second quarter, staffing levels have drifted lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase overall earned $21.9 billion last year, excluding accounting charges linked to changes in the value of its debt. The bank said it has the potential to earn about $27.5 billion, thanks in part to efficiency gains. It aims to cut overall expenses by $1 billion in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach the $27.5 billion profit figure, the bank is also counting on costs for lawsuits to fall as disputes over bad mortgages are resolved, as well as seeing a one percentage point rise in interest rates, said Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The profit scenario also depends on the bank not being hit by another trading debacle like the $6.2 billion loss last year on derivatives trades placed by the London Whale, the nickname given a London-based JPMorgan trader for the size of the positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Jamie Dimon acknowledged that many of his top lieutenants who spoke to investors on Tuesday were in new jobs after changes he made last year in his management team and the bank's divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a little bit too much change in one year," Dimon said. "Some of it was the Whale. Some of it was the re-org" to better align product divisions with customer interests, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the top executives, however, have been at the company several years and know its businesses, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase shares were down 0.2 percent at $47.60 at the close of trading on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By David Henry; Additional reporting by Rick Rothacker in Charlotte, North Carolina; Writing by Dan Wilchins; Editing by Gerald E.

Agile IT announced it would begin migrating customers to the new version of
Office 365, released today by Microsoft. 
SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Agile IT announced today it would begin Office 365 Migrations to the new cloud
version of Microsoft Office, codename "Wave 15". 

The New Office 365, brings new features and plans, all based upon the tried and
tested technology of Microsoft Office Professional, Microsoft Exchange,
Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft Lync. 

"The new Office 365 will allow more businesses to work securely from anywhere,"
said John Gilham, Agile IT`s Principal Consultant and Cloud Architect. "With
more people working outside office buildings on mobile devices such as the new
Microsoft Surface Pro, and in geographically-separated locations, Office 365
offers all of the security, reliability and collaborative functions of an
on-premise solution, with the flexibility of anywhere access." 

All of the component parts of Office 365 have been brought firmly up to date,
with Office 2013 Professional, Exchange 2013 Online, SharePoint 2013 Online and
Lync 2013 Online making up the core of the suite. New applications to the
line-up are the addition of Visio and Project `bolt-on` services, familiar to
many in the corporate arena. 

Another key feature of the new Office is the switch to `per-user` licensing,
which offers the ability to install the software on up to 5 devices per user.
Recognizing the modern trend for people to work on multiple devices such as
tablets and smartphones as well as PCs, the new licensing removes the need for
separate licensing for each device, as used to be the case. 

"I firmly believe that the new Office 365 is the absolute best choice for
businesses of all sizes who are looking to improve productivity and reduce
costs," continued Gilham. "Agile IT is excited to be part of the new Office 365
and we look forward to continuing to provide unrivalled customer service and
expertise in migrating new clients to the Cloud." 

One of the first ever companies to migrate users to Office 365, Agile IT is a
Tier 3 member of the prestigious Microsoft Cloud Champions Club and is one of
the less than 0.5% of Microsoft partners to hold that position. In addition to
holding six Microsoft Gold competencies and six Microsoft Silver competencies,
Agile IT was awarded "Southwest Area Cloud Partner of the Year" by Microsoft in
2012 and was ranked alongside Amazon and Rackspace by Talkin`Cloud as one of the
top 100 Cloud Service Providers in the world. 

Agile IT`s success is also good news for the local economy, with 100% growth in
the number of jobs in the San Diego area each year for the past three years, and
further recruitment in the pipeline. 

Founded in 2006 by a former Business Technology consultant from Microsoft, San
Diego-based Agile IT was one of the first service providers to deliver fixed
price IT support &amp; Office 365 solutions. Agile IT core focus is helping its SMB
and Enterprise clients maximize their investment in technology systems and
solutions using operational rather than capital expense, to make it a more agile
organization. Agile IT's additional focus in its Enterprise Microsoft Consulting
practice areas: SharePoint, Dynamics CRM, Exchange, System Center, Lync, SQL &amp;
Business Intelligence, Windows Client &amp; Server Deployment, Enterprise Identity &amp;
Security, and Azure Cloud Service Hosting - provide agile enterprises with
integrated, secure, and robust private cloud infrastructure supporting strategic
line of business applications.

&lt;p&gt;New York City startup Sonar announced today&#160;that has received a strategic investment from Microsoft&#8217;s Bing Fund.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sonar taps into social networks to tell you how you&#8217;re connected to people nearby and in locations you&#8217;ve checked into. It&#8217;s part of a crowd of social discovery apps that includes Highlight and Glancee (which Facebook bought last year).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed, but we&#8217;ve previously reported that the Bing Fund offers early-stage startups between $50,000 and $100,000 along with advice and design help. The investment will likely be a big help to Sonar, which has only received $200,000 in seed funding so far. It joins other Bing Fund investments in Buddy and Pinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Utilizing tech in an innovative and unique way is a quality the Bing Fund champions, like many investors and accelerators do,&#8221; wrote Aya Zook, the senior program manager for the Bing Fund, in a blog post today. &#8220;But the prospect of working with people we respect and trust, and love hanging out with, is just as important when we consider companies to work with. Sonar hits all the right cords for us and we can&#8217;t be more excited that they agree.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its own blog post, Sonar explained how closely it has already been working together with the Bing Fund:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonar &amp; Microsoft have done some fantastic events together in the past, includingPSFK&#8217;s Need to Know&#160;at last year&#8217;s SXSW, and&#160;Social Media Week,&#160;Xconomy Mobile Madness&#160;and the&#160;For Humankind&#160;gallery all in New York, so we&#8217;re particularly excited to be hooking up with the team at Bing Fund. We&#8217;ve found we share quite a lot in common; they too recognize the value of understanding location and social&#8212;the intersection of time and place&#8212;in providing customers with great experiences. They&#8217;ll be great friends to have along on our adventures in helping customers connect with the most relevant people, places and things nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonar created a short Vine clip to announce the deal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RT @bingfund Welcoming @Sonar!

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to offload all of its announcements before the beginning of March.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, Microsoft announced that the Surface tablet is continuing its worldwide expansion, Yammer revealed its plans to add translation capabilities into conversations, and the Bing updated its Maps feature with a new collection of aerial satellite imagery. Also, European Union regulators announced today that it will fine Microsoft for antitrust violation in the coming months. Oh, and let&#8217;s not forget about Microsoft&#8217;s sale of Atlas Solutions to Facebook and the Bing Fund&#8217;s investment into Sonar. Whew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#8217;s start from the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will roll out the Surface RT to Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, and Taiwan, and the Surface Pro to Australia, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and the U.K. in the coming months.&#160;VentureBeat&#8217;s review found the RT to be a &#8220;disappointing compromise,&#8221; while the Pro is &#8220;full of possibility.&#8221; The Pros sold out online within hours of going on sale in early February. Now, these tablets-meet-PCs will be available in markets around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next is the Yammer news. Yammer is a social network for the enterprise that Microsoft purchased for $1.2 billion in July. The company is working on message translation capabilities that instantly translates Yammer conversations into a user&#8217;s native language to &#8220;ignite multilingual collaboration.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Removing language as a barrier to cross-company collaboration can be a competitive game changer for multinational organizations.

The Translator supports 39 languages. This translation is particularly useful for companies that work with international teams. Yammer said that 65 percent of its seven million users are located outside the United States, and this could drive greater international adoption of the service. &#160; &#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On to lucky number three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing Maps is released over 13 million square kilometers of updated satellite imagery today, which includes &#8220;bathymetry&#8221; data from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Bathymetry is not the study of taking baths, as I initially thought. Rather, it is the study of underwater depth of lake or ocean floors. Updates also include new base satellite imagery provided by TerraColor, with a resolution of 15 meters per pixel, and &#8220;cloud coverage&#8221; that makes it easier to see areas such as the Amazon basin and Tierra de Fuego. These updates &#8220;change the viewer experience within Bing Maps and the Windows 8 Map App.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was also in the news today for various wheelings, dealings, and run-ins with European regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report in Reuters&#160;this morning said that the European Commission is planning to fine Microsoft $2.1 billion (1.6 billion euros) for not providing data at fair prices to rivals, forcing developers to work with its products, and preventing consumers from choosing between rival web browsers from within the Windows operating system. Microsoft has apparently been embroiled in an antitrust battle in Europe for more than a decade, and the charges just kept racking up. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, New York City startup Sonar announced today that it received a strategic investment from Microsoft&#8217;s Bing Fund, which offers early-stage companies between $50,000 and $100,000 to get off the ground. Sonar&#8217;s technology taps into social networks to tell smartphone users how they are connected to people nearby and in locations they&#8217;ve check into. It is the fifth company to join the Bing Fund portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally (I hope), Microsoft finally sold its ad server Atlas Solutions to Facebook today. Microsoft acquired Atlas Solutions as part of its 2007 acquisition of aQuantive. Facebook will use Atlas Solutions to build its own independent ad network and data analytics system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ought to do it for one day, Microsoft.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to offload of its announcements before the beginning of March.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, Microsoft announced that the Surface is continuing worldwide expansion, Yammer revealed its plans to add translation capabilities into conversations, and the Bing updated its Maps feature with a new collection of aerial satellite imagery. Also, European Union regulators announced today that it will fine Microsoft for antitrust violation in the coming months. Oh, and let&#8217;s not forget about Microsoft&#8217;s sale of Atlas Solutions to Facebook and the Bing Fund&#8217;s investment into Sonar. Whew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#8217;s start from the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will rollout the Surface RT to Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, and Taiwan, and the Surface Pro to Australia, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and the UK in the coming months. The Surface Pros and RT are Microsoft&#8217;s versions of a tablet. A VentureBeat review found the RT to be a &#8220;disappointing compromise,&#8221; while the Pro is &#8220;full of possibility.&#8221; The Pros sold out online within hours of going-on-sale in early February. Now, these tablets-meet-PCs will be available in markets around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, there is the Yammer news. Yammer is a social network for the enterprise that Microsoft purchased for $1.2 billion in July of 2012. The company is working on message translation capabilities that will allow users to instantly translate Yammer conversations into their native languages, to &#8220;ignite multilingual collaboration.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Removing language as a barrier to cross-company collaboration can be a competitive game changer for multinational organizations.

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is taking the weight-of-the-world off Microsoft&#8217;s shoulders. Today, news came out that the Facebook officially bought Microsoft&#8217;s Atlas Solutions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in December, rumors circulated that Facebook planned to acquire Atlas in an effort to build its own external advertising network. Microsoft acquired Atlas Solutions back in 2007 as part of its purchase of aQuantive for $6 billion. Microsoft was apparently interested in offloading the property, and Facebook was interested in buying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the deal officially closed. Although the terms have not been disclosed, the price is estimated at under $100 million. Atlas Solutions offers a suite of tools for marketers to serve, track, and measure digital ad campaigns. It delivers billions of impressions every day across multiple channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If marketers and agencies can get a holistic view of campaign performance, they will be able to do a much better job of making sure the right messages get in front of the right people at the right time,&#8221; said Brian Boland, Facebook&#8217;s director of product marketing in a blog post. &#8220;Atlas has built capabilities that allow for this kind of measurement, and enhancing these systems will give marketers a deeper understanding of effectiveness and lead to better digital advertising experiences for consumers.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Facebook and Microsoft want to remain competitive against Google&#8217;s dominance in the ad-space. Microsoft is, in a sense, offloading the responsibility to Facebook, which will be better able to capitalize on advertising opportunities with its own network. E-marketer projects that Facebook will bring in nearly $2.7 billion in display advertising in 2013, as compared to Google&#8217;s $3.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, most advertisers connect to Facebook via a third party. An analysis in AdAge earlier this month said that with its own ad server, Facebook can better measure the effective of ad campaigns and open up more data to advertisers without exposing it to intermediaries. The social networking giant also has plans to develop Atlas into a stronger product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We plan to improve Atlas&#8217;s capabilities by investing in scaling its back-end measurement systems and enhancing its current suite of advertiser tools on desktop and mobile,&#8221; Boland said. &#8220;We will also work to improve the user interface and functionality with the goal of making Atlas the most effective, intuitive, and powerful ad serving, management and measurement platform in the industry.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest installment of the War of the Technology Titans, Facebook edges in on Google&#8217;s territory. Your move, Google. Read Facebook&#8217;s statement.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo Credit: Francisco Diez/Flickr&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals&lt;/p&gt;

constructive role in the development of Chilean capital markets
and to further diversify our investor base," a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the bank was also considering opening an office in
Chile, and that the Huaso program was a way to further the
bank's presence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chile has one of the deepest local capital markets in the
region and has been seen as an ideal stomping ground for other
Latin American borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one banker, Chilean investors now have between
USD300m-USD350m of assets under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite its potential, the Huaso market has only
developed in fits and starts since telecom America Movil open
this space in 2009 after years of leaping regulatory hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a handful of borrowers have tapped this asset class
since then, despite regulatory changes to broaden the borrower
base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it has been a matter of cost given the
relatively shallow but deepening swaps market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011 regional development bank Bladex postponed its
UF2.5m (USD108m) local bond after higher cross-currency swap
rates made the transaction less attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past December, however, Brazil's Banco Pine 
priced a UF1.5m (USD72m) 6% senior unsecured 5-year to yield
6.75%, coming inside initial price expectations of around
7%-7.25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the first time that a Brazilian issuer sold Huaso
bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in 2012, Mexican homebuilder Corporacion Geo
 also sold a Huaso bond, but in an extremely small
deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mexican homebuilder and a mid-tier Brazilian bank may not
have been ideal credits to revive the Huaso market, as investors
have cast a wary eye on both sectors in recent years. Indeed, in
Banco Pine's case, pension funds were not the main drivers of
the trade, as they normally are in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the deal attracted insurance companies, mutual
funds, banks and family offices that have fewer opportunities to
add foreign names to their portfolios (especially paper
denominated in inflation-linked UFs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chilean investors have also been unwilling to venture too
far down the credit spectrum after the accounting scandal at
local retailer La Polar in 2011 shook confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"La Polar changed risk perception of many pension funds,"
said a banker last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) trader known as the "London Whale" was not responsible for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's bankruptcy and should not be dragged into an $8.6 billion lawsuit accusing the largest U.S. bank of causing it, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a Wednesday filing in Manhattan bankruptcy court, JPMorgan believes that Lehman's own documentation showed that the trader, Bruno Iksil, had nothing to do with alleged mismarked derivative trades that are part of the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said Lehman and its unsecured creditors committee, which also seeks Iksil's testimony, pointed to nothing that shows the bank's Chief Investment Office had any role in collateral requests at the center of Lehman's lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting Iksil involved now would waste time and money, JPMorgan said, particularly in light of statements by former U.S. Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry Paulson that the collateral requests did not cause Lehman to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is readily apparent that the only real reason for plaintiffs interest in taking Mr. Iksil's deposition is that he has been in the news," JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Rossman, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan representing Lehman, in a statement on Thursday said Iksil's mismarked trades "resulted in improper demands for hundreds of millions of dollars of collateral. JPMorgan's extraordinary effort to block that testimony is revealing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hearing on Lehman's request is scheduled for March 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil gained notoriety after his activities were linked to $6.2 billion of trading losses at JPMorgan's Chief Investment Office. The French national had worked in London for the New York-based bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman employed JPMorgan as its main clearing bank, handling third-party dealings, prior to its September 15, 2008, bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It accuses JPMorgan of hastening its collapse by using what it learned in that role to extract $8.6 billion of collateral in the four business days ahead of the Chapter 11 filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing Iksil's "practice of intentional mismarking," Lehman said it wanted to review trades that led to an "unjustified" $273.3 million collateral call on September 9, 2008, which JPMorgan reversed the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A September 10, 2008 internal JPMorgan email linked Iksil to two trades by the Chief Investment Office in London that were then "significantly contributing" to a dispute with Lehman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Lehman said it wanted to question Iksil over how the Chief Investment Office managed JPMorgan's exposure to what was once Wall Street's fourth-largest investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lehman, Iksil's lawyers have indicated he will not cooperate without an official request through international channels. Lehman has asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in Manhattan for permission to start that process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a February 13 court filing, Lehman said it also wants to question other people who worked in JPMorgan's Chief Investment Office around the time of the bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last April, Peck narrowed but refused to dismiss Lehman's lawsuit, saying the company could pursue claims that JPMorgan had acted in a "commercially unreasonable" manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman emerged from Chapter 11 last March. It has said it hopes to repay creditors about $65 billion. That process is expected to take several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc et al v.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola)
proposed issuance of $2.5 billion of notes with maturities of two-, five-, and
10-years. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of ratings is provided
at the end of this release. 

The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the company's
senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net proceeds from the
offering to fund a $1.3 billion redemption of all of Coca-Cola Refreshments USA,
Inc.'s outstanding 5.00% notes due 2013, 7.375% notes due 2014 and 4.25% notes
due 2015, including redemption premiums, other outstanding indebtedness and for
general corporate purposes. 

The new notes are being issued under the company's existing indenture dated
April 26, 1988. While the indenture's restrictive covenants include limitations
on secured debt and sale and leaseback transactions, the prospectus for the new
notes excludes those covenants. Coca-Cola is not bound by any financial
covenants. The two-year floating-rate notes may not be redeemed prior to
maturity. The five- and 10-year notes are callable by Coca-Cola subject to a
make-whole provision. Coca-Cola had $32.6 billion of debt as of Dec. 31, 2012. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Coca-Cola ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest global
beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has 16 $1
billion brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute Maid,
and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's
beverage portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in
the U.S. and modest CSD growth in other developed countries. However, this risk
is mitigated by Coca-Cola's market strength in developing, high-growth
geographies. 

Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to consistently generate
considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash flow (FCF).
Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency with topline and cash
flow growth driven by increasing volume, price/mix and improved operating
expense leverage, despite persistent global macroeconomic pressure. Consequently
Coca-Cola generated $10.6 billion and $3.3 billion of CFFO and FCF,
respectively, for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012, after generating $9.5 billion
and $2.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011. 

Fitch expects Coca-Cola's FCF to exceed $3 billion in 2013. Management continues
to meet or exceed its long-term financial targets of 3%-4% worldwide volume and
6%-8% operating income growth. Moreover, Coca-Cola should continue capturing
growth and increasing beverage per capita consumption outside of the U.S. as
consumer sentiment improves and the global recovery progresses. 

Fitch is concerned about the significant growth in Coca-Cola's commercial paper
(CP) balance over the past year. CP reached $16.3 billion at the end of 2012
compared to $12.9 billion in 2011 and as a result represents approximately 50%
of the firm's overall capital structure. Despite the company's strong liquidity
and good market access, Fitch believes this level of CP could result in modestly
higher financial risk over the longer term. 

The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch between its U.S.
cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows which the company
has been reluctant to repatriate. Coca-Cola maintains a comparable cash balance
along with its committed bank lines to provide backup to its CP borrowings. At
Dec. 31, 2012, Coca-Cola's liquidity position of $22.9 billion consisted of
$13.5 billion of cash, $3.1 billion of short-term investments, and $6.3 billion
of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving credit facility. 

Coca-Cola has committed to $3 billion to $3.5 billion of net share repurchases
in 2013, after repurchasing a net $3.1 billion in 2012, but has paced share
repurchases to FCF generation. While not anticipated, a material reduction in
Coca-Cola's cash balance without a commensurate reduction in debt could result
in a negative rating action. 

At Dec. 31, 2012, Coca-Cola's leverage was 2.4x on a total debt to operating
EBITDA basis, up from 2.2x a year ago. Fitch considers leverage above 2.0x as
weak for the rating category but ratings incorporated the fact that Coca-Cola's
net leverage at Dec. 31, 2012 was 1.2x. Fitch believes Coca-Cola should address
its large CP balance in the near-to-intermediate term with any reduction in cash
matching any corresponding reduction in CP levels. 

Ratings also consider the potential of future acquisitions given the company's
transaction history. Fitch recognizes Coca-Cola's acquisitions could be
partially funded with debt, but believes the company would likely restore credit
measures back in line within a reasonable timeframe given its excess cash
generation and cash flow growth. For large transactions, Fitch would expect
Coca-Cola to curtail share repurchases. 

Coca-Cola has a manageable maturity schedule and robust access to the capital
markets. Fitch expects Coca-Cola to opportunistically refinance the approximate
$1.5 billion and $2.6 billion of long-term debt due in 2013 and 2014. 

RATINGS SENSITIVITIES 

Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to
positive rating include: 

Coca-Cola's ratings could be positively affected by the company attaining total
debt to operating EBITDA below 1.5x in combination with a stated commitment to
maintain stronger credit protection measures. 

Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to
negative rating include: 

Coca-Cola's ratings would be negatively affected by a large debt-financed
acquisition or share repurchase program or a reduction in cash and cash
equivalents without a commensurate reduction in CP balances. Fitch notes that
while Coca-Cola has more CP outstanding than capacity under its various
committed facilities, the company has consistently maintained a large cash
balance, and the combination of cash and facility availability provide adequate
backup for the CP. Coca-Cola had $16.3 billion of CP and other short-term
borrowings at Dec. 31, 2012. 

Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola
Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default risk is very low
at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the
notes issued by Coca-Cola. 

Fitch currently rates Coca-Cola as follows: 

The Coca-Cola Company 

--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; 

--Bank credit facilities 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; 

--Short-term IDR 'F1'; 

--CP 'F1'. 

Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR) 

--Long-term IDR 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A+'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable.

were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

&lt;p&gt;* Bruno Iksil played no role in Lehman collapse -JPMorgan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Lehman suing JPMorgan in $8.6 billion case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU competition regulators plan to fine Microsoft Corp before the end of March in a case tied to the U.S. software giant's antitrust battle in Europe more than a decade ago, three people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission had accused Microsoft in October last year of breaking a promise to offer European consumers a choice of rival browsers in the previous version of its Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company made the pledge in 2009 to settle an EU antitrust investigation and stave off a penalty that could have been as much as 10 percent of its global revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission is planning to fine Microsoft before the Easter break," one of the sources said, adding that it is possible that procedural issues could push back the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the fine could be significant because this is the second time that Microsoft has failed to comply with an EU order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesman for competition policy at the Commission, Antoine Colombani, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose shares were up slightly in afternoon trading, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission has sanctioned Microsoft to the tune of 1.6 billion euros ($2.1 billion) to date for not providing data at fair prices to rivals, requiring software developers to create products to work with its products, and for tying its media player to its operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU antitrust authority has said that the latest offence occurred between February 2011 and July 2012. Microsoft has blamed it on a technical error, saying that it has since tightened internal procedures to avoid a repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The matter did not escape the notice of Microsoft's board, which cut the bonus of chief executive Steve Ballmer last year, partly because of the Windows division's failure to provide a browser choice screen as required by the European Commission, according to its annual proxy filing in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's share of the European browser market has roughly halved since 2008 to 24 percent in January, below the 35 percent held by Google's Chrome and Mozilla's 29 percent share, according to Web traffic analysis company StatCounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares were up 12 cents at $27.93 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee, additional reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by David Goodman and Nick Zieminski)&lt;/p&gt;

The investment will likely be a big help to Sonar, which has only received $200,000 in seed funding so far. It joins other Bing Fund investments in Buddy and Pinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Utilizing tech in an innovative and unique way is a quality the Bing Fund champions, like many investors and accelerators do,&#8221; wrote Aya Zook, senior program manager for the Bing Fund, in a blog post today. &#8220;But the prospect of working with people we respect and trust, and love hanging out with, is just as important when we consider companies to work with.

We&#8217;ve found we share quite a lot in common; they too recognize the value of understanding location and social&#8212;the intersection of time and place&#8212;in providing customers with great experiences. They&#8217;ll be great friends to have along on our adventures in helping customers connect with the most relevant people, places and things nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonar created a short Vine clip to announce the deal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RT @bingfund Welcoming @Sonar!

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) trader known as the "London Whale" was not responsible for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's bankruptcy and should not be dragged into an $8.6 billion lawsuit accusing the largest U.S. bank of causing it, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Wednesday filing in Manhattan bankruptcy court, JPMorgan said Lehman knew from documents it produced itself that the trader, Bruno Iksil, had nothing to do with allegedly mismarked derivative trades about which Lehman wanted to take his deposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also said Lehman and its unsecured creditors committee, which also seeks Iksil's testimony, had pointed to nothing that shows the bank's Chief Investment Office had any role in the collateral requests at the center of Lehman's 3-year-old lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, getting Iksil involved wastes time and money, JPMorgan said, particularly in light of statements by former U.S. Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry Paulson that the collateral requests did not cause Lehman to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is readily apparent that the only real reason for plaintiffs interest in taking Mr. Iksil's deposition is that he has been in the news," JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman spokeswoman Kimberly Macleod said the company's lawyers would review the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil gained notoriety after his activities were linked to $6.2 billion of trading losses at JPMorgan's Chief Investment Office. The French national had worked in London for the New York-based bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was Lehman's main clearing bank, handling third-party dealings. Lehman accuses JPMorgan of hastening the bankruptcy by using what it learned in that capacity to extract $8.6 billion of collateral in the four business days prior to the September 15, 2008, Chapter 11 filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing Iksil's "practice of intentional mismarking," Lehman said it wanted to review trades that led to a large, "unjustified" collateral call on September 9, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman also said it wanted to review how the Chief Investment Office managed JPMorgan's exposure to what was once Wall Street's fourth-largest investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman said Iksil's lawyers have indicated he will not cooperate without an official request, prompting it to ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck for permission to start the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last April, Peck narrowed but refused to dismiss Lehman's lawsuit, saying the company could pursue claims that JPMorgan had acted in a "commercially unreasonable" manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman emerged from Chapter 11 last March.

&lt;p&gt;* Bruno Iksil played no role in Lehman collapse -JPMorgan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Lehman suing JPMorgan in $8.6 billion case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
 trader known as the "London Whale" was not responsible
for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's bankruptcy and should not be
dragged into an $8.6 billion lawsuit accusing the largest U.S.
bank of causing it, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Wednesday filing in Manhattan bankruptcy court,
JPMorgan said Lehman knew from documents it produced itself that
the trader, Bruno Iksil, had nothing to do with allegedly
mismarked derivative trades about which Lehman wanted to take
his deposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also said Lehman and its unsecured creditors
committee, which also seeks Iksil's testimony, had pointed to
nothing that shows the bank's Chief Investment Office had any
role in the collateral requests at the center of Lehman's
3-year-old lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, getting Iksil involved wastes time and money,
JPMorgan said, particularly in light of statements by former
U.S. Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry Paulson
that the collateral requests did not cause Lehman to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is readily apparent that the only real reason for

$8.6 billion of collateral in the four business days prior to
the Sept. 15, 2008, Chapter 11 filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing Iksil's "practice of intentional mismarking," Lehman
said it wanted to review trades that led to a large,
"unjustified" collateral call on Sept. 9, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman also said it wanted to review how the Chief

&lt;p&gt;Feb 28 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said oil flow rates

Chevron North America Exploration and Production Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico and the
onshore fields in the region was 153,000 barrels of crude oil,
395 million cubic feet of natural gas and 16,000 barrels of
