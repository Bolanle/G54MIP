&lt;p&gt;  BIRMINGHAM, AL, Jul 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The FDA has mandated a "Black Box Warning" requiring Pfizer Inc.,
manufacturer of Chantix(R), to strengthen warnings about the health risks
and dangers associated with using the drug. Chantix(R) (varenicline) is
advertised as an aid to help people quit smoking. The order for a Boxed
Warning comes on the heels of reports linking Chantix(R) to serious
injuries and death. FDA officials noted, "These reports included those
with a temporal relationship between the use of [Chantix] and suicidal
events and the occurrence of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior in
patients with no history of psychiatric disease." In addition to
requiring a stronger Boxed Warning, the FDA is requiring Pfizer to
"develop patient Medication Guides highlighting the risk of serious
neuropsychiatric symptoms." The FDA Advisory also requires new "Black
Box" warnings to be included on packages of smoking cessation drug
Zyban(R) (buproprion).

    Attorney Kristian Rasmussen of Cory Watson Crowder and DeGaris in
Birmingham, Alabama, filed the first lawsuits in the country on behalf of
Chantix(R) victims. According to Rasmussen, "alarming evidence linking
Chantix(R) to many severe injuries and death has continued to mount since
Pfizer rushed the dangerous drug onto the market."

    Rasmussen says Cory Watson Crowder and DeGaris has received more than
2,900 inquiries from consumers from across the country. Rasmussen said
his firm currently represents more than 350 Chantix victims. Cory Watson
Crowder &amp; DeGaris is recognized nationally for its practice in mass torts
litigation of defective medical devices and pharmaceuticals, class
actions, multidistrict litigation and complex litigation including
business and securities litigation and environmental litigation.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Wednesday ordered Pfizer Inc and GlaxoSmithKline PLC to add strong "black box" warnings on their anti-smoking drugs to highlight the risk of serious mental health problems, including suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warnings, which must be added to Pfizer's Chantix and Glaxo's Zyban, follow more than five thousand reports of depression, hostility and other behavioral changes, the Food and Drug Administration said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA officials said there was still a need for the medications, their concerns tempered by smoking's health dangers, such as lung cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want to scare people off from trying to use the medication to stop smoking. We just want them carefully monitored," said Dr. Curt Rosebraugh, who oversees the FDA office that reviews smoking-cessation drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the FDA strengthened its caution about possible accidents and serious injuries with Chantix linked to loss of consciousness, mental confusion, dizziness and muscle spasms. But it stopped short of adding it to the boxed warning as some health advocates had urged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosebraugh told reporters the FDA could not directly link the reported problems to the drugs, adding that withdrawal from nicotine in tobacco can also cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency is also requiring the companies to conduct additional clinical trials to help determine how serious a problem the mood disorders are, including among patients who already have depression or other similar conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warnings will limit Pfizer's ability to run some types of advertisements for Chantix, which the world's largest drugmaker had been counting on to help revive profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Pfizer has seen the drug's sales plunge over the last year amid safety concerns.

For Zyban and its generic rivals, it received a total 527 reports, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the FDA said it received 98 reports of suicide and 188 reports of attempted suicide with Chantix and 14 reports of suicide and 17 attempts with Zyban and related generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said investors have already factored in the continuing safety concerns. BMO Capital Markets analyst Robert Hazlett said he was lowering his estimated Chantix sales by $50 million per year starting in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares finished down less than 1 percent at $14.90 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Glaxo shares gained 2 percent to close at $36.04, also on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chantix, also known as varenicline, is designed to stimulate a type of nicotine receptor in the brain while preventing nicotine from binding to another receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zyban includes the same active ingredient, bupropion, as Glaxo's antidepressant Wellbutrin, which already carries a boxed warning about suicide and other behavioral risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Pfizer and Glaxo said they would add the new warning to their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it has already begun studying Chantix in hundreds of schizophrenia patients and was planning another trial that would include people with and without psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The benefits of Chantix outweigh the risks for many patients when used as directed," said Dr. Briggs Morrison, a Pfizer senior vice president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some consumer advocates said the FDA's Chantix warning was not strong enough for a drug that has been banned for use by pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Moore, a scientist at the Drug Safety and Policy Institute for Safe Medication Practices, said making the accident caution more prominent was an improvement but it should be as strong as the one for mental side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both doctors and patients should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of this drug... and consider alternatives" such as nicotine patches and gums, said Moore, whose group called attention to reported accidents and injuries last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Susan Heavey with additional reporting by Lisa Richwine in Washington and Ransdell Pierson in New York; editing by Maureen Bavdek, Richard Chang and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds further reaction, edits)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Susan Heavey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, July 1 (Reuters) - U.S. health officials on
Wednesday ordered Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and GlaxoSmithKline PLC
(GSK.L) (GSK.N) to add strong "black box" warnings on their
anti-smoking drugs to highlight the risk of serious mental

additional clinical trials to help determine how serious a
problem the mood disorders are, including among patients who
already have depression or other similar conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The warnings will limit Pfizer's ability to run some types
of advertisements for Chantix, which the world's largest
drugmaker had been counting on to help revive profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, Pfizer has seen the drug's sales plunge over the

gained 2 percent to close at $36.04, also on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chantix, also known as varenicline, is designed to
stimulate a type of nicotine receptor in the brain while
preventing nicotine from binding to another receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zyban includes the same active ingredient, bupropion, as
Glaxo's antidepressant Wellbutrin, which already carries a
boxed warning about suicide and other behavioral risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Pfizer and Glaxo said they would add the new warning
to their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it has already begun studying Chantix in
hundreds of schizophrenia patients and was planning another
trial that would include people with and without psychiatric
disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The benefits of Chantix outweigh the risks for many
patients when used as directed," said Dr. Briggs Morrison, a
Pfizer senior vice president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some consumer advocates said the FDA's Chantix warning
was not strong enough for a drug that has been banned for use
by pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomas Moore, a scientist at the Drug Safety and Policy
Institute for Safe Medication Practices, said making the
accident caution more prominent was an improvement but it
should be as strong as the one for mental side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Both doctors and patients should carefully weigh the risks
and benefits of this drug... and consider alternatives" such as
nicotine patches and gums, said Moore, whose group called
attention to reported accidents and injuries last year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Graceway Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a portfolio company of GTCR Golder Rauner, LLC,
and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that they have entered into an
Acquisition and License Agreement by which Graceway will acquire the worldwide
commercial rights for three investigational dermatological molecules from Pfizer
and the related transferred or licensed intellectual properties. 

"We are excited about the potential that these molecules present. Their
acquisition is evidence of Graceway`s ongoing commitment to the dermatology
community by offering innovative medicines aimed at enhancing patient care,"
stated Jefferson J. Gregory, Chairman and CEO of Graceway. 

Graceway will acquire two molecules that target the treatment of oily skin and
acne - an early stage Stearoyl CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) Inhibitor and a
Cholesterol-Acyltransferase (ACAT) Inhibitor, currently in Phase 2 of
development. This ACAT Inhibitor offers a new mechanism of action to address
these common conditions and is understood to work by reducing skin surface sebum
production. In addition, Graceway will acquire an Activin-Like Kinase 5 (ALK-5)
Inhibitor, currently in early pre-clinical development. The ALK-5 Inhibitor is a
promising agent for the reduction of surgical and traumatic scar formation. 

Concurrent with the Acquisition and License Agreement, the parties also executed
a Master Services and Supply Agreement under which Pfizer has agreed to perform
developmental and clinical services for these three molecules. Terms of the
transaction were not disclosed. 

"We are extremely pleased about this agreement with Graceway as part of Pfizer`s
plan to out license R programs that are no longer core to its strategy but
could become important medicines for patients," said David K. Rosen, Head of Out
Licensing for Pfizer. "This agreement is yet another testament to Pfizer`s
commitment to create value for patients, physicians and shareholders." 

Pfizer was advised by Burrill LLC.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Pozen Files For Approval of Vimovo

Today, Pozen (Nasdaq: POZN)announced the submission of the new drug application
(NDA) to the U.S. FDA, seeking marketing approval for Vimovo (proposed trade
name for PN-400) for the treatment of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis,
rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in patients who are at risk for
developing NSAID-associated ulcers. 

Vimovo is a combination of 500mg enteric coated naproxen and 20mg immediate
release esomeprazole. In early December 2008, Pozen released positive top-line
data from its 400-301/-302 phase III program testing PN-400 (20mg esomeprazole /
500mg naproxen) vs. 500mg enteric coated naproxen alone. Results show that 400
patients total in both trials taking PN-400 experienced statistically
significant fewer number of confirmed gastric ulcers by endoscopy compared to
400 subjects receiving enteric coated naproxen during the six-month period. 

Kimberly-Clark to Reduce Workforce by 3%

Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE: KMB) announced plans to reduce its salaried
workforce by approximately 1,600 positions (or 3%) by the end of 2009, which
management believes will yield annualized savings of $150 million. 

The organizational changes will require charges of $140 million to $150 million
(or between $0.24 and $0.26 per share), mostly in the second quarter of 2009
(about $0.19 per share). Management expects to achieve $0.10 per share in
savings during the second half of 2009. 

Enterprise to buy Teppco

Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) and Enterprise GP Holdings L.P.
announced a definitive agreement to merge with Teppco Partners (NYSE: TPP) along
with Teppco's general partner. The merger of the master limited partnerships
(MLPs) will take place on a unit-for-unit basis to form the largest publicly
traded energy partnership with an enterprise value of more than $26 billion. 

The combined partnership will operate under the Enterprise name and trade under
the 'EPD' ticker symbol. Post merger, Teppco and its general partner - Texas
Eastern Products Pipeline Co. LLC - will become wholly owned subsidiaries of
Enterprise. The completion of the merger is subject to regulatory approvals and
is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2009. 

Chevron Begins Steamflood

The Saudi Arabian subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) started steam
injection in its large-scale pilot steamflood project at Wafra field. This
Eocene heavy-oil carbonate reservoir lies in the Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ)
between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The $340 million pilot is the final test phase
for steamflooding the reservoir. Upon completion, the project would be the
world`s first commercial conventional steamflood in a carbonate reservoir. 

Steamflood technology is an enhanced oil recovery method that involves injecting
steam into heavy-oil reservoirs to heat the crude oil underground, reducing its
viscosity and allowing its extraction through wells. Chevron has been using this
method over the years to produce heavy oil from reservoirs at Kern River,
California, and Duri Field, Indonesia. Duri is the biggest producing field that
Chevron operates in the country.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Wednesday ordered Pfizer Inc and GlaxoSmithKline PLC to add strong "black box" warnings on their anti-smoking drugs to highlight the risk of serious mental health problems, including suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warnings, which must be added to Pfizer's Chantix and Glaxo's Zyban, follow thousands of reports of depression, hostility and other behavioral changes, the Food and Drug Administration said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency is also requiring the companies to conduct additional clinical trials to help determine how serious a problem the mood disorders are in patients taking the smoking cessation drugs, including among patients who already have depression or other similar conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the drugs are effective, "the possible risk of serious adverse events occurring while using these drugs should always be weighed against the significant health benefits of quitting smoking," said Dr. Curt Rosebraugh, who oversees the FDA office that reviews smoking-cessation drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the agency strengthened its caution about possible accidents and serious injuries with Chantix but stopped short of adding it to the boxed warning as some advocates have urged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warnings will hamper Pfizer's ability to advertise Chantix, which the world's largest drugmaker had been counting on to revive profits. Instead, it has seen the drug's sales plunge over the last year amid safety concerns. Global first-quarter sales of Chantix fell 36 percent to $177 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA first alerted patients and doctors about possible mood changes in November 2007 and since then has continued to receive a growing number of reported problems, though it said it could not directly link them to use of the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the agency received 4,762 reports of serious psychiatric events since Chantix's approval in 2006. For Zyban and its generic rivals, it received a total 527 reports, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the FDA said it received 98 reports of suicide and 188 reports of attempted suicide with Chantix and 14 reports of suicide and 17 attempts with Zyban and related generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chantix, also known as varenicline, is designed to stimulate a type of nicotine receptor in the brain while preventing nicotine from binding to another receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zyban includes the same active ingredient, bupropion, as Glaxo's antidepressant Wellbutrin, which already carries a boxed warning about suicide and other behavioral risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Pfizer and Glaxo said they would add the warning to their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it has already begun studying Chantix in hundreds of schizophrenia patients and was planning another trial that would include people with and without psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The benefits of Chantix outweigh the risks for many patients when used as directed," said Dr. Briggs Morrison, a Pfizer senior vice president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares finished down less than 1 percent at $14.90 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Glaxo shares gained 2 percent to close at $36.04, also on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Susan Heavey, Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine in Washington and Ransdell Pierson in New York; editing by Maureen Bavdek, Richard Chang and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RADNOR, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Airgas, Inc. (NYSE: ARG) today announced the winners of its National Branch of
the Year trophies, which honor the best of its more than 850 local branches
nationwide. The winners, based on fiscal 2009 performance, were the Joplin, MO,
branch in Airgas Mid South among the large branches and the Visalia, CA, branch
in Airgas Northern California and Nevada among the small branches. 

"These two represent the best of the best Airgas branch locations, since they
were chosen from among the 24 Regional Branch of the Year winners selected in
the past few weeks," said Mike Molinini, executive vice president and chief
operating officer of Airgas, Inc. "I`m proud to name Joplin and Visalia as this
year`s top branches." 

This is the fifth year Airgas has recognized its top large and small branches
for the Airgas Branch of the Year awards. The honor is based on customer
service, financial performance and safety performance. 

"The 17 associates in the Joplin branch, led by Branch Manager Richard Gorman,
collaborated to attain high service levels and earn new business. They also
simultaneously reduced expenses and beat their financial targets, which is no
small feat considering the challenging economy," added Molinini. He also
recognized the Joplin branch as leaders in safety practices with an impressive
safety record, and cited a high frequency of favorable customer feedback, all of
which contributed to their selection as Airgas Branch of the Year. 

"In the small branch category, the winner is Visalia, in Airgas Northern
California and Nevada. Branch Manager Mark Estavillo led this five-person branch
to exceed their financial targets by making customer service a key component of
daily life. They have been developing a customer-centric culture from their
start in December 2005, and just as important, they have a clean safety record
since the doors opened," Molinini noted. 

As the National Branch of the Year winners, the two branches will soon display
National Branch of the Year trophies, constructed from size 125 cylinders
donated by Taylor-Wharton, which have been powder-coated platinum and mounted on
a welded aluminum base. Like hockey`s Stanley Cup, the trophies carry engraved
bands with the winners` names and are passed along each year to the next
winners. 

The winning branches will also fly a "2009 National Branch of the Year" banner,
and associates will receive silver "Branch of the Year" rings to commemorate the
honor. 

The 24 Regional Branch of the Year winners also fly a similar banner and display
a size 80 cylinder, powder-coated gold trophy. Following is a full list of the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following rating on the U.S. residential mortgage
servicer rating for Walter Mortgage Company (WMCo): 

--U.S. residential primary servicer rating for subprime product at 'RPS3-'. 

The rating action reflects WMCo's seasoned management team, adequate loan
administration procedures, and competent default management practices. 

Since Fitch's prior review, WMCo has undergone significant changes regarding
ownership structure and sourcing of loans. In September 2008, Walter Industries,
Inc. announced a strategic decision to spin off its financing business,
including the mortgage servicing operations of WMCo. In April 2009, the spin-off
was completed and the former financing business was merged with Hanover Capital
Mortgage Holdings, Inc. to form Walter Investment Management Corp. (WIMC). WMCo
is now a subsidiary of WIMC. In December 2008, Walter Industries, Inc. announced
the closure of its Jim Walter Homes (JWH) subsidiary. Approximately 90% of the
accounts in WMCo's servicing portfolio had been sourced through JWH, which
provided financing on the majority of houses it constructed. The balance of
WMCo's servicing portfolio was purchased from third parties, including other
home builders, mortgage companies, and banks, under a program that the company
terminated in August 2007 in light of volatile market conditions. 

WMCo's servicing operation is headquartered in Tampa, FL, with an additional
servicing site in Fort Worth, TX and divisional field offices in Atlanta, GA,
Birmingham, AL, Charlotte, NC, and Houston, TX. The company's business model for
servicing focuses on a niche market that includes accounts originated by JWH
that often involve first time homebuyers, and are generally subprime fixed-rate
mortgage loans with rural collateral. WMCo's strategy of high touch, direct
contact servicing, employing field representatives who are involved in all
stages of collections and default management through disposition of real estate
owned properties, allows the company to pursue loss mitigation resolutions
during the collections process on a face-to-face basis but results in a
significantly higher cost of servicing than most subprime servicers. However,
WMCo's portfolio performance is also stronger as a result with overall
delinquencies of 11.6% as of March 31, 2009. 

WMCo's servicing portfolio consisted of over 36,900 accounts totaling $1.9
billion as of March 31, 2009, with approximately 87% of the accounts included in
residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and the balance owned by the
company. 

Fitch believes that WMCo is a capable servicer with competent systems,
established processes and adequate controls. However, Fitch will continue to
monitor WMCo's ability to maintain its performance while pursuing its servicing
initiatives and developing new sources of servicing assets under its new
ownership structure in a high delinquency environment. 

Fitch rates residential mortgage primary, master, and special servicers on a
scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest rating. Within some of these rating
levels, Fitch further differentiates ratings by plus (+) and minus (-) as well
as the flat rating. For more information on Fitch's residential servicer rating
program, please see Fitch's report 'Rating U.S. Residential Mortgage Servicers',
dated Nov. 29, 2006, which is available on the Fitch Ratings web site at
www.fitchratings.com. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

&lt;p&gt;Provides Specific Instruction to Physicians and Patients About Quitting Smoking
with CHANTIX
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc announced that it has updated the U.S. product labeling for CHANTIX&#174;
(varenicline), a prescription aid to smoking cessation treatment, to communicate
important safety information in a boxed warning as well as in revised warnings
and precautions. These updates are based on post-marketing reports and are being
made in agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Pfizer is
making this information available immediately to U.S. health care providers and
patients through multiple communication channels, including letters to doctors
and pharmacists, Web site updates, and the CHANTIX patient Medication Guide. 

The updated label highlights safety information about reports of serious
neuropsychiatric events in a boxed warning; updates the warning about reports of
neuropsychiatric symptoms and suicidality; adds warnings about reports of
allergic reactions and serious skin reactions; and updates precautionary
information about driving or operating machinery to include details about
reports of accidental injury. 

"The labeling update underscores the important role of health care providers in
treating smokers attempting to quit and provides specific information about
CHANTIX and instructions that physicians and patients should follow closely,"
said Dr. Briggs W. Morrison, senior vice president, Primary Care Development
Group at Pfizer. "Quitting smoking is one of the best things people can do for
their health, but the quitting process is both difficult and complex." 

Boxed Warning Highlights Important Safety Information

Certain information on neuropsychiatric symptoms has been included in the
CHANTIX label since November 2007 and is based on post-marketing reports. The
boxed warning instructs health care providers to observe patients being treated
with CHANTIX for the possibility of certain serious neuropsychiatric events and
to advise patients to stop taking CHANTIX and contact their doctor immediately
if these symptoms occur. It also states that the safety and efficacy of CHANTIX
in patients with serious psychiatric illness have not been established. The
update advises physicians to provide ongoing monitoring and support for patients
who exhibit neuropsychiatric events until symptoms resolve. 

The boxed warning also provides important information about the quitting
process. It states that some smokers who are making a quit attempt - including
those who are not using medication - may experience nicotine withdrawal
symptoms, such as depressed mood. Additionally, the boxed warning communicates
that the health benefits of quitting smoking are immediate and substantial, the
risks of CHANTIX should be weighed against the benefits of its use, and that
CHANTIX has been demonstrated to increase the likelihood of quitting for as long
as one year compared to placebo. 

Pfizer is conducting clinical trials of CHANTIX in multiple populations,
including in patients with psychiatric disorders and chronic lung disease. 

Safety Information in Warnings and Precautions Sections

The CHANTIX label updates existing warning information regarding serious
neuropsychiatric symptoms to include the types of reports received. It also adds
warnings about allergic reactions, such as angioedema, and rare, but serious,
skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Existing precautionary
information about driving and operating machinery has beenupdated in the CHANTIX
label to include details about accidental injury. 

"The health benefits of quitting smoking are immediate and substantial," said
Dr. Morrison. "The benefits of CHANTIX outweigh the risks for many patients when
used as directed. CHANTIX is an effective treatment option for patients who want
to quit smoking. Patients should discuss with their physicians if CHANTIX is
right for them." 

About CHANTIX

CHANTIX was approved by the FDA in May 2006 as an aid to smoking cessation
treatment in adults 18 and older. Nearly 11 million people have been prescribed
CHANTIX worldwide. CHANTIX has been shown to increase the likelihood of
abstinence from smoking for as long as one year compared to treatment with
placebo. Adults who smoke may benefit from quit smoking support programs and/or
counseling during their quit attempt. It`s possible that patients might slip up
and smoke while taking CHANTIX. If patients slip up, they can stay on CHANTIX
and keep trying to quit. 

About Smoking

Tobacco use is a risk factor for six of the eight leading causes of death in the
world, including heart disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.1,2 Smoking-related illness is the leading preventable cause of death in
the United States, killing more than 443,000 people each year.3,4

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Some people have had changes in behavior, hostility, agitation, depressed mood,
suicidal thoughts or actions while using CHANTIX to help them quit smoking. Some
people had these symptoms when they began taking CHANTIX, and others developed
them after several weeks of treatment or after stopping CHANTIX. If you, your
family or caregiver notice agitation, hostility, depression or changes in
behavior, thinking, or mood that are not typical for you, or you develop
suicidal thoughts or actions, anxiety, panic, aggression, anger, mania, abnormal
sensations, hallucinations, paranoia or confusion, stop taking CHANTIX and call
your doctor right away. Also tell your doctor about any history of depression or
other mental health problems before taking CHANTIX, as these symptoms may worsen
while taking CHANTIX. 

Some people can have serious skin reactions while taking CHANTIX, some of which
can become life-threatening. These can include rash, swelling, redness, and
peeling of the skin. Some people can have allergic reactions to CHANTIX, some of
which can be life-threatening and include: swelling of the face, mouth, and
throat that can cause trouble breathing. If you have these symptoms or have a
rash with peeling skin or blisters in your mouth, stop taking CHANTIX and get
medical attention right away. 

The most common side effects include nausea (30%), sleep problems, constipation,
gas and/or vomiting. If you have side effects that bother you or don`t go away,
tell your doctor. You may have trouble sleeping, vivid, unusual or strange
dreams while taking CHANTIX. Use caution driving or operating machinery until
you know how CHANTIX may affect you. 

CHANTIX should not be taken with other quit smoking products. A lower dose of
CHANTIX may be necessary in patients with kidney problems or who get dialysis. 

Before starting CHANTIX, patients should tell their doctors if they are
pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or if they take insulin, asthma medicines, or
blood thinners. Medicines like these may work differently when patients quit
smoking.

CHANTIX was approved by the FDA in May 2006 as an aid to smoking cessation
treatment in adults 18 and older. Nearly 11 million people have been prescribed
CHANTIX worldwide. CHANTIX has been shown to increase the likelihood of
abstinence from smoking for as long as one year compared to treatment with
placebo. Adults who smoke may benefit from quit smoking support programs and/or
counseling during their quit attempt. It`s possible that patients might slip up
and smoke while taking CHANTIX. If patients slip up, they can stay on CHANTIX
and keep trying to quit. 

About Smoking

Tobacco use is a risk factor for six of the eight leading causes of death in the
world, including heart disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.1,2 Smoking-related illness is the leading preventable cause of death in
the United States, killing more than 443,000 people each year.3,4

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Some people have had changes in behavior, hostility, agitation, depressed mood,
suicidal thoughts or actions while using CHANTIX to help them quit smoking. Some
people had these symptoms when they began taking CHANTIX, and others developed
them after several weeks of treatment or after stopping CHANTIX. If you, your
family or caregiver notice agitation, hostility, depression or changes in
behavior, thinking, or mood that are not typical for you, or you develop
suicidal thoughts or actions, anxiety, panic, aggression, anger, mania, abnormal
sensations, hallucinations, paranoia or confusion, stop taking CHANTIX and call
your doctor right away. Also tell your doctor about any history of depression or
other mental health problems before taking CHANTIX, as these symptoms may worsen
while taking CHANTIX. 

Some people can have serious skin reactions while taking CHANTIX, some of which
can become life-threatening. These can include rash, swelling, redness, and
peeling of the skin. Some people can have allergic reactions to CHANTIX, some of
which can be life-threatening and include: swelling of the face, mouth, and
throat that can cause trouble breathing. If you have these symptoms or have a
rash with peeling skin or blisters in your mouth, stop taking CHANTIX and get
medical attention right away. 

The most common side effects include nausea (30%), sleep problems, constipation,
gas and/or vomiting. If you have side effects that bother you or don`t go away,
tell your doctor. You may have trouble sleeping, vivid, unusual or strange
dreams while taking CHANTIX. Use caution driving or operating machinery until
you know how CHANTIX may affect you. 

CHANTIX should not be taken with other quit smoking products. A lower dose of
CHANTIX may be necessary in patients with kidney problems or who get dialysis. 

Before starting CHANTIX, patients should tell their doctors if they are
pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or if they take insulin, asthma medicines, or
blood thinners. Medicines like these may work differently when patients quit
smoking.

&lt;p&gt;Companies` Experts to Educate IT Administrators About Cost-Savings Opportunities
Created by Deploying Virtualized Thin Clients to Replace Desktop PCs
KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Devon IT, a leading alternative desktop solution company, and IBM (NYSE:IBM)
will host educational virtualization events to educate IT personnel and
administrators about the cost-savings capabilities of virtual desktops. The
events will be held at the IBM offices in Kansas City on Tuesday, July 7,
Chicago on Tuesday, July 14, Indianapolis on Wednesday, July 15, and Detroit on
Thursday, July 16. 

Virtualized desktops are hosted on a remote central server instead of on the
hard drive of a local personal computer. Desktop virtualization software
separates an individual`s PC applications, files, data, etc. from their desktop.
Benefits of this computing model include lowering the total cost of ownership,
extending hardware life cycles, increasing security, lowering energy output, and
centralizing desktop management. 

"We have held several IBM road shows this year in different regions and
experienced a significant interest from customers, signaling the momentum of the
virtualized desktop," notes Joe Makoid, President, Devon IT. "We hope to
continue this road show across the U.S. through the end of the year, and
encourage customers who are looking to save money on desktop deployment costs,
lower their energy bills, and centrally manage their desktops to attend these
educational seminars." 

IT executives in all-sized industries are invited to attend the seminars.
Executives from Devon IT and IBM will host a series of discussions about the
benefits of desktop virtualization and the cost-savings benefits. Space is
limited and interested customers are encouraged to register for the events here

&lt;p&gt;Oil Giant Had Tried to Lobby USTR Over $27 Billion Environmental Liability in
Ecuador`s Amazon

WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
In a setback over its attempt to avoid a $27 billion environmental liability,
Chevron has failed for the third time in as many years to convince the Obama and
Bush administrations to cancel bilateral trade benefits for Ecuador in
retaliation for letting indigenous groups sue the oil giant in that country`s
courts. 

Ecuador`s trade benefits were automatically renewed for six months at midnight
when the Obama Administration failed to initiate a review of the issue, despite
intense Chevron lobbying in Congress and at the office of the United States
Trade Representative. Chevron had hired two former U.S. trade ambassadors -
Mickey Kantor and Carla Hills - to approach officials at the agency they
formerly headed to seek a cancellation of the benefits, but to no avail. 

If Chevron had succeeded in canceling the benefits, Ecuador`s government
estimated the country would have lost 350,000 jobs. Similar lobbying efforts by
Chevron -- last year and in 2006 -- to enlist U.S. trade policy a pressure point
in the private lawsuit met stiff opposition from a number of Senators and
Congressmen, and also failed. 

The extension of the benefits comes just one day after the U.S. Supreme Court
denied Chevron`s attempt to appeal a decision that prevented it from arbitrating
the liability with Petroecuador, Ecuador`s state-owned oil company. The company
is also being investigated by New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to
determine if it misled shareholders about its financial risk in Ecuador. 

The long history of the case appears to be haunting Chevron as it suffers a
series of setbacks in courts, with regulatory agencies, and in the media. The
company was recently the subject of unflattering reports on 60 Minutes and in
several newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, The New
York Times, and The Washington Post. 

While it now claims it is not receiving a fair trial, Chevron had fought for
nine years to transfer the legal case to Ecuador after it was originally filed
in 1993 in U.S. federal court in New York. As a condition of the transfer,
Chevron agreed to submit to jurisdiction and be bound by any ruling in Ecuador.
The company also submitted 14 sworn affidavits praising the fairness of
Ecuador`s courts. 

Once the trial in Ecuador started in 2003 and the evidence pointed to Chevron`s
culpability, the company launched a public relations and lobbying campaign to
discredit Ecuador`s courts and pressure Ecuador`s government to quash the case.
The threat of U.S. trade policy was the primary "weapon" Chevron chose to create
leverage with Ecuador`s government to pressure it to interfere in the legal case
on Chevron`s behalf, said Steven Donziger, an American legal advisor to the 80
indigenous and farmer communities suing the oil giant. 

"Chevron`s lobbying effort was based on the theory that Ecuador`s President
could be forced to violate his country`s Constitution by interfering in a
private litigation," said Donziger. "By engaging in these heavy-handed tactics
reminiscent of the worst days of Uncle Sam, Chevron has damaged its own image
and that of other U.S. investors in Latin America." 

"Chevron`s management and its lobbyists need to let the trial in Ecuador
conclude without further interference," added Donziger. 

Texaco (now Chevron) had admitted to dumping billions of gallons of toxin-laced
"water of formation" into Ecuador`s Amazon over an area the size of Rhode Island
when it operated a large oil concession from 1964 to 1990. The pollution has
been dubbed the "Amazon Chernobyl" by several experts, some of whom believe a
clean-up would dwarf the largest decontamination effort ever undertaken. 

A final decision on a $27.3 billion damages assessment, prepared by a
court-appointed special master and team of experts, is expected later this year.
Chevron has said it expects an "adverse" decision and will appeal, while the
plaintiffs say they will seek to have the judgment enforced immediately in U.S.
courts because of Chevron`s attempts to undermine the trial process and cause
wanton delay. 

Further exacerbating the humanitarian situation is that five indigenous groups
in the region have seen their cultures decimated by oil-related contamination,
and all are struggling to survive on small areas of largely poisoned land. Rep.
James McGovern (D-MA), the only member of Congress to have visited the region,
called it a "terrible humanitarian and environmental crisis" in a letter to
President Obama written in November of last year. 

"It is past time for those responsible for this contamination to step up to the
plate and be held accountable," wrote McGovern in the letter. "I...saw the
infrastructure Texaco/Chevron created that allowed for the wholesale dumping of
formation water and other highly toxic materials directly into the Amazon and
its waters." 

Chevron was able to rally several business organizations to its side, including
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, and the National
Association of Manufacturers (Chevron contributes funds to each of these
organizations). But just last week, four Democratic U.S. Senators - Wyden,
Durbin, Leahy, and Casey - wrote a letter to the USTR asking it to ensure that
it does not meddle in the lawsuit on behalf of Chevron. 

In 2006, then-Sen. Obama and Senator Leahy wrote a similar letter to the USTR
asking that it reject Chevron`s attempts to use trade policy to pressure
Ecuador`s government over the lawsuit.

&lt;p&gt;July 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Yum Brands Inc
(YUM.N) to "buy" from "neutral" and said it had a more positive
view on the prospects for profit growth at the company's
international businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman analysts, including Steven Kron and Joseph Fischer,
also said they were more positive on the parent of the Taco
Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC chains' improving U.S. business and
overall corporate margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our upgrade reflects a longer-term view of a secular story
that we think investors should be behind, not because of the
next quarter, but because of the next couple of years," the
analysts wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts said while they were only marginally more
optimistic about the company's U.S. operations, more tangible
product platforms and greater focus on operational costs will
turn the business into a "profit grower instead of a perennial
operating drag."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yum's overseas businesses, other than China, will likely
exceed the targeted 10 percent profit growth, as greater
visibility on the company's strategies will drive sustainable
and profitable growth, Goldman analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts raised their price target on the stock to $40
from $36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum closed at
$33.34 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Surumana block in 2006 and the Mandar block in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has turned into a net importer of crude oil in
recent years as production has slumped after a failure to tap
new fields fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The country has been offering new exploration rights and

&lt;p&gt;Google Still Dominates US and Global Markets 
BOSTON, Mass. &amp; DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Bing has increased Microsoft's share of the search market by 1% in the US
according to analysis for June conducted by web analytics firm StatCounter.
Microsoft had 8.23% market share in June, behind Yahoo! at 11.04% according to
monthly analysis by StatCounter Global Stats. Google still dominates the US
market but has fallen back slightly from 79.07% in April to 78.48% in June.
(Graph: http://www.statcounter.com/images/pr/search-engine-us-apr-may-09.png )

Microsoft US market share has gone from 7.21% in April to 8.23% in June. "At
first sight, a 1% increase in market share does not appear to be a huge return
on the investment Microsoft has made in Bing but the underlying trend appears
positive," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "Steady if not spectacular
might be the best way to describe performance to date." 

Looking at weekly trends for June, Aodhan Cullen said that Microsoft (Bing, Live
Search and MSN Search in total) had peaked post launch at 9.21% in week 1st -
7th June. But after falling away in the following two weeks it had staged a
comeback in the last week in June to 8.45%. 

Microsoft market share, May/June - US
18th to 24th May: 7.41%
25th to 31st May: 9.11%
1st to 7th June: 9.21%
8th to 14th June: 7.47%
14th to 21st June: 7.6%
22nd to 28th June: 8.45% 

(Source: StatCounter Global Stats - Search Engine Market Share)

Globally Microsoft appears to be making modest headway to date going from 3.08%
in April to 3.30% in June. In the same period Yahoo! has fallen from 5.48% to
5.15% globally. Google still dominates the global market with 89.80%.

Data is based on an analysis of 1.316 billion search engine referring clicks
(336 million from the US) which were collected from the StatCounter network of
over three million websites.

&lt;p&gt;FREMONT, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
ISTS Worldwide, Inc. a global end-to-end technology consulting company focused
on the retail and payment verticals, announced today its plans to extend its
payments frameworks using the Microsoft .NET technology stack and core products,
including BizTalk Server and SQL Server. 

ISTS Worldwide is a Microsoft Managed Partner for Microsoft`s Worldwide
Financial Services and Payments group, providing end to end consulting and
outsourced application development and maintenance services. ISTS has over a
period of time built extensible frameworks around core payments which include: 

1. EFT Switching 

2. Card Issuance and Management 

3. Mobile payment 

The ISTS switching framework accepts credit, debit (including EMV), ACH and
prepaid cards. Authorization, activation, redemption, balance enquiry and other
core functionality is also provided. The switch comes with easy management and
maintenance screens and supports ISO 8583 and XML over HTTP message formats. 

The Card Issuance and Management framework is built using the Microsoft .NET
framework and has authorization, posting, printing and settlement engines and
also IVR integration capabilities for customer support. It takes advantage of
the Windows Workflow Foundation and Windows Communication Foundation to manage
running configurations and transport protocol extendibility. This platform
currently supports the prepaid instrument but is extendible to traditional
credit/debit instruments as well. 

The ISTS mobile framework allows a cell phone user to authenticate a payment
card purchase. This platform is being developed in Windows Mobile 6 and the .NET
framework. The framework provides interfaces to extend it to support bill
payment, P2Pfund transfers and fund loading for prepaid. 

"Extending our frameworks to the Microsoft stack was a logical progression for
ISTS. We are increasingly seeing a need within our large and small customers to
look for a Microsoft solution across the payment value chain. These three
solution sets address key processing components of consumer payments from
multiple retail touch points and will be a key step towards our vision of being
able to provide an uniform and extendible platform for consumer transactions -
payments as well as non-payments which are key in shaping a positive retail
experience," said Mustafa Shehabi, Sr. VP Sales &amp; Marketing at ISTS Worldwide,
Inc. 

"Now more than ever, organizations are looking to increase payment processing
efficiency to reduce costs, but deliver an enhanced payment experience to their
customers," said Colin Kerr Industry Manager, Payments &amp; Core Banking, Worldwide
Financial Services at Microsoft. "The solutions built by ISTS using the
Microsoft technology stack offer effective data management and integration
combined with a sophisticated user experience that clients expect."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc announced today the discontinuation of the SUN 1122 Phase 3 trial
that evaluated Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate) plus FOLFIRI (irinotecan plus
infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin) versus FOLFIRI alone for the
first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). The independent Data
Monitoring Committee (DMC) found that the addition of sunitinib to the
chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRI would be unable to demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival
(PFS) compared to FOLFIRI alone, in this study. No new safety issues were
identified. 

"We are disappointed with this result, but trial successes and failures are an
integral part of cancer drug development and contribute to a growing body of
knowledge on improving patient care," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice
president of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology
Business Unit. "Pfizer remains committed to developing new agents for colorectal
and other GI cancers with ongoing clinical studies evaluating other agents in
its pipeline. Investigators will be consulted about the status of sunitinib
colorectal studies other than the SUN 1122 trial. Pfizer also continues to study
sunitinib in late-stage trials as a potential treatment for various other types
of cancer." 

Pfizer has notified clinical trial investigators involved in the study and
regulatory agencies of these findings. 

These results do not affect the approved indications with sunitinib as
monotherapy, where it has played a significant role in advancing the care of
patients. Sunitinib is currently approved for both gastrointestinal stromal
tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate,
and advanced / metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on efficacy and
safety data from large, randomized Phase 3 clinical trials. To date, over 50,000
patients have been treated globally. 

Sunitinib Clinical Research Program

Pfizer Oncology is committed to exploring and delivering innovative therapies to
patients with cancer, and is continuing to study the potential role of sunitinib
in the treatment of various solid tumors including advanced non-small cell lung
cancer, advanced breast cancer, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced
hormone-refractory prostate cancer, in Phase 3 trials. 

Healthcare professionals who are interested in learning more about sunitinib
trials that are open for enrollment can visit the SUN program web site at
www.suntrials.com. Patients with questions should contact their treating
physician. 

About Colorectal Cancer (CRC)

About 630,000 deaths from CRC were estimated to occur in 2007 worldwide,
accounting for eight percent of all cancer deaths. Five-year survival rates for
patients with metastatic disease, cancer that has spread to distant parts of the
body, such as the liver, are much lower, at 11 percent. 

About Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate)

Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of GIST
after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate and advanced
RCC. 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR) are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin
discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - A California state judge ordered Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to halt a $1 billion project aimed at expanding the types of crude oils its San Francisco Bay-area refinery in Richmond, California, can process, according to court documents released on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge Barbara Zuniga sided with California environmental activists that the environmental impact report filed to obtain construction permits for a new hydrogen plant failed to depict how pollution from the refinery would be changed by the project and provide a greenhouse gas mitigation plan as required by California law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a complete victory," said Will Rostov, attorney for Earthjustice, which represented California community groups opposing the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman said the company would begin demobilizing the project and was laying off workers as it weighs its next move in consultation with the City of Richmond, California, which issued the permits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron is disappointed with the court's ruling," said company spokesman Brent Tippen.

Opponents of the project believe the hydrogen plant will allow the refinery to run heavier grades of crude oil, which contain pollutants like mercury and selenium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron began construction on the hydrogen plant along with a cogeneration unit in September. The company has said both are needed to replace outdated equipment and make the refinery more competitive in today's markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large U.S. refiners have been switching their plants to run cheaper, heavy crude oils to reduce costs and increase profits. Hydrogen is used to reduce sulfur content and increase the fuels refined from heavy crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Zuniga's order, the Richmond City Council must set aside construction permits issued for the project and cannot issue any new permits until the environmental impact report complies with California law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit to halt the project was brought by California Green organizations Communities for a Better Environment, Asian Pacific Environmental Network and West County Toxics Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The residents of Richmond do not accept letting Chevron continue to poison our community," said Tom Nompraseurt of the Asian Pacific Environmental Network in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 245,271-barrel-per-day refinery is Chevron's oldest, having operated for 107 years.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with Chevron comments, paragraphs 4-6, 8-9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Erwin Seba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, July 2 (Reuters) - A California state judge
ordered Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to halt a $1 billion project aimed
at expanding the types of crude oils its San Francisco Bay-area
refinery in Richmond, California, can process, according to
court documents released on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge Barbara Zuniga
sided with California environmental activists that the
environmental impact report filed to obtain construction
permits for a new hydrogen plant failed to depict how pollution
from the refinery would be changed by the project and provide a
greenhouse gas mitigation plan as required by California law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a complete victory," said Will Rostov, attorney for
Earthjustice, which represented California community groups
opposing the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokesman said the company would begin
demobilizing the project and was laying off workers as it
weighs its next move in consultation with the City of Richmond,
California, which issued the permits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron is disappointed with the court's ruling," said
company spokesman Brent Tippen. "Chevron believes the project
was properly analyzed and permitted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One hundred workers out of the 1,000 employed on the
project have been laid off and more will be let go in the
coming weeks, Tippen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zuniga's order provides a 60-day period for Chevron to
demobilize the project, but that work cannot include any new
construction, according to the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tippen said the community would lose between $50 million
and $75 million in workforce income along with $61 million
Chevron had agreed to donate to the city of Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richmond will also lose the improved environmental
performance the refinery would have gained from greater

Green organizations Communities for a Better Environment, Asian
Pacific Environmental Network and West County Toxics
Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The residents of Richmond do not accept letting Chevron
continue to poison our community," said Tom Nompraseurt of the
Asian Pacific Environmental Network in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 245,271-barrel-per-day refinery is Chevron's oldest,

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

SEC Approves "Say on Pay" Rule

The disclosure of the executive compensation was last approved by the SEC in
2006. That move required companies to disclose their executives' pay and perks
in greater detail, and required noting the date of stock option grants. The SEC
is now seeking to improve the reporting of stock and option awards. 

One of the reasons for the financial crisis was the executive compensation
structure that encouraged excessive risk-taking. The Obama Administration is
trying to revamp compensation policies of financial firms as a part of the
broader regulatory reforms package. 

Restrictions on executive compensation have been the main reasons behind the
repayment of TARP money by some of the major banks like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:
GS), JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM), BB (NYSE: BBT), US Bancorp (NYSE: USB) and Morgan
Stanley (NYSE: MS).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Will Dell Succeed with New Device?

According to some sources, Dell Inc. (Nasdaq: DELL) may be launching an iPod
"Touch-style" pocket-sized Mobile Internet Device (MID) sometime in the second
half of 2009. The gadget is expected to tap the Internet and will run on Google
Inc.'s (Nasdaq: GOOG) Android software. 

The device will feature a bunch of services such as music, videos, and
connectivity similar to the iPhone. It is expected to be slightly bigger than
Apple`s (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPod Touch but may not have a cellphone. The source also
commented that the production could be delayed or scrapped completely. Dell
declined to comment on any plans for future product releases. 

During March, in a conference call, Dell accepted that it plans to offer a
handheld device but did not provide any specific details. "The company was
exploring smaller-screen devices," said CEO Michael Dell. 

We believe this may not be successful, as Apple has created a niche market for
its iPhone and the entry in the music player market will be tough for Dell. We
also do not expect Dell to catch up anytime soon with competition due to its
long track record of failing new product launches (see Digital Jukebox - DJ
Ditty music player line and the Axim PDAs). Dell has struggled to keep pace with
the consumer market due to intense competitive pressure, particularly in the
low-priced desktops and notebook market. 

Dell`s products lack features desired by consumers and the retail distribution
of large competitors, such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ), Microsoft (Nasdaq:
MSFT) and Apple. Dell has been losing shares to H-P in the consumer market over
the past few years. We believe this is largely the result of more "consumer
friendly" devices and a growing retail distribution channel of H-P. Dell also
lacks the product diversity enjoyed by H-P. Also, Microsoft`s new product named
Zune HD is expected to provide strong competition to Dell due to enhanced
multimedia capabilities and an Internet browser.

&lt;p&gt;Development is Latest Achievement in Major Producing Area
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) announced today that its subsidiary Cabinda Gulf
Oil Company Limited (CABGOC) and its partners commenced crude oil production
ahead of schedule from the Mafumeira Norte project located offshore Angola. 

"Today`s milestone underscores Chevron`s commitment to growing its resource base
in West Africa and delivering on our robust queue of major capital projects,"
said George Kirkland, executive vice president, Global Upstream and Gas,
Chevron. 

Located in 160 feet (49 meters) of water about 15 miles (24 km) off the Angolan
coastline, the Mafumeira Norte project is the first phase development of the
Mafumeira Field located in Area A of Block 0. The project is being
commercialized through fourteen wells to the existing Kungulo water injection
platform and is expected to reach maximum total production of 30,000 barrels of
crude oil and 30 million cubic feet per day of natural gas in 2011. 

"Production from Mafumeira Norte is an exciting milestone for Chevron and its
partners in terms of bringing new energy supplies onto the world market and
providing benefits to Angola," said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and
Latin America Exploration and Production. 

The engineering, procurement, construction, and installation contract for the
Mafumeira Norte platform was awarded to Sonamet (Lobito), a joint venture
between Sonangol and Acergy, marking the first time Sonamet was awarded such a
contract. The fabrication of the platform was completed at Sonamet`s Lobito yard
in southern Angola. 

Chevron, through CABGOC, has a 39.2 percent interest and is the operator of the
Block 0 contractor group, which also comprises SONANGOL P (41 percent), Total
(10 percent) and ENI (9.8 percent).

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - Xstrata's unwanted approach to
rival miner Anglo American led to a late reordering of the
world's top mergers advisers in the first half, restoring Anglo
adviser Goldman Sachs to the No.1 spot above Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Lazard (LAZ.N), and UBS (UBSN.VX),
who are also advising on the suggested stock-for-stock deal,
also climbed in the final first-half league tables from Thomson
Reuters, compared to preliminary data released last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shifts highlight the impact a mandate on a single
mega-deal can have on rankings in the prestigious mergers and
acquisitions (MA) tables -- and also the continued importance
of mining deals to investment bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall the final data showed announced MA fell 40.2
percent, compared with the same period in 2008, to $941 billion,
marking the slowest first half since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomson Reuters ranks Xstrata's proposal -- which Anglo says
lacks "strategic merit" and has "totally unacceptable terms" --
as the first half's fourth-largest deal. It classifies it as a
$42.5 billion "intended" deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That helped Goldman (GS.N) regain first place for announced
mergers and acquisitions (MA) advice, which it held in the
first half of last year, as it worked on $343.1 billion of
deals. Morgan Stanley (MS.N), not an adviser on the deal,
slipped to second by deal value with $331.1 billion of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fellow Anglo (AAL.L) adviser UBS rose to 8th from 9th in the
preliminary data. Among Xstrata's XTA.L advisers, JPMorgan
(JPM.N) remained in third place, Deutsche Bank gained two places
to fourth, and Lazard rose one place to seventh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a deal is eventually struck despite Anglo's rebuff, it
could yield further mandates in MA and equity capital markets
for Xstrata's advisers, even though as a stock-for-stock deal it
would not require debt financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a letter to Anglo, Xstrata said a combined group would
"immediately be able to access equity markets to raise further
capital" and could potentially sell non-core assets or seek
joint-venture partners to raise extra liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rio Tinto's (RIO.AX) (RIO.L) long-running takeover tussle
with BHP Billiton (BLT.L) (BHP.AX), and abortive link-up with
China's Chinalco, involved a slew of banks. Seven of Rio's banks
are now working on its $15 billion rights issue, for which Rio
is paying about $430 million in fees.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange

changing its Microsoft-based (MSFT.O) trading system after
fixing a glitch that caused a seven-hour outage last September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; An LSE spokeswoman said on Thursday the company constantly

terms of speed, capacity and cost, and said last year's systems
failure was not a motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The issue with the software ... was a combination of

world's third-largest share market, was set to abandon the
Windows-based TradElect platform, which went live in June 2007
(blogs.computerworld.com).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The London Stock Exchange is facing increasingly fierce
competition from new trading platforms such as Turquoise and
Chi-X, forcing it to trim its trading fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The LSE was forced to suspend trading for about seven hours
on Sept. 8, which could have been one of the year's busiest

as LSE chief executive from Clara Furse.

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, July 2 (Reuters) - Bangladesh's state-run oil and

energy firm Chevron (CVX.N) to invest $52 million to augment
natural gas supply in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We have okayed the Chevron investment to install a gas

Muqtadir Ali, chairman of the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral

in block 15 under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and
will recover the cost from gas sales," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It will supply up to 60 million cubic feet (mmcf) of gas a
day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On recovery of cost, the compressor will be handed over to
the Gas Transmission Company Ltd (GTCL), a subsidiary of the
Petrobangla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm (Chevron), which alone supplies almost 40 percent
of total gas consumed in the country, will sign a partnership
contract with the GTCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bangladesh now suffers a daily gas shortage of up to 250
mmcf that forced at least 300 manufacturing firms in southern
Chittagong areas to halt their operations, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Serajul Islam Quadir; Editing by Anis Ahmed)

speeds, noise suppression tools, detail preservation, and multiple color
channels. The new color channel feature displays color artifacts allowing for
better overall artifact reduction and image enhancement. Topaz DeJPEG 3 also

&lt;p&gt; * Range of protest options being discussed Friday * No agreement seen on withdrawal of European envoys  BRUSSELS, July 3 (Reuters) - EU countries were studying steps to protest at Iran's crackdown on dissent on Friday, including a coordinated summoning of Tehran's ambassadors in Europe and visa bans on Iranian officials, diplomats said. There is no decision yet on either of those two options, an EU diplomat said after political directors from the 27-nation bloc met in Stockholm on Thursday.  The diplomat said Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the EU, had called his Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki earlier this week. We are taking things step by step. We are waiting for an Iranian response, the diplomat said. Further meetings of EU officials were scheduled in Stockholm and Brussels on Friday. The diplomat did not mention a separate proposal that EU nations withdraw their ambassadors from Iran and a second EU diplomat said he did not expect agreement on that on Friday. Action by Iranian security forces against demonstrators who charged the election had been rigged in favour of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has drawn Western condemnation.  Iranian authorities say the vote was fair. EU foreign ministers last week urged Iran to swiftly release several Iranian employees of Britain's Tehran embassy and a Greek journalist detained as alleged instigators of the street unrest. They also warned of a strong and collective response against intimidation of diplomatic staff.   (Reporting by David Brunnstrom and Mark John; Editing by Sophie Hares)

 (Updates with comment from lawyer, wife in paragraphs 12-13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Matthew Goldstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - Did someone try to steal
Goldman Sachs' secret sauce?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While most in the United States were celebrating the Fourth
of July holiday, a Russian immigrant living in New Jersey was
being held on federal charges of stealing secret computer
trading codes from a major New York-based financial
institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Authorities did not identify the firm, but sources say the
institution is none other than Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The charges, if proven, are significant because the codes
that the accused, Sergey Aleynikov, tried to steal are the
secret sauce to Goldman's automated stock and commodities
trading business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federal authorities contend the computer codes and
related-trading files that Aleynikov uploaded to a German-based
website help this major financial institution generate millions
of dollars in profits each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The platform is one of the things that gives Goldman an
advantage over the competition when it comes to the rapid-fire
trading of stocks and commodities. Federal authorities say the
platform quickly processes rapid developments in the markets
and using secret mathematical formulas, allows the firm to make
highly-profitable automated trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The criminal case has the potential to shed a light on the
inner workings of an important profit center for Goldman and
other Wall Street firms. The charges also raise serious
questions about the safeguards that Wall Street firms deploy to
protect these costly-to-build proprietary trading systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The criminal case began to unfold on the evening of July 3,
when Aleynikov was arrested by FBI agents at Newark Airport
after returning from Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov apparently had just started a job with another
big firm in Chicago after leaving his previous employer in New
York in early June. It appears that the financial institution
allegedly victimized by Aleynikov had alerted federal
authorities that its former employee might be up to no good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On July 4, Aleynikov was processed on a "theft of trade
secrets charge" in a criminal complaint. As of Sunday morning,
he was still being held at the Metropolitan Correction Center
in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on the incident. A
spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's Office in
Manhattan did not comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sabrina Shroff, Aleynikov's lawyer, says the facts will
bear out that her client is innocent. She's hoping he will be
released from custody soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His wife, Elina, says her husband is innocent. Speaking in
a phone interview from the couple's New Jersey home, she says
her husband worked hard for Goldman and has been a good citizen
-- noting he's lived in the United States for 19 years. She
seems mystified that federal authorities would arrest him on
the eve of a holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Federal Bureau of Investigation, in charging Aleynikov,
says he began working for the major financial institution in
May 2007 as a computer programmer and left in early June. That
matches the description of a man named Serge Aleynikov on the
social networking site LinkedIn (the difference in spelling of
the first name could not be immediately explained).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The biographical information for Aleynikov on LinkedIn says
he joined Goldman in May 2007 and was vice president for equity
strategy. The bio says he was responsible for "development of a
distributed real-time co-located high-frequency trading
platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case against Aleynikov may explain why the New York
Stock Exchange moved quickly last week to stop reporting
program stock trading for its most active firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was often at the top of the chart -- far ahead of
its competitors. It's possible Goldman had asked the NYSE to
stop reporting the number after it discovered that someone may
have infiltrated the proprietary computer codes it uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's the way the criminal complaint describes the Goldman
trading platform:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Financial Institution has devoted substantial
resources to developing and maintaining a computer platform
that allows the Financial Institution to engage in
sophisticated high-speed, and high-volume trades on various
stock and commodities markets. Among other things, the platform
is capable of quickly obtaining and processing information
regarding rapid developments in these markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federal authorities appear to believe Aleynikov may have
had help. The German website that Aleynikov is accused of
uploading the stolen information to is registered to a person
in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the case is still unfolding, there is more
information to unearth about Aleynikov. For instance, it
appears he and his wife are competitive ballroom dancers --
there are videos of them on YouTube.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many questions remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which Chicago firm hired Aleynikov? The job he took in
Chicago, according to the criminal complaint, paid nearly three
times more than his $400,000 salary at Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, there's more to learn about anyone who might have
been helping him and the fallout the case may have for Goldman.
When he was arrested, Aleynikov told the FBI he "only intended
to collect 'open source' files on which he had worked, but
later realized that he had obtained more files than he
intended."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quick, get this guy a good lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One question investors need to ask is whether this incident
will have any impact on Goldman's second-quarter earnings. The
alleged wrongdoing by Aleynikov took place at the beginning of
June -- although it's not clear if it had any material impact
on automated trading.

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds details, background) ABUJA, July 6 (Reuters) - Nigeria's main militant group said on Monday it had sabotaged one of Chevron's (CVX.N) crude oil pipeline junction points in the Niger Delta, the second attack in as many days. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said it blew up Chevron's Okan manifold late on Sunday in the southern Delta state, hours after it attacked an oil well head operated by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L). The strategic Okan manifold, which controls about 80 percent of Chevron Nigeria Limited offshore crude oil to its BOP crude loading platform, was blown up at about 2045 hours on Sunday, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said in an emailed statement. It was not immediately possible to independently verify the statement. Chevron officials were not immediately available to comment. Chevron, Shell and Italian energy firm Agip AGIP.MI have shut around 273,000 barrels per day of oil production in Nigeria since MEND launched its latest string of attacks in May.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc computer programmer accused of stealing secret trading codes from the financial firm has been released from federal custody after posting bail, authorities said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, 39, was arrested by the FBI on Friday and charged with "theft of trade secrets."

 By Martha Graybow

 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) computer programmer accused of stealing secret
trading codes from the financial firm has been released from
federal custody after posting bail, authorities said on
Monday.

Sergey Aleynikov, 39, was arrested by the FBI on Friday and
charged with "theft of trade secrets." He met the terms of his
$750,000 bail and was released Monday, said FBI spokesman James
Margolin.

 Aleynikov is accused of misusing computer codes that belong
to his former employer, a New York-based financial institution
that authorities did not identify in court papers but sources
say is Goldman Sachs. [ID:nN05180222]

 A transcript of Aleynikov's appearance before U.S.
Magistrate Kevin Nathaniel Fox in Manhattan on Saturday also
shows that Aleynikov worked for Goldman.

 His lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, said at that proceeding that
Aleynikov told authorities after his arrest that he did not
intend to sell the information or use it "contrary to my
employment agreement with Goldman Sachs."

 Goldman has not seen its business or clients harmed by the
purported computer breach, a source familiar with the situation
said on Monday. The firm declined to comment.

 The case could shed light on the workings of intricate
trading systems developed by Goldman. It also raises questions
about the security of lucrative Wall Street proprietary trading
operations.

 However, the New York Stock Exchange said on Monday there
was no connection between the alleged security breach and an
error that dropped Goldman from a trading report the NYSE
issued last week. [ID: nN06272162]

 Aleynikov, a Russian immigrant living in New Jersey, was
arrested on Friday night as he got off a flight at Newark
Liberty International Airport, according to an FBI affidavit
filed in the case.

 Aleynikov had been held at the Metropolitan Detention
Center in Brooklyn.

 Terms of his bail required a $750,000 personal recognizance
bond to be secured by three financially responsible people.

 The bail also included $75,000 in cash, and Aleynikov was
ordered to surrender his travel documents and not to access the
computer data at issue in the case.

 A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Aug. 3.

 Authorities contend Aleynikov stole codes used for
sophisticated automated stock and commodities trading. They say
Aleynikov, who earned $400,000 a year at Goldman, improperly
copied proprietary computer code and then uploaded it to a
computer server in Germany.

 After he was arrested, he told authorities he had only
intended to collect "open source" files on which he had worked
but "later realized that he had obtained more files than he
intended," the FBI agent said in the court papers.

 The FBI said Aleynikov worked at the financial institution
from May 2007 until June 5, when he left to work for a new
company focused on high-volume automated trading.

 Aleynikov's wife, Elina, told Reuters on Sunday that her
husband is innocent. She said in a phone interview from the
couple's New Jersey home that her husband worked hard for
Goldman and has been a good citizen who has lived in the United
States for 19 years.

&lt;p&gt; A former Goldman computer programmer, Sergey Aleynikov, was
arrested July 3 and held through Monday in U.S. federal court
accused of stealing secret trading codes from the New

Goldstein the bank reported the data, and was "among the top
firms in terms of program trading volume for the week ending
June 26."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYSE's Pellecchia said it was a technical, not human, error
that fumbled the Goldman data. "There was no discussion" with
Goldman on the data, Pellechia said, adding the NYSE will
re-run the report with the Goldman data later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spokesman said the Aleynikov case was in no way related
to NYSE's program trading list error, nor was it related to the
connectivity "glitch" that impacted orders and spurred the
exchange to extend trading by an extra 15 minutes on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;July 6 (Reuters) - J.P.Morgan Securities upgraded Franklin
Resources (BEN.N) and T Rowe (TROW.O), and downgraded Eaton
Vance (EV.N) and Federated (FII.N), saying it prefers equity
managers over fixed income managers due to the recent strength
in equity markets and the likely impact on future earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We realign our ratings (on asset managers) for the second
half of 2009 based on improvements in global market returns
versus domestic returns... and the eventual negative impact we
expect higher rates will have on money funds," analyst Kenneth
Worthington wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He downgraded Eaton Vance Corp and Federated Investors Inc
by a notch each to "underweight," but raised his rating on
Franklin Resources Inc to "overweight" and T Rowe Price Group
Inc to "neutral" on improved performance. He previously rated
both Franklin and T Rowe "underweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Franklin has a large international business that stands to
gain from a weaker dollar, Worthington said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, high fixed-income concentration at
Federated and the deteriorating performance at some key Eaton
Vance funds could cause both stocks to lag those of peers,
Worthington said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two also lack a meaningful international business to
help offset their exposure to fixed income markets, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, Worthington said he continues to believe the asset
management sector is investible at current valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, since we have little conviction on the direction
of the equity markets, we support a more market-neutral stance
on the traditional asset management sector with an equal number
of overweight and underweight ratings," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of T Rowe closed at $39.50 Friday on Nasdaq, while
those of Eaton Vance, Franklin and Federated closed at $25.50,
$69.74 and $23.15, respectively, on the New York Stock
Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Questions were raised about the security of proprietary trading systems at a court hearing on July 4 for a former Goldman computer programer arrested on a charge of stealing the information, which was copied to a server in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the stolen information, or trading code, is allowed to go to a competitor who can start trading with it, "the bank itself stands lose its entire investment in creating this software to begin with, which is millions upon millions of dollars," warned U.S. prosecutor Joseph Facciponte, according to a transcript of Saturday's proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that because of the way this software interfaces with the various markets and exchanges, the bank has warned it could be used to "manipulate markets in unfair ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI in New York said on Tuesday that measures had been taken to prevent code being sent from the server in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Working through our assistant legal attache in Frankfurt and with the authorities in Germany, the FBI has taken steps to ensure that the appropriated code was not distributed," FBI spokesman Jim Margolin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, 39, who left Goldman on June 5 for a Chicago firm and was arrested last Friday night, gave consent to the FBI to visit his home in Little Falls, New Jersey, over the weekend and remove all of his personal computers, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They show that Aleynikov, a father of three and a dual national of the United States and Russia, told the FBI he was cooperating because "I did not think I was doing anything wrong" when he downloaded copies to his personal computer, laptop and to a flash drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told investigators that Goldman Sachs knew he worked on the program from home and said nothing about it previously, according to the court record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov said he had no intention of selling the information or breaking his employment agreement. Aleynikov was arrested at Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey on a flight from Chicago on July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, he was released on $750,000 bail, restricted to New York and New Jersey and ordered to surrender travel documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has declined to comment on the case. A source familiar with the situation said on Monday that the bank had seen no impact on clients or business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROTECTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the transcript, Aleynikov's lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, argued in court that "the server happens to be in Germany is not known to anybody, nor was it a deliberate attempt because when you see a URL you don't know where the server is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told U.S. magistrate judge Kevin Fox that "if Goldman Sachs cannot possibly protect this kind of proprietary information that the government wants you to think is worth the entire United States market, one has to question how they plan to accommodate any other breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the market is at risk no matter what then. It's not necessarily attributable to my client's actions," Shroff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former Goldman technical employee said in an email to Reuters the issue was "a big deal" to most companies, not just Goldman, the biggest and most profitable securities firm until it became a bank last September in the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is one of the few companies that protects its data and assets. A lot of companies don't pay attention to it," said the former employee, who asked not to be identified for professional reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor Facciponte said in court that the copy on a German server could have been disseminated already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the platform was sent out on June 5, Aleynikov's last day at Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We at this time do not know who has access to it and what's going to happen to that software," Facciponte told the magistrate judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My understanding from the financial institution is that they do not believe that any steps they can take would mitigate the danger of this program being released," he told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he also said only someone with Aleynikov's user name and password could gain access to the server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday the office of the U.S. attorney in Manhattan cited the public record and declined additional comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Steve Eder and Elinor Comlay; Editing by Steve Orlofsky))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Their paths sound so similar - two Russian emigres with a talent for numbers who arrived in the United States and quickly moved into the rarefied circles of America's top investment firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Mikhail Malyshev may now regret having crossed paths with countryman Sergey Aleynikov, a computer programer he hired for his start-up firm who is now embroiled in one of the highest profile U.S. corporate espionage cases in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four days ago, federal agents charged Aleynikov, 39, with stealing trade secrets from his former employer, Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). Malyshev's company, Teza Technologies LLC, responded by suspending Aleynikov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of the case could not be worse for Malyshev, who left hedge fund Citadel Investment Group in February to set up Teza Technologies with two partners, also previously employed at Citadel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the FBI has not accused Malyshev and Teza of wrongdoing, such a controversial court case involving one of its first employees could be at the very least a distraction and embarrassment, and could turn into the biggest challenge of Malyshev's career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As news of the arrest captivates the hedge fund and banking communities, some details are emerging about how the men's careers collided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teza's spokesman Guy Chipparoni said Aleynikov was recruited through an outside headhunter, but it is unclear if there was much communication between the two men during the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. complaint against Aleynikov, he left Goldman on June 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requests to interview Malyshev were declined. Aleynikov did not return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IVY LEAGUE TO WHITE SHOE FIRMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former colleagues and a professor who taught him said Malyshev, known by the nickname Misha, is a brilliant mind who easily navigates the most theoretical areas of mathematics but can discuss finance in terms that laymen can understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was one of our very best students," said Nathaniel Fisch, director of the Program in Plasma Physics at Princeton University who supervised Malyshev's doctoral thesis in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had something extra, partly his ambitiousness and persistence and partly his flair. And he has street smarts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after leaving the Ivy League school with a PhD in astrophysics, Malyshev abandoned science for business, accepting a position at McKinsey  Co, the consulting firm often hired by governments, large companies and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, he was hired for the quantitative trading group of Chicago-based Citadel, one of the world's most aggressive hedge fund firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisch remarked on his former student's people skills, displayed when Malyshev helped organize reunions for former students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of large pension funds and Wall Street analysts have paid thousands of dollars over the years to hear Malyshev speak at industry conferences. Several said they remember him speaking comfortably about the intricacies of investing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three former colleagues, who declined to be identified for this article, remember a different side of Malyshev, calling him an imposing man who kept to himself as others socialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They remember his appearance as disheveled in a world where his colleagues wore shirts with cufflinks and crisply pressed slacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By a number of accounts, Malyshev's career was in high gear at Citadel's quantitative group, which posted a roughly 40 percent gain last year even as the firm's billionaire-founder Kenneth Griffin's flagship funds were off about 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a senior executive, Malyshev helped oversee roughly $1 billion in assets in the business unit run by James Yeh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early 2009, though, the relationship between Citadel and Malyshev crested and in February he left with a number of associates to set up Teza. Malyshev had a nine-month non-compete clause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teza has an office in Chicago, but when a reporter visited on Tuesday it was void of furniture and had no receptionist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPUTER NICHE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Aleynikov does not have the same U.S. educational pedigree as Teza's Ivy League-educated partners Malyshev, Jace Kohlmeier and Matthew Hinerfeld, he studied at the elite Moscow Institute of Transportation Engineering. But he left before earning a degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, who is married with three children, found a niche in computer programing as a teenager in Moscow, where he worked as an application programer at the Railroad Consolidated Computer Center, according to his profile on networking site LinkedIn.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was really a good student," remembered fellow student Ayrat Baykov, who is now a software developer in Michigan. The two have not spoken in about two decades but Baykov recalled Aleynikov's quiet yet inviting personality and sense of humor. "I hope he gets out of this trouble," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, who has dual citizenship in the United States and Russia, used contacts he met on the Internet to help him unravel complicated coding problems, posting messages with other programmers in online forums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He refined his computer skills over two decades, first working with hospitals and universities, and later with IDT Corp IDTc.N before moving to Goldman Sachs in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, a premier Wall Street firm that spends billions of dollars on state-of-the-art technology and talent, is an attention grabber on a resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Steve Eder; Additional reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Matthew Goldstein is a Reuters columnist. The views
expressed are his own. --&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Matthew Goldstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - Is Goldman Sachs (GS.N) really
a "vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the view of journalist Matt Taibbi in a long article
in Rolling Stone magazine. Taibbi blames the firm for almost
single-handedly orchestrating every investment calamity since
the Great Depression. And judging by much of the reaction in
the blogosphere, Taibbi's view has become the accepted meme
when talking about Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet that simple storyline, as compelling as it may be, is
far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reality is Goldman is no more of a sinner than any
other Wall Street bank. Is Goldman really any more responsible
for the inflating and the bursting of the housing bubble than
Citigroup (C.N), Merrill Lynch, Countrywide or even New Century
Financial? No single bank cornered the market on greed in the
current financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what does separate Goldman from the pack is that it
consistently plays the trading game with a far more ruthless
attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's rough-and-tumble style is on display in the case
of a former employee accused of stealing some of its secret
proprietary trading codes. According to the criminal complaint,
Goldman learned about the alleged skulduggery of its former
employee, Sergey Aleynikov, sometime in mid-June. But the firm
waited until July 1, right before the start of the Fourth of
July holiday, to notify federal authorities of the theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov's late evening arrest on July 3 forced an unusual
holiday court appearance the next day in federal court in
Manhattan. The terms of the bail were rather steep. And, of
course, the banks were closed for the next two days -- all but
insuring Aleynikov would spend a few more nights in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talk about a deterrent. You can bet that Goldman won't be
dealing with any Aleynikov copycats for quite sometime -- even
if the former programmer is ultimately found not guilty of the
charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's ruthlessness also worked to its advantage in
navigating the collapse of the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back in 2007, when Goldman started turning bearish on the
housing market, the firm began quietly to take steps to lighten
its exposure to home loans to borrowers with risky credit
histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now it's well-known that Goldman was the first of the big
Wall Street banks to play hardball with American International
Group (AIG.N), pushing the insurer in late 2007 to pay up cash
collateral on some of the guarantees it had provided on
mortgage-backed securities. What's not as well known is that
Goldman, in a move to rid itself of subprime-backed debt,
managed to peddle off some of its soon-to-become refuse on CIBC
of Canada (CM.TO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometime in 2007, Goldman sold off pieces of collateralized
debt obligations it had in its portfolio to CIBC. The CDOs were
guaranteed with credit default swaps sold by ACA Capital, a
bond insurer that begin to collapse in December 2008. ACA was
an early sign of things to come with AIG. But back when Goldman
sold the CDOs to CIBC, the deal looked solid enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When tiny ACA collapsed, however, the guarantees were
worthless and the value of the CDOs quickly plummeted. An
embarrassed CIBC, which has never said how it came to possess
the CDOs, took an initial $2.3 billion write-down and since has
taken additional write-downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From Goldman's perspective, the firm, since it clearly
harbored doubts about the securities, did the shrewd thing by
finding a buyer for them. So Goldman delivered a Trojan horse
to CIBC -- a firm with a troubled history in investment
banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is that evil? I don't think so. But it's the kind of
one-sided deal that leaves one wondering why any firm thinks
they can get the better of Goldman in a trade.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Sohu.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: SOHU) as the Bull of
the Day and Cousins Properties (NYSE:CUZ) the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells
Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) and Zions Bancorporation (Nasdaq: ZION). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Sohu.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: SOHU) is the second-largest Internet portal and one of
the most well-known online brands in China. Sohu's pipeline for its new online
games remains strong and is expected to drive meaningful growth in late 2009 and
2010. 

The company spun-off part of its gaming division Changyou.com via an ADS
offering, which is expected to increase user base and help gain shares in the
MMORPG market. We are also encouraged by the company's growing cash balance as
well as its debt free balance sheet. 

We believe that the current stock price does not fully reflect the company's
intrinsic value. Concerns are related to online ad spending, as consumers remain
cautious in their spending. We maintain our Buy rating on the shares of SOHU
with a six-month target price of $75.00. 

Bear of the Day: 

Cousins Properties (NYSE:CUZ) reported 1Q FFO of $0.15 per share, $0.10 lower
than our estimates due to higher expenses and lower top line revenue. CUZ has a
concentration of assets in Atlanta and Dallas, two markets with increasing
downtown and suburban office vacancies. 

In addition, the company's retail portfolio continues to struggle. While the
company's office portfolio performed relatively well in the 1st quarter, we
think operations will deteriorate. 

The dividend was cut 32% in an effort to conserve cash. Another cut could be
coming in 2009 if conditions do not improve.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) was appointed receiver of the
following 7 failed banks: The John Warner Bank of Clinton, First State Bank of
Winchester, Rock River Bank of Oregon, Elizabeth State Bank, Founders Bank,
First National Bank of Danville and Millennium State Bank of Texas. FDIC
arranged for other institutions to assume all the deposits and branches of the
failed banks. 

The FDIC estimates total cost to the deposit insurance fund from the failure of
these banks to be approximately $314 million. The deposit insurance fund now
stands at its lowest level since 1993 - $13 billion as of the end of March 31,
2009. 

The largest acquirers of U.S. bank failures during 2008 and 2009 include
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) (acquired Washington Mutual), Wells Fargo &amp; Company
(NYSE:WFC) (acquired Wachovia Bank) and Zions Bancorporation (Nasdaq: ZION)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - The purported theft of a
Goldman Sachs (GS.N) trading platform threatens to cost it
millions of dollars, a prosecutor told a court, but so far the
bank has not reported damage to its business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Questions were raised about the security of proprietary
trading systems at a court hearing on July 4 for a former
Goldman computer programmer arrested on a charge of stealing
the information, which was copied to a server in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the stolen information, or trading code, is allowed to
go to a competitor who can start trading with it, "the bank
itself stands lose its entire investment in creating this
software to begin with, which is millions upon millions of

to a transcript of Saturday's proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that because of the way this software interfaces
with the various markets and exchanges, the bank has warned it
could be used to "manipulate markets in unfair ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FBI in New York said on Tuesday that measures had been
taken to prevent code being sent from the server in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Working through our assistant legal attache in Frankfurt
and with the authorities in Germany, the FBI has taken steps to
ensure that the appropriated code was not distributed," FBI
spokesman Jim Margolin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sergey Aleynikov, 39, who left Goldman on June 5 for a
Chicago firm and was arrested last Friday night, gave consent
to the FBI to visit his home in Little Falls, New Jersey, over
the weekend and remove all of his personal computers, according
to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They show that Aleynikov, a father of three and a dual
national of the United States and Russia, told the FBI he was
cooperating because "I did not think I was doing anything
wrong" when he downloaded copies to his personal computer,
laptop and to a flash drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He told investigators that Goldman Sachs knew he worked on
the program from home and said nothing about it previously,
according to the court record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov said he had no intention of selling the
information or breaking his employment agreement. Aleynikov was
arrested at Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey on a flight
from Chicago on July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, he was released on $750,000 bail, restricted to
New York and New Jersey and ordered to surrender travel
documents. [ID:nN06268174]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs has declined to comment on the case. A source
familiar with the situation said on Monday that the bank had
seen no impact on clients or business. [ID:nWEN0269]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROTECTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the transcript, Aleynikov's lawyer, Sabrina
Shroff, argued in court that "the server happens to be in
Germany is not known to anybody, nor was it a deliberate
attempt because when you see a URL you don't know where the
server is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She told U.S. magistrate judge Kevin Fox that "if Goldman
Sachs cannot possibly protect this kind of proprietary
information that the government wants you to think is worth the
entire United States market, one has to question how they plan
to accommodate any other breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think the market is at risk no matter what then. It's
not necessarily attributable to my client's actions," Shroff
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A former Goldman technical employee said in an email to
Reuters the issue was "a big deal" to most companies, not just
Goldman, the biggest and most profitable securities firm until
it became a bank last September in the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman is one of the few companies that protects its data
and assets. A lot of companies don't pay attention to it,"
said the former employee, who asked not to be identified for
professional reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The prosecutor Facciponte said in court that the copy on a
German server could have been disseminated already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the platform was sent out on June 5, Aleynikov's
last day at Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We at this time do not know who has access to it and
what's going to happen to that software," Facciponte told the
magistrate judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My understanding from the financial institution is that
they do not believe that any steps they can take would mitigate
the danger of this program being released," he told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he also said only someone with Aleynikov's user name
and password could gain access to the server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday the office of the U.S. attorney in Manhattan
cited the public record and declined additional comment.

President and Chief Executive Officer Glenn Goldman Named Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur Of The</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GA, Jul 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Capital Access Network Inc. (CAN), parent company of AdvanceMe Inc., the
nation's leading provider of Merchant Cash Advances, today announced that
Glenn Goldman, President and Chief Executive Officer, received the Ernst
&amp; Young Entrepreneur Of The Year(R) 2009 Award in the Financial Services
category in Metro New York Area. According to Ernst &amp; Young LLP, the
award recognizes outstanding entrepreneurs who are building and leading
dynamic, growing businesses. Goldman was selected by an independent panel
of judges, and the award was presented at a gala event at the Marriot
Marquis, Times Square, NY on Thursday, June 25th, 2009.

    CAN is a premier provider of working capital solutions to small and
mid-sized businesses through its wholly owned subsidiaries, including
AdvanceMe Inc. Under Goldman's leadership, the company is revolutionizing
the way small businesses access working capital. AdvanceMe provides
funding to small businesses quickly and easily, employing its proprietary
risk scoring models to focus more on the strength and historical
performance of the business rather than relying on the personal records
and indicators of the business owner. AdvanceMe funds merchants by
purchasing future credit and debit card receivables at a discount. Through
arrangements with many of the nation's leading merchant processors,
AdvanceMe automatically retrieves a fixed percentage of each credit card
sale rather than fixed payment amounts. Goldman and his companies are
driving success by providing clients with the fastest, most flexible
access to working capital in a more cashflow friendly way. Small business
types served include merchants in the restaurant, hospitality, retail,
franchisees and professional service practices.

    Since its inception, AdvanceMe has provided nearly $1.5 billion in working
capital to more than 25,000 businesses across all 50 states encompassing
more than 500 industrial codes. Its customers rely on funding from
AdvanceMe to manage and build their businesses without its owners having
to pledge personal collateral or being subject to mortgage liens
associated with loans. Three out of four eligible businesses choose to do
business with AdvanceMe again.

    "We built this company on the premise that more businesses deserved
working capital, and that a different decisioning model could enable us
to empower them with capital without requiring business owners to
potentially sacrifice their homes, personal credit ratings and other
assets to access the working capital they need to keep their business on
track," said Goldman. "Small businesses are the cornerstone of this
country and will be instrumental in the improvement of our current
economy. We are dedicated to the success of this hard working group,"
continued Goldman. "Receiving this award is a testament to the effort,
passion and dedication that our team puts forth on a daily basis in the
service of our customers. I am honored to receive this prestigious award
and to share it with the wonderful group of people that make up this
company."

    The Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur Of The Year awards celebrate their 23rd
anniversary this year. The program honors entrepreneurs who have
demonstrated exceptionality in such areas as innovation, financial
performance and personal commitment to their businesses and communities.

    "We are proud to recognize the achievements of Mr. Goldman," said Jodi
Burns, Ernst &amp; Young LLP Entrepreneur Of The Year Program Director for
Metro New York. "Winners of the Entrepreneur Of The Year award build
leading businesses and contribute significantly to the strength of our
region's economy. Their success helps our area grow stronger."

    As a Metro New York award winner, Goldman is now eligible for
consideration for the Ernst &amp; Young LLP Entrepreneur Of The Year 2009
national program. Award winners in several national categories, as well
as the overall national Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur Of The Year award
winner, will be announced at the annual awards gala in Palm Springs,
California on November 14, 2009. The awards are the culminating event of
the Ernst &amp; Young Strategic Growth Forum, the nation's most prestigious
gathering of high-growth, market-leading companies.

    Sponsors

    Founded and produced by Ernst &amp; Young LLP, the Entrepreneur Of The Year
awards are pleased to have the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and SAP
America as national sponsors.

    In Metro New York, local sponsors include Platinum Sponsors HSBC, Scherzer
International and Vintage Filings, Gold Sponsor Curran &amp; Connors and
Silver Sponsors Solomon Edwards, WilmerHale and WithumSmith+Brown.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, July 7 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major ExxonMobil (XOM.N)
is looking to clinch new deals in Russia but sees the country's
subsoil law, which limits foreigners' access to strategic
fields, as the main obstacle, an executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  "We are looking for new agreements to build the
relationship between IOCs and national oil companies," Neil
Duffin, head of Exxon's project development unit, said ahead of
a meeting of U.S. and Russian businessmen with U.S. and Russian
Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We want the authorities to make amendments to the subsoil
law. We always have discussions around that. It is not easy but
hopefully we will make some breakthrough," he added.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc computer programmer accused of stealing secret trading codes from the financial firm has been released from federal custody after posting bail, authorities said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, 39, was arrested by the FBI Friday and charged with "theft of trade secrets." He met the terms of his $750,000 bail and was released Monday, said FBI spokesman James Margolin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov is accused of misusing computer codes that belong to his former employer, a New York-based financial institution that authorities did not identify in court papers but sources say is Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A transcript of Aleynikov's appearance before U.S. Magistrate Kevin Nathaniel Fox in Manhattan Saturday also shows that Aleynikov worked for Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, said at that proceeding that Aleynikov told authorities after his arrest that he did not intend to sell the information or use it "contrary to my employment agreement with Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has not seen its business or clients harmed by the purported computer breach, a source familiar with the situation said Monday. The firm declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case could shed light on the workings of intricate trading systems developed by Goldman. It also raises questions about the security of lucrative Wall Street proprietary trading operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the New York Stock Exchange said Monday there was no connection between the alleged security breach and an error that dropped Goldman from a trading report the NYSE issued last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, a Russian immigrant living in New Jersey, was arrested Friday night as he got off a flight at Newark Liberty International Airport, according to an FBI affidavit filed in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov had been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terms of his bail required a $750,000 personal recognizance bond to be secured by three financially responsible people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His bail also included $75,000 in cash, and Aleynikov was ordered to surrender his travel documents and not to access the computer data at issue in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A preliminary hearing was scheduled for August 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A "For Sale" sign stood on the lawn of Aleynikov's home on Monday night in Little Falls, New Jersey. The vacated two-story Colonial-style home, whose open mailbox had letters peeking out, was listed as "priced to sell" in an online advertisement by an area real estate agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities contend Aleynikov stole codes used for sophisticated automated stock and commodities trading. They say Aleynikov, who earned $400,000 a year at Goldman, improperly copied proprietary computer code and then uploaded it to a computer server in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he was arrested, he told authorities he had only intended to collect "open source" files on which he had worked but "later realized that he had obtained more files than he intended," the FBI agent said in the court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI said Aleynikov worked at the financial institution from May 2007 until June 5, when he left to work for a new company focused on high-volume automated trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was suspended by Teza Technologies LLC, a Chicago-based firm for which he started to work on July 2, Bloomberg cited the firm as saying in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm, which was co-founded by Misha Malyshev, a former trader at Citadel Investment Group LLC, said it first learned of the allegations on July 5 and suspended Aleynikov without pay following an investigation, according to the news agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teza offered to cooperate with the government and said it "was not aware of the alleged misconduct," according to the news agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teza could not be immediately reached by Reuters for comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's wife, Elina, told Reuters Sunday that her husband is innocent.

ordered to surrender his travel documents and not to access the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) are switching some customers who have fixed-rate credit cards to potentially higher variable rates, acting before a new law takes effect that limits what card issuers can charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. banks, which are also the largest card issuers, plan to tie more cardholders' rates to the prime rate, a benchmark that is traditionally 3 percentage points above the Federal Reserve's key lending rate, the federal funds rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Fed's target rate now in an abnormally low zero to 0.25 percent range to help lift the economy out of recession, the prime rate is 3.25 percent, a level last seen in 1955.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet when the central bank starts boosting its target rate, the prime rate should follow, boosting borrowing costs. That could help issuers absorb record amounts of customer defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Variable rates reflect Chase's changing costs for funding credit card loans," JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman Stephanie Jacobson said. "As a result, our customers may benefit from lower rates when the costs to Chase are decreased, or may experience higher rates as costs increase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America spokeswoman Betty Riess said switching to variable rates "enables us to better manage our business as market conditions change." She said the variable rates will not "at this time" result in rate changes, and that customers will see the variable rates beginning on their August statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Times earlier on Wednesday reported the changes. It said Citigroup Inc (C.N) and American Express Co (AXP.N), two other large card issuers, had no current plans to switch fixed-rate accounts to variable rates, but would not rule it out. Neither immediately returned calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, setting new restrictions on card rates and fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That law was adopted in response to anger among consumer advocates and recession-strapped cardholders at an industry they say "nickels-and-dimes" many of the 90 million card-carrying households, especially those least able to afford high costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But card companies got a break because the law does not take full effect until next February, giving them a window to change some of their policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is based in New York, and Bank of America in Charlotte, North Carolina. They are expected to report second-quarter results on July 16 and July 17, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check Point IPS Software Blade provides businesses with immediate protection
against Microsoft DirectShow Video zero-day exploit
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq:CHKP), the worldwide leader in
securing the Internet, today announced that Check Point IPS Software Blade
shields customers against drive-by attacks associated with a newly discovered
Microsoft DirectShow Video ActiveX Control vulnerability. The new attack has
already compromised thousands of Web sites, which in turn infect endpoints with
malware and expose companies to potential data leakage. Check Point IPS
customers gain immediate protection against the exploit through Check Point`s
automated IPS update services. 

The still unpatched vulnerability works as users visit or are discreetly
redirected to either a malicious Web site or a legitimate Web site that has been
infected with malicious code. The moment a user visits an infected site,
JavaScript is automatically executed to deliver malicious software unknowingly
to the user`s computer, by way of an exploit that exists in Microsoft DirectShow
video streaming software. The downloaded malicious software allows the attacker
to gain the same user rights as the local user. These rights allow the attacker
to download more malicious programs, redirect victim`s Web searches, intercept
information the user types, or steal files that reside on the victim`s computer.
This silent, unsolicited download is known as a drive-by download. 

Enterprise users at risk for this drive-by download have either the Windows 2000
or XP operating system, or Windows server 2003. Users must also have the
DirectShow Video ActiveX plug-in (msvidctl.dll), which is typically widely
distributed among Windows users. 

Check Point IPS Software Blade protects networks against attacks that leverage
the DirectShow exploit by detecting and blocking attempts to utilize specific
ActiveX components. The IPS Software Blade provides protection during delays in
a company`s patching process to always ensure the security of the network. The
protection is further strengthened by immediately available security updates,
capable of detecting specific attempts to exploit newly emerging
vulnerabilities. Check Point`s IPS Software Blade is supported by Check Point
IPS update service, which provides ongoing and real-time updates and
configuration advisories for defenses and security policies. Check Point
protections are developed and distributed by Check Point`s Security Research and
Response Centers located around the globe. Users of Check Point SmartDefense are
also protected against the new vulnerability. 

"This is a remotely exploitable vulnerability in which a hacker can infect a
computer with malicious software over the Internet and infiltrate an enterprise
network," said Oded Gonda, vice president of network security products at Check
Point. "Check Point`s innovative technology ensures that businesses have
immediate protection from these types of exploits." 

Based on the Software Blade architecture, Check Point IPS Software Blade
provides complete, integrated, next generation firewall intrusion prevention
capabilities at multi-gigabit speeds, with preemptive threat coverage for
clients, servers, OS and other vulnerabilities, malware/worm infections, and
more. The IPS Software Blade is comprised of a Multi-Tier Threat Detection
Engine that combines signatures, protocol validation, anomaly detection,
behavioral analysis, and other methods to provide the highest levels of network
IPS protection. Software Blades are independent and flexible security modules
that enable companies to select the functions they need to build a custom Check
Point Security Gateway.

&lt;p&gt;Check Point browser virtualization technology defends consumers against new
zero-day exploit
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Check Point&#174; Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq:CHKP), the worldwide leader in
securing the Internet, today announced that ZoneAlarm&#174; ForceField technology,
included in ZoneAlarm Extreme Security, protects consumers against newly
discovered drive-by attacks associated with Microsoft DirectShow Video ActiveX
Control vulnerability. The new attack has already compromised thousands of Web
sites, which in turn infect visitors with malware and expose them to potential
information theft. By placing a two-way "bubble of security" around the browser,
ZoneAlarm Extreme Security with virtualization technology, once again, stops
infected sites from being able to silently download malicious programs onto the
victim`s PC. Similarly, ZoneAlarm`s virtualization technology successfully
protects consumers against recent attacks such as Nine Ball or Gumblar. 

The still unpatched vulnerability works as users visit or are discreetly
redirected to either a malicious Web site or a legitimate Web site that has been
infected with malicious code. The moment a user visits an infected site,
JavaScript is automatically executed to deliver malicious software unknowingly
to the user`s computer, by way of an exploit that exists in Microsoft DirectShow
video streaming software. The downloaded malicious software allows the attacker
to gain the same user rights as the local user. These rights allow the attacker
to download more malicious programs, redirect victim`s Web searches, intercept
information the user types, or steal files that reside on the victim`s computer.
This silent, unsolicited download is known as a drive-by download. 

Users at risk for this drive-by download have either the Windows 2000 or XP
operating system, or Windows server 2003. Users must also have the DirectShow
Video ActiveX plug-in (msvidctl.dll), which is typically widely distributed
among Windows users. 

"Since the code for the vulnerability is available in-the-wild, meaning that
many hackers could take the code and use it to launch an attack, this
vulnerability has the likelihood to lead to widespread use in a short amount of
time," said Ben Khoushy, vice president of endpoint products for Check Point.
"Through Check Point`s virtualized browser, these types of attacks are contained
in a bubble of security the moment they surface, and often days before
anti-virus programs are able to stop the same attacks. That is why Check Point`s
ForceField technology is so critical in today`s Web-based threat environment." 

ZoneAlarm Extreme Security successfully prevents drive-by downloads from
damaging users` PCs or stealing their information through its unique
virtualization technology. This technology is able to identify any downloads
that the user doesn`t know about or invite. ForceField redirects the drive-by
download to a "sandbox" where the download remains trapped and cannot harm the
operating system. In addition, the antivirus included in ZoneAlarm Antivirus,
ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite and ZoneAlarm Extreme Security has now been
updated to detect and remove the drive-by downloads known to be emanating from
this attack, assuming consumers have the latest antivirus updates. For more

&lt;p&gt; * Google to launch free PC operating system in H2 2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Move takes direct aim at Microsoft Windows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * New Chrome OS to power PCs, from netbooks to desktops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Partners include HP, Texas Instruments, Acer, Qualcomm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Google shares rise 1.5 pct, Microsoft up 0.1 percent
 (Adds details on pricing, partners, closing share prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexei Oreskovic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUN VALLEY, Idaho, July 7 (Reuters) - Google Inc (GOOG.O)
plans to attack Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) core business by
taking on the software giant's globally dominant Windows
operating system for personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google, which already offers a suite of e-mail, Web and
other software products that compete with Microsoft, said it
would launch a new, free operating system that will initially
be targeted at netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Called the Google Chrome Operating System, the new software
will be in netbooks for consumers in the second half of 2010,
Google said in a blog post, adding that it was working with
multiple manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Netbooks are low-cost notebook PCs designed for Internet
surfing and other Web-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's been part of their culture to go after and remove
Microsoft as a major holder of technology, and this is part of
their strategy to do it," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst
at Enderle Group. "This could be very disruptive. If they can
execute, Microsoft is vulnerable to an attack like this, and
they know it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google and Microsoft have locked horns over the years in a
variety of markets, from Internet search to mobile software. It
remains to be seen if Google can take market share away from
Microsoft on its home turf, with Windows currently installed in
more than 90 percent of the world's PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Key to success will be whether Google can lock in
partnerships with PC makers, which currently offer Windows on
most of their product lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google said in a blog post on Wednesday that it is working
with a number of PC makers including Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N),
Acer (2353.TW), Lenovo (0992.HK) and Asustek (2357.TW), as well
as chipmakers Texas Instruments TXN.N and Qualcomm (QCOM.O)
to design and build Chrome devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news comes as executives from the world's biggest
technology and media companies, including Google and Microsoft,
gather in Sun Valley, Idaho for an annual conference organized
by boutique investment bank Allen  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Microsoft declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose 3 cents to close at $22.56 on the
Nasdaq. Google shares rose 1.5 percent to $402.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FAST AND LIGHTWEIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new Chrome OS is expected to work well with many of the
company's popular software applications, such as Gmail, Google
Calendar and Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will be fast and less memory-intensive, enabling users
to access the Web in a few seconds, Google said. The new
operating system is based on open-source Linux code, which
allows third-party developers to design compatible
applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The operating systems that browsers run on were designed
in an era where there was no web," Sundar Pichai, vice
president of product management at Google, said in the blog
post. The Chrome operating system is "our attempt to rethink
 what operating systems should be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google said the operating system was a new project,
separate from its Android mobile operating software found in
some smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new system is designed to work with ARM (ARM.L) and
Intel Corp's (INTC.O) x86 chip platforms, the main chip
architectures in use in the market. Microsoft has previously
said it would not support PCs running on ARM chips, allowing
Google an opportunity to infiltrate that segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charlene Li, partner at Altimeter Group, said Google's new
system could first appeal to consumers looking for a
netbook-like device for Web surfing, rather than people who use
desktop PCs for gaming or high-powered applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But eventually, the operating system has the potential to
scale up to larger, more powerful PCs, especially if it proves
to run faster than Windows, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google said the new OS would be free to use. Enderle noted
that the company's business model has been to earn revenue from
connecting applications or advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declines to say how much it charges PC brands for
Windows, but most analysts estimate about $20 for the older XP
system and at least $150 for the current Vista system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Altimeter's Li added: "A benefit to the consumer is that
the cost saving is passed on, not having to pay for an OS. It's
clearly positioned as a shot across the bow of Microsoft."

&lt;p&gt;SUN VALLEY, Idaho (Reuters) - Google Inc plans to attack Microsoft Corp's core business by taking on the software giant's globally dominant Windows operating system for personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, which already offers a suite of e-mail, Web and other software products that compete with Microsoft, said on Tuesday it would launch a new operating system that will initially be targeted at netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 1.4 percent to $22.22 in early Nasdaq trade on Wednesday. Google shares rose 1.2 percent to $401.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called the Google Chrome Operating System, the new software will be in netbooks for consumers in the second half of 2010, Google said in a blog post, adding that it was working with multiple manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netbooks are low-cost notebook PCs designed for Internet surfing and other Web-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been part of their culture to go after and remove Microsoft as a major holder of technology, and this is part of their strategy to do it," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle Group. "This could be very disruptive. If they can execute, Microsoft is vulnerable to an attack like this, and they know it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft have locked horns over the years in a variety of markets, from Internet search to mobile software. It remains to be seen if Google can take market share away from Microsoft on its home turf, with Windows currently installed in more than 90 percent of the world's PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes as executives from the world's biggest technology and media companies, including Google and Microsoft, gather in Sun Valley, Idaho for an annual conference organized by boutique investment bank Allen  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Microsoft declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to success will be whether Google can lock in partnerships with PC makers, such as Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc, which currently offer Windows on most of their product lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co , the world's largest PC brand, declined to confirm if it would sell PCs running on the new operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking into it" said HP spokeswoman Marlene Somsak, referring to the operating system. "We want to understand all the different operating systems available to customers, and will assess the impact of Chrome on the computer and communications industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's Chrome Internet browser, launched in late 2008, remains a distant fourth in the Web browser market, with a 1.2 percent share in February, according to market research firm Net Applications. Microsoft's Internet Explorer continues to dominate with nearly 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAST AND LIGHTWEIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Chrome OS is expected to work well with many of the company's popular software applications, such as Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be fast and less memory-intensive, enabling users to access the Web in a few seconds, Google said.

Acer Inc, the world's No. 3 PC brand, has already agreed to sell netbooks that run on Android to be released this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system is designed to work with ARM and x86 chips, the main chip architectures in use in the market. Microsoft has previously said it would not support PCs running on ARM chips, allowing Google an opportunity to infiltrate that segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlene Li, partner at consulting company Altimeter Group, said Google's new system could initially appeal to consumers looking for a netbook-like device for Web surfing, rather than people who use desktop PCs for gaming or high-powered applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But eventually, the Google operating system has the potential to scale up to larger, more powerful PCs, especially if it proves to run faster than Windows, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google did not say how much it would charge for the operating system (OS), but Enderle expects Google to charge at most a nominal fee or make it free, saying the company's business model has been to earn revenue from connecting applications or advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declines to say how much it charges PC brands for Windows, but most analysts estimate about $20 for the older XP system and at least $150 for the current Vista system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altimeter's Li added: "A benefit to the consumer is that the cost saving is passed on, not having to pay for an OS.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc's bid to compete with Microsoft Corp's Windows operating system may help lower the cost of personal computers at a time when prices are already being pinched by inexpensive netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google said it will offer its just-announced Chrome operating system for free when it is launched in the second half of 2010, a move that could force Microsoft into a price war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Windows is the dominant operating system -- installed on 90 percent of the world's PCs, Microsoft won't take Google's challenge lightly, analysts said. Its new Windows 7 operating system will be available in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's strategy is likely to be to compete on price," said Brent Williams, an analyst with the Benchmark Co. "Now there's a competitor with the muscle and the brand recognition. Google is that company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said Chrome OS, which is based on the open-source Linux code, is being designed for all PCs but will debut on netbooks. It makes sense for Google to initially target the stripped-down, Web-centric netbooks, one of the only segments showing any growth in a PC market that is contracting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netbooks generally sell for $300 to $400, but prices are dropping as new offerings flood the market and wireless carriers offer subsidies with the purchase of a data plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman Bros analyst Shaw Wu noted that while the prices on nearly all PC components have been falling, "the one thing that has not been coming down is the cost of the operating system. This is going to put some pressure on Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft doesn't say how much it charges PC brands for Windows, but analysts estimate it gets $20 to $40 for the older XP system used in the vast majority of netbooks, and at least $150 for the current Vista system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said price competition could ultimately give a bump to PC makers' margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think overall it should improve the profitability for PC vendors. It's really a question of how much they pass on to the customers," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REWRITING THE RULES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 20 million and 30 million netbooks are expected to be shipped this year, and the devices continue to rewrite the rules for the PC industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as heavyweights such as Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc roll out new netbooks, analysts expect new players, including Taiwan-based equipment manufacturers and carriers such as ATT Inc, to release branded netbooks running on either Intel Corp's x86 chip platform or ARM chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said Chrome will work on either architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said its Chrome team is working with PC makers including HP, Lenovo, Acer and Asustek, and chipmakers such Qualcomm and Texas Instruments to design and build devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell did not return a call seeking comment. Microsoft has not commented on Google's move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins Stewart analyst Ashok Kumar was skeptical that Chrome poses any near-term threat to Microsoft, but he expects the company to react nonetheless. "I think Microsoft will be flexible in pricing to respond to any challenge," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time I think that Linux will gain traction, and as more carriers jump on this netbook opportunity, Google might provide them a way to differentiate their platform. But this is just the first stage of a marathon," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gartner analyst Michael Silver said Google's move does present some risk to Microsoft, but he was doubtful the software giant would cut the price of Windows any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is a bit limited because what they do for one they have to do for everybody .... If they see it as a threat they'll respond. But netbooks have been shipping with Windows XP for a while and have actually been doing quite well compared with Linux, even though they're more expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gabriel Madway; Editing by Tiffany Wu and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Issuers say market conditions are changing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Changes occur before tougher card law takes full effect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N)
and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) are switching some customers
who have fixed-rate credit cards to potentially higher variable
rates, acting before a new law takes effect that limits what
card issuers can charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The largest U.S. banks, which are also the largest card
issuers, plan to tie more cardholders' rates to the prime rate,
a benchmark that is traditionally 3 percentage points above the
Federal Reserve's key lending rate, the federal funds rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the Fed's target rate now in an abnormally low zero to
0.25 percent range to help lift the economy out of recession,
the prime rate is 3.25 percent, a level last seen in 1955.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet when the central bank starts boosting its target rate,
the prime rate should follow, boosting borrowing costs. That
could help issuers absorb record amounts of customer defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Variable rates reflect Chase's changing costs for funding
credit card loans," JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman Stephanie
Jacobson said. "As a result, our customers may benefit from
lower rates when the costs to Chase are decreased, or may
experience higher rates as costs increase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America spokeswoman Betty Riess said switching to
variable rates "enables us to better manage our business as
market conditions change." She said the variable rates will not
"at this time" result in rate changes, and that customers will
see the variable rates beginning on their August statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Los Angeles Times earlier on Wednesday reported the
changes. It said Citigroup Inc (C.N) and American Express Co
(AXP.N), two other large card issuers, had no current plans to
switch fixed-rate accounts to variable rates, but would not
rule it out. Neither immediately returned calls seeking
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law the
Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act,
setting new restrictions on card rates and fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That law was adopted in response to anger among consumer
advocates and recession-strapped cardholders at an industry
they say "nickels-and-dimes" many of the 90 million
card-carrying households, especially those least able to afford
high costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But card companies got a break because the law does not
take full effect until next February, giving them a window to
change some of their policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is based in New York, and Bank of America in
Charlotte, North Carolina. They are expected to report
second-quarter results on July 16 and July 17, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Please replace the release with the following corrected version due to multiple
revisions. 

The corrected release reads: 

CHEVRON MOURNS PASSING OF FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO HAROLD J. "BILL" HAYNES

David J. O`Reilly, chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corporation
(NYSE: CVX) commentedtoday on the death of Harold J. "Bill" Haynes, the
company`s former chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Haynes, 83,
passed away today. 

"Bill drove tremendous growth in the company and solidified its preeminent
position in the industry by the time of his retirement," said O`Reilly. "He left
an indelible mark on our company, and our industry, by encouraging open dialogue
and challenging conventional thinking. He ushered in a new era of communication
between the industry, public and news media on energy issues that was truly
trendsetting. I speak for our board of directors and employees in saying we are
deeply saddened by his passing." 

Haynes joined Standard Oil Company of California (later to become Chevron
Corporation) in 1947. Early in his career, he was identified as a promising
executive and rose rapidly through the ranks. In 1956, he was named chief
engineer of the company`s producing affiliate in Venezuela; in 1958, he became
vice president of that operation. In 1962, he was named vice president of
Standard`s largest subsidiary, which was also one of the largest companies in
the United States. Haynes was elected to the board of directors in 1966 and was
elected president of the company in 1969. He assumed the post of board chairman
in 1974 and retired in 1981. 

A native of Fort Worth, Texas, Haynes graduated as a civil engineer from Texas
A University in 1947 after serving with the U.S. Navy in World War II. He
received Texas A's Distinguished Alumni Award in 1972, the university's first
Geosciences and Earth Resources Medal for Distinguished Achievement in 1978, the
Distinguished Graduate award from the Department of Civil Engineering in 2000,
and the university's Dwight Look College of Engineering Outstanding Alumni Honor
Award in 2004. 

Haynes served as chairman of Bechtel's board of counselors and as a director of
Bechtel Group, Inc. He was also a director of Fremont Group, a private
investment company. Past directorships included Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi
Aramco), Citicorp-Citibank, Hewlett-Packard, The Boeing Company, Weyerhaeuser
and PACCAR Inc. He also served as a member of the Business Council. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Microsoft could cut prices to respond to Google-analysts &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Google's move could help margins at PC vendors &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Gabriel Madway &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SAN FRANCISCO, July 8 (Reuters) - Google Inc's (GOOG.O) bid to compete with Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Windows operating system may help lower the cost of personal computers at a time when prices are already being pinched by inexpensive netbooks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts expect Google to offer its just-announced Chrome Operating System for a small fee or for free when it is launched in the second half of 2010, a move that could force Microsoft into a price war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Although Windows is the dominant operating system -- installed on 90 percent of the world's PCs, Microsoft won't take Google's challenge lightly, analysts said. Its new Windows 7 operating system will be available in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft's strategy is likely to be to compete on price," said Brent Williams, an analyst with the Benchmark Co. "Now there's a competitor with the muscle and the brand recognition. Google is that company." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Google said Chrome OS, which is based on the open-source Linux code, is being designed for all PCs but will debut on netbooks. It makes sense for Google to initially target the stripped-down, Web-centric netbooks, one of the only segments showing any growth in a PC market that is contracting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Netbooks generally sell for $300 to $400, but prices are dropping as new offerings flood the market and wireless carriers offer subsidies with the purchase of a data plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Kaufman Bros analyst Shaw Wu noted that while the prices on nearly all PC components have been falling, "the one thing that has not been coming down is the cost of the operating system. This is going to put some pressure on Microsoft." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft doesn't say how much it charges PC brands for Windows, but analysts estimate it gets $20 to $40 for the older XP system used in the vast majority of netbooks, and at least $150 for the current Vista system.  Wu said price competition could ultimately give a bump to PC makers' margins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I think overall it should improve the profitability for PC vendors. It's really a question of how much they pass on to the customers," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    REWRITING THE RULES &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Between 20 million and 30 million netbooks are expected to be shipped this year, and the devices continue to rewrite the rules for the PC industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Even as heavyweights such as Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Dell Inc DELL.O roll out new netbooks, analysts expect new players, including Taiwan-based equipment manufacturers and carriers such as AT Inc (T.N), to release branded netbooks running on either Intel Corp's (INTC.O) x86 chip platform or ARM (ARM.L) chips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Google said Chrome will work on either architecture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    HP said it is studying the Chrome operating system. Dell did not return a call seeking comment. Microsoft has not commented on Google's move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Collins Stewart analyst Ashok Kumar was skeptical that Chrome poses any near-term threat to Microsoft, but he expects the company to react nonetheless. "I think Microsoft will be flexible in pricing to respond to any challenge," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Over time I think that Linux will gain traction, and as more carriers jump on this netbook opportunity, Google might provide them a way to differentiate their platform. But this is just the first stage of a marathon," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Gartner analyst Michael Silver said Google's move does present some risk to Microsoft, but he was doubtful the software giant would cut the price of Windows any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft is a bit limited because what they do for one they have to do for everybody .... If they see it as a threat they'll respond. But netbooks have been shipping with Windows XP for a while and have actually been doing quite well compared with Linux, even though they're more expensive." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Gabriel Madway; Editing by Tiffany Wu and Richard Chang) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((gabriel.madway@thomsonreuters.com; +1 415 677 2536)) Keywords: GOOGLE/PCS  Keywords: GOOGLE/PCS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
David J. O`Reilly, chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corporation
(NYSE: CVX) commentedtoday on the death of Harold J. "Bill" Haynes, the
company`s former chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Haynes was
83 years. 

"Bill drove tremendous growth in the company and solidified its preeminent
position in the industry by the time of his retirement," said O`Reilly. "He left
an indelible mark on our company, and our industry, by encouraging open dialogue
and challenging conventional thinking. He ushered in a new era of communication
between the industry, public and news media on energy issues that was truly
trendsetting. I speak for our board of directors and employees in saying we are
deeply saddened by his passing." 

Haynes joined Standard Oil Company of California (later to become Chevron
Corporation) in 1947. Early in his career, he was identified as a promising
executive and rose rapidly through the ranks. In 1956, he was named chief
engineer of the company`s producing affiliate in Venezuela; in 1958, he became
vice president of that operation. In 1962, he was named vice president of
Standard`s largest subsidiary, which was also one of the largest companies in
the United States. Haynes was elected to the board of directors in 1966 and was
elected president of the company in 1969. He assumed the post of board chairman
in 1974 and retired in 1981. 

A native of Fort Worth, Texas, Haynes graduated as a civil engineer from Texas
A University in 1947 after serving with the U.S. Navy in World War II. He
received Texas A's Distinguished Alumni Award in 1972, the university's first
Geosciences and Earth Resources Medal for Distinguished Achievement in 1978, the
Distinguished Graduate award from the Department of Civil Engineering in 2000,
and the university's Dwight Look College of Engineering Outstanding Alumni Honor
Award in 2004. 

Haynes served as chairman of Bechtel's board of counselors and as a director of
Bechtel Group, Inc. He was also a director of Fremont Group, a private
investment company. Past directorships included Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi
Aramco), Citicorp-Citibank, Hewlett Packard, The Boeing Company, The Rand
Corporation, Weyerhaeuser and PACCAR Inc. He also served as a member of the
Business Council. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides

including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp.,
series 2004-C3, commercial mortgage pass-through certificates as follows: 

--$15.2 million class F to 'BBB' from 'A-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$18.9 million class G to 'BBB-' from 'BBB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$15.2 million class H to 'BB' from 'BBB'; Outlook Negative; 

--$20.9 million class J to 'BB-' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$7.6 million class K to 'B' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$5.7 million class L to 'B-' from 'BB'; Outlook Negative. 

In addition, Fitch downgrades and assigns Recovery Ratings (RRs) to the
following classes: 

--$9.5 million class M to 'CCC/RR1' from 'BB-'; 

--$3.8 million class N to 'CC/RR1' from 'B+'; 

--$5.7 million class P to 'C/RR6' from 'B'; 

--$5.7 million class Q to 'C/RR6' from 'B-'. 

Fitch affirms the following classes: 

--$3.9 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$156.7 million class A-1A at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$154.7 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$235.8 million class A-3 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$166.1 million class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$421.4 million class A-5 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$87.2 million class A-J at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$43.6 million class B at 'AA'; Outlook Negative; 

--$13.3 million class C at 'AA-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$13.3 million class D at 'A+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$15.2 million class E at 'A'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch does not rate the $21.7 million class NR. 

The downgrades are the result of additional specially serviced loans and
increased Fitch loss expectations since Fitch's last rating action. Fitch
assumed losses for all of the specially serviced loans which resulted in
significantly lower credit enhancement. As loans have recently transferred to
special servicing, Fitch's loss estimates may be adjusted as additional
information on the resolution of the loans becomes available. Rating Outlooks
reflect the likely direction of any rating changes over the next one to two
years. The Negative Rating Outlooks reflect the high percentage of Fitch Loans
of Concern and the potential for increased loss estimates. As of the June 2009
distribution date, the pool has paid down 5% to $1.44 billion from $1.51 billion
at issuance. Ten loans (13.6%) have defeased including the largest loan in the
deal (6.9%). Seven non-defeased loans (4.4%) are scheduled to mature within the
next two years. 

Fitch has identified 32 Loans of Concern (27.4%), including seven specially
serviced loans (7.1%). The largest specially serviced loan (4.1%) is secured by
a portfolio of eight industrial/flex properties located in the greater Boston
metropolitan statistical area. The loan recently transferred to special
servicing due to imminent default resulting from several factors which include
an outstanding lawsuit from the leasing broker, issues with the majority owner's
liquidity to keep the loan current, and upcoming loan maturity in January 2010
and ability to refinance. The loan is current. 

The second largest specially serviced loan (1.5%) is secured by a multifamily
property located in San Antonio, TX and is currently 90 days delinquent. The
loan has been in special servicing since December 2007 when the borrower MBS Co.
filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. A plan of reorganization was filed which
contemplates the sale of the property subject to an assumption of the loan. The
property is under contract for sale, subject to court approval. The loan will be
assumed and modified. 

The third largest specially serviced loan (0.5%) is secured by a 67,141 square
feet retail property, consisting of three tenants, located in Wichita Falls, TX
and renovated in 2003. The loan was transferred to special servicing in April
2009 due to the bankruptcy filing of the largest tenant, Linens N Things. At
origination the spaces were leased to Linens N Things, Ross, and Shoe Carnival.
After Linens N Things vacated, vacancy fell to 55.5%. The borrower requested a
loan modification. The borrower has a draft lease out to TJ Maxx for the former
Linens N Things space. The loan is current. 

Significant losses are expected upon liquidation of the specially serviced
assets which will deplete the non-rated class and impact classes P and Q. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance
and other relevant policies and procedures are also available from the 'Code of
Conduct' section of this site.

&lt;p&gt; * Starts 60-day consultation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Proposals affect quarter of 20,000 UK workforce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) said on Wednesday it
planned to close its final salary pension scheme in the UK in
order to become more competitive and make long-term pension
costs more predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IT giant said it had started a 60-day consultation with
about 5,000 members of its final salary scheme, representing a
quarter of its staff in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(The) proposals include enhancements to the defined
contribution plan for all IBM UK employees and closure of the
defined benefit plans for existing members," the company said in
a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past five years, higher costs have accelerated the
trend of UK corporates closing down their final salary pension
schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, oil major BP Plc (BP.L) said it would close its
final salary scheme for new UK employees joining the company
after April 2010, while Barclays (BARC.L) said it planned to
curtail its final salary scheme for British staff in favour of a
cheaper arrangement.[ID:nL31032549] [ID:nL2297338]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said that defined benefits accrued to date would be
protected.

&lt;p&gt; * Google to launch PC operating system in second half 2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Move takes direct aim at Microsoft Windows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * New OS to power PCs ranging from netbooks to desktops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft shares down 1.4 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Google shares up 1. 2 pct
 (Adds share prices in fourth paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexei Oreskovic and Edwin Chan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUN VALLEY, Idaho, July 7 (Reuters) - Google Inc (GOOG.O)
plans to attack Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) core business by
taking on the software giant's globally dominant Windows
operating system for personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google, which already offers a suite of e-mail, Web and
other software products that compete with Microsoft, said on
Tuesday it would launch a new operating system that will
initially be targeted at netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Microsoft shares fell 1.4 percent to $22.22 in early
Nasdaq trade on Wednesday. Google shares rose 1.2 percent to
$401.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Called the Google Chrome Operating System, the new software
will be in netbooks for consumers in the second half of 2010,
Google said in a blog post, adding that it was working with
multiple manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Netbooks are low-cost notebook PCs designed for Internet
surfing and other Web-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's been part of their culture to go after and remove
Microsoft as a major holder of technology, and this is part of
their strategy to do it," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst
at Enderle Group. "This could be very disruptive. If they can
execute, Microsoft is vulnerable to an attack like this, and
they know it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google and Microsoft have locked horns over the years in a
variety of markets, from Internet search to mobile software. It
remains to be seen if Google can take market share away from
Microsoft on its home turf, with Windows currently installed in
more than 90 percent of the world's PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news comes as executives from the world's biggest
technology and media companies, including Google and Microsoft,
gather in Sun Valley, Idaho for an annual conference organized
by boutique investment bank Allen  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Microsoft declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Key to success will be whether Google can lock in
partnerships with PC makers, such as Hewlett-Packard Co and
Dell Inc, which currently offer Windows on most of their
product lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) , the world's largest PC brand,
declined to confirm if it would sell PCs running on the new
operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are looking into it" said HP spokeswoman Marlene
Somsak, referring to the operating system. "We want to
understand all the different operating systems available to
customers, and will assess the impact of Chrome on the computer
and communications industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google's Chrome Internet browser, launched in late 2008,
remains a distant fourth in the Web browser market, with a 1.2
percent share in February, according to market research firm
Net Applications. Microsoft's Internet Explorer continues to
dominate with nearly 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FAST AND LIGHTWEIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new Chrome OS is expected to work well with many of the
company's popular software applications, such as Gmail, Google
Calendar and Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will be fast and less memory-intensive, enabling users
to access the Web in a few seconds, Google said. The new
operating system is based on open-source Linux code, which
allows third-party developers to design compatible
applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The operating systems that browsers run on were designed
in an era where there was no web," Sundar Pichai, vice
president of product management at Google, said in the blog
post. The Chrome operating system is "our attempt to rethink
 what operating systems should be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google said the operating system was a new project,
separate from its Android mobile operating software found in
some smartphones. Acer Inc, the world's No. 3 PC brand, has
already agreed to sell netbooks that run on Android to be
released this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new system is designed to work with ARM and x86 chips,
the main chip architectures in use in the market. Microsoft has
previously said it would not support PCs running on ARM chips,
allowing Google an opportunity to infiltrate that segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charlene Li, partner at consulting company Altimeter Group,
said Google's new system could initially appeal to consumers
looking for a netbook-like device for Web surfing, rather than
people who use desktop PCs for gaming or high-powered
applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But eventually, the Google operating system has the
potential to scale up to larger, more powerful PCs, especially
if it proves to run faster than Windows, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google did not say how much it would charge for the
operating system (OS), but Enderle expects Google to charge at
most a nominal fee or make it free, saying the company's
business model has been to earn revenue from connecting
applications or advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declines to say how much it charges PC brands for
Windows, but most analysts estimate about $20 for the older XP
system and at least $150 for the current Vista system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Altimeter's Li added: "A benefit to the consumer is that
the cost saving is passed on, not having to pay for an OS. It's
clearly positioned as a shot across the bow of Microsoft."

&lt;p&gt; * Banks net $304 mln from additional stake sales&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Gains to impact third-quarter earnings, banks say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * VisaNet IPO was world's largest in past 12 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Guillermo Parra-Bernal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAO PAULO, July 8 (Reuters) - Brazilian banks Bradesco and
Banco do Brasil said they would book pretax profits totaling
610 million reais ($304 million) from additional stake sales in
VisaNet, days after the credit card operator's record-setting
initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bradesco (BBDC4.SA)(BBD.N), Brazil's second-largest private
sector bank, said it would book a pretax gain of 410 million
reais from the sale of a 2.2 percent stake in VisaNet
VNET3.SA. The gain will affect third-quarter earnings
results, the Osasco, Brazil-based bank said in a regulatory
filing on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA), Brazil's largest
state-controlled bank, will book a pretax gain of 200 million
reais from the sale of an undisclosed stake in VisaNet, the
Brasilia-based bank said in a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Easing global credit conditions and hopes for a recovery in
the economies of major developed countries fueled risk-taking
among foreign and local investors participating in the VisaNet
IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders raised 8.4 billion reais from the offering
last month, the largest IPO ever in Brazil and the world's
biggest in the past 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters
data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bradesco and Banco do Brasil announced on June 30 they
would use part of the initial IPO proceeds of 3.4 billion reais
to boost provisions for bad loans. Loan delinquencies in May
rose to their highest level since September 2000 as the
Brazilian economy fell into recession.

&lt;p&gt;MANCHESTER, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
The Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee has urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate the
computer trading program of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that, according to a
federal prosecutor, the bank acknowledges can be used to manipulate markets. 

GATA's complaint to the two commissions refers to a July 6 Bloomberg News story
-- http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087=a_6d.tyNe1KQ -- reporting
the arraignment in U.S. District Court in New York of a former Goldman Sachs
employee accused of stealing the program. The prosecutor, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Joseph Facciponti, was quoted as telling the court: "The bank has
raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use
this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways." 

In its letters to the SEC and CFTC, GATA wrote: "The assistant U.S. attorney's
comment can be construed to suggest Goldman Sachs considers its own manipulation
of markets to be fair, while such manipulation by others would be unfair. The
court proceeding described in the Bloomberg News story would seem to impugn all
markets in which Goldman Sachs trades." 

GATA asked each commission "to investigate Goldman Sachs' trading program
urgently and report its findings publicly." 

GATA is an educational and civil rights organization that seeks to restore free
markets to the precious metals.

Dear Chairman Gensler / Dear Chairman Schapiro: 

I'm enclosing a copy of a report distributed July 6 by Bloomberg News Service
about the U.S. government's prosecution of a former employee of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. involving the purported theft of a Goldman Sachs computer trading
program. The report quotes Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti as saying
in U.S. District Court in New York City: "The bank has raised the possibility
that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use
it to manipulate markets in unfair ways." 

If the report quotes the assistant U.S. attorney correctly, and if he was
characterizing Goldman Sachs' position correctly, then Goldman Sachs claims to
have possession of a computer trading program that can manipulate markets. The
assistant U.S. attorney's comment can be construed to suggest Goldman Sachs
considers its own manipulation of markets to be fair, while such manipulation by
others would be unfair. 

The court proceeding described in the Bloomberg News story would seem to impugn
all markets in which Goldman Sachs trades. On behalf of the Gold Anti-Trust
Action Committee Inc., I ask your commission to investigate Goldman Sachs'
trading program urgently and report its findings publicly. 

Thanks for your consideration. 

With good wishes.

&lt;p&gt;  MONTREAL, Jul 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Superclick, Inc. (OTCBB: SPCK), a technology leader in IP infrastructure
management solutions to the hospitality industry announced that it has
certified its market leading SIMS platform solution for hotels on IBM's
BladeCenter HS22.

    Sandro Natale, CEO of Superclick, said, "Our focus continues to be on
delivering a higher performing, more efficient, and simplified IP
infrastructure management solution to our hotel customers. IBM's
BladeCenter HS22, which is a blade-based server for highly converged
networks is a natural fit for us, given the increasing complexity of the
data center environment in the hotel. The BladeCenter offers hotels
several advantages, including better rack space utilization, energy
savings, better redundancy and it allows for faster support response
times. In addition, it will allow Superclick to better service larger
hotels with a more robust and reliable solution."

    Reducing Energy Costs

    According to a recent white paper from the Robert Frances Group, the total
power generated by individual computer platforms has grown by more than
100 watts and with system power consumption increases to more than 300
watts per server.

    Natale said, "The BladeCenter enables multiple applications that used to
reside on separate services to be centralized onto one unit. The blades
can share storage, network and other functionality so that the server
requires less energy to run."

    Energy Saving Features


--  Low-voltage processors use less energy and produce less waste heat
    than higher-voltage processors, thereby reducing data center energy costs
--  Optional solid state drives use only 2W of energy per drive, vs. 9-10W
    for 2.5 inch HDDs. This is as much as 80% less energy than a HDD would use
--  The high degree of integration can greatly reduce the amount of power
    consumed and heat produced, relative to an equivalent number of 1U servers.
    This can greatly reduce date center energy costs.
--  Most industry standard servers use power suppliers that are between 70-
    75% efficient at converting power from AC wall current to the DC power used
    inside servers. BladeCenter power modules are up to 92% efficient, helping
    to save more money.
    

    
"In the current economic environment, our hotel customers are looking
for increasing ways to reduce costs and reducing energy consumption is a
fundamental way to do this," commented Natale.

capabilities that allow for communications virtually anytime, anywhere, on

&lt;p&gt;Brings Corporations and Law Firms Greater In-house Control over Electronic
Evidence Projects
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Navigant Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:NCI), a global consulting firm providing
dispute, investigative, operational, risk management and financial advisory
solutions, announced today the launch of its advanced eDiscovery portal built
upon Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. Navigant Consulting`s new tool was
developed in response to a growing demand among corporations and law firms for
better processes around internal documentation. The portal provides
organizations with greater access and control over the activities that occur
during an eDiscovery project, including compliance, archiving, search,
collection and pre-review. 

"According to Gartner research, and based on feedback from many of our clients,
companies are increasingly looking to insource portions of their eDiscovery in
an effort to reduce litigation costs," said Julie Howard, President and Chief
Operating Officer, Navigant Consulting. "Our firm can attest to this growing
trend as we have built our own in-house eDiscovery solution to use our
e-Discovery portal and have successfully assisted clients in implementing this
tool to better manage their eDiscovery matters." 

Navigant Consulting`s eDiscovery portal enables clients to manage the end-to-end
eDiscovery process through Office SharePoint Server 2007. The technology
features automated legal hold noticing as well as a workflow for managing
eDiscovery activities under one central location. Navigant Consulting`s portal
allows integration with multiple litigation technologies and provides a set of
eDiscovery compliance tools necessary for effective electronic records
management. 

"Office SharePoint Server 2007 is a terrific platform for the kind of workflow
that eDiscovery projects generate," said Richard Finkelman, Managing Director
and leader of Navigant Consulting`s Discovery Services practice. "The tool is
extremely dynamic and allows companies who are insourcing solutions in stages to
properly preserve both legacy information and information from newer systems." 

"We are delighted to work with a consulting firm that has such comprehensive
knowledge of the eDiscovery business and is helping clients to migrate their
existing eDiscovery functions to more current architectures," said Brian Zeve,
U.S. professional services managing director, Microsoft Corp. "Office SharePoint
Server 2007 is one of the fastest growing products in Microsoft`s history and we
think more companies and industries will be able to meet their compliance
obligations with advanced tools like Navigant`s eDiscovery portal."

&lt;p&gt;RADVISION Further Distinguishes Itself by Earning Microsoft Competencies in Both
Networking Infrastructure and ISV/Software Solutions
TEL AVIV, Israel--(Business Wire)--
RADVISION Ltd. (Nasdaq: RVSN), a leading provider of video network
infrastructure and developer tools for unified visual communications over IP, 3G
and emerging next-generation IMS networks, today announced it has attained Gold
Certified Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program with competencies in
both Networking Infrastructure and ISV/Software Solutions, recognizing
RADVISION`s expertise and impact in the technology marketplace. As a Gold
Certified Partner, RADVISION has demonstrated expertise with Microsoft
technologies and a proven ability to meet customers` needs. Microsoft Gold
Certified Partners receive a rich set of benefits, including access, training
and support, giving them a competitive advantage in the channel. 

"We are extremely pleased to have attained Gold Certified Partner status in the
Microsoft Partner Program for the fourth year running. This allows us to clearly
promote our expertise and relationship with Microsoft to our customers," said
Bob Romano, VP Enterprise Marketing of RADVISION. "The benefits provided through
our Gold Certified Partner status will allow us to continue to enhance the
offerings that we provide for customers." 

"Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap between
their business demands and technology capabilities," said Allison Watson,
corporate vice president of the Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "They
need to trust in a company that can act as an expert adviser for their long-term
strategic technology plans. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners, which have
certified expertise and direct training and support from Microsoft, can build a
positive customer experience with our technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes
RADVISION as a Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its expertise in
providing customer satisfaction using Microsoft products and technology." 

As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status,
RADVISIONhad to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft Competencies are
designed to help differentiate a partner`s capabilities with specific Microsoft
technologies to customers looking for a particular type of solution. Each
Competency has a unique set of requirements and benefits, formulated to
accurately represent the specific skills and services that partners bring to the
technology industry. Within select Competencies, there are Specializations that
focus on specific solution areas that recognize deeper expertise within that
Competency. Serving as a specialized path to earning those Competencies,
Specializations give direct access to the tools and resources that support that
specific area of focus. 

Microsoft partners enrolled in the Networking Infrastructure Solutions
Competency have proven their proficiency in implementing solutions based on
Microsoft`s Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008 Operating Systems, or
Windows Small Business Server 2008 and Essential Business Server 2008. These
implementations may include crafting solutions that connect Windows-based
servers, PC locations and the Internet; installing a server farm; or building a
small-business Windows Server stand-alone solution that includes file and print
capabilities. 

"We place tremendous value on our partners, which help us deliver solutions and
applications to customers," said Ward Ralston, group product manager for Windows
Server at Microsoft Corp. "Solutions competencies provide an integrated
partnering framework that recognizes an enterprise`s expertise and rewards it
for the effect it has in the technology marketplace. It also allows companies to
demonstrate for customers their broad knowledge of building wide-ranging
solutions based on Microsoft technologies, such as setting up networks using
Windows Server 2008 and the Windows Essential Server Solutions product line." 

The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and focus partners
bring to a particular solution set. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners that have
obtained this competency have a successful record of developing and marketing
packed software based on Microsoft technologies. 

"Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to better enable ISVs
to meet customer needs," said Walid Abu-Hadba, corporate vice president of the
Developer and Platform Evangelism Group at Microsoft Corp. "They allow ISVs to
keep and win customers through their deep knowledge of solutions-based Microsoft
platform technologies. Microsoft has a long history of working closely with ISV
partners to help them deliver compelling solutions and applications to our
mutual customers, and the Microsoft Competencies are an important step in
continuing to enhance vital relationships with ISVs worldwide." 

The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and represents
Microsoft`s ongoing commitment to the success of partners worldwide. The program
offers a single, integrated partnering framework that recognizes partner
expertise, rewards the total impact that partners have in the technology
marketplace, and delivers more value to help partners` businesses be successful.

FAIRFAX, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Penske Racing driver Sam Hornish Jr. will drive a special No. 77 Mobil 1
Advanced Fuel Economy Dodge in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series LifeLock.com 400 at
Chicagoland Speedway on July 11 to help make consumers aware of the best ways to

Before this unique version of the No. 77 car takes to the track, the weekend
will kick off with The Mobil 1 Advanced Fuel Economy NASCAR Challenge, a special
event to entertain Chicago sports fans and provide them with tips on saving
fuel. 

The Mobil 1 Advanced Fuel Economy NASCAR Challenge will take place on July 10 at
Soldier Field in downtown Chicago. Penske NASCAR stars Sam Hornish Jr., Kurt

Chicago Bear Hall of Famer Dan Hampton - will drive fuel-efficient Mobil
1-branded Smart cars on a miniature road course. 

"One tip I`ll be sharing that weekend--using Mobil 1 Advanced Fuel economy can
deliver up to a 2 percent* fuel economy improvement, which, over the life of a
vehicle, can save over $400* in fuel costs," said Sam Hornish Jr., driver of the
No. 77 Dodge. 

The event will also highlight a retail promotion in which consumers can receive
a $10 rebate when they buy five one-quart bottles or one five-quart jug of Mobil

Technologies LLC, responded by suspending Aleynikov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The timing of the case could not be worse for Malyshev, who
left hedge fund Citadel Investment Group in February to set up
Teza Technologies with two partners, also previously employed
at Citadel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the FBI has not accused Malyshev and Teza of
wrongdoing, such a controversial court case involving one of
its first employees could be at the very least a distraction
and embarrassment, and could turn into the biggest challenge of
Malyshev's career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As news of the arrest captivates the hedge fund and banking
communities, some details are emerging about how the men's
careers collided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teza's spokesman Guy Chipparoni said Aleynikov was
recruited through an outside headhunter, but it is unclear if
there was much communication between the two men during the
hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the U.S. complaint against Aleynikov, he left
Goldman on June 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Requests to interview Malyshev were declined. Aleynikov did
not return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IVY LEAGUE TO WHITE SHOE FIRMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former colleagues and a professor who taught him said
Malyshev, known by the nickname Misha, is a brilliant mind who
easily navigates the most theoretical areas of mathematics but
can discuss finance in terms that laymen can understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He was one of our very best students," said Nathaniel
Fisch, director of the Program in Plasma Physics at Princeton
University who supervised Malyshev's doctoral thesis in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He had something extra, partly his ambitiousness and
persistence and partly his flair. And he has street smarts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shortly after leaving the Ivy League school with a PhD in
astrophysics, Malyshev abandoned science for business,
accepting a position at McKinsey  Co, the consulting firm
often hired by governments, large companies and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2003, he was hired for the quantitative trading group of
Chicago-based Citadel, one of the world's most aggressive hedge
fund firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fisch remarked on his former student's people skills,
displayed when Malyshev helped organize reunions for former
students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hundreds of large pension funds and Wall Street analysts
have paid thousands of dollars over the years to hear Malyshev
speak at industry conferences. Several said they remember him
speaking comfortably about the intricacies of investing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three former colleagues, who declined to be identified for
this article, remember a different side of Malyshev, calling
him an imposing man who kept to himself as others socialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They remember his appearance as disheveled in a world where
his colleagues wore shirts with cufflinks and crisply pressed
slacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By a number of accounts, Malyshev's career was in high gear
at Citadel's quantitative group, which posted a roughly 40
percent gain last year even as the firm's billionaire-founder
Kenneth Griffin's flagship funds were off about 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a senior executive, Malyshev helped oversee roughly $1
billion in assets in the business unit run by James Yeh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By early 2009, though, the relationship between Citadel and
Malyshev crested and in February he left with a number of
associates to set up Teza. Malyshev had a nine-month
non-compete clause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teza has an office in Chicago, but when a reporter visited
on Tuesday it was void of furniture and had no receptionist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COMPUTER NICHE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Aleynikov does not have the same U.S. educational
pedigree as Teza's Ivy League-educated partners Malyshev, Jace
Kohlmeier and Matthew Hinerfeld, he studied at the elite Moscow
Institute of Transportation Engineering. But he left before
earning a degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov, who is married with three children, found a
niche in computer programming as a teenager in Moscow, where he
worked as an application programmer at the Railroad
Consolidated Computer Center, according to his profile on
networking site LinkedIn.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He was really a good student," remembered fellow
student Ayrat Baykov, who is now a software developer in
Michigan. The two have not spoken in about two decades but
Baykov recalled Aleynikov's quiet yet inviting personality and
sense of humor. "I hope he gets out of this trouble," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov, who has dual citizenship in the United States
and Russia, used contacts he met on the Internet to help him
unravel complicated coding problems, posting messages with
other programmers in online forums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He refined his computer skills over two decades, first
working with hospitals and universities, and later with IDT
Corp IDTc.N before moving to Goldman Sachs in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, a premier Wall Street firm that spends
billions of dollars on state-of-the-art technology and talent,
is an attention grabber on a resume.

&lt;p&gt;System Vulnerability Lets Hackers "Own" Your Computer 
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Today, Rob Housman, Executive Director of the Cyber Secure Institute, released
this statement concerning Microsoft`s Security Advisory 972890 regarding a
serious vulnerability in its Video ActiveX Control, which could allow a hacker
to take total control of a user`s computer: 

With this ActiveX security flaw, if a user visits certain websites and uses the
ActiveX Control system, the vulnerability allows the hacker to take control and
become the main user on the personal computer-in essence they own you, or at
least your computer and your data. Not only can a hacker have total access to
all the data on the computer, but the hacker can use your computer for a host of
malicious purposes. Because of the widespread use of Internet Explorer and
ActiveX on Microsoft operating systems, this vulnerability puts at risk untold
numbers of computers. 

This advisory, however, is unique in that it was not accompanied by an update,
or actual patch, to fix the vulnerability. Instead, the Microsoft has advised
customers to use the "workaround section" to stop support of ActiveX in Internet
Explorer. That Microsoft would go out with this vulnerability even without an
update shows the high degree of risk here. Moreover, it shows the overall level
of vulnerability inherent in today`s IT environment. 

Sadly, news of yet another serious vulnerability is not surprising. We have come
to expect them in a world where cybersecurity is dependent upon inherently
insecure IT systems. In fact, we face vulnerabilities like this one so regularly
that even this serious, and unfixed "Browse Slave" vulnerability barely makes
the news. 

We have to break this cycle. We have to stop relying on the old hack-and-patch.
We need to focus on deploying new technologies that are inherently
secure-technologies that are, in fact, certified secure against the types of
threats we face today. Certified, inherently secure technologies, like those of
Integrity Global Security and Tenix, need to be the basis of this paradigm
shift. Until we do that, expect the Institute`s next Hack-and-Patch Digest
shortly.

&lt;p&gt;KnowledgeLake`s Partner Program is Expanding and Fueling the Company`s Growth
ST. LOUIS--(Business Wire)--
KnowledgeLake, Inc., a leading provider of document imaging and capture
technologies for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) solutions, states its continued commitment to the KnowledgeLake
Alliance Partner program. The program has been instrumental to KnowledgeLake`s
company growth. 

"KnowledgeLake is very committed to our Alliance Partners," said Bob Bueltmann,
Vice President of Business Development and co-founder of KnowledgeLake, Inc. "As
a result of this commitment our partners contribute to a large percentage of our
continued growth. In 2008, KnowledgeLake exceeded its growth expectations and
doubled its sales revenue. A significant portion of this growth is a result of
our partner`s success in providing KnowledgeLake ECM solutions. KnowledgeLake
solutions provide the strategic edge that our partners need to deliver ECM
solutions to their customers." 

The partner program is a top priority for KnowledgeLake and the goal is to team
with best-in-class organizations to architect, sell and implement
state-of-the-art SharePoint platform based ECM systems. KnowledgeLake partners
are equipped to leverage their sales efforts by providing customers with a full
suite of document imaging and capture products. The program is designed for both
services and reseller partners. 

"KnowledgeLake has taken a new approach to their partner program with their
Partner Advisory Council (PAC). Their success in bringing the traditional ECM
vendors and Microsoft Systems integrators together was clearly visible at their
First Annual PAC meeting," said Thomas Postulka, Senior Strategic Alliance
Manager, Fujitsu Imaging Products Group. "The PAC members can now leverage each
other`s offerings, enabling them to fill possible gaps when faced with
requirements outside their solution base, therefore having the ability to offer
a value added service to their client." 

KnowledgeLake is equipping its partners with leading edge technology like
KnowledgeLake Connect 4.0. KnowledgeLake has recently incorporated a new
technology into KnowledgeLake Connect that provides the ability to integrate
desktop programs such as Web, Windows, Silverlight and WPF applications with

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) warned that second-quarter earnings would be hit by a sharp decline in U.S. refining margins and that any benefits from higher oil prices were largely offset by a weaker dollar, sending its shares down 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outlook from the second-largest U.S. oil company only contributed to the gloom surrounding the country's refiners in the face of toughening regulation and a depressed fuel market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said on Thursday the decline in second-quarter U.S. refining margins more than offset an increase in marketing margins, while margins were mixed outside its home country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refining margins have been squeezed by higher crude prices, which lift input costs, and weak demand due to the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Downstream results are projected to be significantly lower than the first quarter," Chevron said in its interim update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said U.S. oil-equivalent production in April and May was 682,000 barrels per day (bpd), up from 671,000 in the first quarter, while international output was 1.979 million bpd, down by 13,000 bpd from the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is targeting overall average output of 2.63 million bpd for 2009.

But in the second quarter last year -- which ended right before oil prices peaked -- Chevron earned $2.90 a share on revenue of nearly $83 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival ConocoPhillips (COP.N) said this week high inventories and weak fuel margins would hurt its second-quarter refining results, while oil and natural gas production was expected to drop from the prior quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron were down 1.8 percent at $61.95 in extended trading on Thursday, near its four-month low of $61.90 touched on Wednesday. ConocoPhillips shares eased nearly 1 percent, while Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) slipped 0.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares are now down 16 percent in 2009, versus just an 8 percent drop for the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of oil stocks .OIX, as companies with refining operations have been hit harder than production-focused rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Societe Generale analyst Aymeric de-Villaret said Chevron should post some of the strongest production growth among the big energy companies and its least exposure to refining would minimize the impact of lower margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SocGen started its coverage of Chevron with a "buy" rating, while the brokerage put a "hold" on Exxon and a "sell" on ConocoPhillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by financial consultant Deloitte released on Thursday, found that U.S. refiners faced a shakeout due to pending environmental regulations that could shrink national refining capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is already facing resistance in its efforts to upgrade its San Francisco Bay refinery at Richmond, and plans to appeal a California judge's ruling that halted a $1 billion project to build a hydrogen plant there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Silicon Valley start-ups, increasingly dropping Microsoft and turning to Web-based software, may be the crucial opening Google needs for its Chrome operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts and executives say Google, which unveiled the Chrome this week in a direct challenge to Microsoft's decades-old dominance of computer operating systems and business applications, will take years to get significant share of the market, but start-ups might be their way in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of tech entrepreneurs argue that Microsoft's current software is out of date and inefficient because, unlike applications that run off the Web in a "cloud" environment, they run one copy per person at a time, rather than allowing multiple users to share information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a business setting you never work on things alone," said Tien Tzuo, chief executive of Zuora, a company that sells software to facilitate billing online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea of sending a file back and forth is just archaic," said Tzuo. "Why not just give employees an inexpensive device that allows them to plug into the Internet?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Windows nonetheless dominates. It remains the operating system software for about 95 percent of PCs, with more than 950 million copies running worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to Windows's success is that it offers the most applications and draws the most programmers. But start-ups, who thrive on low-cost efficiency, say Google's operating system -- which will be free -- offers superior applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many have already switched to Web-based software such as Google Apps for everything from email to word processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRAVELING LIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Sifry, the chief executive of Offbeat Guides, which provides personalized on-line guides for 30,000 destinations, said Google Apps allow him to travel without a computer because he can access all of his applications on-line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, with operating system-based applications most companies would have to maintain, update, install, costing time and money, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Offbeat Guides contractors around the world collaborate online with the main office, Sifry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that I don't have to worry about doing technical support on their computers and software helps an extraordinary amount," he said. "Whenever Google does a bug fix it works on all of their systems, without us having to spend any effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts estimate about 2 percent of PC users will try out the Chrome OS in its first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has said it will first try to persuade the likes of Hewlett-Packard and Acer to offer its operating system in low-cost netbooks that work mostly off the Web, allowing existing individual users to switch painlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts are uncertain if Google's Chrome can gain rapid traction among corporations, law firms and other businesses because of the sheer cost of switching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Siminoff, chief executive of PhoneTag -- which faces direct competition from Google for software that transcribes phone messages -- uses both Google and Microsoft and similarly lets his employees use any application they want. But he concedes that some Microsoft applications remain indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Siminoff and Sifry say they need at least a few copies of Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet software so they can exchange data with lawyers and accountants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chad Wilbur, a senior Quist Valuation financial analyst, said Excel enjoys "mindshare" among long-standing users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's beat into you from the time you learn on a computer. All our client documents arrive in Excel format. There are no comparable products," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Tzuo argues that will change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sure, there are certain functions that are still only in Excel," he said, noting his finance department uses it for complex spreadsheets spanning multiple files. But every day that passes, the number of things that Excel does, that Google Spreadsheet doesn't, gets smaller and smaller."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has taken the following actions on the following classes of
JPMorgan Mortgage Acquisition Trust 2007-CH1 Group 1: 

--Class AF-1A affirmed at 'A/LS3'; Outlook Negative; 

--Class AF-1B affirmed at 'A/LS3'; Outlook Negative; 

--Class AF-2 affirmed at 'B/LS3'; Outlook Negative; 

--Class AF-3 affirmed at 'CCC/RR2'; 

--Class AF-4 upgraded to 'CCC/RR3' from 'CC/RR3'; 

--Class AF-5 upgraded to 'CCC/RR3' from 'CC/RR3'; 

--Class AF-6 upgraded to 'CCC/RR2' from 'CC/RR2'; 

--Class MF-1 affirmed at 'CC/RR5'; 

--Class MF-2 affirmed at 'C/RR5'; 

--Class MF-3 affirmed at 'C/RR5'; 

--Class MF-4 affirmed at 'C/RR5'; 

--Class MF-5 affirmed at 'C/RR6';

--Class MF-7 affirmed at 'C/RR6'; 

--Class MF-8 affirmed at 'C/RR6'; 

--Class MF-9 affirmed at 'C/RR6'. 

The AF-4, AF-5 and AF-6 classes were downgraded to 'CC' on June 12, 2009. Fitch
used loss coverage ratios to guide the long-term ratings. A bond's loss-coverage
ratio is determined by dividing the amount of projected collateral loss that
would result in a bond default by the expected base-case collateral loss amount.
A loss-coverage ratio between .75 and .99 generally results in a 'CCC' long-term
rating, while a ratio between .50 and .74 generally results in a 'CC' long-term
rating. 

For JPM 2007-CH1 Group 1, Fitch projects a collateral loss on the remaining pool
balance of 32%. As determined by cashflow analysis, the AF-4 to AF-6 classes all
have loss coverage ratios between .50 and .74 and were previously assigned 'CC'
ratings. However, while all three classes are expected to eventually default,
the immanency of default is more consistent with that seen by 'CCC' rated
classes than by 'CC' rated classes. All three classes are projected to default
in approximately four years, which is consistent with the average time to
default for 'CCC' rated Subprime senior classes. The average time to default for
'CC' rated Subprime senior classes is approximately 18 months. Additionally, the
relationship of the three bonds' credit enhancement to severely delinquent loans
is higher than any other currently rated 'CC' Subprime class and more similar to
a typical 'CCC' rated class. As a result of these additional considerations, the
bonds were upgraded to 'CCC'.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights MIPS Technologies (Nasdaq: MIPS) as the Bull of
the Day and Altria Group (NYSE:MO) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America
(NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

MIPS Technologies (Nasdaq: MIPS) develops embedded processors and intellectual
property for use in performance-oriented markets such as digital entertainment,
wired and wireless communications (including broadband access), office
automation, security and automotive markets. 

The firm continues to drive bottom-line margins higher in a very difficult
environment. The valuation on MIPS has become very compelling as the stock has
shed significant value from its 52-week high and the new acquisition has the
potential to drive margin expansion. 

Further, MIPS recently sold its analog business, which is highly accretive. We
would be buyers of the stock at these levels. 

Bear of the Day: 

Altria Group (NYSE:MO) is the leading domestic tobacco company, which generates
significant cash flow and the stock has a high dividend yield. In an effort to
expand into adjacent categories, Altria acquired UST, the world's leading moist
smokeless tobacco manufacturer. 

However, the company is engaged in numerous tobacco liability suits. Several
large punitive damage awards have been upheld, most recently the $79.5 million
judgment in the Williams case in 2009. 

In addition, the 150+% federal excise tax increase should dramatically reduce
cigarette volume. A Sell rating is recommended.

Even Landlords May Be Hurting

2Q09 asking rent fell 0.7% year-over-year to $1,040 a month, and down 0.6% from
on a linked quarter basis. In the U.S.`s largest U.S.`s apartment market, New
York, vacancies fell 0.5% on a linked quarter basis and a 4.0% declined
year-over-year to 2.9%, despite a 1.7% decrease in rent to the $2,680 level. In
addition, other areas of the country (such as Las Vegas, San Francisco and San
Jose, California) had effective rents that dropped more than 2.0%
year-over-year. 

Nationally the picture may grow worse, with approximately 45% of the more than
100,000 units from new construction for 2009 already on the market. As
unemployment has continued to mount, the largest tenant group -- 18-24-year-olds
-- has been hardest hit. 

With general expectations of an economic recovery pushed back to early 2010,
lower rents and higher vacancies should be expected to continue over the near
term. 

With the apartment buildings sector typically the leader for all commercial real
estate categories with respect to defaults, it is extremely probable that
financial institutions such as (but not limited to) Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of
America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) will continue to experience
negative commercial real estate credit quality trends during the coming
quarters.

Record Bankcard Losses in May

In May 2009 the U.S. Credit Card Quality Index, which tracks about 53% of the
outstanding debt on bankcards and private label and retail cards that back
credit card asset-backed securities rated by S, indicated less than rosy data.


The index showed for bankcard trusts -- American Express (NYSE: AXP), MasterCard
(NYSE: MA) or Visa (NYSE: V) -- losses reached a record 10.0% for the month, for
a 66.8% increase from May 2008. U.S. retail cards losses (to include gas and
department store cards) increased 12.2% the highest point since January 2000,
when the statistic was first tracked. 

As to be expected, there is a fairly close correlation to unemployment, which
increased 70.9% the past 12 months. The expansion of losses among the trusts
outpaced unemployment growth by 49.3% to 38.2% over the past six-months
respectively, as the rise in unemployment continued to make it difficult for
consumers to pay down credit card debt. 

Based on S estimates, card losses should average 10.5-12.5% during the next
12-18 months. This ominous prediction should translate to elevated mortgage and
commercial losses at but not limited to Citigroup (NYSE: C) and US Bancorp
(NYSE: USB).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`sAnalyst Blog:

Mortgage Fraud on the Rise

There typically two types of mortgage fraud. The first, fraud for property
focuses on applicants making misstatements to obtain a loan (embellishing income
and concealing debt), and the second fraud for profit focuses on elaborate
schemes to focus on falsifying appraisals and loan documents, which include
identity theft and shell companies. 

Reports of fraud have not moderated during the 1H09 as losses are $208 million
higher compared to the year ago level. The FBI believes attempts have the
potential to spread as expectations for the current economic downward trend is
expected to continue into 2009 and perhaps into 2010. 

The top 10 mortgage fraud states were California, Illinois, Texas, Georgia,
Ohio, Colorado, Maryland, Florida, Missouri and New York. Therefore it its
extremely probable that financial institutions such as but not limited to
Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), US
Bancorp (NYSE: USB) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) will continue to experience
negative credit quality trends during the coming quarters.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported in its interim update that
upstream earnings for the second quarter 2009 compared with the first quarter
are expected to benefit from an increase in prices for crude oil, largely offset
by substantial unfavorable foreign currency effects. Downstream results are
projected to be significantly lower than the first quarter. 

Basis for Comparison in Interim Update

The interim update contains certain industry and company operating data for the
second quarter 2009. The production volumes, realizations, margins and certain
other items in the report are based on a portion of the quarter and are not
necessarily indicative of Chevron's quarterly results to be reported on July 31,
2009. The reader should not place undue reliance on this data. 

Unless noted otherwise, all commentary is based on two months of the second
quarter 2009 versus full first quarter 2009 results. 

UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

The table that follows includes information on production and price indicators
for crude oil and natural gas for specific markets. Actual realizations may vary
from indicative pricing due to quality and location differentials and the effect
of pricing lags. International earnings are driven by actual liftings, which may
differ from production due to the timing of cargoes and other factors.

Total U.S. oil-equivalent production during the first two months of the second
quarter increased 11,000 barrels per day mainly due to activities in the Gulf of
Mexico that included ongoing restoration of operations damaged by hurricanes
last September, the ramp-up of production at Blind Faith, and the start-up at
Tahiti. 

International net oil-equivalent production decreased 13,000 barrels per day.
The liquids component of oil-equivalent production decreased 4,000 barrels per
day as the effects of planned field maintenance in Kazakhstan and Canada more
than offset increased volumes associated with the continued ramp-up at the
Agbami Field offshore Nigeria. Natural gas production decreased about 60 million
cubic feet per day, largely reflecting lower sales in Thailand. 

U.S. crude oil realizations for the first two months of the second quarter
increased $11.94 per barrel to $48.79. International liquids realizations
increased $9.40 to $48.83 per barrel. U.S. natural gas realizations declined
$0.88 to $3.26 per thousand cubic feet, while average international natural gas
realizations decreased $0.57 per thousand cubic feet to $3.64. 

International upstream results for the first two months of the second quarter
included unfavorable foreign currency effects in excess of $400 million
resulting from the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against most other major
currencies, a trend that continued in June. Additionally, the international
upstream segment is expected to reflect charges of approximately $100 million
associated with well write-offs in the quarter. Worldwide upstream depreciation
expense is currently forecast to be in line with first quarter 2009 results. 

DOWNSTREAM - REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

The table that follows includes industry benchmark indicators for refining and
marketing margins. Actual margins realized by the company may differ
significantly due to location and product mix effects, planned and unplanned
shutdown activity and other company-specific and operational factors.

 2 Marketing margins, formerly shown for other international areas, have been discontinued. With the sale of the Brazil fuels marketing business in the first quarter 2009, approximately 70% of international marketing sales are in the Asia-Pacific / Middle East / Africa area. 
                                                                                                                              


For the full second quarter, the U.S. refining indicator margins were down
sharply, more than offsetting an increase in marketing margins. Outside the
United States, refining indicator margins were mixed. Marketing margins in the
Asia-Pacific / Middle East / Africa area were nearly flat. 

During the first two months of the second quarter, daily U.S. refinery
crude-input volumes were essentially unchanged. Outside the United States,
refinery crude-input volumes were down 32,000 barrels per day, or about three
percent, primarily due to planned maintenance at refineries in South Korea and
Singapore. 

International downstream results in the full second quarter are expected to
include adverse timing effects due to the substantial increase in crude oil and
refined product prices between the beginning and end of the quarter. Earnings in
the full second quarter are expected to include gains of roughly $150 million
from the previously announced sales of marketing businesses in Kenya and
Cameroon, approximately $250 million less than asset sales gains recorded in the
first quarter.

ALL OTHER

The company`s general guidance for the quarterly net after-tax charges related
to corporate and other activities is between $250 million and $350 million. Due
to foreign currency effects and the potential for irregularly occurring accruals
related to income taxes, pension settlements and other matters, actual results
may significantly differ from the guidance range or current projections. Total
net charges in the second quarter are currently expected to be lower than the
guidance range.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Option activity is brisk on Dow Jones Industrial Average component General
Electric Company (NYSE: GE) today. Of particular interest is volume at the
stock's January 2010 10 call and put, which have each seen more than 22,000
contracts cross the tape. Open interest is heavy at these strikes, with the
January 2010 call sporting 108,688 contracts, while the January 2010 put has
22,881 contracts open. 

Taking a closer look at this volume reveals some unusual option activity. On the
January 2010 call, 21,500 contracts traded in nine blocks between 10:52 a.m. and
11:17 a.m. Eastern time on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). These
blocks crossed at the ask price of $1.83, and were marked spread. At roughly the
same times and on the same exchange, 10 blocks totaling 21,500 January 2010 puts
traded at the bid price of $1.20, and were marked spread. Given this data, it
would appear that we are looking at a synthetic long position on General
Electric.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, environmental group reaction, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, July 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) plans to
appeal a California judge's ruling that halted a $1 billion
project to build a hydrogen plant at its San Francisco Bay
refinery in Richmond, California, a company spokesman said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron will not ask for a stay of the order, which brought
the expansion project to an abrupt halt last week, forcing the
layoff of 900 out of 1,000 construction workers, said Chevron
spokesman Brent Tippen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the court's decision was erroneous with regard
to the environmental impact report," Tippen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge Barbara Zuniga
ruled in a July 2 decision that the environmental impact report
filed to obtain construction permits for the new hydrogen plant
failed to depict how pollution from the refinery would be
changed after the project was complete and provide a greenhouse
gas mitigation plan as required by California law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; California environmentalists had fought the expansion's
approval by the Richmond City Council, citing flaws in the
environmental report required by state law. They filed the
lawsuit after the Council approved the project and work began
in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is not a surprise," said Torm Nompraseurt of the
Asian Pacific Environment Network, which opposed Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has all the money in the world to hire all the
legal help they need," Nompraseurt said. "What Chevron needs to
give the community is a good EIR and disclose all the
information to the community."

appeal a California judge's ruling that halted a $1 billion
project to build a hydrogen plant at its San Francisco Bay
refinery in Richmond, California, a company spokesman said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron will not ask for a stay of the order which brought
the expansion project to an abrupt halt last week, forcing the
layoff of 900 out of 1,000 construction workers, said Chevron's
Brent Tippen.

&lt;p&gt;July 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE.N) to "neutral," saying the
recent move by various governments to clamp down on excessive
speculation in energy and commodity trading by reviewing
position limits may impact trading volumes of exchange
operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Until further clarity emerges on the outcome of the global
energy trading review, we believe the stock will remain
relatively range-bound," analyst Daniel Harris said in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which cut its price targets on ICE to $95
from $130 and on CME Group Inc (CME.O) to $310 from $350, said
the move may hurt 2010 earnings of ICE by 5 to 14 percent and
those of CME by 2 to 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also cut its growth outlook for oil and natural gas
futures at ICE and CME to 0 percent in 2010/2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy trading formed 58 percent of ICE's 2008 revenue and
21 percent of CME's second-half revenue for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of ICE rose 3 percent to $87.67 on the New York
Stock Exchange. CME Group Inc's shares were also up 3 percent
at $271.67 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc said today that it is disappointed by the Canadian Federal Court`s
decision declaring invalid its patent covering amlodipine besylate, the active
ingredient in Norvasc, and that the company will appeal the decision to the
Federal Court of Appeal of Canada. Pfizer's amlodipine besylate patent -
Canadian Patent No. 1,321,393 - expires in 2010. The civil action was brought by
Ratiopharm. 

Pfizer remains committed to protecting its intellectual property rights and to
ensuring the long-term viability of its research and development programs. 

The company noted that legal challenges to this patent in Canada by other
generic manufacturers are still pending.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) has attracted a plethora of option players
lately, as investors prepare for the financial firm's second-quarter earnings
release, slated to hit the Street before the market opens on Tuesday, July 14.
According to data from WhatsTrading.com, the security saw roughly 72,600 puts
and 71,000 calls change hands yesterday, more than doubling its average daily
volume of about 33,250 and 32,000 contracts, respectively. 

Digging deeper into the data, it appears we may have discovered a put ratio
backspread - a bearish trading play - in the works. At 10:40 a.m. Eastern time,
several blocks totaling 5,000 GS July 135 puts changed hands at the ask price of
$3.13, suggesting they were bought. At the same time, several blocks totaling
2,500 July 145 puts traded at the bid price of $8.26, indicating they were
likely sold. Both trades were marked "spread," reinforcing our theory that these
two legs were related.

&lt;p&gt; * EU executive to propose dropping visas for three states * Macedonia meets standards; Serbia, Montenegro close   (adds Dutch spokesman) BRUSSELS, July 9 (Reuters) - The EU executive will propose next week to allow citizens of Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia to travel to the bloc without visas from the start of next year, the EU justice commissioner said on Thursday. A proposal will be made next Tuesday in Strasbourg to liberalise visas for nationals of the Western Balkans, Jacques Barrot told a news briefing in Brussels. Under this proposal, the new regime comes into force on January 1. The proposal will have to be formally approved by the EU's 27 justice ministers, although unanimity would not be required. Barrot said the first countries covered would be Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, while Albania and Bosnia should follow later in 2010, provided they meet certain requirements. EU officials say Macedonia has already met EU standards for visa liberalisation, which include adequate border monitoring, introduction of biometric passports and steps against crime and corruption. Montenegro and Serbia were expected to be able to meet all conditions by the year-end. Barrot said the Netherlands remained reluctant to offer concessions to Serbia given Belgrade's failure to clear up war crimes issues dating back to the Yugoslav war of the 1990s. Certainly the reluctance of the Netherlands on Serbia remains a important issue, but there will be strong advocates around the table, so I think we will win, Barrot said. We will not punish the Serbian youth due to poor conduct of (Slobodan) Milosevic, he said in reference to the Serbian wartime leader who died while on trial in the Hague. Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that while the Netherlands opposed ratification of an agreement that would allow Serbia to progress towards the EU until Belgrade cooperates fully with the Hague war crimes tribunal, it was not opposed to visa liberalisation. The Netherlands is in favour of visa liberalisation as soon as Serbia meets necessary criteria. There is no such thing as Dutch reluctance on this issue, Bart Rijs said. An EU official said Serbian residents in the newly independent Kosovo would still need visas and would have to obtain special passports from Belgrade. He said the new visa regime would oblige Serbians to monitor the border with Kosovo, which Belgrade still considers a part of Serbia and does not recognise as a state. EU foreign ministers last month encouraged the European Commission to propose the visa liberalisation for states of the Western Balkans. All the countries have been offered the prospect of eventual EU membership, which the European Union sees as a means of ensuring stability in the region. Citizens of the former Yugoslavia used to be able to travel without visas to Western Europe until wars that followed Yugoslavia's break-up in the 1990s. Of the countries of the former Yugoslavia, only Slovenia is so far an EU member, but its neighbour Croatia has already secured a visa-free regime.

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI (Reuters) - Low-cost netbooks could provide the fertile ground Google Inc needs to make its free PC operating system a success as it prepares to take on Microsoft Corp's dominant Windows juggernaut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google's new Chrome Linux-based operating system will be free-of-charge, in stark contrast to Windows, which analysts say costs anywhere from $20 for the older XP system to at least $150 for the current Vista system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That price gap could be just what Google needs to attract price-conscious consumers of netbooks, the bare-bones PCs which sell for as little as $400 each. The Internet search giant has said Chrome will initially be targeted at netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google's move is very timely because of all the bad press that Microsoft's been getting over its pricing for Windows 7," said Gartner analyst Lilian Tay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is unwilling to cut prices, and PC brands are probably already unhappy with that because they're already trying so hard to make the extra dollar from the cheap netbooks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PC industry is struggling to recover from its worst downturn, hit by the global recession and as booming netbook sales cannibalize traditional laptops that cost as much as six times more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coming generation of "nettops," being promoted as the netbook equivalent of traditional desktop computers, could strain the industry further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrome could be just the ticket for netbook makers to boost their profit margins, as the Web-centric nature of netbooks makes it a natural fit for Google, which has carved out a space for itself as a major innovator on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most major PC brands declined to say if they would make Chrome-based netbooks, although Google has named big tech names such as Hewlett-Packard, Acer and Lenovo as partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan's Asustek, which pioneered the netbook in 2006, called the Chrome operating system an interesting development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're looking very closely into it, and will be seeking user feedback and seeing what the industry has to say about it before deciding whether we'll use the system in our PCs," Asustek Chief Operating Officer Tony Chen told Reuters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TESTY RELATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, relatively late to embrace the netbook craze, had initially said it would be hard to create a new class of PCs and seemed content to watch on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains a reluctant supporter even with netbooks' current rapid growth, as sales of cheaper versions of Windows used on netbooks have cannibalized more expensive, advanced versions, hurting revenues at the software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has tried to restrict how its upcoming Windows 7 version can be used in netbooks, and says it won't support certain low-cost chip-sets from UK chip designer ARM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google may seek to exploit some of the resulting PC maker discontent with Microsoft on the issue. Already, Google has said it will support netbooks running on ARM chipsets as the British company launches its own aggressive plan to take up to a 30 percent share of the market next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has never lost 30 percent of any PC segment in recent memory," said Vincent Chen, an analyst at Yuanta Securities. "If Google is successful in the ARM segment, that's going to give it a huge boost to expand even further."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analyst however remain skeptical on Chrome's long term chances, saying the system, based on the open-source Linux, is just the latest version of an unsuccessful formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you look at netbooks, all of them ran on Linux in the early days," said IDC analyst Bryan Ma. "They tried it, but users didn't want that. They wanted something familiar, and in today's world, that's Windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Doug Young and Anshuman Daga.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds analysts' comments, background; updates share
movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) was
upgraded to "buy," and its second-quarter outlook raised at
Banc of America Securities-Merrill Lynch, which said the Wall
Street bank, helped by strong trading conditions in the
quarter, could beat estimates for the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company jumped 2.23 percent in pre-market
trading after closing at $138.55 Wednesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, led by Guy Moszkowski, also increased their
target on Goldman shares to $175 from $144, raised earnings
outlook for 2009 and 2010, and said the company's earnings
power and book value were increasing rapidly again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has managed to sidestep the worst of the financial
crisis, posting just one quarterly loss since the middle of
2007, while most of its competitors reported huge losses and
took massive asset-writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; B of A-Merrill analysts, who previously rated the stock
"neutral," raised their second-quarter earnings estimate to
$3.90 a share from $2.92, to reflect significantly better
trading, principal gains and investment banking revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. commercial banks reported record trading revenue in
the first quarter of 2009, benefiting from wide trading margins
and gains from interest rate products, according to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading conditions for Goldman in the current quarter
appears to have been a continuation of that seen during the
first quarter, B of A-Merrill analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Buoyed by stable volumes as spreads tightened, fixed
income markets continued to see wide bid/ask spreads on muted
competition," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second quarter could also be a record quarter for Goldman
in terms of equity underwriting, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second quarter saw a revival in global equity
underwriting volume as firms raced to recapitalize while market
conditions were favorable, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They raised their earnings estimates for Goldman to $16.30
a share from $14.06 for 2009, and to $19.78 from $17.63 for
2010 on expectations of better trading revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; B of A-Merrill analysts are the latest in a long line of
securities analysts to raise their second-quarter earnings
outlook for Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts at FBR Capital Markets in June raised their
second-quarter forecast for Goldman citing likely gains from a
favorable trading and capital markets environment.

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI (Reuters) - Low-cost netbooks could provide the fertile ground Google Inc (GOOG.O) needs to make its free PC operating system a success as it prepares to take on Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) dominant Windows juggernaut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google's new Chrome Linux-based operating system will be free-of-charge, in stark contrast to Windows, which analysts say costs anywhere from $20 for the older XP system to at least $150 for the current Vista system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That price gap could be just what Google needs to attract price-conscious consumers of netbooks, the bare-bones PCs which sell for as little as $400 each. The Internet search giant has said Chrome will initially be targeted at netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google's move is very timely because of all the bad press that Microsoft's been getting over its pricing for Windows 7," said Gartner analyst Lilian Tay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is unwilling to cut prices, and PC brands are probably already unhappy with that because they're already trying so hard to make the extra dollar from the cheap netbooks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PC industry is struggling to recover from its worst downturn, hit by the global recession and as booming netbook sales cannibalize traditional laptops that cost as much as six times more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coming generation of "nettops," being promoted as the netbook equivalent of traditional desktop computers, could strain the industry further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrome could be just the ticket for netbook makers to boost their profit margins, as the Web-centric nature of netbooks makes it a natural fit for Google, which has carved out a space for itself as a major innovator on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most major PC brands declined to say if they would make Chrome-based netbooks, although Google has named big tech names such as Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N), Acer (2353.TW) and Lenovo (0992.HK) as partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan's Asustek (2357.TW), which pioneered the netbook in 2006, called the Chrome operating system an interesting development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're looking very closely into it, and will be seeking user feedback and seeing what the industry has to say about it before deciding whether we'll use the system in our PCs," Asustek Chief Operating Officer Tony Chen told Reuters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TESTY RELATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, relatively late to embrace the netbook craze, had initially said it would be hard to create a new class of PCs and seemed content to watch on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains a reluctant supporter even with netbooks' current rapid growth, as sales of cheaper versions of Windows used on netbooks have cannibalized more expensive, advanced versions, hurting revenues at the software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has tried to restrict how its upcoming Windows 7 version can be used in netbooks, and says it won't support certain low-cost chip-sets from UK chip designer ARM (ARM.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google may seek to exploit some of the resulting PC maker discontent with Microsoft on the issue. Already, Google has said it will support netbooks running on ARM chipsets as the British company launches its own aggressive plan to take up to a 30 percent share of the market next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has never lost 30 percent of any PC segment in recent memory," said Vincent Chen, an analyst at Yuanta Securities. "If Google is successful in the ARM segment, that's going to give it a huge boost to expand even further."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts however remain skeptical on Chrome's long term chances, saying the system, based on the open-source Linux, is just the latest version of an unsuccessful formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you look at netbooks, all of them ran on Linux in the early days," said IDC analyst Bryan Ma. "They tried it, but users didn't want that. They wanted something familiar, and in today's world, that's Windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Doug Young and Anshuman Daga)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUN VALLEY, Idaho (Reuters) - Google Inc plans to attack Microsoft Corp's core business by taking on the software giant's globally dominant Windows operating system for personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, which already offers a suite of e-mail, Web and other software products that compete with Microsoft, said it would launch a new, free operating system that will initially be targeted at netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called the Google Chrome Operating System, the new software will be in netbooks for consumers in the second half of 2010, Google said in a blog post, adding that it was working with multiple manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netbooks are low-cost notebook PCs designed for Internet surfing and other Web-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been part of their culture to go after and remove Microsoft as a major holder of technology, and this is part of their strategy to do it," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle Group. "This could be very disruptive. If they can execute, Microsoft is vulnerable to an attack like this, and they know it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft have locked horns over the years in a variety of markets, from Internet search to mobile software. It remains to be seen if Google can take market share away from Microsoft on its home turf, with Windows currently installed in more than 90 percent of the world's PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to success will be whether Google can lock in partnerships with PC makers, which currently offer Windows on most of their product lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said in a blog post on Wednesday that it is working with a number of PC makers including Hewlett-Packard, Acer, Lenovo and Asustek, as well as chipmakers Texas Instruments and Qualcomm to design and build Chrome devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes as executives from the world's biggest technology and media companies, including Google and Microsoft, gather in Sun Valley, Idaho for an annual conference organized by boutique investment bank Allen  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Microsoft declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 3 cents to close at $22.56 on the Nasdaq. Google shares rose 1.5 percent to $402.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAST AND LIGHTWEIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Chrome OS is expected to work well with many of the company's popular software applications, such as Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be fast and less memory-intensive, enabling users to access the Web in a few seconds, Google said. The new operating system is based on open-source Linux code, which allows third-party developers to design compatible applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The operating systems that browsers run on were designed in an era where there was no web," Sundar Pichai, vice president of product management at Google, said in the blog post. The Chrome operating system is "our attempt to rethink&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;what operating systems should be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said the operating system was a new project, separate from its Android mobile operating software found in some smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system is designed to work with ARM and Intel Corp's x86 chip platforms, the main chip architectures in use in the market. Microsoft has previously said it would not support PCs running on ARM chips, allowing Google an opportunity to infiltrate that segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlene Li, partner at Altimeter Group, said Google's new system could first appeal to consumers looking for a netbook-like device for Web surfing, rather than people who use desktop PCs for gaming or high-powered applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But eventually, the operating system has the potential to scale up to larger, more powerful PCs, especially if it proves to run faster than Windows, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said the new OS would be free to use. Enderle noted that the company's business model has been to earn revenue from connecting applications or advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declines to say how much it charges PC brands for Windows, but most analysts estimate about $20 for the older XP system and at least $150 for the current Vista system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altimeter's Li added: "A benefit to the consumer is that the cost saving is passed on, not having to pay for an OS. It's clearly positioned as a shot across the bow of Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kelvin Soh in Taipei, Jim Finkle in Boston, Gabriel Madway and Edwin Chan in San Francisco; Writing by Tiffany Wu, editing by Will Waterman and Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

according to a company environmental filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Loss of oxygen to FCCU2 caused partial oxidation and consequential

emissions. The event had no impact on production and all customer needs
were met," the company added.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, July 9 (Reuters) - The EU executive will propose next week to allow citizens of Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia to travel to the bloc without visas from the start of next year, the EU justice commissioner said on Thursday. A proposal will be made next Tuesday in Strasbourg to liberalise visas for nationals of the Western Balkans, Jacques Barrot told a news briefing in Brussels. Under this proposal, the new regime comes into force on January 1. The proposal will have to be formally approved by the EU's 27 justice ministers, although unanimity would not be required. Barrot said the first countries covered would be Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, while Albania and Bosnia should follow later in 2010, provided they meet certain requirements. EU officials say Macedonia has already met EU standards for visa liberalisation, which include adequate border monitoring, introduction of biometric passports and steps against crime and corruption. Montenegro and Serbia were expected to be able to meet all conditions by the year-end. Barrot said the Netherlands remained reluctant to offer concessions to Serbia given Belgrade's failure to clear up war crimes issues dating back to the Yugoslav war of the 1990s. Certainly the reluctance of the Netherlands on Serbia remains a important issue, but there will be strong advocates around the table, so I think we will win, Barrot said. We will not punish the Serbian youth due to poor conduct of (Slobodan) Milosevic, he said in reference to the Serbian wartime leader who died while on trial in the Hague. An EU official said Serbian residents in the newly independent Kosovo would still need visas and would have to obtain special passports from Belgrade. He said the new visa regime would oblige Serbians monitor the border with Kosovo, which Belgrade still considers a part of Serbia and does not recognise as a state. EU foreign ministers last month encouraged the European Commission to propose the visa liberalisation for states of the Western Balkans. All the countries have been offered the prospect of eventual EU membership, which the European Union sees as a means of ensuring stability in the region. Citizens of the former Yugoslavia used to be able to travel without visas to Western Europe until wars that followed Yugoslavia's break-up in the 1990s. Of the countries of the former Yugoslavia, only Slovenia is so far an EU member, but its neighbour Croatia has already secured a visa-free regime.

&lt;p&gt;July 9 (Reuters) - J.P.Morgan Securities shed its
long-standing preference for the UK equities within Europe and
took an "overweight" stance on Eurozone, saying that
continental equities were expected to benefit from improving
interest rate differential and less currency headwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Downgrading UK equities to "underweight" from "overweight",
the brokerage said within Eurozone, it preferred German
equities in particular, with an "overweight" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a European equity strategy note, analyst Mislav Matejka
said that he preferred German equities to do well, driven by
strong performance of capital goods, autos, steel and chemicals
subsectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage reiterated its "overweight" rating on Europe
over the United States on valuation and said European
corporates had moved above their U.S. peers in terms of return
on equities and earnings before interest and taxes/sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "European equities experienced sharp outflows over the past
two years as investors pared non-U.S. exposure to reduce
risk... the flows could reverse as volatility continues to move
lower, and investors move out of the safe haven, the U.S.,"
Matejka wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage upgraded European chemicals sector to
"overweight" from "neutral," saying that the sector had
aggressively liquidated inventories, have good emerging markets
exposure and should benefit from the global pickup in
manufacturing activity, led by autos.

&lt;p&gt;    * Chrome PC operating system could attract netbook makers &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * PC brands could look to Chrome to improve netbook margins &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Google's strong web presence could help it grow netbooks &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Google names Acer, Asustek, Lenovo and HP among partners &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Kelvin Soh &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    TAIPEI, July 9 (Reuters) - Low-cost netbooks could provide the fertile ground Google Inc (GOOG.O) needs to make its free PC operating system a success as it prepares to take on Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) dominant Windows juggernaut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Google's new Chrome Linux-based operating system will be free-of-charge, in stark contrast to Windows, which analysts say costs anywhere from $20 for the older XP system to at least $150 for the current Vista system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That price gap could be just what Google needs to attract price-conscious consumers of netbooks, the bare-bones PCs which sell for as little as $400 each. The Internet search giant has said Chrome will initially be targeted at netbooks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Google's move is very timely because of all the bad press that Microsoft's been getting over its pricing for Windows 7," said Gartner analyst Lilian Tay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft is unwilling to cut prices, and PC brands are probably already unhappy with that because they're already trying so hard to make the extra dollar from the cheap netbooks." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The PC industry is struggling to recover from its worst downturn, hit by the global recession and as booming netbook sales cannibalise traditional laptops that cost as much as six times more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A coming generation of "nettops", being promoted as the netbook equivalent of traditional desktop computers, could strain the industry further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Chrome could be just the ticket for netbook makers to boost their profit margins, as the Web-centric nature of netbooks makes it a natural fit for Google, which has carved out a space for itself as a major innovator on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Most major PC brands declined to say if they would make Chrome-based netbooks, although Google has named big tech names such as  Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N), Acer (2353.TW) and Lenovo (0992.HK) as partners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Taiwan's Asustek (2357.TW), which pioneered the netbook in 2006, called the Chrome operating system an interesting development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We're looking very closely into it, and will be seeking user feedback and seeing what the industry has to say about it before deciding whether we'll use the system in our PCs," Asustek Chief Operating Officer Tony Chen told Reuters." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    To read Reuters coverage of Google-Microsoft stories, click [nN08415019] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    TESTY RELATIONS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, relatively late to embrace the netbook craze, had initially said it would be hard to create a new class of PCs and seemed content to watch on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It remains a reluctant supporter even with netbooks' current rapid growth, as sales of cheaper versions of Windows used on netbooks have cannibalised more expensive, advanced versions, hurting revenues at the software maker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has tried to restrict how its upcoming Windows 7 version can be used in netbooks, and says it won't support certain low-cost chip-sets from UK chip designer ARM (ARM.L). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Google may seek to exploit some of the resulting PC maker discontent with Microsoft on the issue. Already, Google has said it will support netbooks running on ARM chipsets as the British company launches its own aggressive plan to take up to a 30 percent share of the market next year. [nSP400501] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft has never lost 30 percent of any PC segment in recent memory," said Vincent Chen, an analyst at Yuanta Securities. "If Google is successful in the ARM segment, that's going to give it a huge boost to expand even further." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Some analysts however remain sceptical on Chrome's long term chances, saying the system, based on the open-source Linux, is just the latest version of an unsuccessful formula. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "When you look at netbooks, all of them ran on Linux in the early days," said IDC analyst Bryan Ma. "They tried it, but users didn't want that. They wanted something familiar, and in today's world, that's Windows." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Doug Young and Anshuman Daga) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((kelvin.soh@thomsonreuters.com; +886 2 2508 0815; Reuters Messaging: kelvin.soh.reuters.com@reuters.net) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((If you have a query or comment on this story, send an email to news.feedback.asia@thomsonreuters.com)) Keywords: GOOGLE/NETBOOKS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

TOY STORY &amp; TOY STORY 2 - DOUBLE FEATURE(In Disney Digital 3D)

Disney&#9679;Pixar`s TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2 return to the big screen in an exciting
double feature Oct. 2, 2009-this time in Disney Digital 3D. 

TOY STORY 

They`re toys, they talk-at least when people aren`t around-and they`re back&#8230;
celebrating the return of the "Toy Story" franchise-this time in Disney Digital
3D! TOY STORY, the film that started it all, takes moviegoers back to that
fantastic fun-filled journey, viewed mostly through the eyes of two rival toys-
Woody (voice of TOM HANKS), the lanky, likable cowboy, and Buzz Lightyear (voice
of TIM ALLEN), the fearless space ranger. The comically-mismatched duo
eventually learn to put aside their differences when circumstances separate them
from their owner Andy and they find themselves on a hilarious adventure-filled
mission where the only way they can survive is to form an uneasy alliance. 

TOY STORY 2 

Disney&#8226;Pixar`s TOY STORY 2 picks up as Andy heads off to Cowboy Camp, leaving
his toys to their own devices. Things shift into high gear when an obsessive toy
collector named Al McWhiggin (voice of WAYNE KNIGHT), owner of Al's Toy Barn,
kidnaps Woody (voice of TOM HANKS). At Al's apartment, Woody discovers that he
is a highly valued collectible from a 1950s TV show called "Woody's Roundup,"
and he meets the other prized toys from that show - Jessie the cowgirl (voice of
JOAN CUSACK), Bullseye the horse and Stinky Pete the Prospector (voice of KELSEY
GRAMMER). Back at the scene of the crime, Buzz Lightyear (voice of TIM ALLEN)
and the gang from Andy's room - Mr. Potato Head (voice of DON RICKLES), Slinky
Dog (voice of JIM VARNEY), Rex (voice of WALLACE SHAWN) and Hamm (voice of JOHN
RATZENBERGER) - spring into action to rescue their pal from winding up as a
museum piece. The toys get into one predicament after another in their daring
race to get Woody home before Andy returns. 

DISNEY`S A CHRISTMAS CAROL(In Disney Digital 3D and IMAX 3D)

DISNEY`S A CHRISTMAS CAROL, a multi-sensory thrill ride re-envisioned by Academy
Award&#174;-winning filmmaker Robert Zemeckis, captures the fantastical essence of
the classic Dickens tale in a groundbreaking 3D motion picture event. Ebenezer
Scrooge (JIM CARREY) begins the Christmas holiday with his usual miserly
contempt, barking at his faithful clerk (GARY OLDMAN) and his cheery nephew
(COLIN FIRTH). But when the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come
take him on an eye-opening journey revealing truths Old Scrooge is reluctant to
face, he must open his heart to undo years of ill will before it`s too late.
Opens in theaters nationwide on Nov. 6, 2009. 

THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG

Walt Disney Animation Studios presents the musical THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, an
animated comedy set in the great city of New Orleans. From the creators of "The
Little Mermaid" and "Aladdin" comesa modern twist on a classic tale, featuring a
beautiful girl named Tiana (ANIKA NONI ROSE), a frog prince who desperately
wants to be human again, and a fateful kiss that leads them both on a hilarious
adventure through the mystical bayous of Louisiana. THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG
marks the return to hand-drawn animation from the revered team of John Musker
and Ron Clements, with music by Oscar&#174;-winning composer Randy Newman. Opens on

tale of an elite unit of Elves known as Prep &amp; Landing. Every Christmas Eve,
this high-tech organization ensures that homes around the world are properly
prepared for a visit from the Big Guy (aka Santa Claus). After working
tirelessly on Prep &amp; Landing for 227 years, an elf named Wayne (voice of Dave
Foley) is upset when he doesn`t receive an expected promotion to be the Director
of Naughty List Intelligence. Instead, Magee (voice of Sarah Chalke), the North
Pole Christmas Eve Command Center Coordinator (NPCECCC for short), partners
Wayne with Lanny (voice of Derek Richardson), an idealistic rookie who has an
undying enthusiasm for Christmas. During their Christmas Eve mission, Wayne and
Lanny encounter unexpected challenges that push them to their limits. 

BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (In Disney Digital 3D)

Walt Disney Pictures` magical animated classic BEAUTY AND THE BEAST returns to
the big screen in Disney Digital 3D, introducing a whole new generation to the

others-and ultimately learns to see beneath the Beast`s exterior to discover the
heart and soul of a prince. Featuring unforgettable music by Howard Ashman and

of the most beloved stories of all time. JOHNNY DEPP stars as the Mad Hatter and
MIA WASIKOWSKA as 19-year-old Alice, who returns to the whimsical world she
first encountered as a young girl, reuniting with her childhood friends: the

life-and-death journey across a visually-stunning cyber universe that has become
far more advanced and exceedingly dangerous.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Silicon Valley startups, increasingly dropping Microsoft and turning to Web-based software, may be the crucial opening Google needs for its Chrome operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts and executives say Google, which unveiled the Chrome this week in a direct challenge to Microsoft's decades-old dominance of computer operating systems and business applications, will take years to get significant share of the market, but startups might be their way in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of tech entrepreneurs argue that Microsoft's current software is out of date and inefficient because, unlike applications that run off the Web in a "cloud" environment, they run one copy per person at a time, rather than allowing multiple users to share information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a business setting you never work on things alone," said Tien Tzuo, chief executive of Zuora, a company that sells software to facilitate billing online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea of sending a file back and forth is just archaic," said Tzuo. "Why not just give employees an inexpensive device that allows them to plug into the Internet?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Windows nonetheless dominates. It remains the operating system software for about 95 percent of PCs, with more than 950 million copies running worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to Windows's success is that it offers the most applications and draws the most programmers. But startups, who thrive on low-cost efficiency, say Google's operating system -- which will be free -- offers superior applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many have already switched to Web-based software such as Google Apps for everything from email to word processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRAVELING LIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Sifry, the chief executive of Offbeat Guides, which provides personalized on-line guides for 30,000 destinations, said Google Apps allow him to travel without a computer because he can access all of his applications on-line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, with operating system-based applications most companies would have to maintain, update, install, costing time and money, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Offbeat Guides contractors around the world collaborate online with the main office, Sifry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that I don't have to worry about doing technical support on their computers and software helps an extraordinary amount," he said. "Whenever Google does a bug fix it works on all of their systems, without us having to spend any effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts estimate about 2 percent of PC users will try out the Chrome OS in its first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has said it will first try to persuade the likes of Hewlett-Packard and Acer to offer its operating system in low-cost netbooks that work mostly off the Web, allowing existing individual users to switch painlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts are uncertain if Google's Chrome can gain rapid traction among corporations, law firms and other businesses because of the sheer cost of switching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Siminoff, chief executive of PhoneTag -- which faces direct competition from Google for software that transcribes phone messages -- uses both Google and Microsoft and similarly lets his employees use any application they want. But he concedes that some Microsoft applications remain indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Siminoff and Sifry say they need at least a few copies of Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet software so they can exchange data with lawyers and accountants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chad Wilbur, a senior Quist Valuation financial analyst, said Excel enjoys "mindshare" among long-standing users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's beat into you from the time you learn on a computer. All our client documents arrive in Excel format. There are no comparable products," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Tzuo argues that will change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sure, there are certain functions that are still only in Excel," he said, noting his finance department uses it for complex spreadsheets spanning multiple files. But every day that passes, the number of things that Excel does, that Google Spreadsheet doesn't, gets smaller and smaller."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), seeking to extricate itself from a federal bailout program, wants warrants held by the government to be sold at auction, after the Treasury Department demanded too high a price for the bank to buy them back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank revealed its decision as a Congressional Oversight Panel overseeing the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program said it could cost taxpayers billions of dollars if the government lets banks repurchase warrants too cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuing the warrants has become a flashpoint for some of the 10 large banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), that repaid more than $68 billion of TARP funds last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The repayments included $25 billion by JPMorgan, whose chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has described participation in TARP as a "scarlet letter" for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The objective is to get out of the clutches of government," said Marshall Front, chairman of Front Barnett Associates LLC in Chicago. "That is an urgent objective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10-year warrants were meant to allow taxpayers to share the upside as banks recover. Banks can buy back the warrants if they agree with the Treasury Department on the fair market value. Otherwise, Treasury can auction them to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Street Corp (STT.N), one of the 10 large banks to repay TARP funds last month, was the first from this group to directly buy back the warrants, paying $60 million to do so according to the latest TARP transaction report on Friday. State Street had received $2 billion in bank bailout funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TRUE MARKET PRICE" SOUGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While repaying bailout money frees banks from caps on executive pay, banks still have a big incentive to shed the warrants because the government can change the rules on banks still tied to TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, the warrants will cost them. If investors exercise warrants they buy at auction, banks will have to issue more shares. On the other hand, if banks repurchase their warrants, that cost would reduce their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti said an auction "is consistent with the Treasury's process, which we fully support, and it will result in the true market price for the warrants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Treasury representative said the government wants to dispose of warrants "in a manner that protects taxpayers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Congressional Oversight Panel, outstanding warrants industry wide could be worth anywhere from $4.71 billion to $12.27 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel said 11 smaller banks were permitted to buy back their warrants at 66 percent of estimated fair market value, which means the government passed up $10 million of profit. It said taxpayers could lose $2.7 billion if the government accepted the same percentage on all the warrants it still holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor who chairs the panel, told Reuters Television she was pleased with the decision to auction the JPMorgan warrants, which her panel estimated are worth $1.02 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you go to the market, sometimes you get burned and sometimes you make out, but that really is fair market value in an open and transparent process," she said. "Nothing substitutes for real market valuations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTHER BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the other eight big financial companies to repay TARP in June will seek to auction or buy back their warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eight are Goldman, Morgan Stanley, American Express Co (AXP.N), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), BBT Corp (BBT.N), Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The others had no immediate comment or did not immediately return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed down $1.28 on Friday at $32.34 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay and Jonathan Stempel, additional reporting by Dan Burns, Steve Eder, Svea Herbst-Bayliss, David Lawder and Ellis Mnyandu; editing by John Wallace and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank revealed its decision as a Congressional Oversight Panel overseeing the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program said it could cost taxpayers billions of dollars if the government lets banks repurchase warrants too cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuing the warrants has become a flashpoint for some of the 10 large banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), that repaid more than $68 billion of TARP funds last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The repayments included $25 billion by JPMorgan, whose chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has described participation in TARP as a "scarlet letter" for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The objective is to get out of the clutches of government," said Marshall Front, chairman of Front Barnett Associates LLC in Chicago. "That is an urgent objective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10-year warrants were meant to allow taxpayers to share the upside as banks recover. Banks can buy back the warrants if they agree with the Treasury Department on the fair market value. Otherwise, Treasury can auction them to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Street Corp (STT.N), one of the 10 large banks to repay TARP funds last month, was the first from this group to directly buy back the warrants, paying $60 million to do so according to the latest TARP transaction report on Friday. State Street had received $2 billion in bank bailout funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TRUE MARKET PRICE" SOUGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While repaying bailout money frees banks from caps on executive pay, banks still have a big incentive to shed the warrants because the government can change the rules on banks still tied to TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, the warrants will cost them. If investors exercise warrants they buy at auction, banks will have to issue more shares. On the other hand, if banks repurchase their warrants, that cost would reduce their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti said an auction "is consistent with the Treasury's process, which we fully support, and it will result in the true market price for the warrants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Treasury representative said the government wants to dispose of warrants "in a manner that protects taxpayers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Congressional Oversight Panel, outstanding warrants industry wide could be worth anywhere from $4.71 billion to $12.27 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel said 11 smaller banks were permitted to buy back their warrants at 66 percent of estimated fair market value, which means the government passed up $10 million of profit. It said taxpayers could lose $2.7 billion if the government accepted the same percentage on all the warrants it still holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor who chairs the panel, told Reuters Television she was pleased with the decision to auction the JPMorgan warrants, which her panel estimated are worth $1.02 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you go to the market, sometimes you get burned and sometimes you make out, but that really is fair market value in an open and transparent process," she said. "Nothing substitutes for real market valuations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTHER BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the other eight big financial companies to repay TARP in June will seek to auction or buy back their warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eight are Goldman, Morgan Stanley, American Express Co (AXP.N), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), BBT Corp (BBT.N), Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The others had no immediate comment or did not immediately return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed down $1.28 on Friday at $32.34 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay and Jonathan Stempel, additional reporting by Dan Burns, Steve Eder, Svea Herbst-Bayliss, David Lawder and Ellis Mnyandu; editing by John Wallace and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Under normal circumstances, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) might be afforded a moment of gloating as it struts toward what could be a banner earnings announcement just nine months after being roiled by Wall Street's worse crisis since the Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these aren't ordinary times for the biggest U.S. investment bank, which lately has faced a torrent of unwanted publicity stemming from employee theft allegations and an unflattering spread in Rolling Stone magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Goldman, expected to announced second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, finds itself in a no-win situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If earnings are too good critics may lambaste it for ramping up risk too much and embracing a hedge fund-like model that could make it vulnerable to big market swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they fall short, investors may accuse the firm of failing to live up to its reputation for being more aggressive and intelligent than its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are between a rock and a hard place," said Walter Todd, a portfolio manager with Greenwood Capital Associates, which owns shares of rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, regardless of the results, critics may fall back on the old "Government Sachs" refrain, a nod to the number of former Goldman defectors now working in government, and claiming special treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a public relations standpoint, Todd said that leaves Goldman asking questions familiar to the oil industry as it contended with windfall profit taxes amid spiking gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How well do they really want to do?" Todd asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting Goldman to report net income for common shareholders of $3.54 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is down from a pro-forma $4.58 a year earlier, but would best a surprisingly strong first quarter in which Goldman reported net income of $3.39 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong trading income and improving equity underwriting markets are expected to bolster the results, offsetting a one-time charge of $425 million related to payback of loans Goldman took from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a noisy second quarter, Goldman repaid $10 billion in TARP loans, while raising $8.9 billion in equity, debt and asset sales to win its way out of the government program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the approval to exit TARP was considered a key step from getting out from under the thumb of the U.S. government, which has taken the industry to task for lavish compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Goldman reports strong earnings, it will confront another public relations challenge in how it translates profits to compensation for employees. Last month, the Observer newspaper reported that Goldman employees in London were briefed on the company's performance and told to expect record bonuses if the year finished strongly. Goldman has denied such a briefing ever took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"PAY THEIR PEOPLE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banc of America Securities-Merrill Lynch analysts said in a research note this week that Goldman could set aside as much as $17.9 billion for compensation this year, more than the $10.9 billion last year, but still below the $20.19 billion set aside in 2007. Using Goldman's first-quarter headcount, that comes out to $642,000 per employee, based on the research estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Does the strong earnings and the employee pay-out mean it is back to the future and that they are wheeling and dealing and engaging in higher risk activities, as was true just a few years ago?" said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. "We don't really know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there is more than a touch of jealousy to the chorus of ill-will toward Goldman, which rivals have in recent years waited -- so far in vein -- to break its long earnings hot streak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's defenders say Goldman is simply being upbraided for its success and argue that the firm has Wall Street's most sophisticated risk management procedures in place -- systems that put it in a stronger position than most rivals to ride out last fall's turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the fact is that better-than-expected earnings would boost Goldman's share price, already up 73 percent so far this year, which would be good news for its investors and partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the financial realm, they are smartest guys around," said Bill Hackney, chief investment officer of Atlanta Capital Management Co, which owns Goldman shares. "I doubt there's any behind the scenes conspiracy among Goldman executives to cause them to have an unfair advantage in the market. This harping is just sort of sour grapes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sour grapes or not, Goldman, despite the fact that the Treasury Department is no longer run by one of its former CEOs and that a retired Goldman chairman has been forced out of key post at the New York Federal Reserve, continues to raise hackles among many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scathing article in Rolling Stone that accused the bank of having a key role in various market bubbles stretching back to the 1920s and stoked outrage on the Daily Kos and other blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrest of one of its former employees earlier this week for allegedly stealing computer codes that were the key to hefty trading profits at the firm also stirred up chatter on various financial blogs where little love is lost for the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is not expected to impact earnings but the firm, famously publicity-averse, may have little chance of retreating from the spotlight anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - The owner of a website onto which a purportedly stolen Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) computer code was downloaded has declined to say whether or not other people accessed the code while it was on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roopinder Singh, who runs file storage website xp-dev.com, told Reuters in London on Friday that computer files show whether or not the valuable code -- which U.S. prosecutors have charged former Goldman employee Sergey Aleynikov with stealing -- was viewed by others, but he declined to say what they show due to the scale of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Singh, accounts at xp-dev.com initially have a privacy setting that only lets the user see them. However, users can change that setting to allow other people to view files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Private is the default," he said. "You then have the option ... You can explicitly either share it (or keep it private)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to say what the settings on Aleynikov's account were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh also said German authorities had taken hardware from the website on Monday, while the UK's Serious Organized Crime Agency visited his flat in south east London several hours later that evening. He said his website was down until Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On Monday afternoon the hard drives were seized -- German authorities took away the hard drives to do forensic work on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wasn't really (initially) told it was connected to the Goldman case," Singh said. "On Wednesday morning they came back to my place and I deleted the data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI in New York said earlier this week it had taken measures to prevent code being sent from the server in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Working through our assistant legal attache in Frankfurt and with the authorities in Germany, the FBI has taken steps to ensure that the appropriated code was not distributed," FBI spokesman Jim Margolin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh said that he had previously had no connection with Aleynikov and that anyone could set up an account on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's lawyer said on Friday that there was confusion over what was being said and written about the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, said: "They talk about open source code and proprietary information as though it were the same thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shroff said: "He (Aleynikov) has not said anything about sharing proprietary information. In fact he denies guilt. There is no guilt, and there is no harm to Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purported theft of the code could cost Goldman Sachs "millions upon millions of dollars", a U.S. prosecutor, Joseph Facciponte, said at 39-year-old Aleynikov's initial court appearance in New York on Saturday. He was arrested on Friday night and interviewed by the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment while a Serious Organized Crime Agency spokesman was unable to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Grant McCool and Steve Eder in New York, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Silicon Valley startups, increasingly dropping Microsoft (MSFT.O) and turning to Web-based software, may be the crucial opening Google (GOOG.O) needs for its Chrome operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts and executives say Google, which unveiled the Chrome this week in a direct challenge to Microsoft's decades-old dominance of computer operating systems and business applications, will take years to get significant share of the market, but startups might be their way in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of tech entrepreneurs argue that Microsoft's current software is out of date and inefficient because, unlike applications that run off the Web in a "cloud" environment, they run one copy per person at a time, rather than allowing multiple users to share information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a business setting you never work on things alone," said Tien Tzuo, chief executive of Zuora, a company that sells software to facilitate billing online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea of sending a file back and forth is just archaic," said Tzuo. "Why not just give employees an inexpensive device that allows them to plug into the Internet?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Windows nonetheless dominates. It remains the operating system software for about 95 percent of PCs, with more than 950 million copies running worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to Windows's success is that it offers the most applications and draws the most programmers. But startups, who thrive on low-cost efficiency, say Google's operating system -- which will be free -- offers superior applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many have already switched to Web-based software such as Google Apps for everything from email to word processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRAVELING LIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Sifry, the chief executive of Offbeat Guides, which provides personalized on-line guides for 30,000 destinations, said Google Apps allow him to travel without a computer because he can access all of his applications on-line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, with operating system-based applications most companies would have to maintain, update, install, costing time and money, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Offbeat Guides contractors around the world collaborate online with the main office, Sifry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that I don't have to worry about doing technical support on their computers and software helps an extraordinary amount," he said. "Whenever Google does a bug fix it works on all of their systems, without us having to spend any effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts estimate about 2 percent of PC users will try out the Chrome OS in its first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has said it will first try to persuade the likes of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and Acer (2353.TW) to offer its operating system in low-cost netbooks that work mostly off the Web, allowing existing individual users to switch painlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts are uncertain if Google's Chrome can gain rapid traction among corporations, law firms and other businesses because of the sheer cost of switching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Siminoff, chief executive of PhoneTag -- which faces direct competition from Google for software that transcribes phone messages -- uses both Google and Microsoft and similarly lets his employees use any application they want. But he concedes that some Microsoft applications remain indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Siminoff and Sifry say they need at least a few copies of Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet software so they can exchange data with lawyers and accountants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chad Wilbur, a senior Quist Valuation financial analyst, said Excel enjoys "mindshare" among long-standing users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's beat into you from the time you learn on a computer. All our client documents arrive in Excel format. There are no comparable products," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Tzuo argues that will change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sure, there are certain functions that are still only in Excel," he said, noting his finance department uses it for complex spreadsheets spanning multiple files. But every day that passes, the number of things that Excel does, that Google Spreadsheet doesn't, gets smaller and smaller."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

CRE Mauling to Continue

Clearly, as more companies downsize and retailers close their doors, small and
regional banks may experience substantial risk of severe losses from commercial
real estate loans. The pressures are not expected to improve until economic
improvements are experienced -- specifically, when consumers and businesses
start spending money again. 

With unemployment hitting 9.5% in June 2009, new construction projects have come
to a virtual standstill, which moderates the number of construction jobs that
are being worked on and moderates tax revenue for local governments. Currently,
the national commercial real estate market is not expected to hit bottom for at
least three years. 

Recently it was noted that the Federal Reserve has been focusing commercial real
estate loans banks' books as losses from the sector continue to expand. As such,
the Fed has expanded its training of its bank examiners in order to be prepared
to deal with rising losses from the commercial real estate industry. 

While small and regional banks would experience hits, institutions such as (but
not limited to) Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Wells Fargo
(NYSE: WFC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and US Bancorp (NYSE: USB) as well.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Speculative investors are beginning to display an optimistic bias toward
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). During the past five days, traders on the
International Securities Exchange (ISE) have bought to open 17,054 calls on
MSFT, compared to 5,062 puts. In other words, option players have purchased 3.37
times more bullish bets than bearish during the past week. 

Taking a slightly longer-term look, MSFT currently sports a 10-day ISE call/put
volume ratio of 2.16, as calls bought to open have more than doubled puts during
the past two weeks. This ratio ranks higher than 56.1% of other such readings
taken during the past year, suggesting that the stock's call options have been
more popular than usual of late.

&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive Solution to Deploy Premium Video Services over the Internet 
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Envivio Inc. announced today the immediate availability of the first complete
encoding and Digital Rights Management (DRM) protected distribution solution
optimized for Microsoft Silverlight 3. Designed for evaluating, developing and
deploying premium live and on Demand video services, Envivio SilverLiveTV
provides operators and content owners with a comprehensive solution for
delivering high-value, feature-rich video entertainment to consumers. 

SilverLiveTV enables operators to offer PC and Mac users multiple channels of
video content over wired and wireless networks. It ingests analog or digital
sources and simultaneously encodes and encrypts the content using Envivio`s
video processing enhancements and DRM interfaces. Advanced Quality of Service
management maximizes reliability and ensures consumers a great viewing
experience. Embedded Microsoft Windows Media and Silverlight DRM, powered by
PlayReady content protection, guards the entire lifecycle of high value streamed
content from the head-end to the consumer device over IP networks. 

"Demand for entertainment, particularly premium-caliber services, on PCs and
mobile devices is steadily increasing," said Steve Sklepowich, group product
manager for Silverlight at Microsoft Corp. "Envivio encoders and their support
for the advanced features of Silverlight 3 enable operators and content holders
to pursue the benefits of delivering these services to consumers." 

Ready to deploy today

SilverLiveTV enables operators to immediately deploy protected video services
using Microsoft`s existing Windows Media platform and Windows Media DRM content
protection. SilverLiveTV also supports Microsoft Silverlight 3, enabling
operators to begin testing and configuring new advanced services. SilverLiveTV
is easily enhanced through software updates to ensure support for future
Silverlight 3 developments. 

Advanced Silverlight 3 technologies

With its ability to simultaneously encode video at multiple bitrates,
SilverLiveTV elegantly supports Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0 and
Silverlight Smooth Streaming, Microsoft`s HTTP-based adaptive streaming
platform. Silverlight continually detects the user`s local bandwidth and CPU
conditions, and seamlessly switches between streams of different bitrates to
give the best possible video experience regardless of changing network
conditions. 

As video is encoded, SilverLiveTV automatically protects it with Silverlight
DRM, powered by PlayReady. This feature enables secure, encrypted delivery of
high value content from the Envivio 4Caster C4-based video head-end to a
consumer's playback device over public networks. SilverLiveTV also supports
products from third party PlayReady DRM licensees. 

"Today`s consumer is just as likely to turn to his PC for entertainment as the
television," said Julien Sign&#232;s, President and CEO of Envivio. "SilverLiveTV is
the comprehensive solution operators and content owners have been waiting for to
enable them to capitalize on this rapidly growing market opportunity. The system
is deployable today and fully expandable as operators adopt Microsoft`s emerging
technologies." 

SilverLiveTV contents

SilverLiveTV includes the Envivio 4Caster C4, an award-winning convergence
encoding platform used around the world to provide service to millions of IPTV,
Internet TV and Mobile TV subscribers. The bundled reference architecture
features all of the extensions required to ensure fast, effortless testing and
deployment of advanced Silverlight services. The included Silverlight 3-based
player is ready to use immediately for live TV applications. SilverLiveTV also
features integration and support from the world`s most experienced team of
mobile TV deployment experts. The fully upgradeable 4Caster C4 can be configured
to support most popular client devices on any IPTV, Internet TV or Mobile TV
network. 

A demonstration of SilverLiveTV is available for Silverlight 3 enabled devices
at http://www.envivio.com/solutions/Silverlight. Additional information can be
found at the Silverlight home page http://silverlight.net/.

&lt;p&gt;July 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised the U.S. hardware
sector to "attractive" from "neutral," on expectations of a
potential upside in the stocks and the sector to outperform in
the seasonally stronger second half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The most depressed hardware sector will be the number one
area for investment when the economy and IT budgets improve,
well above software, networking equipment and services, the
brokerage said in a note dated July 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A return to normal seasonal trends in tech should serve as
the first catalyst in the back half of the year, followed by
increased IT spending and a corporate upgrade cycle in 2010,"
analysts led by David Bailey wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts expect a 35 percent to 50 percent upside
potential in hardware companies' shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bailey upgraded Dell Inc DELL.O to "conviction buy" from
"neutral," and called the world's second largest maker of
personal computers his top pick, expecting an aging installed
base and the rollout of Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) new Windows 7
operating system to drive a corporate PC upgrade cycle in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bailey cut Western Digital Corp WDC.N and IBM (IBM.N) to
"neutral" from "buy," based on valuation, and said all the
advantages of Western Digital have already been priced into its
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On IBM, the analyst said the potential upside to the
stock's $120 price target is less than the other buy-rated
stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bailey, who favours Dell, Arrow Electronics (ARW.N),
Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Seagate Technology (STX.O), also
upgraded Seagate to "buy" from "neutral" and raised his price

 (Writes through, adds details, quote, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Leah Schnurr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
pointed to a lower open on Friday after Chevron warned about
second-quarter earnings, raising the specter of a
weaker-than-expected second-half economic recovery and anemic
corporate profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the bell Thursday, Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said
second-quarter earnings would be hit by a sharp decline in U.S.
refining margins and that any benefits from higher oil prices
would be largely offset by a weaker dollar. (For details, see
[ID:nN09478562])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stocks are likely to be pushed and pulled as major
companies release financial scorecards and investors focus on
the corporate outlook for the rest of the year. Earlier in the
week, Alcoa Inc (AA.N) posted a better-than-expected loss
Wednesday, providing short-term relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Optimism about a burgeoning economic recovery has propelled
the broad SP 500 up by as much as 40 percent from March's
12-year lows, but investors are reassessing how strong a
recovery might be after the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's pretty clear that the green shoots thesis, which a
lot of optimists were hoping would have some sway, is a
nonstarter," said Barry Ritholtz, director of equity research
at Fusion IQ in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now people are adapting to a more realistic view of the
economy, which is ongoing weakness for the foreseeable future
and everything that means for corporate earnings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Economic data on tap includes the preliminary reading for
July's Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer
sentiment, due at 9:55 a.m. EDT (1355 GMT). The data is
expected to come in at 70.5, down from 70.8 in June, according
to the average forecast of economists polled by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 fell 7.50 points and were below fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 lost 62
points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures gave up 7.25 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a whirlwind 40-day reorganization, General Motors
Corp GMGMQ.PK prepared to exit bankruptcy Friday, saying it
was a leaner and meaner automaker ready to win back American
consumers and pay back taxpayers. [ID:nN09484459]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ritholtz said the speed with which GM emerges from
bankruptcy could provide a viable alternative for saving
companies without taxpayer bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology shares may get a boost after Goldman Sachs
upgraded both the software and hardware sectors to
"attractive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, stocks edged higher as investors bought
beaten-down technology and commodity shares and a positive
broker comment on Goldman (GS.N) boosted the financial sector.

&lt;p&gt;July 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded its coverage
view on U.S. software sector to "attractive" from "neutral,"
saying the overall outlook for IT spending looked more
encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman, however, downgraded business software maker CA Inc
(CA.O) to "neutral" and replaced it with SuccessFactors Inc
SFSF.O on its "buy" list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "CA historically has underperformed in a seasonal rally,"
the brokerage said. "In reviewing the software rallies from
2002 through 2007, CA underperformed the group in five out of
six."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Goldman, which cut its price target on CA by $2 to $22,
said currency remains a headwind for CA for the next few
quarters, both from a revenue and earnings perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On SuccessFactors, the brokerage said the software maker
can benefit earlier in the cycle from some product specific
secular tailwinds though it continues to view applications as
the lagging element of software spending. The brokerage raised
the price target on the stock to $11 from $9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of CA closed at $16.56 on Nasdaq, while those of
SuccessFactors closed at $8.29 Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

were largely offset by a weaker dollar, sending its shares down
1.8 percent. [ID:nN09478562]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron's stock traded in Frankfurt (CVX.F) was down 1.3
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Oil CLc1 resumed its fall towards $60 on Friday and

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, July 13 (Reuters) - The Asia-Pacific head of
Blackstone Group's (BX.N) credit hedge fund group is leaving to
re-join JPMorgan (JPM.N), according to a source familiar with the
matter, roughly six months after the group's Asia desk shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Timothy Donahue, the former Asia-Pacific head of GSO Capital
Partners, is taking a senior managing director role with JPMorgan
in New York on its leveraged loan and high-yield capital markets
team, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  GSO Capital Partners LP, the hedge fund that Blackstone
bought for nearly $930 million in cash and stock in March 2008,
manages a credit hedge fund, mezzanine and senior debt funds, and
collateralised loan obligation (CLO) vehicles. The fund had $10
billion under management at the time it was bought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After opening its Asia desk in Hong Kong last September, GSO
closed it in January, failing to find attractive investments in
the region as markets plunged across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GSO's Asia team was Donahue, Managing Director Sanjeev
Khemlani, Associate Angad Banga and Vice-President Abhimanyu
Prakash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Donahue, and his wife and family, moved with JPMorgan to Hong
Kong about three years ago from New York. For the first two years
he was JPMorgan's Asia-Pacific head of structured leveraged
finance, before moving over to Blackstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Massachusetts native and Fordham University graduate will
re-join the team he left three years ago.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is expanding its horizons with its newly revealed Office 2010 software suite. The updated Office will be available in two separate formats: a traditional PC-based edition and a completely Web-based version. Both products are expected to be released in the first half of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are answers to some common questions about the new Office 2010 and what you can expect from a consumer perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the PC-based Office 2010 and the Web-based Office 2010 be the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. The Web-based version of Office 2010, called Office Web apps, will include only Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote. The functionality in the programs will also be limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What'll you be able to do with the Office 2010 Web apps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Office 2010 Web apps will give you full browser-based viewing and "lightweight" editing of any Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote files. The apps will allow for multiple people to edit the same files concurrently (a la Google Docs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will I be able to save files online with the Office Web apps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll have the option of saving files online, although you will have to sign up for a free Windows Live Skydrive account to take advantage of the cloud-based storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the Office 2010 Web apps be free?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Personal consumers will be able to access the Office 2010 Web apps free of charge using a Windows Live ID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would I want to consider the PC-based Office 2010 instead of the Web apps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Web apps will provide only basic functions of the four "core" Office programs. For anything more advanced, you'll still have to turn to the traditional PC-based version of Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Office 2010 still have the Ribbon menu interface?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, although it's been updated from its Office 2007 debut. First, the Ribbon will now stretch across the entire Office suite of programs. The placement of commands has been tweaked to make common tasks easier to find, and -- unlike in Office 2007 -- you'll be able to customize the Ribbon to your own personal preferences by adding, deleting, and relocating menu options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new in the Office 2010 PC version of Word?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the additions in Microsoft Word  2010 include a new Paste Preview option that allows you to preview the formatting of content before inserting it into your document; improved options for customizing text with effects and various styles; and the ability to insert screenshots into a document without exiting the Word program. You can also more easily edit images with an improved photo editing tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new in Outlook in Office 2010?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated Microsoft Outlook 2010 includes a Gmail-esque "Conversation View" that lets you group connected e-mails into single conservation entries; the ability to create macro-style shortcuts to simplify common tasks; direct access to your contacts list from your inbox; and the addition of on-demand translation tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about Excel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Excel 2010 adds something called "Sparklines," described as "tiny charts that fit within a cell and give a visual trend summary alongside text data." It also boasts improved table handling, better charting performance, and more advanced methods for manipulating data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any standout additions in PowerPoint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most noteworthy additions to PowerPoint 2010 are related to video: You can now import videos from different formats and make edits right within Office -- and, for the first time, you can export your entire slideshow as a Windows Media file. PowerPoint 2010 also features an improved selection of slide transitions, including some three-dimensional options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where can I find a detailed breakdown of all the programs' new features?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out "Office 2010: A Complete Overview of What's New" for an app-by-app breakdown, or see "Visual Overview of Office 2010 Features" for an image-based tour of the new Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/168335&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Executives sell $691 mln between September and April-FT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sales peaked between December and February-FT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) executives sold almost $700 million worth of stock since
the collapse of rival Lehman Brothers last year, the Financial
Times said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newspaper said that most of the stock sales took place
while the biggest U.S. investment bank was bailed out by the
government with $10 billion of taxpayer money, according to
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman executives sold stock worth $691 million between
September 2008 and April 2009, more than the $438 million in
stock sold between September 2007 and April 2008, when the
average share price was substantially higher, the Financial
Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock sales peaked between December and February, when
Goldman Sachs' shares traded near record lows, the newspaper
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Lehman Brothers collapse froze financial markets,
Goldman Sachs was forced to convert into a bank holding company
to have access to government funding, and received $10 billion
of taxpayer money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also reported its first quarterly loss since going
public in 1999. However, Goldman has managed to sidestep the
worst of the financial crisis, which has caught rivals with
much higher losses and massive asset writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the bank repaid the government the bailout
funds, along with other big banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect Goldman Sachs will report strong quarterly
earnings on Tuesday, boosted by sold trading income and
improving equity underwriting markets.

&lt;p&gt;Doyenz Demonstrates Strong Momentum with Series-A Funding, New Product Release,
Strategic Partnerships and New Addition to Executive Management Team
NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
Doyenz, Inc., the first company to deliver Migrations in the Cloud, Active
Disaster Recovery and Failover in the Cloud for the small to mid-sized business
market, today announced that it will be demonstrating the new capabilities of
its Automated Virtual IT platform at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference
2009 in New Orleans, July 13-16, 2009. 

The Doyenz Migration in the Cloud service enables partners to remotely perform
rapid "point and click" migrations for Windows-based servers, which reduces
deployment time and costs by 50%, ensures seamless deployments, and eliminates
downtime for the customer. Partners can ensure "True" Business Continuityfor
their customers with the Doyenz Active Disaster Recovery and Failover in the
Cloud service, which stores a production-ready server image in the Doyenz cloud
for use at all times. This unique capability enables the latest image to fail
over and run from the cloud in just minutes in the case of failure. The partners
can also use the latest image or a prior version at any time to test, patch, or
upgrade systems in the Doyenz Virtual Lab. The combination of these services
allows partners to deliver True Business Continuity to their customers at a
price they can afford, while growing recurring revenue streams and improving
margins. 

The Doyenz Migration in the Cloud service will be promoted by Microsoft through
its Core Infrastructure group at the Microsoft World Wide Partner Conference in
New Orleans. In addition, Dave Sobel, CEO of Evolve Technologies and a Microsoft
Gold Certified Partner, will be demonstrating the benefits of the Migration in
the Cloud service in his breakout session at the conference. Finally, Doyenz
also announces its partnership with Intel, and the Intel Enabled Server
Acceleration Alliance (Intel ESAA) Program, in which it will deliver pre-tested
and certified server solutions to Intel resellers. 

"We are excited to welcome Doyenz as a new Intel ESAA technology provider," said
Ned Thanhouser, Director, Intel ESAA Program. "The Doyenz Automated Virtual IT
solution will enable our resellers to add more value to their customers when
bringing Intel-based server solutions to market." 

In order to leverage and expand this significant partnership traction, industry
veteran Carl Sittig has joined Doyenz as VP of Strategic Business Development.
Carl joins Doyenz from Microsoft where he held a variety of sales, marketing,
and business executive roles in a 17-year tenure, including his recent role as
GM of OEM Server Sales. His experience spans engagements with the largest
Multinational OEMs to the smallest VAR partners across North &amp; South America,
Asia, and Europe. At Doyenz, Carl is focused on developing strategic business
partnerships with independent software and hardware vendors, and OEMs to bring
the value of Automated Virtual IT services to their customer base. 

"We are thrilled to see such strong momentum across all aspects of our business,
from product adoption to partnerships, to attracting the brightest talent in the
industry. Doyenz continues to gain traction as one of the companies ushering in
the era of the new IT Economy. This success was a key factor in the recent
closing of our Series A round of financing. We are very proud to have
accomplished all this in these difficult economic times," states Ashutosh
Tiwary, CEO of Doyenz. 

Having just finalized a Series-A funding round of $5M, Doyenz plans to use the
capital to fuel its momentum across partners, sales, marketing and product
development. 

Doyenz is a Bronze sponsor at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference and is
located in booth #300. Doyenz will be providing live demonstrations of their
Failover and Migrations in the Cloud services at the conference.

(NYSE: JPM) and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(Business Wire)--
The law firm of Stueve Siegel Hanson LLP (http://www.stuevesiegel.com) announces
that it is has filed a class action lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:
JPM) and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. on behalf of persons who purchased Auction
Rate Securities for which J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. was the sole auction
dealer, lead auction dealer, co-lead auction dealer, or joint lead auction
dealer between July 10, 2004 and February 13, 2008, inclusive (the "Class
Period"). 

The class action, captioned O`Gara v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., et al., Case No. 09
Civ. 6199, is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. The class action is brought against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.
and its subsidiary J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (collectively "JP Morgan"). The
class action is brought on behalf of persons who purchased Auction Rate
Securities between July 10, 2004 and February 13, 2008 for which J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. was the sole auction dealer, lead auction dealer, co-lead
auction dealer, or joint lead auction dealer ("JPM ARS") 

The Complaint alleges that JP Morgan violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 related to its role as a manager of auctions for
auction rate securities. Auction rate securities are either municipal or
corporate debt securities or preferred stocks which pay interest at rates set at
periodic "auctions." Auction rate securities generally have long-term maturities
or no maturity dates. 

The Complaint alleges that JP Morgan manipulated the market in which auction
rate securities are traded to create the appearance that the securities traded
at arm`s-length auctions, when in fact the available supply well exceeded the
demand for those securities. The Complaint alleges that JP Morgan placed or
caused the placement of support bids for auctions in which it served as a dealer
to create the appearance of stability and liquidity in the auction market,
prevent auction failures, and set the rates of interest or dividends paid on
those securities. The Complaint alleges that JP Morgan engaged in this conduct
to further perpetuate the sale of auction rate securities, and to manage its
inventory of auction rate securities for its own benefit and to the detriment of
investors. The Complaint alleges that JP Morgan failed to disclose its conduct
to investors in violation of the federal securities laws. 

According to the Complaint, holders of auction rate securities underwritten and
managed by JP Morgan have been unable to liquidate their positions in these
securities following the decision on February 13, 2008 of all major
broker-dealers including JP Morgan to "withdraw their support" for the periodic
auctions at which the interest rates paid on auction rate securities are set. 

If you purchased or otherwise acquired auction rate securities for which JP
Morgan served as a dealer between July 10, 2004 and February 13, 2008, you may,
no later than September 11, 2009, request that the Court appoint you as lead
plaintiff. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other
class members in directing the litigation. To be appointed lead plaintiff, the
Court must decide that your claim is typical of the claims of other class
members, and that you will adequately represent the class. Your ability to share
in any recovery is not affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a
lead plaintiff. You may retain Stueve Siegel Hanson LLP, or other attorneys, to
serve as your counsel in this action. 

If you wish to discuss your rights as an investor in auction rate securities
through JP Morgan or any other brokerage, please contact Stueve Siegel Hanson
LLP toll-free at (800) 714-0360. A copy of the complaint is available from the
Court, or can be viewed on Stueve Siegel Hanson LLP`s Web site at:
http://www.stuevesiegel.com/auctionrate.html.

&lt;p&gt;For the second time in a week, Microsoft is warning users that hackers are exploiting an unpatched, critical bug in a company-made ActiveX control, putting people running Internet Explorer (IE) at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been busy lately acknowledging "zero-day" vulnerabilities. Today's admission was the third in the last two months, and the fifth since February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the security advisory Microsoft released early Monday, the vulnerability is in Office Web Components, a set of ActiveX controls for publishing Office content to the Web, and for displaying that content in IE. The bug is in the ActiveX control that displays Excel spreadsheets within IE, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of the disclosure was particularly awkward for Microsoft. Top executives spent much of Monday morning touting the new Office 2010, which will release simultaneously next year with Office Web, scaled-down online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users running Office XP, Office 2003, Internet Security and Acceleration Server (ISA) 2004, ISA 2006 and Office Small Business Accounting 2006 are at risk from attack through IE, Microsoft said. It classified the bug as a "critical" threat. "This vulnerability could be used for remote code execution in a 'browse and get owned' scenario," said Fermin Serna of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) in a blog entry today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackers are now exploiting the bug in the wild, Microsoft admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in its warning of last week, Microsoft again said the most likely attack scenario would involve a malicious Web site hosting the exploit. U.K.-based Sophos echoed that with some specifics today, saying that it has found several sites, "mostly hosted in China that serve the exploit as a part of a Web exploit kit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People running non-Microsoft browsers, such as Mozilla's Firefox or Google's Chrome, are not at risk, as they don't support ActiveX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users with Office 2007 are not vulnerable to attack, at least by default, although they may be if they have manually downloaded and installed Office Web Components 11, the version normally bundled with Office 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[We're] working to develop a security update," confirmed Dave Forstrom, an MSRC spokesman. He did not offer up a release date, however. "This update will be released once it reaches an appropriate level of quality for broad distribution," Forstrom said in a entry on the MSRC blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lieu of a patch, users can protect themselves by setting two "kill bits" to block Office Web Components from running in IE. Since setting ActiveX kill bits can be dangerous -- it requires editing the Windows registry -- Microsoft has again created an automated tool to do the heavy lifting. The so-called "Fix it" tool can be downloaded from Microsoft's support site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's next regularly-scheduled security updates are due tomorrow, when it expects to roll out a half-dozen bulletins. The company has already promised to push a kill bit update for last week's ActiveX bug, but was unsure Monday whether it would be able to do the same for the newest vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Spectacular New 49-foot Icon Will Debut July 16th At Coca-Cola Sky Field
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
There`s a giant new state-of-the-art Coca-Cola bottle stepping up to the plate,
and it`s sure to be a hit with Braves fans. The sparkling new 49-foot-tall
Coca-Cola Contour bottle will be unveiled at Turner Field, home of the Atlanta
Braves, on July 16th. 

The new 21st century rendition of the iconic Coca-Cola Contour bottle replaces
the original Coca-Cola Sky Field bottle, which stood high above left field for
the past 12 years. With a high-resolution, programmable screen serving as the
bottle`s famous red label and lights that can produce millions of different
colors, the new bottle will offer a high-tech way to celebrate a Braves` home
run while carrying on the traditional fireworks celebration for which the
original bottle was known. 

"Enjoying an ice-cold Coca-Cola at a Braves game is the essence of summer in
Atlanta, and we think the new Coca-Cola bottle really captures the specialness
of that experience," said Katie Bayne, chief marketing officer, Coca-Cola North
America. "The bottle is designed to be entertaining for the fans as well, and we
think it will add a new sense of excitement to the experience of being at Turner
Field for a game." 

The outside of the bottle is made of a polycarbonate high-impact material and
traced in 3,000 tri-colored LED's (Light-Emitting Diodes), each capable of
producing over 16 million different colors. The new bottle will be officially
unveiled by Coca-Cola and Braves executives including Hank Aaron at a special
ceremony at home plate before the start of the Braves July 16th game against the
New York Mets at Turner Field. During that game, Coca-Cola and the Braves will
distribute genuine pieces of memorabilia from the original Coca-Cola Sky Field
bottle to a number of lucky Braves fans. The bottle was fabricated by Freeman
Company of Dallas, Texas.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Heinz (NYSE:HNZ) as the Bull of the Day and
Xtent, Inc. (Nasdaq: XTNT) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on Boeing (NYSE:BA), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and
Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Growth in Heinz's (NYSE:HNZ) domestic businesses, strengthening international
operations, and the reallocation of resources in favor of key brands are major
positive trends for the company. 

Despite cost pressure from higher commodity costs, strong pricing of 3.5% to
4.5% has allowed the company to report positive earnings surprises in the last
twelve quarters. Management expects net sales to increase by 4% to 6% in fiscal
2010 driven by new product introductions and positive pricing. 

In addition, the stock's valuation is attractive. The Buy rating is maintained. 

Bear of the Day: 

Xtent, Inc.'s (Nasdaq: XTNT) Custom NX drug eluting stent (DES) Systems treats
coronary artery disease (CAD), the leading form of cardiovascular disease and
major cause of death in the U.S. and Europe. CAD accounts for over 650,000
annual deaths and affects over 13 million people in the U.S. 

The company received CE mark approval for the product. However,
commercialization of the product in Europe may be delayed due to the company's
shortage of funds. 

As such, we lowered our near-term revenue estimates and downgraded this stock to
a Sell.

Trade Deficit Declines

Yes, it is nice to see imports decline, particularly things like oil imports,
but it would be far better if we were reducing the deficit by selling more
abroad, rather than buying less here. If there were some evidence that the
reason for the reduced imports was that we were making more of what we consume
here, say by buying Chevys built in Detroit rather than Hondas built in Tokyo
(or Hondas build in Tennessee, for that matter), it might be a different story. 

However, it appears that the reduction in imports is just another reflection of
weak overall demand. The change in the balance of industrial goods and materials
(including oil) was a very significant part of the year over year improvement,
with our monthly import bill falling by 34.9 billion while our monthly exports
were down by $11.0 billion. In other words, this category was responsible for
$23.9 billion -- or 72.6% -- of the total improvement on a year-over-year basis.


Net imports (aka the trade deficit) is a direct input into the GDP numbers. The
improvement in the May trade deficit will be an important factor in making the
second quarter GDP growth decline much less than the 5.5% decline we saw in the
first quarter. Since our exports are by definition the imports of some other
country, the fact that demand for them is rising might indicate that the rest of
the world is also starting to find its economic footing (although it would show
up as a negative in their national income accounts, just as it helps ours). 

I find the rise in actual exports to be a very encouraging sign. It might just
be signaling some light at the end of the tunnel for major U.S. exporters like
Boeing (NYSE:BA), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT).

&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft Office 2010, due to ship in mid-2010 and being released to testers as a Technical Preview today, Redmond will push themes including collaboration and improved productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office's iron grip on the business world, though strong, is not likely to last forever, and Microsoft is starting to follow through on its "software plus services" vow by letting customers trade upfront payments for monthly fees, most recently by offering Exchange and Sharepoint software as a Web service for a monthly fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Microsoft Office 2010 Highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also counting on a more Web-based manifestation of Office to keep from looking like a corporate dinosaur next to fast and loose Web apps from Google and Zoho, as well as to protect itself from the shift from PCs to more portable devices including smartphones and netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unprecedented move, Microsoft will offer afree, albeit limited, version of Office for the Web where users can access documents via a Web browser. It is scheduled to release the same time as the full, paid version of Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unified Communications in Office 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 will have real-time communications within a document that allows workers to see if colleagues working on a project are available online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paid version -- pricing has not yet been announced -- has features that go deeper into the collaboration realm. But with the combination of a free, light and Web-based version along with the paid, heavy and desktop-based edition, Microsoft believes it can reinvent the way work gets done in the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll have to wait until next year to see if Microsoft can execute on that goal. But until then, here's a look at three collaboration features new to Office 2010 designed to improve enterprise worker productivity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-Time Communications within a Document&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A box listing the people who are currently editing a PowerPoint slide or Word Doc will pop up in Office 2010. If you mouse over the name of a co-worker working on a project, a green light will signify if that worker is available online. If he or she is available, you will be asked if you want to call or e-mail this person or set up a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feature will also allow workers to find colleagues within the company directory who have specific skills and invite them to join the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of "unified communications" within Microsoft Office is an effort to bring more social networking features into the enterprise, something business users have been clamoring for as their personal use of sites like Facebook and Twitter spill over into their working lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-Authoring Projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could write a book about how much time is wasted e-mailing Word docs and Excel spreadsheets around companies so that various workers can make changes or give approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 has a new feature that aims to keep workers in sync called "co-authoring." Groups of workers can create slides, a spreadsheet or a Word document collaboratively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain team members can create and edit certain slides of PowerPoint presentation or certain sections of a written proposal in Word. A small box in the lower left corner of a document will list who is currently editing. Once a worker saves changes to a document, co-workers can look at it and offer suggestions or approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote Access of Office Docs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the free, Web-based version of Office, users will be able to retrieve Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents anywhere using a smartphone or with a non-work laptop using any browser, not just Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Web version of Office is limited in the sense that it won't have all the fonts and formatting of the paid version, but users will be able to view and edit Office documents in a Web browser. This will come in handy for a worker rushing through an airport who wants to quickly check PowerPoint slides in a smartphone browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Jul 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
MOSAID Technologies Inc. (TSX: MSD) today announced that it has initiated
litigation against IBM Corporation of Armonk, New York, for infringement
of six of MOSAID's United States patents. The suit was filed today in the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

    In its complaint, MOSAID claims that IBM has infringed and is infringing
MOSAID's patents by making and selling microprocessor and Application
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) products which practice MOSAID's
patents. MOSAID is claiming infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,603,703;
6,580,654; 6,980,448; 7,038,937; 7,486,580; and 7,535,749. The patents
were granted on MOSAID's fundamental Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)
circuit inventions.

    "We are taking this action to protect our intellectual property because
we have been unable to reach a reasonable settlement with IBM, despite
many years of negotiation," said John Lindgren, President and CEO,
MOSAID. "We believe that IBM requires a license to our patents for its
microprocessor and ASIC products that contain embedded DRAM. MOSAID has
licensed virtually 100% of the global commodity DRAM industry, including
signing patent license agreements covering embedded DRAM products. The
value of our patents is internationally recognized."

    MOSAID is represented by Howrey LLP, a top U.S. law firm specializing in
trademark and patent litigation.

    About MOSAID

    MOSAID Technologies Inc. is one of the world's leading intellectual
property companies. MOSAID develops semiconductor memory technology and
licenses patented intellectual property in the areas of semiconductors
and telecommunications systems. MOSAID counts many of the world's largest

uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or
achievements to differ materially from those in such forward-looking
statements. Assumptions made in preparing forward-looking statements and
financial guidance include, but are not limited to, the following:
MOSAID's continued expansion of its patent portfolio and of its
opportunities for future patent licensing revenue as a result of MOSAID's
acquisition of patents from third parties and from development of new
inventions; DRAM manufacturers continuing to infringe MOSAID's patents;
the timing and amount of MOSAID's litigation expenses; MOSAID's ability
to sign new patent licensees; current assumptions as to the
identification of products that are unlicensed to MOSAID's wireless
patents; and the timing and amount of MOSAID's Research &amp; Development
expenses.

expected results include, but are not limited to, the following: the
extent of embedded DRAM proliferation in the System-on-a-Chip markets;
legal rulings and/or regulatory investigations or complaints having an
adverse impact on the validity, enforceability, potential royalty rates,
and strength or breadth of coverage of MOSAID's essential and/or
nonessential patents (including, but not limited to, adverse results from
litigation or proceedings in patent offices and government regulatory
agencies in various countries around the world); judicial, legislative or
regulatory changes that impair the ability of patent holders to earn
licensing revenues; economic, social, and political conditions in the
countries in which MOSAID or patent licensees operate, including security
risks, health conditions, possible disruptions in transportation networks
and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; non-payment or
delays in payment by, or insolvency of, licensees or other debtors;
variability in patent licensees' sales of licensed products, failure to
maintain and enforce MOSAID's existing patent portfolio, or failure to
obtain valuable patents as a result of research and development
activities, or failure to acquire valuable patents from third parties;
MOSAID's ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel; change in
MOSAID's financial position; consolidation of MOSAID's licensees; natural
events, such as severe weather and earthquakes in the locations in which
MOSAID or patent licensees operate; and changes in the tax rate
applicable to MOSAID as the result of changes in the tax law in the
jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, the
outcome of tax audits and the ability to realize deferred tax assets.

    MOSAID assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements. Additional information identifying risks and uncertainties
affecting MOSAID's business and other factors that could cause MOSAID's
financial results to fluctuate are contained in MOSAID's Annual
Information Form, under the section entitled "Risk Factors," and in

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Jul 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Beginning 12:01 a.m. EDT on July 14, 2009, Czech nationals will require a
visa to travel to Canada, Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism
Minister Jason Kenney announced today. For the first 48 hours, Czech
citizens may apply for entry on arrival in Canada. After 11:59 p.m. EDT
July 15, 2009, a visa will be required.

    Since the visa requirement was lifted on the Czech Republic in October
2007, nearly 3,000 claims have been filed by Czech nationals, compared
with less than five in 2006. The Czech Republic is now the second top
source country for refugee claims. The relatively higher acceptance rate
of refugee claims originating in the Czech Republic masks the troubling
fact that more than half of the claims are abandoned or withdrawn before
a final decision is made by the Immigration and Refugee Board, indicating
that many claimants may not be genuine refugees.

    "In addition to creating significant delays and spiraling new costs in
our refugee program, the sheer volume of these claims is undermining our
ability to help people fleeing real persecution," said Minister Kenney.
"All too often, people who really need Canada's protection find
themselves in a long line, waiting for months and sometimes years to have
their claims heard. This is unacceptable.

    "The visa requirement I am announcing will give us a greater ability to
manage the flow of people into Canada and verify bona fides. By taking
this important step towards reducing the burden on our refugee system, we
will be better equipped to process genuine refugee claims faster."

    "The visa process will allow us to assess who is coming to Canada as a
legitimate visitor and who might be trying to use the refugee system to
jump the immigration queue," Minister Kenney said. "It is not fair for
those who have been waiting patiently to come to Canada, sometimes for
years, when others succeed in bypassing our immigration system."

    Canada regularly reviews its visa policies toward other countries.
Countries are aware that if they do not satisfy the conditions of a
visa-exemption, a visa may be imposed.

    This change means that nationals from the Czech Republic who want to
travel to Canada will first need to apply for a Temporary Resident Visa
and meet the requirements to receive one. It is up to the applicant to
satisfy the visa officer their visit to Canada is temporary, they will
not overstay their approved time in Canada, they have enough money to
cover their stay in Canada, they are in good health, they do not have a
criminal record, and are not a security risk to Canadians. These
requirements are the same for anyone who wants to visit Canada.

    Applicants from the Czech Republic will submit their applications to the
Canadian visa office in Vienna, Austria which currently serves nationals
from several other European countries.

    "Canada has strong ties with the Czech Republic," said Minister Kenney.
"We continue to welcome all genuine travellers to Canada from this
country."

&lt;p&gt;Choosing to risk cannibalizing its own sales rather than let competitors such as Google Inc. eat away at them, Microsoft Corp. will give consumers and corporate users free access to the upcoming Web version of Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced Monday that its Office Web service will be available to members of its free Windows Live online service, of which there are about 400 million active users worldwide today, says Chris Capossela, senior vice-president of the information worker product management group at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Web will also be free to enterprise workers, provided they are licensed for Office's software maintenance program, called Software Assurance. There are 90 million such workers today, Capossela said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Web will also be available as a paid standalone service competing with Google Apps, which came out of beta last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accommodate the three new Web versions of Office, Microsoft will reduce the number of client versions of Office 2010 to five from eight in Office 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its annual Worldwide Partner Conference in New Orleans, Microsoft will also announce that Office 2010, along with related Office products SharePoint Server 2010, Visio 2010 and Project 2010, have reached the technical preview stage. It will begin inviting tens of thousands of people to begin testing the Office 2010 suite, which is expected to ship in the first half of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beta for the remaining Office 2010 products, including Office Web, will begin by the end of the year, Capossela said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear of a free Web&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has long been viewed in many quarters as being afraid of moving Office to the Web for fear of killing the goose that lays golden eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office generates about $15 billion to $20 billion a year for Microsoft, which is second only to Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its aggressive, albeit-belated move, Microsoft isn't endangering its Office sales, Capossela said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, Office Web will only offer lightweight versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint that lack many features. Even the most price-sensitive consumers will still want to buy a fuller-featured, easier-to-use client version of Office, Capossela said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you talk to a student who is writing a ten page class paper, writing something that long in a Web browser is probably not the best experience," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has long offered lower-end products that in theory could have -- but did not -- cannibalize Office, such as Works or WordPad, said Capossela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that even if consumers and small businesses move en masse to Office Web, that won't be so bad, since the revenue per customer wasn't that high. Many were using older versions of Office or simply pirating the software, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Office: Now with free Office Web!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's most lucrative Office customers -- enterprises paying for Microsoft's Software Assurance -- will be rewarded with free access to Office Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These customers can either get it hosted for free on Microsoft's servers or, Microsoft said for the first time, in their own corporate data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a big differentiator from the Googles and Zohos of the world, who say you have to run it in our cloud," Capossela said. "This gives [enterprise] customers choice, as a lot of them will want to run [Office Web] themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third way customers will be able to get access to Office Web is through a paid subscription. This option would be aimed at small businesses who need more security and control over their documents than the free Windows Live version provides, said Capossela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to reveal the price of the paid service. The supported Google Apps Premier Edition, by comparison, costs $50 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will let all of its partners resell this version of Office Web, but only a select few will be allowed to host Office Web as well, Capossela said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something Microsoft is already allowing some partners to do with its Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS) service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the chopping block&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three versions Microsoft plans to eliminate from Office 2010 include Office Basic, a low-end version offered for pre-installation by PC makers, Office Small Business and Office Enterprise, a corporate version that made its first appearance in Office 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves three main flavors for consumers and small businesses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Office Home and Student, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. The subject of many promotions targeted at price-sensitive students and households, Office Home and Student has been Microsoft's best-selling retail version for the past three years, Capossela said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Office Home and Business, a new version which includes the four apps in Home and Student along with Outlook 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Office Professional, which includes the five apps in Home and Business, plus Access and Publisher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises and large organizations that license Office in volume, Office 2010 will come in two main versions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Office Standard, which includes 6 apps -- Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Office Professional Plus, which will include access to all of Office's ten client apps: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, Access, InfoPath, Communicator, and SharePoint Workspace (formerly known as Groove). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not revealed prices for the various versions of Office, which in the 2007 edition, ranged between $149 and $499 at list price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will release three versions of its dominant Office software that users can access over the Web, catching up with products that rival Google Inc launched three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news helped send shares in the world's largest software maker up  2.7 percent by midday, more than double the gain in the Nasdaq Composite Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the latest salvo in an intensifying war between Microsoft and Google. Google announced plans last week to challenge Windows with a free operating system.

&lt;p&gt;Integration of Industry Leading Desktop Virtualization and Desktop Management
Infrastructure Lowers Costs via Unified Management and Delivers Next Generation
User-Centric Computing
NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS) today announced plans with Microsoft to
simplify desktop computing by extending their desktop virtualization
partnership. This integration will enable enterprise customers to manage all of
their Windows desktops and applications from a common platform to deliver a
consistent user experience to any device, anywhere. The combined solution will
unify management of physical and virtual desktops and applications via one
management platform, Microsoft System Center, while delivering a consistent
experience for Citrix users on any device from any location via one universal
client, Citrix Receiver. 

Enterprise IT organizations will be able to manage both distributed and
centrally hosted applications using Citrix XenApp and Microsoft System Center
Configuration Manager. Citrix XenApp will also extend Microsoft Application
Virtualization (App-V) to enable self-service delivery of applications on any
device using Citrix Receiver and Citrix Dazzle. In addition, Citrix announced
plans to extend integration of Citrix XenDesktop with the new Microsoft VDI
Suite licenses to enhance the companies` joint virtual desktop infrastructure
(VDI) solution. 

"In today`s challenging economic climate, IT needs to simplify computing with
fewer moving parts, and at the same time meet the increasing requirements of its
business and users," said Gordon Payne, senior vice president and general
manager, Delivery Systems Division, Citrix Systems. "By integrating our market
leading desktop virtualization and management solutions, Citrix and Microsoft
simplify IT service delivery and enhance end user productivity with a unified
management platform and one universal client." 

Simplifying Delivery of Applications to Managed and Unmanaged Desktops

Citrix and Microsoft will simplify application delivery for physical and virtual
desktops. Citrix will offer a System Center Configuration Manager connector for
XenApp that enables IT to deliver applications to any device - including managed
or unmanaged Windows and non-Windows end points. Together, Citrix and Microsoft
will enable IT to leverage their existing Microsoft System Center Configuration
Manager investments to publish, manage and report on both XenApp and App-V
applications. This integration is planned for availability in 1H 2010. 

"Together, Citrix and Microsoft are taking a significant next step to deliver
seamless, comprehensive application and desktop virtualization solutions by
helping companies maximize their existing technology investments," said Brad
Anderson, general manager, Management and Services Division, Microsoft Corp.
"For customers using System Center Configuration Manager and XenApp, this
connector will provide deeper control of their virtualization infrastructure,
lower costs by reusing existing infrastructure and simplify administration
across both products by unifying the management experience for physical and
virtual assets in the enterprise." 

Providing Users a High-definition, Easy-to-use and Self-service Experience

Citrix Receiver is a lightweight universal software client that makes accessing
virtual applications and desktops on any device as easy as turning on your TV.
By integrating App-V into Citrix Receiver, users will be able to access all
their applications with a common user experience using any device online or
offline. This approach radically simplifies desktop management for IT and gives
end users far more flexibility and independence in how and where they work. This
integration is planned for availability in 2H 2009. 

Introduced at Citrix Synergy in May 2009, Citrix Dazzle (see press release) is
the first self-service "storefront" for enterprise applications giving employees
self-service access to the applications they need to work without any training.
By integrating App-V into Citrix Dazzle, users will have easy access to their
applications and IT services, bringing the economics of the web to enterprise
IT. This integration is planned for availability in 1H 2010. 

Delivering the Industry Leading Desktop Virtualization Solution on the Microsoft
VDI Platform

Citrix XenDesktop is a key component of the joint VDI solution from Microsoft
and Citrix, which offers enterprises industry-leading virtual desktop
performance and enterprise scalability. The new Microsoft VDI Suite licenses,
announced today and available to Microsoft volume license customers in 4Q 2009,
will provide further customer value and make it simpler for customers to acquire
a platform for VDI. Citrix will fully support Microsoft VDI Suite and will
continue to enhance the ability for customers to manage their physical and
virtual desktops using the common Microsoft System Center suite of products.

&lt;p&gt;Growing Demand for Seamless Email Migration That Removes Technology Barriers
Between Disparate Email Systems
SAN MATEO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Please replace the release with the following corrected version due to multiple
revisions. 

The corrected release reads: 

CEMAPHORE SYSTEMS` MAILSHADOW EMAIL SYNC AND MIGRATION SOLUTIONS SHOWCASED AT
MICROSOFT WORLDWIDE PARTNER CONFERENCE

Growing Demand for Seamless Email Migration That Removes Technology Barriers
Between Disparate Email Systems

Cemaphore Systems&#8482;, a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner and authorized reseller
and advisor of Microsoft Business Productivity Online Suite, announced it was
participating in Worldwide Partner Conference 2009 put on by Microsoft Corp. in
New Orleans from July 13-16 as a key demo partner in the Microsoft Partner
Solution Showcase pavilion. 

"We`re honored to be one of a select group of partners to participate in the
Microsoft Partner Solution Showcase. Our innovative solutions empower customers
with the flexibility to move their email data without worrying about migration
downtime," said Tyrone Pike, chief executive officer of Cemaphore Systems. "As a
company, we`ve seen strong customer demand for non-disruptive email migration
capabilities that remove technology barriers between disparate email systems to
ensure a smooth transition." 

"Microsoft values its relationship with Cemaphore, and its continued dedication
to deliver additional value to Exchange Online and SharePoint Online," said
Stephan Schirrecker, director, partner strategy at Microsoft Corp. "Cemaphore
has developed the solutions and practices that help customers accelerate their
adoption of Microsoft Online Services." 

Growing Customer Base

New customers are seeing significant benefits to this flexible, easy approach to
email synchronization and migration. With Microsoft Exchange Server and
Microsoft Exchange Online, Cemaphore`s MailShadow solutions have gained traction
in many key industries. For example:

* As companies such as a global payment solutions firm go through mergers and
acquisitions, they frequently need an easy way to consolidate Exchange mailboxes
between the parent company and its newly acquired subsidiary. "Doing a
cross-domain Exchange migration between different companies can be complex,"
said John Liccione, CTO, Cemaphore Systems. "MailShadow`s powerful migration
capabilities simplify this process and enable an organization to migrate
hundreds of mailboxes without interrupting daily business operations or
requiring extra off-hours or weekend IT effort." 
* Companies may also need the freedom to switch email systems and hence require
portability of email data. A university in Saudi Arabia had experimented with
Google Apps but after careful evaluation decided that Exchange Server was its
ideal solution for 600 users. Though the university wanted to switch to Exchange
Server, the IT department had been concerned about how to move its Google data
to its new email system until its trusted systems integrator, SADA Systems,
recommended MailShadow. "MailShadow, with its bidirectional real-time sync, was
the obvious solution for this customer application," said Tony Safoian,
president/CEO of SADA Systems. "We also appreciate the collaborative engagement
with Cemaphore Systems." 
* Because of the compelling economic benefits, another key customer trend is the
adoption of email services in the cloud. Before implementing the final cloud
solution, a Boston-based hedge fund firm wanted to evaluate both Google Apps and
Exchange Online yet still have the flexibility to roll back to its on-premises
Exchange Server mailboxes. Thanks to MailShadow, the pilot went smoothly.
Because of its rich messaging capabilities, the customer also chose the Business
Productivity Online Suite. "Cemaphore Systems has provided not just a powerful
messaging solution but also outstanding technical support," said Chayan
Rattanavijai, IT Specialist. "It`s great to have a vendor I count on for help
when I need it."

"Business users are increasingly seeking more flexible and economical options to
traditional IT solutions. Cemaphore Systems is a company that appears to have
cracked the code for painless synchronization between different versions of
Exchange Server, Exchange Online and Google Apps," said Michael E. Dortch,
principal analyst and managing editor at DortchOnIT.com. "This is significant
because MailShadow technology can be used to provide seamless migration for
business-critical Exchange deployments, whether on premises or in the cloud." 

Cemaphore will be at Microsoft pavilion, #445, from July 13-16 during the
Worldwide Partner Conference in New Orleans. 

About Cemaphore Systems, Inc.

Cemaphore Systems provides email synchronization and continuity software to
enable continuous replication, instant recovery and seamless migration between
Google Apps, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Exchange Online, Microsoft Hosted
Exchange, and other email systems. With MailShadow&#174;, customers can synchronize,

&lt;p&gt;SILVER SPRING, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Colonel Gray Heppner M.D., deputy commander of the Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research (WRAIR) [www.wrair.army.mil], was recently honored by Kiwanis
International for his role in the development of a promising vaccine against
malaria. Heppner was presented the 2009 World Service Medal
[http://kif.kiwanis.org/KIF/where/wsm.aspx]. 

The Kiwanis World Service Medal, established in 1985, recognizes individuals who
devote a significant part of their lives to meeting the needs of others. One
medal is awarded each year. Previous winners include Mother Teresa, Sir Roger
Moore, Audrey Hepburn, Nancy Reagan and Rosalynn Carter. 

"The malaria death toll in Africa is staggering, the equivalent of seven 747
airliners full of children crashing into Mount Kilimanjaro every day," said Don
Canady, Kiwanis International president. "Worldwide, some 500 million children
and adults are sickened with malaria every year. We eliminated malaria in the
United States 50 years ago, so our children are no longer threatened. Now is the
time to eliminate malaria everywhere. The children of the world deserve action."


Action is what Heppner has been taking since 1990, when he joined the WRAIR
Malaria Vaccine Program. He has played a key role in the development of the
world`s most promising malaria vaccine called RTS,S. His team of scientists from
WRAIR, working with GlaxoSmithKline, carried out critical studies of the vaccine
in Africa, Asia, Europe and the USA. With the Gates Foundation beginning in
2001, global efforts broadened, resulting in the start this year of Africa-wide
multi-center trials intended to license the RTS,S malaria vaccine for children.
Heppner notes, "There is real hope the RTS,S vaccine could reduce severe malaria
by 50%." 

Strong international partnerships are the key to elimination. "Only with a team
of teams, ministries of health, NGOs, industry, USAID, the Gates Foundation, and
research institutes like the WRAIR, can malaria be eliminated. The tool kit to
build a malaria-free world needs more than just bed nets, pesticides and
treatment drugs; it requires a vaccine. The scientists and physicians at WRAIR
are committed to work until there is a 100% effective malaria vaccine. I hope
this Kiwanis International award will inspire thousands more to join the fight,"
said Heppner.

&lt;p&gt;Bing.com surged to more than 22 million monthly visits; Dell, Sears, Hotels.com,
Marriott and Home Depot are among the savvy, early adopting advertisers
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
AdGooroo (www.adgooroo.com), a leading provider of online marketing competitive
intelligence and keyword tools, today released its latest quarterly Search
Engine Advertiser Update. While Bing achieved impressive traffic growth in the
second quarter, advertisers appear to be adopting Bing at a much slower pace,
according to the report. 

"We measured a 5.46 percent increase in first-page advertisers in May (just
ahead of Bing`s release) but saw a 3.31 percent decrease in June," said AdGooroo
Founder and Chief Gooroo Rich Stokes. "The data also uncovered substantial
decreases in ad coverage; so Bing is serving up significantly fewer first page
ads than Live Search had served previously. This is great news for Bing users
and advertisers since reduced ad coverage typically improves the user experience
and indicates less competition for advertisers that decide to get in the game." 

The new report includes documentation of other trends that emerged during the
second quarter; several full color charts that compare the second quarter and
year ending June 2009 performance of Bing, Google and Yahoo!; and alphabetical
listings of each of the three engines` top 25 advertisers. The alphabetical
lists of top advertisers contain some interesting and noteworthy newcomers.
Google`s list of top second quarter advertisers, for example, included Bing.com.
Newcomers on the Microsoft list of top advertisers include many well known
brands that have embraced the engine early, perhaps hoping to capitalize on the
substantial Microsoft advertising campaign currently supporting the Bing launch.


The report also covers year over year growth in advertiser base for each of the
three engines. Although Microsoft generated an impressive 35 percent growth in
its advertiser base year over year, Google won this battle by increasing its own
base of advertisers, the largest by far among the three engines, by 52 percent.
Yahoo! grew only 14 percent over the same time period.

the report, "Search Engine Advertising Update - Q209" in the AdGooroo Research
Library: http://www.adgooroo.com/adgooroo_research_library.php.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Silicon Valley startups, increasingly dropping Microsoft (MSFT.O) and turning to Web-based software, may be the crucial opening Google (GOOG.O) needs for its Chrome operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts and executives say Google, which unveiled the Chrome this week in a direct challenge to Microsoft's decades-old dominance of computer operating systems and business applications, will take years to get significant share of the market, but startups might be their way in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of tech entrepreneurs argue that Microsoft's current software is out of date and inefficient because, unlike applications that run off the Web in a "cloud" environment, they run one copy per person at a time, rather than allowing multiple users to share information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a business setting you never work on things alone," said Tien Tzuo, chief executive of Zuora, a company that sells software to facilitate billing online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea of sending a file back and forth is just archaic," said Tzuo. "Why not just give employees an inexpensive device that allows them to plug into the Internet?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Windows nonetheless dominates. It remains the operating system software for about 95 percent of PCs, with more than 950 million copies running worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to Windows's success is that it offers the most applications and draws the most programmers. But startups, who thrive on low-cost efficiency, say Google's operating system -- which will be free -- offers superior applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many have already switched to Web-based software such as Google Apps for everything from email to word processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRAVELING LIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Sifry, the chief executive of Offbeat Guides, which provides personalized on-line guides for 30,000 destinations, said Google Apps allow him to travel without a computer because he can access all of his applications on-line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, with operating system-based applications most companies would have to maintain, update, install, costing time and money, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Offbeat Guides contractors around the world collaborate online with the main office, Sifry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that I don't have to worry about doing technical support on their computers and software helps an extraordinary amount," he said. "Whenever Google does a bug fix it works on all of their systems, without us having to spend any effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts estimate about 2 percent of PC users will try out the Chrome OS in its first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has said it will first try to persuade the likes of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and Acer (2353.TW) to offer its operating system in low-cost netbooks that work mostly off the Web, allowing existing individual users to switch painlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts are uncertain if Google's Chrome can gain rapid traction among corporations, law firms and other businesses because of the sheer cost of switching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Siminoff, chief executive of PhoneTag -- which faces direct competition from Google for software that transcribes phone messages -- uses both Google and Microsoft and similarly lets his employees use any application they want. But he concedes that some Microsoft applications remain indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Siminoff and Sifry say they need at least a few copies of Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet software so they can exchange data with lawyers and accountants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chad Wilbur, a senior Quist Valuation financial analyst, said Excel enjoys "mindshare" among long-standing users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's beat into you from the time you learn on a computer. All our client documents arrive in Excel format. There are no comparable products," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Tzuo argues that will change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sure, there are certain functions that are still only in Excel," he said, noting his finance department uses it for complex spreadsheets spanning multiple files. But every day that passes, the number of things that Excel does, that Google Spreadsheet doesn't, gets smaller and smaller."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said Monday a
boiler linked to gasoline-making Fluid Catalytic Cracker Unit No. 3 at its
572,0000 barrel-per-day Baytown, Texas refinery remained down for planned
work after it was shut late last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This boiler is still down and we don't have an estimate on when it
will be back up," Exxon spokeswoman Neely Nelson told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boiler outage "is not impacting production and customer needs are
being met as this one of several boilers in FCC No. 3," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a filing July 10 with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality,
Exxon said the FCC boiler will be shut that day for planned maintenance,
noting associated emissions may last through July 12.

&lt;p&gt;Dotfuscator&#174; and the Runtime Intelligence Service Combine to Provide Software
Plus Services Instrumentation Solution to Improve Application Quality, Value and
Service Level Assurance 
NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
PreEmptive Solutions, the leading provider of solutions to protect, monitor and
manage software development investments, announced here today the immediate
availability of application monitoring and management support inside the
Microsoft Azure Services Platform. 

Development teams can now track Azure application feature usage to improve
adoption and quality. ISVs can integrate Azure evaluation software usage into
Microsoft Dynamics CRM to increase win rates. Enterprises can integrate Azure
application runtime data into Microsoft Business Intelligence Solutions to
improve business agility. 

"Application developers targeting Azure must find innovative ways to measure
usage, adoption and end-user patterns," said Gabriel Torok, CEO PreEmptive
Solutions. "This visibility into application resource utilization and stability
within the cloud will help their organizations establish and manage appropriate
service level requirements, as well as anticipate market requirements instead of
just reacting to them." 

According to Gartner, Inc. "Tools unaware of the target runtime environment,
requiring manual intervention to deploy and manage applications, are not
cloud-enabled," in How to Identify a Cloud Application Development Tool 2Q09,
June 17, 2009, Eric Knipp. Among the report`s recommendations were "Pick tools
that integrate with cloud system infrastructure natively, rather than creating
your own. The capabilities of cloud system infrastructure are evolving, and
"rolling your own" tool requires accepting the risks associated with the dynamic
nature of the target platform." 

The Dotfuscator Suite can inject feature and session-level instrumentation into
compiled .NET components running inside the Microsoft Azure Services Platform.
The runtime data can be streamed to one or more end points including PreEmptive
Solutions Runtime Intelligence Service - a software plus service solution that
provides near real-time dashboards, alerts and usage analytics. 

In addition to supporting Azure deployed components, the Dotfuscator Suite
supports monitoring and instrumentation of .NET components targeting Microsoft
Silverlight, the Microsoft .NET Compact Framework and every version of the .NET
framework including the beta versions of 4.0. 

A starter set of instrumentation capabilities needed to implement monitoring and
management support for the Azure Services Platform is also included in the
community edition of Dotfuscator recently shipped with Microsoft`s Visual
Studio&#174; 2010 beta 1.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Free version to be released in first half of next year &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Included with next major release of Office suite &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Jim Finkle &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    BOSTON, July 13 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will release a free version of its dominant Office software that users can access over the Web, catching up with products that arch rival Google Inc (GOOG.O) launched three years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest software maker will offer a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation software and a note-taking program with the same look and feel of their counterparts in the Office suites that it sells for personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It is the latest salvo in an intensifying war between the two technology giants. Google announced plans last week to challenge Windows with a free operating system. Microsoft introduced a new search engine, dubbed Bing, last month, that has taken a small amount of market share from Google. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A free version of Office could hurt sales of Microsoft's top-selling and most profitable business unit. One of Office's most popular titles is a home version that sells for $150. It includes the four programs that Microsoft will give away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft is in a tough spot. Their competition isn't just undercutting them. They are giving away the competitive product," said Sheri McLeish, an analyst with Forrester Research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Office division rang up operating profit of $9.3 billion on sales of $14.3 billion in the first three quarters of the software maker's current fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    McLeish said she expects Microsoft to overtake Google in the market as the hundreds of millions of people who use Office flock to try out the Internet version. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft will seek to make money by using it to lead those users to its ad-supported websites, including the Bing search engine. Analysts have said that Bing's early signs of success suggest Microsoft may be rounding the corner in efforts to turn around its money-losing Internet division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft will release the free offering when it starts selling Office 2010, it next major release of the product, sometime in the first half of next year. Its current version came out in January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The software maker unveiled an early release on Monday at a conference for business partners in New Orleans. It will be distributed to tens of thousands of testers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Company spokeswoman Janice Kapner said the free Web version will provide "a very rich experience" and probably have more functionality than Google. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Office 2010 is among a wave of upgrades to Microsoft programs planned over the next year. A new version of its ubiquitous Windows operating system is coming out in October and a new version of its widely used email server is also in the works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft also plans two other Internet versions of Office for businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It will host one of them at its own data centers, charging a yet-to-be-announced fee for that service. Businesses with premium service contracts will have the choice of running the Web-based version from their own data centers at no extra cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Richard Chang) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((jim.finkle@thomsonreuters.com; + 1 617 856 4344; Reuters Messaging: jim.finkle.reuters.com@reuters.net))   Keywords: MICROSOFT/OFFICE  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

medication errors, drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. By registering for
iGuard.org, consumers who have a HealthVault account can immediately begin
benefitting from this potentially life-saving medication safety monitoring
service. 

Barbara Munroe of Phoenix, Ariz., is an iGuard.org user who has epilepsy and
takes numerous medications. "After wasting away for a year with no energy, I
registered all my medicines on iGuard.org," said Munroe. "To my surprise, I soon
received an alert about an interaction between Paxil and another medication I'm
taking, Zonegran. Since deleting Paxil from my medications my energy has soared.
Without iGuard.org's information, I would still be on the couch - or worse. It
has saved my life." 

Consumer-Centric Medication Safety Tool Empowers Patients

"By providing consumers with immediate, customized information regarding the
safety of their prescription and over-the-counter medications, iGuard.org
furthers our goal of enabling patients to take greater control over managing
their own health," said David Cerino, general manager of the Consumer Health
Solutions Group at Microsoft. 

When people register for the iGuard.org service through HealthVault, they
immediately receive a personalized safety report by email that checks their
medications for potential side-effects, treatment duplication and drug
interactions. They also automatically receive updated safety reports as the
medications in their HealthVault profile change, as well as rapid email safety
and recall alerts, as new information emerges about their medications. 

For example, last month the FDA issued alerts for a number of medications,
including Stamina-RX Dietary Supplements, Ibuprofen, Zicam Cold Remedy Nasal
Products, Levemir Insulin, Acetaminophen, Zenecore plus, Digoxin and Propafenone
tablets, Raptiva and stimulant medications for children with
Attention-Defecit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This month the FDA issued
alerts for Chantix, Welbutrin, Zyban and Lantus. 

"Every single person who is taking these medications and is registered with
iGuard.org received a personalized email message with essential information
about the recall or alert," said Hugo Stephenson, M.D., founder and president of
iGuard.org. "Daily we receive compelling feedback from people telling us how
valuable this service is to their general health management, and how it provides
potentially life-saving medication information. In many cases, patients bring
the alerts to their physicians or pharmacists who weren`t yet aware of the
recall or alert." 

Stephenson said, "We are extremely excited to be working with Microsoft and
their transformational vision for healthcare. Now anyone seeking to become more
informed about their health-and a better way to manage their medical
information-is empowered with tools to help them play a more active role in
their own health care. 

Microsoft HealthVault, launched in October 2007, is a personal health
application platform designed to put consumers in control of their health
information. HealthVault provides a security- and privacy-enhanced foundation on
which a broad ecosystem of providers can build innovative health and wellness
solutions such as personal health records, disease management, fitness, weight
loss and other Web applications. HealthVault can be used to collect and store
health information that would otherwise reside in disparate systems and transfer
the information between a variety of providers' health services and systems. It
enables the reuse and free flow of interoperable and transportable personal
health information. For more information, visit www.HealthVault.com. 

iGuard.org offers a free and secure source of information for registered users
who want to get informed, stay informed and share feedback about their
medications. Founded by drug researchers in 2007, iGuard.org is committed to
improving medication safety by providing 1.5 million Americans with the
information they need to take more a more active role in their own health care.
In addition to safety related information, patients will have the opportunity to
learn about clinical trials for specific conditions and or medications.
Registration is free online at iGuard.org.

&lt;p&gt;IT Administrators Cite Lack of Time and Resources and Application Compatibility
as Main Deterrents to Migration
BOCA RATON, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Nearly 60 percent of IT administrators do not plan to migrate to Microsoft
Windows 7, despite the operating systems` acclaim and notable user interface
improvements from Windows Vista, a survey by ScriptLogic Corporation revealed.
ScriptLogic (www.scriptlogic.com), a leading provider of systems lifecycle
management solutions for Microsoft Windows-based networks, today announced the
results of an end-user survey that illustrates barriers preventing IT
administrators from Windows 7 deployment when it is available later this year. 

The survey, which was distributed to 20,000 Microsoft Windows systems IT
administrators and generated more than 1,000 responses, includes key findings
such as:

* When asked about their plans to deploy Windows 7, nearly 60 percent (59.2) of
respondents said they have no plans to deploy at this time; 34 percent plan to
deploy by the end of 2010 and only 5.4 percent plan to deploy by the end of 2009
- quickly following scheduled general availability in October 2009. 
* IT administrators note the biggest barriers to deploying Windows 7 as lack of
time and resources (42.4 percent) and application compatibility (38.9 percent),
followed by OS deployment/migration (8.8 percent), hardware support (7.6
percent) and migration of user settings (3.2 percent).

ScriptLogic has introduced a new page on its website that discusses Windows 7
migration. The web resource includes full survey results as well as suggested
third-party resources that eliminate migration roadblocks. For example,
ScriptLogic notes tools available from Microsoft that check applications to be
deployed and ensure their installation, configuration and security settings are
compatible with the new operating system. Web users can visit the online
resource at http://www.scriptlogic.com/Windows7/landingpage. 

"While it is important that our staff have access to the latest operating
systems, we won`t migrate to Windows 7 until at least the first service pack has
been released," said Sean Angus, senior PC LAN tech for Middlesex Hospital in
Connecticut. "The IT department must complete thorough testing to ensure that
the applications we rely on each day, specifically radiology information systems
and financial applications, will be compatible, before deploying any new
platforms or software to our 1,500 desktops." 

Many of the issues that prevented organizations from deploying Windows Vista are
still relevant in preparation for Windows 7 migration. ScriptLogic Corporation
offers various solutions to ease migration challenges. When Windows 7 is
available, customers using ScriptLogic`s Desktop Authority can simply add new
computers running Windows 7 to the domain. As a result, the user`s personal
customizations and settings will automatically be applied to the new Windows
7-based machine, making desktops immediately usable and employees instantly
productive. Additionally, ScriptLogic`s Desktop Authority MSI Studio will
provide IT administrators with a tool to test, customize, manage and simplify
the deployment of applications on machines running Windows 7. 

"This survey highlights the impact the economy has had on IT, with thirty five
percent of respondents saying they`ve saved money by skipping upgrades and
delaying purchases," said Nick Cavalancia, vice president of Windows management
at ScriptLogic. "This is likely a reason why IT administrators will put off a
Windows 7 migration. ScriptLogic continues to upgrade and enhance our Desktop
Authority product line. So, when our customer base is ready to deploy Windows 7,
we will have the solutions available to simplify the process."

Children`s will also be implementing athenahealth`s revenue cycle management
service, athenaCollectorSM. 

While a highly functional EHR is an important improvement, to maximize patient
care, an organization must bring together all of the information it has from
multiple resources at the point of care for each child. To achieve this
unprecedented leap forward, Cook Children`s will implement the Microsoft Amalga
Unified Intelligence System (UIS) 2009. This strategic data aggregation platform
will span Cook Children`s multiple lines of business, including CCPN, its
Medical Center, and its Health Plan. With Amalga UIS, Cook Children`s will be
able to unify inpatient, outpatient, lab, radiology and home health data,
enabling clinicians to access real-time information from a single source. 

Additionally, through this collaborative effort with athenahealth and Microsoft,
Cook Children`s will enable its patients to connect with Microsoft HealthVault,
an online personal health platform that allows individuals to store their health
information, or their whole family`s health information, in one
security-enhanced location. Using HealthVault, consumers have complete control
over their electronic health data and can give permission to their physicians
and other healthcare providers to view it and give input, supporting more
informed decisions around patient care. 

As planning with athenahealth and Microsoft progressed, it became clear to Cook
Children`s that through athenahealth, these same tools could be made available
to physicians nationally. Through athenahealth, Cook Children`s has found a way
to allow primary care physicians across the country to electronically refer
their patients for virtual consults with the pediatric subspecialists employed
by CCPN. Also as part of the collaboration, athenahealth in conjunction with
Cook Childrens`s purchasing organization, PedsPal, will offer preferred pricing
for athenahealth`s EHR and its revenue cycle management services to PedsPal`s
1,100 affiliated physicians spanning 22 states as part of this larger national
clinical connectivity strategy. 

"This unique venture with these proactive organizations brings a fresh solution
that will be reproducible and sustainable in medical practices across the
country at a very low cost," said Rick Merrill, President and CEO of Cook
Children`s Health Care System. "Most importantly it gives a child, regardless of
their insurance or ability to pay, collaborative care and the starting point for
a permanent internet accessible medical record. In selecting athenahealth`s
clinical and revenue cycle management service our physicians will now be
instantly connected on a common web-based platform," said Merrill. "Through
Amalga UIS, we will be able to integrate our medical center, physician
practices, health plan and home health company. Cook Children`s will be uniquely
positioned to use leading edge health information technologies to advance the
quality of patient care." 

"Cook Children`s Health Care System continues to demonstrate its leadership
position nationally and athenahealth is thrilled to have been selected to work
with them and Microsoft as they deploy our unique ambulatory EHR and revenue
cycle management services that we believe will improve both the clinical and
financial outcomes for its patients and physicians," said Jonathan Bush,
Chairman and CEO of athenahealth. "With all of our clients sharing the same
national physician network, athenaNet, Cook Children`s is now in a position to
execute on an exciting new clinical connectivity strategy that will benefit
children throughout Texas and across the country." 

"We`re excited to collaborate with Cook Children`s and athenahealth to implement
a health IT strategy that will help improve the care and outcomes of pediatric
patients across the country" said Steve Shihadeh, Vice President of Microsoft`s
Health Solutions Group. "By unlocking and connecting the vast amounts of data
across the health enterprise with Amalga UIS, we can give the professionals at
Cook Children`s the right information at the right time, helping them to make
optimal decisions for improving the health of children."

&lt;p&gt;Growing Demand for Seamless Email Migration That Removes Technology Barriers
Between Disparate Email Systems
SAN MATEO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Cemaphore Systems&#8482;, a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner and authorized reseller
and advisor of Microsoft Business Productivity Online Suite, announced it was
participating in Worldwide Partner Conference 2009 put on by Microsoft Corp. in
New Orleans from July 13-16 as a key demo partner in the Microsoft Partner
Solution Showcase pavillion. 

"We`re honored to be one of a select group of partners to participate in the
Microsoft Partner Solution Showcase. Our innovative solutions empower customers
with the flexibility to move their email data without worrying about migration
downtime," said Tyrone Pike, chief executive officer of Cemaphore Systems. "As a
company, we`ve seen strong customer demand for non-disruptive email migration
capabilities that remove technology barriers between disparate email systems to
ensure a smooth transition." 

"Microsoft values its relationship with Cemaphore, and its continued dedication
to deliver additional value to Exchange Online and SharePoint Online," said
Stephan Schirrecker, director, partner strategy at Microsoft Corp. "Cemaphore
has developed the solutions and practices that help customers accelerate their
adoption of Microsoft Online Services." 

Growing Customer Base

New customers are seeing significant benefits to this flexible, easy approach to
email synchronization and migration. With Microsoft Exchange Server and
Microsoft Exchange Online, Cemaphore`s MailShadow solutions have gained traction
in many key industries. For example:

* As companies such as a global payment solutions firm go through mergers and
acquisitions, they frequently need an easy way to consolidate Exchange mailboxes
between the parent company and its newly acquired subsidiary. "Doing a
cross-domain Exchange migration between different companies can be complex,"
said John Liccione, CTO, Cemaphore Systems. "MailShadow`s powerful migration
capabilities simplify this process and enable an organization to migrate
hundreds of mailboxes without interrupting daily business operations or
requiring extra off-hours or weekend IT effort." 
* Companies may also need the freedom to switch email systems and hence require
portability of email data. A university in Saudi Arabia had experimented with
Google Apps but after careful evaluation decided that Exchange Server was its
ideal solution for 600 users. Though the university wanted to switch to Exchange
Server, the IT department had been concerned about how to move its Google data
to its new email system until its trusted systems integrator, SADA Systems,
recommended MailShadow. "MailShadow, with its bidirectional real-time sync, was
the obvious solution for this customer application," said Tony Safoian,
president/CEO of SADA Systems. "We also appreciate the collaborative engagement
with Cemaphore Systems." 
* Because of the compelling economic benefits, another key customer trend is the
adoption of email services in the cloud. Before implementing the final cloud
solution, a Boston-based hedge fund firm wanted to evaluate both Google Apps and
Exchange Online yet still have the flexibility to roll back to its on-premises
Exchange Server mailboxes. Thanks to MailShadow, the pilot went smoothly.
Because of its rich messaging capabilities, the customer also chose the Business
Productivity Online Suite. "Cemaphore Systems has provided not just a powerful
messaging solution but also outstanding technical support," said Chayan
Rattanavijai, IT Specialist. "It`s great to have a vendor I count on for help
when I need it."

"Business users are increasingly seeking more flexible and economical options to
traditional IT solutions. Cemaphore Systems is a company that appears to have
cracked the code for painless synchronization between different versions of
Exchange Server, Exchange Online and Google Apps," said Michael E. Dortch,
principal analyst and managing editor at DortchOnIT.com. "This is significant
because MailShadow technology can be used to provide seamless migration for
business-critical Exchange deployments, whether on premises or in the cloud." 

Cemaphore will be at Microsoft pavillion, #445, from July 13-16 during the
Worldwide Partner Conference in New Orleans.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said quarterly earnings surged 33 percent on blowout trading results, trouncing forecasts and putting the bank on pace for hefty bonuses that could draw unwanted scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results continued Goldman's extraordinary rebound from a near meltdown of the U.S. banking industry last fall that led to a $125 billion taxpayer bailout for its largest members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman set aside $6.65 billion for salary, bonuses and benefits in the quarter, up by nearly half from the quarter ended in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That puts the average Goldman employee on pace to earn more than $900,000 this year. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, senior officers and star traders will likely receive tens of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government wanted "to make sure that the banks are making money, so they do make money," said Francis Campeau, a broker at MF Global Canada in Montreal. "The flip side is now one could argue they're making too much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman reported net income for common shareholders of $2.7 billion, or $4.93 a share. That compares with $2.05 billion, or $4.58, in the quarter ended May 30, 2008, before the bank switched to a calendar-year schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had forecast earnings of $3.49 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares ended Tuesday's trade on the New York Stock Exchange up 22 cents to close at $149.66. The shares are up nearly 80 percent this year, compared with a 24 percent rise in the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first major U.S. bank to report second-quarter results, Goldman said trading income nearly doubled from a year ago to $10.78 billion while its equity underwriting business produced record revenue of $736 million. Goldman's traders thrived in an environment of wide price swings, robust demand and fewer rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's less competition out there," Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told reporters in a briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a subsequent interview, Viniar told Reuters he could not predict whether the firm could keep up the pace all year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't tell you we will have this level of earnings every quarter," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT OUT OF THE WOODS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis wreaked havoc on Wall Street last year, collapsing Bear Stearns, sending Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy, and forcing Merrill Lynch into a shotgun wedding with Bank of America Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's second-quarter investment banking revenue of $1.44 billion was down 15 percent from a year ago but rose 75 percent from the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The environment is very conducive to the type of things they do," said Keith Davis, an analyst at Farr, Miller  Washington. "Spreads are very wide, fixed-income and equity issuances have been pretty strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has come under fire for its government connections, seemingly sailing through a deep recession shortly after accepting $10 billion of taxpayer bailout money and benefiting from a host of other government programs, including access to the U.S. Federal Reserve's borrowing window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank incurred a one-time $426 million charge in the second quarter related to last month's repayment of loans from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. Viniar said there was "no timeline" for buying back stock warrants issued to the government under TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the conference call with investors, Viniar said the company has amassed substantial capital as it awaits word from the government on new capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are going to be new capital regulations coming out," said Viniar, adding that he didn't expect them to harm Goldman's business. "We don't know what they are going to be so we have to wait and see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON MUTED ON GOLDMAN'S BIG DAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaction to Goldman's earnings was muted among U.S. lawmakers, some of whom have been harsh critics of Wall Street's excesses proceeding the credit crunch and bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want all the people we gave money to make profits. Pay the money back with interest and have a net zero cost to our program," House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representative Paul Kanjorski, a senior Democrat on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, said Goldman's soaring profits were a sign of economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is there a law in the United States that you can't make profits?" Kanjorski asked reporters after a panel meeting. "It shows that there will be some capital available to be invested and that's a good sign for the economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others were angered by bonuses that they felt were subsidized by taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There should be at least some ethical obligation on the part of the Goldman Sachs because their bonus pool is backed by taxpayers who are suffering through the poorest economy that we've seen in 70 years," said Rich Ferlauto, director of corporate governance and pension investments for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration and key lawmakers in Washington are preparing plans to overhaul regulation of the banking sector. The plans include clamping down on the largely unregulated derivatives market -- a major source of profit for Goldman in the quarter -- and establishing a consumer protection agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said his firm was "not immune to public sentiment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know it. We see it. We don't like it," Viniar said of the firm's vilification in parts of the media. "We believe we are doing good things. We are helping the economy recover. I don't like reading bad things about Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder, Elinor Comlay, Juan Lagorio, Jonathan Spicer in New York, Richard Cowan, Kevin Drawbaugh and Rachelle Younglai in Washington; writing by Joe Giannone, editing by John Wallace, Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

characters such as %, ?, #, etc. When search engine spiders see these special
characters, they stop crawling the site and rank these dynamically driven sites
very low in terms of content relevancy. This means that your unpaid, natural
search results will appear lower (or not at all) in search engine results. 

This new service offering will take URLs that can be difficult for search
engines to read, index and display in natural search results, and will then
remove special characters and create English-language URLs to display smart
content such as company, catalog and product information. This will be
tremendously beneficial for e-commerce web sites with dynamic content. 

The Zobrist Search Friendly URLs offering will create effective URLs by using
substitution rules to add relevant content to the URLs. These substitution rules
automatically populate the URLs with catalog information so that when new
products are added, the URLs are immediately updated, allowing customers to hit
your site directly from the search engine. Besides Friendly URLs, this offering
also includes the generation of an XML sitemap, and important page tags such as
title, heading 1, heading 2, meta tag, and alt-image tags that also help your
natural search results. 

The offering is a fixed-price bid between $9,995 and $14,995 depending on the
complexity of the URLs. The Zobrist team will provide a free assessment to
determine the exact cost of the service. 

Benefits of activating search-friendly URLs on your site include:

* Increase the effectiveness of unpaid, organic search for your entire website 
* Increase Google page ranking for each page 
* Increase the number of pages that can be crawled by search engine spiders 
* Increase traffic to and sales from your site

Companies that have deployed Search Friendly URLs include Harney Hardware, Lee
Jeans and The North Face. For additional information on the news that is the

&lt;p&gt; * TSX rises 0.95 pct to 9,986.15 for second day of gains

 * Financials lead TSX after strong Goldman Sachs results
 (Adds details, quote, updates numbers)

 By John McCrank

 TORONTO, July 14 (Reuters) - Toronto's main stock index
finished higher for a second straight session on Tuesday in a
broad rally led by financials, which were encouraged by strong
results at Goldman Sachs (GS.N) in the United States.

 The SP/TSX composite index .GSPTSE closed up 94.22
points, or 0.95 percent, at 9,986.15. Nine of the index's 10
main groups were higher.

 The financials sector, which accounts for about a third of
the index, ended up 2.01 percent, and the top six advancers on
the TSX were from the financial group, led by Royal Bank of
Canada (RY.TO), up 2.9 percent at C$47.86.

 Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) followed, up 1.7 percent at
C$58.96. Bank of Nova Scotia also rose 1.7 percent, to
C$42.14.

 "What's helped (the market) for the past couple of days has
been good earnings and good economic news," said Ian Nakamoto,
director of research at MacDougall, MacDougall  MacTier.

 Quarterly earnings at Goldman Sachs surged 33 percent on
strong trading results, handily beating market expectations.
The U.S. banking industry was near collapse just nine months
ago. [ID:nN14289399]

  Johnson  Johnson's (JNJ.N) quarterly results also beat
analysts' forecasts, pointing to resilient pharmaceutical and
consumer product sales in the United States. [ID:nN14253944]

 "They're sort of two extremes here, I mean Goldman Sachs is
very much of a risk animal, and Johnson  Johnson tends to
attract risk-averse investors, and both companies beat
expectations," said Nakamoto. "It's good that it's not just one
sector doing well."

 Alimentation Couche-Tard (ATDb.TO), North America's
second-biggest convenience store retailer and operator of a
string of gas bars, rose 4.3 percent to C$14.92, after it
reported a stronger quarterly profit. [ID:nN14255046]

 In the index's materials group, Barrick Gold (ABX.TO)
climbed 1.3 percent to C$37.38, and Kinross Gold (K.TO) rose
1.1 percent to C$21.17, as the price of gold edged higher on
U.S. inflation worries. [ID:nLE288914] The group as a whole was
up 0.66 percent.

 Fertilizer producer Potash Corp (POT.TO) was one of the
biggest drags on the index, limiting gains in the materials
group.

 Potash Corp fell 2.5 percent to C$95.52, extending a slide
that started on Monday after the head of India's IFFCO, a
farmer fertilizer cooperative, said that three international
companies had agreed to supply Indian buyers with potash well
below current spot market prices. [ID:nBNG121776]

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp warned that cybercriminals have attacked users of its Office software for Windows PCs, exploiting a programing flaw that the software giant has yet to repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker issued the warning on Tuesday as it released patches to address nine other security holes in its software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite today's fixes, Windows users continue to be under attack. Microsoft is taking two steps forward, while attackers are putting it one step back," said Dave Marcus, McAfee Inc's Avert Labs director of security research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals target Microsoft programs because they are so widely used, allowing them to go after the largest number of potential victims with one set of code. (Windows runs more than 90 percent of the world's PCs. Office has some 500 million users).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackers take advantage of the Office vulnerability by booby-trapping websites with malicious code that loads onto computers running Office software. Infected PCs are commandeered into a botnet, a network of hijacked computers. They are used for identity theft, spamming and other cybercrimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not say how many machines were attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can prevent attacks by disabling functions within the Office software that allow it to work over the Web. Microsoft has posted a tool for doing that on its website -- here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office XP, 2003 and 2007 are vulnerable to the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Carol Bishopric and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) on Tuesday portrayed its energy trading as hedging that
should be exempt from proposed U.S. government limits on the
volume of contracts that speculators can trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman's Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the
bank's trades are vital to enable hedging. He said during a
conference call that proposed regulations may have little
impact on Goldman's commodities results if the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission retains hedging exemptions currently
granted to banks doing energy trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Consumers need hedging. Producers need hedging. And you
need financial intermediaries to help do that," Goldman's Chief
Financial Official David Viniar told a conference call with
analysts after unveiling the company's second quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which declared record revenues in the second
quarter from combined fixed income, currencies and commodities
trading, is the first major Wall Street bank to respond to
regulations proposed by the CFTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CFTC said last week it plans to seek federal limits on
the amount of oil and gas contracts that traders, including
financial speculators, are allowed to hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big Wall Street banks such as Goldman hold huge positions
in trading of energy derivatives, created to allow commercial
players to hedge risk. The CFTC is considering outright
positions limits, as well reviewing whether it should continue
to grant exemptions to financial players allowed to buy as many
energy contracts as they need for hedging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CFTC officials have said the goal is to rein in excessive
speculation blamed for driving oil and commodity prices to
record levels last year before markets crashed in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency said it would seek the views of market
participants for the regulations, which may be enforced as
early as October. [ID:nL8366016]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which is also involved in physical trading of
crude oil, will wait to see how the new regulations pan out,
Viniar said. "The devil is in the details...so it's hard to
say."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even before the CFTC initiatives rolled out last week, the
Obama administration had proposed bringing unregulated
over-the-counter trades in commodities to exchanges that clear
them centrally and transparently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar said Goldman supports that move because it was "a
believer in central clearing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think that is good...for the market, and actually it's
good for us because it levels the playing field in some ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by David Gregorio)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The yen fell on Tuesday as earnings of Goldman Sachs surpassed expectations, stoking modest hopes for an economic recovery and boosting investors' appetite for stocks and higher-yielding assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But traders were cautious ahead of earnings news from other U.S. banks while lackluster data from Germany weighed on the euro, keeping it rooted in a broad range against the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slight rise in risk appetite supported higher-yielding currencies and those tied to commodity prices such as the Canadian dollar, which hit a three-week high earlier against the greenback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar tend to fall when risk appetite rises as investors target higher-yielding currencies and assets such as stocks and commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report on Tuesday showed better-than-expected June U.S. retail sales, but traders noted that much of the 0.6 percent rise in retail sales was driven by higher gasoline prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Retail sales were better than expected, so that's a bit of good news, but there has been little follow-through as the market is uncertain which way it wants to trade," said Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salvaggio also said that data showing a sharp rise in U.S. producer prices last month, which pushed government bond yields to rise, may stoke inflation fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other traders noted the thin summer trading conditions, which adds up to a euro stuck in a broad $1.3850-$1.4050 range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro was 0.1 percent lower at $1.3966 and slightly higher against the yen at 130.12 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against the yen, the dollar was last 0.7 percent higher at 93.65 yen. The greenback extended gains versus the Japanese currency and hit session highs in late trading after U.S. chip maker Intel Corp. (INTC.O) second-quarter results beat Wall Street's expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also gave a forecast for current-quarter revenue that also topped analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, a 33 percent rise in Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) quarterly earnings lifted some spirits, though market participants remained cautious ahead of reports this week from other banks, including Citigroup Inc (C.N) and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The focus will remain for now on corporate earnings, with U.S. equities likely to be the biggest factor weighing on the greenback." said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at The Bank of New York Mellon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If earnings disappoint, as many suspect, the dollar has room to rally on rising risk aversion and falling stock prices," he added. "If earnings exceed expectations, the dollar may come under renewed selling pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGH-YIELDERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currencies seen as higher risk did better as the Canadian dollar rose more than 1 percent to a three-week high of C$1.1345 per U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia's dollar rose 1.3 percent to $0.7927, and sterling added 0.5 percent to $1.6311. Strong Australian business confidence data and better-than-expected UK retail sales and home price data added to demand for both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro's woes were tied partly to a monthly poll of economic sentiment from German think-tank ZEW, which defied upbeat market expectations and fell for the first time since October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ZEW report "was much lower than what was expected, but it is still a figure that shows more optimism than pessimism toward economic recovery," said Dan Cook, a senior market analyst at IG Markets Inc. in Chicago. Investors' attention now will turn ahead to readings on U.S. consumer prices, industrial output and minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting all due on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Steven C.

Here are highlights from Monday`sAnalyst Blog: 

America Movil Battles Movistar

America Movil (NYSE: AMX), the leading provider of wireless services in Latin
America, has announced its plan to launch the highly anticipated iPhone 3GS, an
upgraded version of Apple Inc`s (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPhone 3G, in six countries
across central and south America by July 31, 2009. The company will initially
commercialize the new device in Mexico, Columbia, Guatemala, El Salvador,
Uruguay and the Dominican Republic, which will be followed by expansion to other
markets under its coverage universe. 

The latest iPhone model offers superior features and functionality compared to
the iPhone 3G, including faster processor speed, improved battery life and a
better camera. 

Through its largest subsidiary Telcel, America Movil currently dominates the
Mexican wireless market facilitated by its well-known brand, extensive
distribution network, nationwide coverage and the country`s benign regulatory
environment. The company`s share of the Mexican wireless market was nearly 71%
in 2008, with 65% wireless penetration. 

America Movil launched its 3G services in Mexico in February 2008 and became the
first and only carrier to adopt these 3G offerings. Leveraging its 3G network,
the company launched iPhone 3G in Mexico in July 2008, followed by subsequent
roll-outs in 10 additional Latin American markets. 

Although America Movil still commands a major share of the Mexican wireless
market, it is gradually losing its position due to stiff competition from
Telefonica`s (NYSE: TEF) Movistar, which has recently completed commercial
launch of its 3.5G wireless network across several Mexican cities --
representing a major network advancement. 

Additionally, introduction of mobile number portability (subscribers can switch
operators without losing their phone numbers) in July 2008 has increased
subscriber churn (customers switching to competitors) as more are more customers
are migrating to Movistar. Further, America Movil remains significantly
challenged by the intensely competitive Brazilian wireless market. 

The upcoming launch of the iPhone 3GS is expected to help America Movil to
counter competition in a more effective manner. The high-profile handset will
essentially boost customer adoptions of the company`s 3G services, thereby
stimulating ARPU (average revenue per user) growth while reducing subscriber
churn. 

We reiterate our Hold rating for America Movil as investment risks across key
markets, regulatory issues and weak inflationary/currency conditions may limit
the company`s financial performance in the upcoming reporting periods. 

Exxon Wins New Drilling Permit

On Friday, July 10, Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), the world`s largest publicly
traded oil company, gained a permit from Norway`s top petroleum resources
regulatory agency, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), to drill wellbore
25/8-17 in production license 027 D. 

The Texas-based oil giant plans to drill wildcat wells (well drilled in an area
where no current oil or gas production exists) on the license using
semi-submersible facility Bredford Dolphin. Exxon Mobil has a 50% operated
interest in the production license 027 D, which was awarded in December 2007.
Well 25/8-17 is located just south of the company`s Jotun field project in North
Sea and is the second well drilled on the production license. 

One of the largest oil and gas producers on the Norwegian continental shelf,
Exxon`s recent award demonstrates its global approach to the identification and
pursuit of quality hydrocarbon resources and exploration opportunities. 

We currently have a Buy recommendation on this large-cap integrated player.
Exxon Mobil`s relatively low-risk energy conglomerate business structure, its
fortress balance sheets, ample free cash flow even in a low price environment
and growing dividends are well suited for uncertain times like these. Our other
Buy-rated name in this space is Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX).

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Credits Next-Generation Firewall Provider with Identifying Two DirectX
Vulnerabilities


SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Palo Alto Networks, the leader in next-generation firewalls, today announced
that its Threat Research Team has discovered two vulnerabilities in today`s
Microsoft Patch Tuesday security bulletin. Both are critical vulnerabilities
that can allow remote code execution if exploited. For both vulnerabilities, an
attacker who successfully exploits them could take control of a susceptible
system, install software, view/change/delete data, or create new user accounts
with full user rights. 

Microsoft credited Palo Alto Networks` Threat Research Team with finding
CVE-2009-1538 (DirectX Pointer Validation Vulnerability) and CVE-2009-1539
(DirectX Size Validation Vulnerability). Both CVE-2009-1538 and CVE-2009-1539

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs reported strong profits on Tuesday, but economic signals from the United States and Europe dimmed optimism a global recovery may be close on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the force of the global recession was receding, U.S. retail sales data muted gains in financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A jump in auto and gasoline sales salvaged an otherwise lackluster June for U.S. retailers, pushing sales up 0.6 percent for the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding both autos and gasoline, sales were down 0.2 percent in a fourth consecutive monthly decline, suggesting a sluggish recovery from the worst downturn since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Department stores and restaurants were among the laggards, indicating consumers remained reluctant to resume discretionary spending. Producer prices rose more than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wall Street, U.S. stock markets .N closed slightly higher as the report on consumer spending -- which accounts for two-thirds of activity in the world's biggest economy -- dampened enthusiasm from positive corporate results.

 (Adds comments from lawmakers)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder and Joe Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) said quarterly earnings surged 33 percent on blowout
trading results, trouncing forecasts and putting the bank on
pace for hefty bonuses that could draw unwanted scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results continued Goldman's extraordinary rebound from
a near meltdown of the U.S. banking industry last fall that led
to a $125 billion taxpayer bailout for its largest members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman set aside $6.65 billion for salary, bonuses and
benefits in the quarter, up by nearly half from the quarter
ended in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That puts the average Goldman employee on pace to earn more
than $900,000 this year. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein,
senior officers and star traders will likely receive tens of
millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. government wanted "to make sure that the banks are
making money, so they do make money," said Francis Campeau, a
broker at MF Global Canada in Montreal. "The flip side is now
one could argue they're making too much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman reported net income for common shareholders of $2.7
billion, or $4.93 a share. That compares with $2.05 billion, or
$4.58, in the quarter ended May 30, 2008, before the bank
switched to a calendar-year schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average had forecast earnings of $3.49 a share,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares ended Tuesday's trade on the New York Stock
Exchange up 22 cents to close at $149.66. The shares are up
nearly 80 percent this year, compared with a 24 percent rise in
the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer index .XBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first major U.S. bank to report second-quarter results,
Goldman said trading income nearly doubled from a year ago to
$10.78 billion while its equity underwriting business produced
record revenue of $736 million. Goldman's traders thrived in an
environment of wide price swings, robust demand and fewer
rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's less competition out there," Chief Financial
Officer David Viniar told reporters in a briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a subsequent interview, Viniar told Reuters he could not
predict whether the firm could keep up the pace all year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I wouldn't tell you we will have this level of earnings
every quarter," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOT OUT OF THE WOODS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial crisis wreaked havoc on Wall Street last
year, collapsing Bear Stearns, sending Lehman Brothers into
bankruptcy, and forcing Merrill Lynch into a shotgun wedding
with Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's second-quarter investment banking revenue of
$1.44 billion was down 15 percent from a year ago but rose 75
percent from the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The environment is very conducive to the type of things
they do," said Keith Davis, an analyst at Farr, Miller 
Washington. "Spreads are very wide, fixed-income and equity
issuances have been pretty strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has come under fire for its government connections,
seemingly sailing through a deep recession shortly after
accepting $10 billion of taxpayer bailout money and benefiting
from a host of other government programs, including access to
the U.S. Federal Reserve's borrowing window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank incurred a one-time $426 million charge in the
second quarter related to last month's repayment of loans from
the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as
TARP. Viniar said there was "no timeline" for buying back stock
warrants issued to the government under TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the conference call with investors, Viniar said the
company has amassed substantial capital as it awaits word from
the government on new capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are going to be new capital regulations coming out,"
said Viniar, adding that he didn't expect them to harm
Goldman's business. "We don't know what they are going to be so
we have to wait and see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON MUTED ON GOLDMAN'S BIG DAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reaction to Goldman's earnings was muted among U.S.
lawmakers, some of whom have been harsh critics of Wall
Street's excesses proceeding the credit crunch and bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I want all the people we gave money to to make profits.
Pay the money back with interest and have a net zero cost to
our program," House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told
reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representative Paul Kanjorski, a senior Democrat on the
U.S. House Financial Services Committee, said Goldman's soaring
profits were a sign of economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Is there a law in the United States that you can't make
profits?" Kanjorski asked reporters after a panel meeting. "It
shows that there will be some capital available to be invested
and that's a good sign for the economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others were angered by bonuses that they felt were
subsidized by taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There should be at least some ethical obligation on the
part of the Goldman Sachs because their bonus pool is backed by
taxpayers who are suffering through the poorest economy that
we've seen in 70 years," said Rich Ferlauto, director of
corporate governance and pension investments for the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Obama administration and key lawmakers in Washington
are preparing plans to overhaul regulation of the banking
sector. The plans include clamping down on the largely
unregulated derivatives market -- a major source of profit for
Goldman in the quarter -- and establishing a consumer
protection agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar said his firm was "not immune to public sentiment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We know it. We see it. We don't like it," Viniar said of
the firm's vilification in parts of the media. "We believe we
are doing good things. We are helping the economy recover. I
don't like reading bad things about Goldman Sachs."

that cybercriminals have attacked users of its Office software
for Windows PCs, exploiting a programming flaw that the
software giant has yet to repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software maker issued the warning on
Tuesday as it released patches to address nine other security
holes in its software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Despite today's fixes, Windows users continue to be under
attack. Microsoft is taking two steps forward, while attackers
are putting it one step back," said Dave Marcus, McAfee Inc's
MFE.N Avert Labs director of security research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hackers booby-trap websites with malicious code that loads

estimates that some 500 million people use its Office suite,
which includes Word, Excel and PowerPoint software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software maker said in a security bulletin that it has
developed a temporary workaround for the problem, which users
must manually install on PCs to protect them from attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A company spokeswoman said that program would soon be
available through Microsoft's website. Office XP, 2003 and 2007
are vulnerable to the attacks.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) chief executive attempted to laugh off the challenge of Google Inc's (GOOG.O) planned computer operating system on Tuesday, conceding only that it was "interesting".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I will be respectful," Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said to laughs from the audience at a conference for the company's technology partners in New Orleans, which was broadcast over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who knows what this thing is? To me, the Chrome OS thing is highly interesting," said Ballmer, choosing his words carefully and drawing more amusement from the largely pro-Microsoft crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It won't happen for a year and a half and they already announced an operating system," he added, referring to Google's Android system for smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week Google said it was planning a computer operating system based on its Chrome browser, aiming directly at the core business of Microsoft, the world's largest software company, whose Windows operating systems are used on more than 90 percent of personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's plan, based on the theory that access to the Internet is now the most important feature of any computing device, would be separate from its Android system already available for smartphones and soon for small PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if they can't make up their mind or what the problem is over there, but the last time I checked, you don't need two client operating systems," said Ballmer. "It's good to have one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the jovial tone of Ballmer's public remarks, Microsoft is taking Google's challenge seriously. Its new Bing search engine is a concerted attempt to take market share from dominant leader Google, and its announcement on Monday that it would offer some versions of its Office application on the Internet is a swipe back at Google's move into free, online software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer's previous attempts to make light of new competition have not always been successful. He also derided Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone as too expensive, but it went on to take a significant share of the smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 15 cents to $23.08 on Tuesday afternoon on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Matthew Lewis and Gerald E.

 (Adds Viniar comments from interview)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder and Joe Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) said quarterly earnings surged 33 percent on blowout
trading results, trouncing expectations and putting the bank on
pace for windfall bonuses that could draw more unwanted public
scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results continued Goldman's extraordinary rebound from
the near meltdown of the U.S. banking industry last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just nine months after the U.S. Treasury bailed out the
nation's largest banks with $125 billion of taxpayer money,
Wall Street's biggest surviving securities firm topped
forecasts as improving markets fueled trading profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also blew the lid off compensation. It set aside
$6.65 billion for salary, bonuses and benefits in the quarter,
up by nearly half from the quarter ended in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That puts the average Goldman employee on pace to earn more
than $900,000 this year. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein,
senior officers and star traders will likely receive tens of
millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. government wanted "to make sure that the banks are
making money, so they do make money," said Francis Campeau, a
broker at MF Global Canada in Montreal. "The flip side is now
one could argue they're making too much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman reported net income for common shareholders of $2.7
billion, or $4.93 a share. That compares with $2.05 billion, or
$4.58, in the quarter ended May 30, 2008, before the bank
switched to a calendar-year schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average had forecast earnings of $3.49 a share,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares were fractionally lower in midday trade
after rising 5.3 percent on Monday. The shares are up nearly 80
percent this year, compared with a 24 percent rise in the NYSE
Arca Securities Broker/Dealer index .XBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, the first major U.S. bank to report second-quarter
results, said trading income nearly doubled from a year ago,
while its equity underwriting business produced record revenue
of $736 million. Goldman's traders thrived in an environment of
wide price swings, robust demand and fewer rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's less competition out there," Chief Financial
Officer David Viniar told reporters in a briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a subsequent interview, Viniar told Reuters he could not
predict whether the firm could keep up the pace all year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I wouldn't tell you we will have this level of earnings
every quarter," he said. "It is very hard to know" how the
company will perform over the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a conference call with analysts, he elaborated: "The
environment is still a very tricky environment ... We're not
out of the woods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial crisis wreaked havoc on Wall Street last
year, collapsing Bear Stearns, sending Lehman Brothers into
bankruptcy, and forcing Merrill Lynch into a shotgun wedding
with Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's second-quarter investment banking revenue of
$1.44 billion was down 15 percent from a year ago but rose 75
percent from the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They look like a blowout to me, but I don't think it
should be a big surprise to anyone," said Keith Davis, an
analyst at Farr, Miller  Washington. "The environment is very
conducive to the type of things they do. Spreads are very wide,
fixed-income and equity issuances have been pretty strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; William Smith, chief executive of Smith Asset Management,
said, "Things are very fragile, but they manage to make money
in all environments, which is what you're supposed to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has come under fire for its government connections
and fat-cat profits, seemingly sailing through a deep recession
shortly after accepting $10 billion of taxpayer bailout money
and benefiting from a host of other government programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank incurred a one-time $426 million charge in the
second quarter related to repaying the government. Viniar said
there was "no timeline" for buying back stock warrants issued
to the government under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or
TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not comment on how the government's intervention
impacted Goldman, observing only that the firm is "not immune
to public sentiment." The bank has been under fire from
lawmakers and public advocates, including a highly caustic
cover story recently in pop culture magazine Rolling Stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We know it. We see it. We don't like it," Viniar said. "We
believe we are doing good things. We are helping the economy
recover. I don't like reading bad things about Goldman Sachs."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp will invest $600 million over the next five to six years on trying to developing biofuel from algae, even though the oil major has said renewables will be only a small part of global energy supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon, placing its largest financial bet on renewable fuels, is forming a research and development alliance with Synthetic Genomics Inc, a privately held company that focuses on gene-based research, the company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, which would cost billions to fully develop, is in its initial stages, so commercially viable biofuel made from algae would be many years away, Exxon told reporters on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to be realistic," said Emil Jacobs, vice president of research at Exxon. "This is not going to be easy, and there are no guarantees of success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending on the algae fuels project will require only a fraction of Exxon's annual capital budget of $25 billion to $30 billion, but it will be the world's largest biofuels development project of its kind, said Craig Venter, genome pioneer and founder of Synthetic Genomics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's algae research will not likely silence critics who have argued that the oil major needs to sharpen its focus on renewable and cleaner-burning fuels, but it is a step in the right direction, said Fred Burke, president of Johnston Lemon Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's terrific," Burke said. "It indicates to me that they are reaching out and trying some alternative ideas when frankly I didn't have the idea that they were doing that before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though renewable energy sources are forecast to show rapid growth, crude oil, gas and coal will meet nearly 80 percent of global energy needs through 2030, Exxon said in its latest energy outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUILDING IN CALIFORNIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of its first steps, the Exxon and Synthetic Genomics plan to build a research facility in San Diego, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other companies, including Europe's largest oil company by market value, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, are also researching the possibility of generating motor fuel from algae, but all parties agree a commercial solution is years off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said it reviewed the viability of all other types of biofuels and determined the algae project was best after considering factors including environmental performance and economies, Jacobs told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biofuel from algae would have a key advantage over existing biofuels in that it would not compete with food crops for land, thereby meeting energy needs without pushing up food costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make biofuel from algae, sunlight and a large source of carbon dioxide would be needed. Exxon said it could source its carbon dioxide for the research product from power plants, natural production or refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Exxon has been skeptical about green energy such as wind, biofuels and solar power and has supported research that questioned the scientific basis of man-made climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also fended off proposals that it invest in renewable fuels at an investors' meeting in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon rose 25 cents, or less than one percent, to $65.95 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ajay Kamalakaran in Bangalore; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc employees, on average, are within striking distance of $1 million of compensation and benefits this year, just months after the bank received bailout funds and other support from the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure will likely fuel criticism of the politically connected bank, especially at a time of recession and rising unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman on Tuesday said money set aside for pay surged 75 percent in the second quarter. Compensation and benefit costs were $6.65 billion, up 47 percent from the comparable quarter in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a 16 percent reduction in staff from last year, to 29,400, the bank set aside an average $226,156 per employee in the quarter, up from $129,200 a year ago. If the quarterly figure is annualized, it comes to $904,624 per employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is definitely a politically charged issue, but one of the objectives of Goldman paying back the government was that it would be free to adjust compensation," said Marshall Front, chairman of Front Barnett Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Front said Goldman could pay some "hefty bonuses" this year but not as big as before the financial crisis, when senior managers pocketed tens of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustavo Dolfino, president of New York-based headhunter WhiteRock Group, estimated compensation packages could top around $10 million or $11 million, and will be just for a handle of traders that structured deals that made money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest bonuses will go specifically to the foreign exchange and commodities traders, that are the people accountable for the kind of profits that Goldman is doing," Dolfino said. "People at investment banking will not make a lot of money, and people at middle market sales, and MA will make a little bit more of money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenue rose to 49 percent in the second quarter from 48 percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank reported a 33 percent increase in second-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a conference call with journalists that the compensation figures reflected Goldman Sachs' performance in the second quarter, adding that funds set aside for compensation could be lower in the second half if business deteriorates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compensation figures include cash salaries, estimated year-end bonuses, equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes, severance costs and employee benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Lehman Brothers collapsed in September and investors worried that other Wall Street banks were in danger of going under, Goldman Sachs converted from an investment bank to a bank holding company. The move gave it permanent access to U.S. government funding, in exchange for stricter regulation, and was meant to restore market confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman received a $10 billion government bailout to strengthen its balance sheet. It recently repaid those funds as the U.S. Treasury decided the bank was strong enough to survive without government support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also received access to a series of government programs designed to shore up the financial system, such as the ability to issue bonds backed by the government, and was a major beneficiary of the government's $180 billion rescue of insurance giant American International Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To its credit, Goldman sidestepped the worst of a financial crisis that caught rivals off guard and generated massive credit losses and writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio; additional reporting by Steve Eder; Editing by Martin Howell, John Wallace and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman sets aside $226,156 per employee in 2nd quarter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Compensation, benefits surge 75 percent per employee
 (Adds comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Juan Lagorio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) employees, on average, are within striking distance of
$1 million of compensation and benefits this year, just months
after the bank received bailout funds and other support from
the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The figure will likely fuel criticism of the politically
connected bank, especially at a time of recession and rising
unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman on Tuesday said money set aside for pay surged 75
percent in the second quarter. Compensation and benefit costs
were $6.65 billion, up 47 percent from the comparable quarter
in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given a 16 percent reduction in staff from last year, to
29,400, the bank set aside an average $226,156 per employee in
the quarter, up from $129,200 a year ago. If the quarterly
figure is annualized, it comes to $904,624 per employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is definitely a politically charged issue, but one of
the objectives of Goldman paying back the government was that
it would be free to adjust compensation," said Marshall Front,
chairman of Front Barnett Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Front said Goldman could pay some "hefty bonuses" this year
but not as big as before the financial crisis, when senior
managers pocketed tens of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gustavo Dolfino, president of New York-based headhunter
WhiteRock Group, estimated compensation packages could top
around $10 million or $11 million, and will be just for a
handle of traders that structured deals that made money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The biggest bonuses will go specifically to the foreign
exchange and commodities traders, that are the people
accountable for the kind of profits that Goldman is doing,"
Dolfino said. "People at investment banking will not make a lot
of money, and people at middle market sales, and MA will make
a little bit more of money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs said the ratio of compensation and benefits
to net revenue rose to 49 percent in the second quarter from 48
percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank reported a 33 percent increase in second-quarter
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a conference
call with journalists that the compensation figures reflected
Goldman Sachs' performance in the second quarter, adding that
funds set aside for compensation could be lower in the second
half if business deteriorates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The compensation figures include cash salaries, estimated
year-end bonuses, equity awards and other items such as payroll
taxes, severance costs and employee benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Lehman Brothers collapsed in September and investors
worried that other Wall Street banks were in danger of going
under, Goldman Sachs converted from an investment bank to a
bank holding company. The move gave it permanent access to U.S.
government funding, in exchange for stricter regulation, and
was meant to restore market confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman received a $10 billion government bailout to
strengthen its balance sheet. It recently repaid those funds as
the U.S. Treasury decided the bank was strong enough to survive
without government support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also received access to a series of government
programs designed to shore up the financial system, such as the
ability to issue bonds backed by the government, and was a
major beneficiary of the government's $180 billion rescue of
insurance giant American International Group Inc (AIG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To its credit, Goldman sidestepped the worst of a financial
crisis that caught rivals off guard and generated massive
credit losses and writedowns.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - Taipei's ASUSTeK (2357.TW)
and ASUS Computer International did not infringe three
International Business Machine (IBM.N) patents, according to a
decision by the International Trade Commission announced
onTuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; IBM had accused the ASUSTeK and ASUS of infringing three
patents, but an administrative law judge working for the trade
commission found no infringement in a ruling issued on March
16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ITC's decision upholds the law judge's ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes since the
commission can bar the importation of products that use
infringing technology.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is well aware of the negative public sentiment toward the big Wall Street bank, but the distrust is not deserved, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman is "not immune to public sentiment," Viniar told Reuters in an interview following release of the bank's strong second-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know it. We see it. We don't like it," he said. "We believe we are doing good things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, "We are helping the economy recovery. I don't like reading bad things about Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criticism of the bank in Washington and on Main Street has centered on its role in the financial crisis and the generous compensation paid to its executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October Goldman received a $10 billion government bailout, and it has also benefited from other government schemes during the depths of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman reported better-than-expected earnings for both the first and second quarters, rebounding from the near meltdown of the U.S. banking industry last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank repaid the bailout loans last month and is in negotiations on repurchasing warrants it issued to the government related to the Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said TARP was "a very important thing" for the economy and helped stabilize the banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to directly say how the program impacted Goldman, saying the program has to be evaluated as a whole instead of bank by bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he could not predict whether the firm's robust growth will continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't tell you we will have this level of earnings every quarter," he said, adding that "it is very hard to know" how the company will perform over the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the future will depend largely on demand for Goldman's services, which was strong in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' strong second-quarter earnings were a result of "basic blocking and tackling for the firm," the Wall Street bank's chief financial officer said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a quarter in which Goldman reported a 33 percent rise in earnings, David Viniar said the company focused on its core businesses, without ramping up risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did well across a variety of businesses," Viniar said on a conference call with journalists. "It was very well spread, across equities and underwriting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Goldman's risk portfolio was essentially flat in the quarter, calling it "vanilla" in terms of fears about the bank engaging in too much risk so soon after last year's credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said Goldman benefited from the disappearance of some of its competitors in the investment banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is definitely less competition out there," he said, adding that there is also less risk capital available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman set aside $6.65 billion for compensation in the quarter, at a time when banks are under political pressure to curb lavish bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said the compensation figures are strong for the first half of the year but will suffer if the company falters in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to its quarterly report, Goldman lost 400 people, or about 1 percent of its staff, in the second quarter. Viniar said head count was likely to rise in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If anything, we are seeing an influx of talent," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to discuss the specifics of the alleged theft of Goldman computer codes by a former employee, but called any losses "immaterial" and said Goldman still has the codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder and Elinor Comlay; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The costs to insure the debt of Goldman Sachs Group Inc fell on Tuesday after the bank reported a stronger-than-forecast rise in quarterly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman's credit default swaps tightened to about 142 basis points, from 150 basis points late on Monday, according to Phoenix Partners Group data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by John Parry; Editing by W Simon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a stronger than forecast 33 percent rise in quarterly earnings as a gain in trading outweighed a one-time charge to repay government loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's largest surviving investment bank reported net income for common shareholders of $2.7 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with a pro-forma $2.05 billion, or $4.58 a share a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stripping out extraordinary items, Goldman earned $4.93 a share, beating analysts' consensus forecast of $3.39, according to Reuters estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TERRY MORRIS, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR EQUITY MANAGER FOR NATIONAL PENN INVESTORS TRUST COMPANY IN READING, PENNSYLVANIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I saw this coming, or at least thought I did. It's a buy the rumor, sell the news kind of thing. They did print a good number but based on yesterday's action it was apparently all built into the stock, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So now the stock is selling off. Just goes to show that its all relative to the expectations that were embedded into the price of the stock at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is all opposed to Johnson  Johnson, which beat expectations by only something like three cents but is trading a buck higher. They didn't beat expectations nearly as much as Goldman, but JJ is trading higher because the expectations weren't priced into the stock already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say that the reason futures pared their gains is because of Goldman. Goldman puts a cap on the financials today. But they were the leaders yesterday, so they deserve a break. But the fact that the stock isn't trading higher on such good news means the news is built in to the stock, so what's left to take them higher?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL HOLLAND, MONEY MANAGER, HOLLAND  CO, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even though I was prepared for really good results, the magnitude of their success in trading I think is breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are showing once again that they are the smartest guys in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What they have continued to do during the worst financial crisis in 25 years shows that they are the smartest guys in the room and, therefore, it doesn't necessarily translate to the other people who are in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no question that Lloyd Blankfein and his team have differentiated themselves from the rest of the financial community with results like these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a tribute to their managing risk people if they can continue to do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRANCIS CAMPEAU, BROKER AT MF GLOBAL CANADA, IN MONTREAL:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The headline numbers are great but the stock is down. It's the classic case of buy the rumor, sell the fact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the U.S. government bailout plan: "They want to make sure that the banks are making money, so they do make money. The flip side is one could argue they're making too much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVID DIETZE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, POINT VIEW FINANCIAL SERVICES, SUMMIT, NJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very impressive, a huge beat. I think the trading operations were all systems go, that was supported by strong underwriting results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that this is going to provide a nice shot in the arm of confidence generally for the market, particularly for the financials. I do caution investors that the Goldman business model is a little bit different, the focus is investment banking. They and Morgan Stanley are practically the only games left in town as others have gone by the wayside or are licking their wounds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be interesting to see exactly how Goldman's shares respond to this. The early read is a bit of a sell on the news. They're up 77 percent so far this year, I think this may be a classic case of buy on the rumor and sell on the news. Obviously 77 percent for six to seven months is totally unsustainable, they're still part of the economy, so I think it's going to spell more good news for peers and wannabe peers than Goldman itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH, SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Goldman announcement indicates that they're making a great deal of money, but the problem you tend to have with financials is that the rules aren't fully set. One of the things that overhangs that is what's the future going to be like? You also have another equation, which is what's the government going to do? Goldman is now a bank, they've given back the TARP money, but they're now into a whole different series of regulations than they were before. Goldman received a substantial amount of other benefits last fall, including a lot of the counterparty money that AIG received, so they're kind of locked in with the government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILLIAM LARKIN, FIXED INCOME MANAGER AT CABOT MONEY MANAGEMENT IN SALEM, MASS, WITH $375 MILLION IN ASSETS, AND AN OWNER OF GOLDMAN BONDS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those are very strong numbers. Their market position was improved by the weakness of their competitors. That was sort of understood by the marketplace, and now it's confirmed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gets discounted by the market from a projection standpoint because it was assumed to be strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this earnings season goes well, there'll be less political problems." If it does not go well, "people are going to say: 'You're bailing them out but they're not lending.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TODD LEONE, HEAD OF LISTED TRADING, COWEN  CO. IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The expectations were built into the stock yesterday and the volatility came out yesterday. Based on how it's trading, the results look in line. People had big expectations for it after the upgrade, and I think it had its rally yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure why we're paring right now, people might have been hoping for a little more from Goldman because of yesterday's anticipation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHARD BOVE, ANALYST, ROCHDALE SECURITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They outperformed everybody's expectations which is not particularly unusual. When things are going well for the company, it does tend to overshoot on the upside. Trading was strong and investment banking was strong particularly in equities. Equities was the driver. I think it's a pretty strong signal that other capital market companies will do well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEITH DAVIS, AN ANALYST AT FARR, MILLER  WASHINGTON, IN WASHINGTON D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are pretty strong. They look like a blow out to me, but I don't think it should be a big surprise to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The environment is very conducive to the type of things they do. Spreads are very wide, fixed income and equity issuances have been pretty strong, so it doesn't surprise me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question would be now how repeatable are these results, how sustainable in this environment, and I think the run up in the stock suggests that a lot of these good news is probably already in the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should see positive results from Morgan Stanley, the capital markets side of JPMorgan Chase, the capital markets businesses at Citi and some other large commercial banks as well, but Goldman is the best pure play."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILLIAM SMITH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF SMITH ASSET MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're terrific numbers...I think things are very fragile but they manage to make money in all environments which is what you're supposed to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think you're going to see absolutely enormous numbers coming out of the money centers, including Citigroup."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact is that as you have stabilization and as credit spreads tighten, we still have a steep yield curve for the traditional banks and trading activity has exploded. These are things you need to happen. The toxic assets on the banks' balance sheets all of a sudden aren't so toxic. One by one you're going out and shooting all the bear arguments... The fact is, these aren't zombie banks, the toxic assets have proved not to be toxic -- more undervalued."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman should be celebrated, not demonized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, Mary Angela Rowe, Jonathan Spicer, Ryan Vlastelica, Sweta Singh and Juan Lagorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc executives sold almost $700 million worth of stock since the collapse of rival Lehman Brothers last year, the Financial Times said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said that most of the stock sales took place while the biggest U.S. investment bank was bailed out by the government with $10 billion of taxpayer money, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman executives sold stock worth $691 million between September 2008 and April 2009, more than the $438 million in stock sold between September 2007 and April 2008, when the average share price was substantially higher, the Financial Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock sales peaked between December and February, when Goldman Sachs' shares traded near record lows, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Lehman Brothers collapse froze financial markets, Goldman Sachs was forced to convert into a bank holding company to have access to government funding, and received $10 billion of taxpayer money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also reported its first quarterly loss since going public in 1999. However, Goldman has managed to sidestep the worst of the financial crisis, which has caught rivals with much higher losses and massive asset writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the bank repaid the government the bailout funds, along with other big banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect Goldman Sachs will report strong quarterly earnings on Tuesday, boosted by sold trading income and improving equity underwriting markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JP Morgan Private Equity Ltd JPEL.L (JPEL) is raising an initial $50 million to invest in secondary assets, nibbling at the outer edges of the market where there is less competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are hitting what is likely to be the best secondary market that anyone has seen in the last 20 years given the high number of investors seeking liquidity, whether it's banks, pension funds, insurers, or hedge funds," said Greg Getschow, managing director, private equity at JP Morgan Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The listed fund has a market capitalization of $500 million, but values its portfolio at $1.2 billion in assets. It is targeting cheap deals of $5 million or below, where the bigger funds do not participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, Getschow said he was seeking out "motivated" sellers, or those who desperately need liquidity. He cited one deal this year with an unnamed financial institution that needed to sell for regulatory reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said this had cost only 5 million euros ($6.99 million) but the asset size was much bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There can be some good opportunities around quarter or year end as institutions clean up their balance sheets," he said. "That can be the best bargain you'll ever see because these are motivated sellers, but you have to move fast."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the best opportunities were coming from financial institutions such as banks and hedge funds, but endowments and high net worth individuals were also looking for liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In normal cycles you may see one type of investor that has an incentive to sell but in this market almost everyone you can imagine is a seller," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPEL is looking to take positions where MA activity is likely, for a speedy exit. Getschow cited healthcare equipment and services and U.S. for-profit education companies as providing interesting opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG DISCOUNTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondaries transactions are picking up but have been slow to conclude as potential sellers are reluctant to part with their assets due to market uncertainty. "There is still a big bid/ask spread which has prevented some transactions from going through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getschow thought things would improve toward autumn as prices are starting to come in. He is now seeing high quality assets at 60 to 70 percent discounts to their intrinsic value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About six months ago the fund started to buy some real estate, capitalizing on distressed sellers. "We needed to find deals that were not over-geared, so we avoided luxury properties and looked more at mid-market apartments," said Getschow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trust found one financial seller and a publicly traded entity that needed liquidity, and real estate now accounts for some 10 percent of the portfolio.

&lt;p&gt;WATCH HILL, R.I.--(Business Wire)--
Clarmar Estate located in the historic and resort coastal area of Watch Hill,
situated on 4&#177; acres will sell at real estate auction on Friday, July 31st at 11
a.m. J. P. King Auction Company, the nation`s leading real estate auction
marketing firm specializing in high-luxury properties will manage the sale of
the estate. 

Built in 1931, Clarmar Estate is listed in the National Register of Historic
Places. Esteemed Architect Warrington G. Lawrence designed this grand estate for
the Clarence-Bitting Family of New York as a summer retreat. Clarmar Estate
maintains its original elegance and grandeur and continues to be one of the
largest estates in Watch Hill with 12 bedrooms and 8.5 baths. 

"Clarmar Estate was built on one of the highest points in the area with
panoramic views of the neighboring countryside and the Atlantic Ocean," said
Craig King, president &amp; CEO of J. P. King Auction Company. "Watch Hill is a
historic town that was originally developed as an exclusive seaside resort
destination in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The resort town of Watch
Hill is only one hour south of Providence and a short drive from Manhattan." 

The 20-room estate has 12` ceilings with ornate molding, antique chandeliers,
custom wall paneling, and a total of 10 hand-crafted fireplaces. The living
room, main foyer, and formal dining room are all connected allowing an ideal
flow for entertaining. 

The formal dining room exudes intricate detail and displays antique features
including a brass chandelier, built-in linen and silverware chests, restored
Portuguese marble mantle, a 13` buffet server with Belgian black and gold marble
top, and elaborate plaster moldings with ceiling border, center medallion and
scroll work. The foyer showcases a custom border of gold leaf plaster that trims
the ceiling, hand-cut marble Travertine flooring, magnificent walnut and iron
staircase with curved balcony, large stained glass window, and an elevator that
services 3 of 4 floors. The living room/great room also offers tremendous detail
and contains an Art Deco fan, antique Italian 6` vault fireplace mantle with
original stone carvings, large candelabra wall sconces, stucco walls, and a
barrel vaulted hand-painted Byzantine ceiling with gold leaf. 

Two guest rooms located in the North Wing, a library/study, summer parlor,
chapel, patio kitchen, staff bedroom, and main kitchen all occupy the first
level. The main kitchen and pantry have been modernized for today`s convenience.
The kitchen features oak cabinetry, granite countertops, built-in appliances,
sub-zero refrigerator, and an abundance of storage and work areas. 

A walnut stairway extends from the first level to the second level. The second
level showcases two master suites with elegant features and an adjoining deck
that provides views of the Atlantic Ocean, Block Island, Fisher`s Island, and
panoramic views of the countryside. The second level suites contain original
fixtures, luxurious finishes, and oak strip flooring under plush carpeting. The
third level of the residence contains a storage room ideal for a playroom or
recreation room. The ground level offers a pub or family room complete with
original Cyprus panels, large stained glass windows, stone fireplace, and stone
arched entryway into a dining area. This ground level dining area is perfect for
entertaining with an eat-in kitchen and bar. Additional bedrooms and baths
adjoin the family room and dining area. 

The neo-classical designed exterior is as detailed as the home`s interior. The
expansive veranda with porte-cochere extension has a central, curved
Tuscan-column projection in front of a shallow central entrance pavilion. A
pediment containing an oculus tops the entrance pavilion and is flanked on each
side by a pediment dormer containing an arched window. Paired exterior-end
chimneys constructed of granite add to this neo-classical design with extensive
rear wings.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, July 14 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Tuesday said final development of its new research project to
make fuels from algae will cost billions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We need to be realistic," Emil Jacobs, vice president of
of research at Exxon, told reporters on a conference call.
"This is not going to be easy, and there are no guarantees of
success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest publicly traded company plans to spend
$600 million over the next five or six years to develop biofuels
from algae with its partner Synthetic Genomics Inc (SGI), a
privately held company focused on gene-based research.

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman sets aside $226,156 per employee in 2nd quarter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Compensation, benefits surge 75 percent per employee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Juan Lagorio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - The average Goldman Sachs
Group Inc (GS.N) employee is within striking distance of $1
million in compensation and benefits this year, just nine
months after the bank received a $10 billion U.S. government
bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The figure will likely fuel criticism of the politically
connected bank, especially amind the widening recession and
rising unemployment. In addition to the bailout, Wall Street's
biggest surviving securities firm also benefited from several
other government schemes during the depths of last year's
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman on Tuesday said money set aside for pay surged 75
percent in the second quarter. Compensation and benefits costs
were $6.65 billion, up 47 percent from the equivalent quarter
in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given a 16 percent reduction in staff from last year, to
29,400, the bank set aside an average $226,156 per employee in
the second quarter, up from $129,200 in a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the quarterly figure is annualized, it comes to $904,624
per employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs said the ratio of compensation and benefits
to net revenue rose to 49 percent in the second quarter from 48
percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank reported a 33 percent increase in second-quarter
earnings to $2.7 billion on strong trading results. It said
higher compensation was primarily due to increased net
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The compensation figures include cash salaries, estimated
year-end bonuses, equity awards and other items such as payroll
taxes, severance costs and employee benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Lehman Brothers collapsed in September and investors
worried other Wall Street banks were also in danger of going
under, Goldman Sachs converted from an investment bank to a
bank holding company. The move gave it permanent access to U.S.
government funding, in exchange for stricter regulation, and
was meant to restore market confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman received the $10 billion bailout to shore up its
balance sheet. It recently repaid those funds as the U.S.
Treasury decided it was strong enough to survive without
government support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also received access to a series of government
programs designed to shore up the financial system, such as the
ability to issue bonds backed by the government, and was a
major beneficiary of the government's $180 billion rescue of
insurance giant American International Group Inc (AIG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To its credit, Goldman managed to sidestep the worst of a
financial crisis that caught rivals off guard and generated
massive credit losses and writedowns.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Five new commercial offerings for the Nortel(1) (OTCBB: NRTLQ) and
Microsoft Innovative Communications Alliance (ICA) were introduced today
at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference. The new solution packages
are tailored to the specific needs of enterprises to deliver the
simplicity and enhanced speed of operations enabled by unified
communications. The new technologies enable companies to realize
significant productivity gains and operational efficiencies that provide
a competitive edge.

    Nortel has experienced significant success deploying Microsoft telephony
solutions for global organizations as part of the Microsoft voice pilot
program. The new commercial offers demonstrate the continued innovation,
investment and commitment to the ICA relationship.

    "Transitioning to a unified communications environment does not need to
be complicated, and these new ICA solutions are designed to provide a
simple, cost-effective means for companies to make that transition," said
Craig Schuman, director of business development and strategy for the
unified communications group at Microsoft. "Nortel's dedication to
providing unified communications solutions that integrate simply with
Microsoft Office Communications Server and Microsoft Exchange Server has
been a key factor in the success of the Innovative Communications
Alliance."

    "Unified communications take business operations to a new realm," said
Joel Hackney, president, Enterprise Solutions, Nortel. "CXOs are
realizing a new mindset - one that goes beyond business continuity and
extends into realm of business possibility. ICA solutions deliver the
capabilities that enable this fundamental shift. Companies cannot stand
still in this environment, and need every advantage available. Nortel and
Microsoft are delivering the means to realize that advantage quickly,
holistically and economically. Being the top Microsoft partner is of key
importance to delivering these capabilities to our customers - and we
look forward to nurturing the relationship in the years ahead." 

    New Solution Bundles Provide UC Foundation

    The five new commercial offerings for the Innovative Communications
Alliance are designed to accelerate deployment and simplify the
transition to unified communications. The integrated packages lower the
barrier to entry, simplify their purchase and deployment, and provide a
cost-effective means to evaluate the technology to prove their value in
the customer's networking environment. New solution bundles include:

    - SIP Contact Center 7.0 + Microsoft Office Communications Server: The
Contact Center 7.0 release brings unified communications into the contact
center through its integration of OCS2007 presence capability, providing
the capability to immediately contact the appropriate subject matter
expert leading to higher first call resolution rates.

    - Web Services: Targeted at companies with 100-500 users, this solution
includes UC capabilities that enable seamless user experience with
presence and click-to-call into other business applications and processes.

    - Enterprise Lighthouse: This offering provides a cost-effective option
for the large enterprise to take advantage of the enhanced productivity
that unified communications provides. The offer includes deployment
services to enable UC integration, including Office Communications Server
Voice and Conferencing and Microsoft Exchange Voicemail for deployments
of greater than 2,000 users.

    - Enterprise Mini Lighthouse: This offering provides a cost-effective
option for the small enterprise to take advantage of the enhanced
productivity that unified communications provides. The offer includes

Server Voice and Conferencing and Microsoft Exchange Voicemail for

enable the Office Communications Server conferencing capability for a
minimum of 500 users.

    New Customers Drive Momentum

    In addition to the 1,300 ICA customer wins over the three year agreement
between the companies, Movares and SQLSoft+ are the most recent customers
to realize the advantages of deploying ICA solutions.

    "We anticipate a fast ROI on this deployment," said Steve Brugger,
president, SQLSoft+. "We are realizing savings of 30 percent each month
on reduced phone and data charges alone. Our overseas employees stay
connected transparently and have all but eliminated their cell phone
charges when contacting our US office. Since we had already deployed
ECALS on the client machines, our client hardware costs were limited to
inexpensive USB handsets, which were one-third the price of most IP
phones. Being able to run our old and new phone systems in parallel
during deployment made for a very fast training and adoption cycle as
well as a smooth cutover. The conferencing features have also reduced our
costs." SQLSoft+ selected Nortel Professional Services to help implement
the solution. Nortel is a Gold Certified Systems integrator for Microsoft
UC solutions.

    Peter Dubbelman, senior IT advisor, Movares, an engineering consultancy
company based in The Netherlands said, "We chose Nortel because of their
collaboration with Microsoft, as this provided a low risk and seamless
integration for Unified Communications with our existing Microsoft
environment. Our objective was to enable working anywhere anytime, using
integrated voice and data services on both computers and smartphones.
After the pilot, 96 percent of our employees would not want to go back to
our old system, and scaling up to the entire company yielded lots of
compliments for our ICT department."

    "Nortel remains a stalwart Microsoft partner and is committed to the
success of ICA as a means to helping our customers solve their business
problems," said Susan King, leader, Innovative Communications Alliance,
Nortel. "We have sharpened our execution with a focus on delivering
critical software and services to augment Microsoft's unified
communications offering. These new capabilities are helping our customers
streamline and truncate their operations by extending their unified
communications capabilities deeper within their organization's business
applications and processes."

&lt;p&gt; * Says core businesses were strong&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Firm benefited from less competition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Head count expected to rise in third quarter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) strong
second-quarter earnings were a result of "basic blocking and
tackling for the firm," the Wall Street bank's chief financial
officer said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a quarter in which Goldman reported a 33 percent rise in
earnings, David Viniar said the company focused on its core
businesses, without ramping up risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We did well across a variety of businesses," Viniar said
on a conference call with journalists. "It was very well
spread, across equities and underwriting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Goldman's risk portfolio was essentially flat in
the quarter, calling it "vanilla" in terms of fears about the
bank engaging in too much risk so soon after last year's credit
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar said Goldman benefited from the disappearance of
some of its competitors in the investment banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is definitely less competition out there," he said,
adding that there is also less risk capital available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman set aside $6.65 billion for compensation in the
quarter, at a time when banks are under political pressure to
curb lavish bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar said the compensation figures are strong for the
first half of the year but will suffer if the company falters
in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to its quarterly report, Goldman lost 400 people,
or about 1 percent of its staff, in the second quarter. Viniar
said head count was likely to rise in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If anything, we are seeing an influx of talent," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to discuss the specifics of the alleged theft
of Goldman computer codes by a former employee, but called any
losses "immaterial" and said Goldman still has the codes.

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's largest surviving investment bank announced better-than-expected second quarter results, while sales at U.S. retailers beat expectations with a 0.6 percent rise in June, boosted by a big jump in auto sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both appeared to back up U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who said that a global assault on recession was making headway and acknowledged that Washington bore a special responsibility to help spur a recovery in the world economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a 33 percent rise in earnings as a strong gain in trading was offset by a one-time charge to repay government loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're terrific numbers...I think things are very fragile but they manage to make money in all environments which is what you're supposed to do." said William Smith, chief executive of Smith Asset Management in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're going to see absolutely enormous numbers coming out of the money centers, including Citigroup," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the first major U.S. bank to report quarterly earnings in the current cycle, saw its performance bolstered by improving markets and strong trading results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But gains were tempered by a one-off $426 million charge related to the repayment of $10 billion in loans from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIZZLED OUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stronger-than-expected first quarter results from financial companies sparked a rally in the sector which spread to the rest of the stock market. World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 1 percent by 1319 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest U.S. retail sales figures were not all good. Excluding both autos and gasoline, sales were down 0.2 percent, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. Department stores and restaurants were among the laggards, suggesting that consumers remained reluctant to resume discretionary spending despite signs the recession may be drawing to a close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, data Tuesday showed that German investors have turned more pessimistic than expected, a signal analysts say means the nation's economy won't start growing until next year at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The German economy could be among the first to escape the recession. However, it is 'if' and not 'when'," added Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Financial Markets. "Cautious optimism, not enthusiasm, is most suitable for the way forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Euro zone industrial production was also a disappointment, growing only slightly in May after a bad April, and remaining 17 percent lower than it was a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials and investors alike are on tenterhooks, waiting to see whether a tentative upturn in economic data in recent weeks means an eventual end to the worst downturn since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many fear that it is merely a short-lived blip, sustained only by the trillions of dollars that governments around the world have poured into saving their banks and stimulating their economies -- borrowed money that will take years to repay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE OF OPTIMISM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jeddah, Geithner struck an optimistic note. "The force of the global recession is receding," he said. "For the first time in several quarters, the IMF and a range of private analysts are starting to revise up their forecasts for growth in the second half of this year and next."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he did in London Monday, Geithner accepted the global economy faced severe problems but was reassuring so long as "steady, forceful and sustained" support continues until private investment and spending lead a recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data released in Europe showed at best a weak recovery. German analyst and investor sentiment fell in July for the first time since October 2008, a leading survey showed. The Mannheim-based ZEW economic think tank's monthly poll of economic sentiment fell to 39.5 from 44.8 in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by David Stamp; Editing by Keiron Henderson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  AMHERST, NH, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
PistolStar, Inc., provider of tailored authentication solutions that
address usability, security and compliance, now offers stronger
authentication, self-service password recovery and password and
authentication security features for Microsoft SharePoint and IBM
WebSphere and WebSphere Portal. With PortalGuard, PistolStar's new
browser-based authentication security software, SharePoint authentication
and WebSphere Portal access is simpler and more secure, as users can
self-manage their portal password while administrators obtain enhanced
access control features that enable them to meet or exceed corporate
authentication security objectives and compliance with government and
industry regulations.

    PortalGuard allows users to perform self-service password reset by
responding to multiple, configurable challenge questions. This facilitates
the recovery process in a highly secure way, even when users perform
self-service password resets from offsite locations or on the road. Also,
administrators are able to free up the time and resources used to respond
to password change requests.

    With PortalGuard's numerous configurable password and authentication
security features, administrators can implement processes for stronger and
consistently secure SharePoint authentication and WebSphere Portal access,
thus preventing unauthorized access and assuring compliance auditors that
data is protected. Users can be required to provide their username, portal
password and a challenge question response to gain access. Other features
provide the ability to perform crucial functions, such as configure the
number of strikes for account lockout; limit multiple, concurrent logon
sessions; lockout inactive users after 'n' days, validate password
strength and apply password strength rules; and audit and record user
login activity.

    "Building on our success with Web Set Password for IBM Lotus Domino, we
are now delivering the same powerful password and authentication security
functionality for SharePoint authentication and WebSphere Portal access,"
states Thomas Hoey, president and CEO at PistolStar, Inc. "With the
increasing level of security threats in today's enterprise, we are
providing customers with solutions that are tailored to their environment
and strengthen authentication to adapt to changing circumstances.
SharePoint and WebSphere Portal end-users, IT administrators and corporate
management equally benefit from PortalGuard's ease and convenience,
enhanced authentication security and robust controls for compliance."

______________ 

"While markets remain fragile and we recognize the challenges the broader
economy faces, our second quarter results reflected the combination of improving
financial market conditions and a deep and diverse client franchise," said Lloyd
C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our role as an intermediary
focused on making markets for buyers and sellers helped drive our performance.
We were also active as an underwriter of many significant debt and equity
offerings for clients." 

Net Revenues

Investment Banking

Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.44 billion, 15% lower than the second
quarter of 2008 and 75% higher than the first quarter of 2009. 

Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $368 million, 54% lower than the second
quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide
completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm`s Underwriting
business were $1.07 billion, 21% higher than the second quarter of 2008, due to
significantly higher net revenues in equity underwriting, as well as higher net
revenues in debt underwriting. The increase in equity underwriting reflected
very strong client activity. The increase in debt underwriting primarily
reflected higher net revenues from investment-grade and municipal activity. The
firm`s investment banking transaction backlog decreased during the quarter. (5)

Trading and Principal Investments

Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $10.78 billion, 93%
higher than the second quarter of 2008 and 51% higher than the first quarter of
2009. 

Net revenues in FICC were $6.80 billion, significantly higher than the second
quarter of 2008. These results reflected particularly strong performances in
credit products, interest rate products and currencies, reflecting strength in
the client franchise. In addition, net revenues in both mortgages and
commodities were higher compared with the second quarter of 2008. Results in
mortgages included a loss of approximately $700 million on commercial mortgage
loans. During the quarter, FICC operated in an environment characterized by
strong client-driven activity, particularly in more liquid products, favorable
market opportunities and tighter corporate credit spreads. 

Net revenues in Equities were $3.18 billion, 28% higher than the second quarter
of 2008, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in derivatives and, to a
lesser extent, principal strategies. In addition, net revenues in shares were
solid, but essentially unchanged compared with the second quarter of 2008.
Commissions declined compared with the second quarter of 2008. During the
quarter, Equities operated in an environment characterized by solid
client-driven activity, favorable market opportunities, a significant increase
in global equity prices and a decline in volatility levels. 

Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $811 million for the second
quarter of 2009. These results included a gain of $948 million related to the
firm`s investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China Limited (ICBC), a gain of $343 million from corporate principal
investments and a loss of $499 million from real estate principal investments. 

Asset Management and Securities Services

Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.54 billion, 28%
lower than the second quarter of 2008 and 6% higher than the first quarter of
2009. 

Asset Management net revenues were $922 million, 21% lower than the second
quarter of 2008, reflecting lower assets under management, principally due to
market depreciation since the end of the second quarter of 2008. During the
second quarter of 2009, assets under management increased $48 billion to $819
billion (6), due to $42 billion of market appreciation, primarily in equity and
fixed income assets, and $6 billion of net inflows. 

Securities Services net revenues were $615 million, 38% lower than the second
quarter of 2008. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflected the impact of
lower customer balances compared with the second quarter of 2008. 

Expenses

Operating expenses were $8.73 billion, 33% higher than the second quarter of
2008 and 28% higher than the first quarter of 2009. 

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, estimated year-end
discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such
as payroll taxes, severance costs and benefits) were $6.65 billion, which was
higher than the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to higher net revenues.
The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 49.0% for the first
half of 2009. Total staff decreased 1% during the quarter. 

Non-Compensation Expenses

Non-compensation expenses, excluding consolidated entities held for investment
purposes (7), were $1.80 billion, 8% lower than the second quarter of 2008 and
11% higher than the first quarter of 2009. The decrease compared with the second
quarter of 2008 was attributable to lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and
distribution fees, principally reflecting lower transaction volumes in Equities.
In addition, non-compensation expenses during the second quarter of 2009 were
generally lower than the second quarter of 2008 principally due to the impact of
reduced staff levels and the effect of expense reduction initiatives. These
decreases were partially offset by the impact of higher FDIC fees on bank
deposits, including the impact of a special assessment of approximately $50
million, and net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $25
million. The increase in non-compensation expenses related to consolidated
entities held for investment purposes reflected real estate impairment charges
of approximately $170 million during the second quarter of 2009. Including
consolidated investment entities held for investment purposes, non-compensation
expenses were $2.08 billion, essentially unchanged from the second quarter of
2008 and the first quarter of 2009. 

Provision for Taxes

The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2009 was 31.5%, up slightly
from 31.0% for the first quarter of 2009. 

Capital

As of June 26, 2009, total capital was $254.05 billion, consisting of $62.81
billion in total shareholders` equity (common shareholders` equity of $55.86
billion and preferred stock of $6.96 billion) and $191.24 billion in unsecured
long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $106.41 and tangible book
value per common share (4) was $96.94, an increase of approximately 8% and 10%,
respectively, during the quarter. Book value and tangible book value per common
share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units
granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 524.9 million at
period end. 

During the quarter, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.) completed a
public offering of 46.7 million common shares at $123.00 per share for total
proceeds of $5.75 billion. 

On June 17, 2009, Group Inc. repurchased from the U.S. Treasury the 10.0 million
shares of the firm`s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series H,
that were issued to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the U.S. Treasury`s TARP
Capital Purchase Program. The aggregate purchase price paid by Group Inc. to the
U.S. Treasury for the Preferred Stock was $10.04 billion (including accrued
dividends). The repurchase included a one-time preferred dividend of $426
million, which is included in our results for the second quarter of 2009. 

Under the regulatory capital guidelines currently applicable to bank holding
companies, the firm`s Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel I (8) was 13.8% as of
June 26, 2009, up from 13.7% as of March 27, 2009. Under the capital guidelines

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the
firm`s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are
inherently uncertain and outside of the firm`s control. It is possible that the
firm`s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially,
from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these
forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important
factors that could affect the firm`s future results and financial condition, see
"Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm`s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 and "Management`s Discussion and

Certain of the information regarding the firm`s Tier 1 capital ratios,
risk-weighted assets, total assets, level 3 assets and average global core
excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates; these estimates are
forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as
the firm completes its quarterly financial statements. 

Statements about the firm`s investment banking transaction backlog also may
constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk
that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be
completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually
earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those
currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the
terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case
of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general
economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities
markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the
securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the
securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse
development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a
required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that
could adversely affect the firm`s investment banking transactions, see "Risk
Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm`s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the

 (1)      Annualized return on average common shareholders` equity (ROE) is computed by dividing annualized net earnings applicable to    
          common shareholders by average monthly common shareholders` equity. The one-time preferred dividend of $426 million related to  
          the repurchase of the firm`s TARP preferred stock (calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the redemption   
          value of the preferred stock) was not annualized in the calculation of annualized net earnings applicable to common shareholders 
          since it has no impact on other quarters in the year. The following table sets forth our average common shareholders` equity:

 (4)      Tangible common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable          
          intangible assets. Tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing tangible common shareholders` equity by the     
          number of common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements. 
          Management believes that tangible common shareholders` equity is meaningful because it is one of the measures that the firm and 
          investors use to assess capital adequacy. The following table sets forth the reconciliation of total shareholders' equity to    
          tangible common shareholders' equity:

 (5)     The firm`s investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of the firm`s future net revenues from investment banking transactions where management believes 
         that future revenue realization is more likely than not.

 (7)     Consolidated entities held for investment purposes are entities that are held strictly for capital appreciation, have a defined exit strategy and are engaged in          
         activities that are not closely related to the firm's principal businesses. For example, these investments include consolidated entities that hold real estate assets,    
         such as hotels, but exclude investments in entities that primarily hold financial assets. Management believes that it is meaningful to review non-compensation expenses   
         excluding expenses related to these consolidated entities in order to evaluate trends in non-compensation expenses related to the firm's principal business activities.   
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (8)     As a bank holding company, the firm is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The firm is reporting its Tier 1 capital     
         ratio in accordance with the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to bank holding companies, which are based on the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee 
         on Banking Supervision (Basel I). The Tier 1 capital ratio equals Tier 1 capital divided by total risk-weighted assets. The firm`s risk-weighted assets under Basel I were 
         approximately $409 billion as of June 26, 2009. The firm continues to disclose its Tier 1 capital ratio in accordance with the capital guidelines applicable to it when   
         the firm was regulated by the SEC as a Consolidated Supervised Entity. These guidelines were generally consistent with those set out in the Revised Framework for the     
         International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel II). The firm`s risk-weighted assets   
         under Basel II were approximately $382 billion as of June 26, 2009. These ratios represent preliminary estimates as of the date of this earnings release and may be       
         revised in the firm`s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended June 26, 2009. For a further discussion of the firm's capital requirements, see "Equity   
         Capital" in Part I, Item 2 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

         ended June 26, 2009.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (10)    SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy 
         gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to            
         unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). Level 3 assets reflect prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and   
         unobservable. For a further discussion of the firm's level 3 assets, see "Critical Accounting Policies - Fair Value - Fair Value Hierarchy - Level 3" in Part I, Item 2   
         "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended March 27,

         period ended June 26, 2009.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (11)    The firm`s global core excess represents a pool of excess liquidity consisting of unencumbered, highly liquid securities that may be sold or pledged to provide same-day  
         liquidity, as well as overnight cash deposits. This liquidity is intended to allow the firm to meet immediate obligations without the need to sell other assets or depend 
         on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets in a difficult funding environment. This amount represents the average loan value (the estimated amount of cash that  
         would be advanced by counterparties against these securities), as well as overnight cash deposits, of the global core excess. For a further discussion of the firm's      
         global core excess liquidity pool, please see "Liquidity and Funding Risk" in Part I, Item 2 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  
         Operations" in the firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended March 27, 2009. This amount represents a preliminary estimate as of the date of this  
         earnings release and may be revised in the firm`s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended June 26, 2009.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (12)    Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, "Amortization of identifiable intangible assets" is included in "Depreciation and amortization" in the consolidated statements of 
         earnings. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (13)    Basic earnings per common share for the three and six months ended June 26, 2009 were computed in accordance with FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. EITF 03-6-1, "Determining 
         Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities," and the impact was a reduction of $0.02 per basic common share. There was  
         no impact from the adoption of FSP No. EITF 03-6-1 to earnings per basic common share for the quarter ended March 27, 2009. Prior periods have not been restated due to   
         immateriality.

         respectively, of consolidated entities held for investment purposes. Compensation and benefits includes $66 million, $70 million and $66 million for the three months     
         ended June 26, 2009, March 27, 2009 and May 30, 2008, respectively, attributable to these consolidated entities.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (15)    VaR is the potential loss in value of the firm`s trading positions due to adverse market movements over a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. The modeling  
         of the risk characteristics of the firm`s trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While management believes that these assumptions and     
         approximations are reasonable, there is no standard methodology for estimating VaR, and different assumptions and/or approximations could produce materially different VaR 
         estimates. For a further discussion of the calculation of VaR, see Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the firm`s Annual

&lt;p&gt;  NEW ORLEANS, LA, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The new release of Sanbolic's advanced clustered file system, Melio 2009
R2, is now available as a beta product and offers improved performance,
better scalability, and new options for data protection. This product
incorporates several new components designed for customers who will use
Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V for IT consolidation, business continuity
and datacenter optimization projects. The new lock architecture in the
file system adds the ability to support very large numbers of virtual
machine hosts accessing virtual machine files on a shared SAN volume with
near raw disk performance. Distributed snapshot capability allows
snapshots to be created from any host server, and is compatible with any
backup software using a standard volume shadow copy service (VSS) client.
Melio 2009 R2 beta and Sanbolic's LaScala clustered volume manager can be
used with any physical or virtual Windows Server, and is available as a
120-day evaluation version for Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V release
candidate at www.sanbolic.com.

    Melio FS and LaScala allow logical volumes on SAN storage to be configured
and assigned centrally and enable concurrent shared access to SAN volumes
from multiple physical or virtual servers. All Windows Server 2008 R2
Hyper-V hosts can access virtual machine files on a shared SAN volume
enabling live migration of virtual machines, even for virtual machines
with high I/O requirements. Melio FS can also provide shared access to
application data on a SAN volume from virtual servers, improving
application availability, performance, and scalability. Melio FS and
LaScala are fully compatible with System Center Virtual Machine Manager
2008 R2, as well as Windows Server technologies such as Failover
Clustering, MPIO, and Active Directory.

    Customers can easily install Melio FS and LaScala on Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V and virtual machines, and the software can be used with any
industry standard SAN storage. Sanbolic's products have no file system or
volume size limitations. Storage performance monitoring is integrated into
Melio FS, and quality of service can be set on a per virtual machine basis
if storage bandwidth is constrained. The snapshot capability provides
several unique features taking advantage of the capability of Melio
clustered file system. Snapshot can be mounted on any machine in the
storage cluster, independent of which machine created the snapshot. There
is no limit to the number of snapshots, and there are no preparation or
space reserve requirements. Differential snapshots are supported,
significantly reducing storage use and I/O performance impact.

    "Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V provides features and performance that
offer tremendous value for customers trying to optimize datacenter
operations," said Dai Vu, director of virtualization solutions marketing,
Server and Tools Business at Microsoft Corp. "The new release of Melio FS
will offer enterprise customers a high-performance and scalable storage
solution."

    Sanbolic software currently supports Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2,
Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and System Center Virtual
Machine Manager 2008 R2. Sanbolic distributes its product solutions
worldwide through a network of distributors, OEMs, VARs and system
integrators.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BridgeWays, a division of Xandros, today released a series of management
packs that enable system administrators to manage business critical
applications on Windows, Linux, and Unix from a single console. The new
management packs help extend Microsoft System Center Operations Manager

enterprise data centers with cross-platform environments.

    The management packs extend System Center capabilities to the management
of Oracle Database, MySQL Database, and Apache HTTP Server running on Red
Hat Enterprise Server, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Solaris, and

BridgeWays product line, which will continue to expand, was developed
under the broad technology and business collaboration agreement between
Microsoft and Xandros.

    "Microsoft recognizes that customers often have a mix of software and
hardware deployed in their enterprise and effectively managing across
these IT environments is critical to attaining the highest level of
efficiency and harnessing costs," said Larry Orecklin, general manager,
System Center and Virtualization marketing at Microsoft. "The System
Center management suite delivers these features and by working with
companies such as Xandros, with their knowledge of open source, LOB and
virtualization software, these capabilities are further extended enabling
customers to deeply manage their heterogeneous physical and virtual
enterprise."

    "The new BridgeWays management pacts are significant in two respects:
first, they demonstrate the benefits of our technology sharing agreement
with Microsoft; and, second, they enable single-console management of both
proprietary and open source applications," said Andreas Typaldos, CEO of
Xandros. "By exploiting the new cross platform capabilities of System

&lt;p&gt;  SAN RAMON, CA, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Sabrix, Inc., a leading provider of transaction tax management for
companies of all sizes, today announced it has attained Gold Certified
Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program with Competency in two
categories: ISV/Software Solutions and Microsoft Business Solutions.

    As a Gold Certified Partner, Sabrix has demonstrated expertise with
Microsoft technologies and a proven ability to meet customers' needs.
Microsoft Gold Certified Partners receive a rich set of benefits,
including access, training and support, giving them a competitive
advantage in the channel.

    Sabrix, Inc. is a leading provider of transaction tax management for
companies of all sizes, enabling finance, tax, and IT professionals to
achieve accurate, timely, and cost-effective compliance for sales tax, use
tax, Value Added Tax (VAT), excise tax and industry-specific taxes and
fees. With this latest announcement, Sabrix has proven its superior
compatibility with Microsoft technologies further delivering on its
promise to help its customers achieve compliance with confidence.

    "Achieving Microsoft Gold Certified Status attests to the reliability and
superiority of our outsourced sales and use tax compliance service for the
Microsoft Dynamics community," said Pam Kostka, SVP, Corporate Marketing
of Sabrix. "At Sabrix, we are not only committed to providing our
customers with the best tax technology and access to expert tax services,
but also the most advanced integration capabilities so customers can
achieve compliance with confidence, while leveraging their existing

    "Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap
between their business demands and technology capabilities," said Allison
Watson, corporate vice president of the Worldwide Partner Group at
Microsoft Corp. "They need to trust in a company that can act as an expert
adviser for their long-term strategic technology plans. Microsoft Gold
Certified Partners, which have certified expertise and direct training and
support from Microsoft, can build a positive customer experience with our
technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes Sabrix as a new Gold Certified
Partner for demonstrating its expertise in providing customer satisfaction
using Microsoft products and technology."

    As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status,
Sabrix had to declare Microsoft Competencies. Microsoft Competencies are
designed to help differentiate a partner's capabilities with specific
Microsoft technologies to customers looking for a particular type of
solution. Each Competency has a unique set of requirements and benefits,
formulated to accurately represent the specific skills and services that
partners bring to the technology industry. Within select Competencies,
there are Specializations that focus on specific solution areas that
recognize deeper expertise within that Competency. Serving as a
specialized path to earning those Competencies, Specializations give
direct access to the tools and resources that support that specific area
of focus.

    Competency: ISV/Software Solutions

    The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and focus
partners bring to a particular solution set. Microsoft Gold Certified
Partners that have obtained this competency have a successful record of
developing and marketing packaged software based on Microsoft
technologies.

    "Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to better
enable ISVs to meet customer needs," said Walid Abu-Hadba, corporate vice
president of the Developer and Platform Evangelism Group at Microsoft
Corp. "They allow ISVs to keep and win customers through their deep
knowledge of solutions-based Microsoft platform technologies. Microsoft
has a long history of working closely with ISV partners to help them
deliver compelling solutions and applications to our mutual customers,
and the Microsoft Competencies are an important step in continuing to
enhance vital relationships with ISVs worldwide."

    Competency: Microsoft Business Solutions

    The Microsoft Business Solutions Competency is designed for partners with
proven expertise in designing and/or implementing enterprise resource
planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities
using Microsoft's financial, CRM and supply chain management solutions.
Microsoft solutions partners have capitalized on this opportunity to help
organizations develop and build integrated ERP and CRM solutions around
Microsoft technology. The Microsoft Business Solutions Competency allows
partners to identify their unique, proven proficiency in deploying
applications based on Microsoft's financial, CRM and supply chain
management solutions.

    "Microsoft partners that specialize in business management systems meet a
unique market need," said Doug Kennedy, Vice President, Microsoft Dynamics
Partners at Microsoft Corp. "It is important to recognize how important
industry features are to delivering solutions that fit customer needs. We
work with partners building the skills needed for them to align to a key
industry and we are rolling out programs and initiatives such as the
Certified for Microsoft Dynamics program -- a solution certification
achieved by Microsoft Dynamics partners whose software solutions have met
Microsoft Corporation's highest standard for partner developed industry
solutions to deliver comprehensive business management systems."

    The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and represents
Microsoft's ongoing commitment to the success of partners worldwide. The
program offers a single, integrated partnering framework that recognizes
partner expertise, rewards the total impact that partners have in the
technology marketplace, and delivers more value to help partners'
businesses be successful.

 (Adds quote, byline, updates prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose
on Tuesday as investors bet that quarterly earnings from
Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) would kick off a strong reporting
season for financial companies, offsetting caution over the
looming release of June retail sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors will scrutinize the monthly retail sales data
from the Commerce Department for clues about consumer demand
and the strength of the economic recovery. The data is due at
8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT), along with the June Producer Price
Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a Reuters poll of economists, June retail
sales are expected to rise 0.4 percent month-over-month, versus
an increase of 0.5 percent in May. Excluding autos, retail
sales are expected to match the prior month's 0.5 percent
gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are looking for some indication that as we approach
the critical back to school and ultimately the Christmas season
that there is some indication that consumers are starting to
open their pocketbooks," said Rick Meckler, president of
investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All these numbers are becoming somewhat important in terms
of sectors of the market finding their legs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 rose 4.9 points and were above fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 climbed
57 points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures added 0.50 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, whose results are due before the bell, is among
several marquee names scheduled to post quarterly results on
Tuesday, including two Dow components -- chipmaker Intel Corp
(INTC.O) and diversified healthcare company Johnson  Johnson
(JNJ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before the bell shares of Goldman Sachs were flat at
$149.45, a day after an upbeat analyst recommendation on the
stock sent banks shares rallying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also high on the news agenda are developments surrounding
embattled CIT Group Inc (CIT.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a source familiar with the matter, the
Treasury and the U.S. Federal Reserve are exploring ways to
provide relief to CIT, a key source of financing for thousands
of small and medium-sized companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIT shares jumped 26 percent to $1.70 before the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the bell on Monday, No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp
(CSX.N) rose 6.1 percent after the company reported a
stronger-than-expected quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dell Inc DELL.O could set the tone for the technology

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Allied Healthcare International Inc. (NASDAQ: AHCI) (AIM: AHI)
(http://www.alliedhealthcare.com), a leading provider of flexible
healthcare staffing services in the United Kingdom, has secured a
prestigious three-year contract from the Waltham Forest Borough Council in
the United Kingdom. Under the new Waltham Forest contract, Allied has the
opportunity to deliver up to three thousand hours of home care services a
week (156,000 hours a year), as a sole provider within the "South Patch,"
one of three geographically defined areas of Waltham Forest Borough. (The
hours opportunity is based on the existing care provision under the
jurisdiction of the contract, as laid out by the tender specification, and
may be subject to change.) This award represents approximately 33% of the
overall contracts given to homecare providers by the council. The opening
of this new geographic location expands Allied's network to 109 branches
across the United Kingdom.

    Initially, Allied Healthcare was working with Waltham Forest as a spot
provider of domiciliary care, one of thirteen such providers working with
the local authority. In 2008, Waltham Forest Local Authority (LA) and
Primary Care Trust (PCT), jointly tendered for an outcomes based homecare
contract to service the residents of Waltham Forest; this contract was
designed to improve the health and well-being of local residents according
to objectives outlined in a government white paper titled, "Our Health,
Our Care, Our Say."

    Allied Healthcare was successful in passing the first stages of the
process and was invited to future rounds of negotiation meetings. The
Council had geographically divided the borough into four patches, with an
initial expectation of appointing one provider to each region; the four
appointed providers would then form a partnership with the LA and the PCT
to further develop the outcome-based model of care. The Council was so
impressed by Allied and two other providers that they chose to
geographically reconfigure the borough into three patches. Allied was
awarded the South Patch and was the only existing provider to retain
supply within the borough.

    Following the award of the South Patch, Allied Healthcare, alongside the
PCT and LA and two new providers, formed a partnership agreement that
would be used at the steering group to shape the service during the life
of the contract. Allied had a period of approximately three months to
implement the new contract, including the recruitment of new carers and
transfer of existing clients and service users. Contract "Go-Live" was
set for April 21, 2009, and Allied was able to successfully transfer all
of the Service Users under the contract.

    "The Bid Team was fundamental to the company's success in securing a
contract award with the London Borough Waltham Forest," said Jonathan
Carr, Interim Commissioning Support - Adult Social Care at the London
Borough of Waltham Forest. "They remained both professional and
impressive at all times and contributed significantly to the service
specification on which the best and final offers were invited. This
commitment was followed up at both the implementation and contract
commencement stages. Having this continuity of senior management
throughout the process was, and remains, key to the relationships that
have been built up and the prospects for the service. Allied's excellent
support to the Council and other two partner providers during the initial
contract difficulties, must also be noted."

    "We are delighted to be working with Waltham Forest," said Sandy Young,
Allied Healthcare Chief Executive Officer. "This is a tremendous
opportunity for Allied to provide a comprehensive level of service to the
residents of the South Patch region and we look forward to continuing to
work with the PCT, LA, carers, and service users to shape better outcomes

in European equities which rallied for a second day on Tuesday,
ahead of results from U.S. bellwethers Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and
Intel. (INTC.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1023 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top

&lt;p&gt;* Schwerpunkt liegt auf der Entwicklung fortschrittlicher Biokraftstoffe aus
photosynthetischen Algen
* Allianz mit f&#252;hrendem Genomik-Innovator, Synthetic Genomics Inc.

IRVING, Texas (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) hat heute eine Allianz mit dem f&#252;hrenden
Biotechnologie- Unternehmen, Synthetic Genomics Inc. (SGI), zur Erforschung und
Entwicklung von Biokraftstoffen der n&#228;chsten Generation aus photosynthetischen
Algen bekannt gegeben. 

&#8222;Diese Investition erfolgt nach jahrelanger Planung und ist eine wichtige
Erweiterung der laufenden Bem&#252;hungen von ExxonMobil, bahnbrechende Technologien
zu f&#246;rdern, um zur L&#246;sung der weltweiten Energieprobleme beizutragen", sagte Dr.
Emil Jacobs, Vice President des Bereichs Forschung und Entwicklung der
ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. 

&#8222;Die Deckung des weltweit steigenden Energiebedarfs fordert eine Vielzahl
verschiedener Technologien und Energiequellen. Wir glauben, dass aus Algen
hergestellter Biokraftstoff in Zukunft eine bedeutende Rolle spielen k&#246;nnte,
wenn unsere Anstrengungen erfolgreich sind, einen Kraftstoff zu entwickeln, der
erschwinglich ist und geringe Kraftstoffemissionen hat." 

ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company hat mit SGI, einem Unternehmen, das
sich auf die Entwicklung genomisch orientierter L&#246;sungen konzentriert und vom
Pionier der Gentechnik, Dr. J. Craig Venter gegr&#252;ndet wurde, eine
Forschungsallianz geschlossen. Aus photosynthetischen Algen sollen
fortschrittliche Biokraftstoffe entwickelt werden, die mit heutigen Benzin- und
Dieselkraftstoffen vertr&#228;glich sind. 

Die Ausgaben von ExxonMobil f&#252;r das Programm belaufen sich voraussichtlich auf
&#252;ber 600 Millionen US Dollar - darunter etwa 300 Millionen US Dollar f&#252;r interne
Kosten und m&#246;glicherweise mehr als 300 Millionen f&#252;r Zahlungen an SGI - sofern
die Etappenziele in Forschung und Entwicklung mit Erfolg erreicht werden. 

&#8222;Obwohl noch grundlegende Arbeiten und jahrelange Forschungs- und
Entwicklungst&#228;tigkeiten vor uns liegen, k&#246;nnten im Erfolgsfall Kraftstoffe auf
Algenbasis dazu beitragen, den weltweit wachsenden Bedarf zu decken und
gleichzeitig die Treibhausgasemissionen zu reduzieren", sagte Michael Dolan,
Senior Vice President von ExxonMobil. &#8222;Unser neues Forschungsprogramm &#252;ber
Biokraftstoffe auf Algenbasis erg&#228;nzt die laufenden Bem&#252;hungen von ExxonMobil
die Emissionen zu senken sowohl in den eigenen operativen Gesch&#228;ftseinheiten als
auch bei der Anwendung unserer Produkte durch die Verbraucher und zwar durch
Verbesserung der Effizienz als auch durch zukunftsweisende Technologien." 

W&#228;hrend der letzten f&#252;nf Jahre hat ExxonMobil &#252;ber 1,5 Milliarden US Dollar f&#252;r
solche Ma&#223;nahmen investiert, mit denen die Energieeffizienz gesteigert und die
Treibhausgasemissionen reduzieret werden k&#246;nnen. Zu den Initiativen geh&#246;ren
Technologien zur Verbesserung der Fahrzeugeffizienz, wie zum Beispiel
Reifenauskleidungen, die den Reifendruck l&#228;nger konstant halten,
fortschrittliches kraftstoffsparendes Motoren&#246;l sowie Fahrzeugkunststoffe mit
geringem Gewicht. Dar&#252;ber hinaus forscht das Unternehmen an der Steigerung der
Motoreffizienz, hat eine verbesserte Separatorfolie f&#252;r Lithiumbatterien f&#252;r
Hybrid-Elektrofahrzeuge entwickelt und f&#246;rdert die Erforschung der M&#246;glichkeiten
zur Verbesserung von Solarenergie, Biokraftstoffen und Kohlenstoffabscheidung
und -speicherung (CCS). 

&#8222;Die echte Herausforderung bei der Erzeugung eines einsatzf&#228;higen Biokraftstoffs
der n&#228;chsten Generation ist, ihn in gro&#223;en Mengen zu produzieren. Dies erfordert
wesentliche Fortschritte in Wissenschaft und Technik", sagte Venter, CEO von
SGI. &#8222;Die Allianz zwischen SGI und ExxonMobil kombiniert die sich erg&#228;nzenden
F&#228;higkeiten und Fachkenntnisse der beiden Unternehmen f&#252;r die Entwicklung
innovativer L&#246;sungen, die zu einer Produktion von Biokraftstoff aus Algen in
gro&#223;em Umfang f&#252;hren k&#246;nnte." 

Die technischen und wissenschaftlichen Erfahrungen von ExxonMobil werden in
allen Stadien des Programms genutzt, von der Systementwicklung zur Steigerung
der Algenproduktion bis hin zur Herstellung marktf&#228;higer Kraftstoffe. 

Jacobs f&#252;gte hinzu: &#8222;Nach gr&#252;ndlichen Studien sind wir zu dem Schluss gekommen,
dass die potenziellen Vorteile und der Nutzen von Biokraftstoff aus Algen
erheblich sein k&#246;nnten. Neben anderen Vorteilen k&#246;nnten vorhandenes Sonnenlicht
und Kohlendioxid, das f&#252;r das Wachstum der photosynthetischen Algen gebraucht
wird, einen Beitrag zur Reduzierung von Treibhausgasen leisten. F&#252;r die Z&#252;chtung
von Algen werden weder Frischwasser noch Ackerland ben&#246;tigt, die sonst der
Produktion von Lebensmitteln vorbehalten sind. Dar&#252;ber hinaus haben Algen das
Potential gro&#223;e Mengen &#214;l zu erzeugen. Die k&#246;nnen in vorhandenen Raffinerien zur
Herstellung von Kraftstoffen verwendet werden, die wiederum mit der bestehenden
Verkehrstechnologie und -infrastruktur nutzbar sind." 

&#220;ber ExxonMobil

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
AltiGen Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATGN), a leading provider of 100
percent Microsoft-based VoIP call centers, phone systems and intelligent
gateways, today announced it has been deployed at Gibson Guitar's
Nashville headquarters to integrate with Microsoft Office Communications
Server 2007.

    Gibson is an early adopter of the Microsoft OCS solution. Earlier this
year, Gibson made the decision to increase the capability of its call
center. AltiGen was selected for its ability to provide intelligent
routing, supervision and call recording. In addition to functioning as the
call center, AltiGen is also providing an integrated, intelligent gateway
for PSTN connectivity to both the call center and the OCS server.

    "Gibson is the world's leading manufacturer of musical instruments and
musical technology," said Eddie Martinie, Gibson Information Technology
Manager. "We hold our products and company infrastructure to the same
standards of excellence and leading technology. Gibson endeavors to use
nothing but the best, and that is why we chose AltiGen for our call
center. It will help us maintain our competitive advantage."

    "From day one we have utilized Microsoft as the platform for all of our
voice applications," said Shirley Sun, AltiGen's vice president of
research and development. "With native integration, we are a complementary
extension when companies choose to utilize Microsoft's unified
communications solutions."

    "In one day I seamlessly integrated OCS with the AltiGen call center/voice
gateway," added Martinie. "Once I received the AltiGen server, it was
installed and ready to go in a few hours. An AltiGen engineer remotely
connected to the server and configured updates while I dropped phones off
at desks. By the time I got back, I was setting up extensions the same day
I received the hardware.

    "Microsoft OCS has completely changed our company culture. The next step
was to extend that to our call center. I tested all of the available call
center products that tie into OCS. None of them even came close to the
AltiGen solution. The affordability and seamless integration with
Microsoft OCS is really the best of both worlds," Martinie concluded.

    AltiGen will be demonstrating its integration with Microsoft Office
Communications Server 2007 this week in New Orleans at the Microsoft
Worldwide Partner Conference.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
AltiGen Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATGN), a leading provider of 100
percent Microsoft-based VoIP call centers, phone systems and intelligent
gateways, today announced it has been deployed at Gibson Guitar's
Nashville headquarters to integrate with Microsoft Office Communications
Server 2007.

    Gibson is an early adopter of the Microsoft OCS solution. Earlier this
year, Gibson made the decision to increase the capability of its call
center. AltiGen was selected for its ability to provide intelligent
routing, supervision and call recording. In addition to functioning as the
call center, AltiGen is also providing an integrated, intelligent gateway
for PSTN connectivity to both the call center and the OCS server.

    "Gibson is the world's leading manufacturer of musical instruments and
musical technology," said Eddie Martinie, Gibson Information Technology
Manager. "We hold our products and company infrastructure to the same
standards of excellence and leading technology. Gibson endeavors to use
nothing but the best, and that is why we chose AltiGen for our call
center. It will help us maintain our competitive advantage."

    "From day one we have utilized Microsoft as the platform for all of our
voice applications," said Shirley Sun, AltiGen's vice president of
research and development. "With native integration, we are a complementary
extension when companies choose to utilize Microsoft's unified
communications solutions."

    "In one day I seamlessly integrated OCS with the AltiGen call center/voice
gateway," added Martinie. "Once I received the AltiGen server, it was
installed and ready to go in a few hours. An AltiGen engineer remotely
connected to the server and configured updates while I dropped phones off
at desks. By the time I got back, I was setting up extensions the same day
I received the hardware.

    "Microsoft OCS has completely changed our company culture. The next step
was to extend that to our call center. I tested all of the available call
center products that tie into OCS. None of them even came close to the
AltiGen solution. The affordability and seamless integration with
Microsoft OCS is really the best of both worlds," Martinie concluded.

    AltiGen will be demonstrating its integration with Microsoft Office
Communications Server 2007 this week in New Orleans at the Microsoft
Worldwide Partner Conference.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) anunci&#243; hoy una alianza con la compa&#241;&#237;a
l&#237;der en biotecnolog&#237;a, Synthetic Genomics Inc. (SGI), para investigar y
desarrollar biocombustibles de pr&#243;xima generaci&#243;n derivados de algas
fotosint&#233;ticas. 

"Esta inversi&#243;n se est&#225; llevando a cabo despu&#233;s de varios a&#241;os de planeaci&#243;n e
investigaci&#243;n, y se suma de manera importante a los esfuerzos actuales de

las algas podr&#237;an ayudar a satisfacer la creciente demanda mundial por
combustible para transporte mientras se reduce la emisi&#243;n de gases de efecto
invernadero", afirm&#243; Michael Dolan, vicepresidente s&#233;nior de ExxonMobil.
"Nuestro nuevo programa de biocombustibles derivados de las algas complementa
los esfuerzos en desarrollo de ExxonMobil para reducir emisiones, tanto en
nuestras operaciones como por parte de los consumidores de nuestros productos, a
trav&#233;s de mejoras en la eficiencia e innovaciones tecnol&#243;gicas". 

ExxonMobil ha invertido m&#225;s de US$1,500 millones durante los &#250;ltimos cinco a&#241;os
en actividades que incrementan la eficiencia energ&#233;tica y reducen las emisiones
de gases de efecto invernadero. Las iniciativas incluyen tecnolog&#237;as para
mejorar la eficiencia automotriz, tales como revestimientos para neum&#225;ticos que
los mantienen inflados durante m&#225;s tiempo, aceites de motor de avanzada
tecnolog&#237;a que ahorran combustible y pl&#225;sticos livianos para autom&#243;viles. 

Adem&#225;s, la compa&#241;&#237;a est&#225; realizando investigaciones para mejorar la eficiencia
de los motores, ha desarrollado una pel&#237;cula separadora mejorada para bater&#237;as
de ion-litio utilizadas en carros el&#233;ctricos h&#237;bridos y patrocina una
investigaci&#243;n innovadora que est&#225; en busca de maneras para mejorar la captaci&#243;n
y almacenamiento de energ&#237;a solar, biocombustibles y carbono. 

"El verdadero desaf&#237;o de crear un biocombustible viable de pr&#243;xima generaci&#243;n
consiste en alcanzar la capacidad de producirlo en grandes vol&#250;menes, lo cual
requerir&#225; avances significativos tanto en ciencia como en ingenier&#237;a", dijo el
Dr. Venter, director ejecutivo de SGI. "La alianza entre SGI y ExxonMobil

desarrollar soluciones innovadoras que podr&#237;an conducirnos a la producci&#243;n a
gran escala de biocombustibles derivados de las algas". 

La pericia en el campo de la ingenier&#237;a y de la ciencia que posee ExxonMobil
ser&#225; utilizada a lo largo de todo el programa, desde el desarrollo de sistemas
para aumentar la escala de producci&#243;n de algas hasta la fabricaci&#243;n de
combustibles terminados. 

El Dr. Jacobs a&#241;adi&#243;: "Despu&#233;s de un estudio considerable, hemos determinado que
las ventajas y beneficios potenciales del biocombustible derivado de las algas
podr&#237;an ser significativos. Entre otras ventajas, la f&#225;cil disponibilidad de la
luz solar y del di&#243;xido de carbono que se usa para hacer crecer las algas
fotosint&#233;ticas podr&#237;a proporcionar beneficios de mitigaci&#243;n de gases de efecto
invernadero. El crecimiento de las algas no depende del agua dulce y de la
tierra cultivable que, por el contrario, se utilizan para la producci&#243;n de
alimentos. Finalmente, las algas tienen el potencial de producir grandes
vol&#250;menes de aceites que podr&#237;an ser procesados en las refiner&#237;as existentes
para fabricar combustibles que sean compatibles con la tecnolog&#237;a e
infraestructura de transporte existentes".

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
AExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) anunciou hoje uma alian&#231;a com a Synthetic
Genomics Inc. (SGI), uma das principais empresas do setor de biotecnologia, para
pesquisar e desenvolver biocombust&#237;veis de &#250;ltima gera&#231;&#227;o de algas
fotossint&#233;ticas. 

"Este investimento segue-se a v&#225;rios anos de planejamento e estudos e &#233; um
acr&#233;scimo importante &#224;s cont&#237;nuas iniciativas da ExxonMobil para desenvolver
tecnologias revolucion&#225;rias que ajudem a enfrentar os desafios energ&#233;ticos do
mundo", disse Emil Jacobs, vice-presidente de pesquisa e desenvolvimento da
ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. 

"Atender &#224;s crescentes demandas energ&#233;ticas do mundo vai exigir uma grande
variedade de tecnologias e fontes energ&#233;ticas. Acreditamos que o biocombust&#237;vel
produzido de algas pode ser uma parte significativa da solu&#231;&#227;o para o futuro, se
os nossos esfor&#231;os resultarem em um combust&#237;vel para transporte economicamente
vi&#225;vel e com baixa emiss&#227;o de carbono l&#237;quida." 

A ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company firmou uma alian&#231;a de pesquisa e
desenvolvimento com a SGI, empresa de capital fechado com foco no
desenvolvimento de solu&#231;&#245;es gen&#244;micas fundada pelo pioneiro dos estudos do
genoma, J. Craig Venter, para desenvolver, a de algas fotossint&#233;ticas,
biocombust&#237;veis compat&#237;veis com os combust&#237;veis a diesel e gasolina de hoje. 

Com esse programa, a ExxonMobil espera gastar mais de US$ 600 milh&#245;es - que
incluem cerca de US$ 300 milh&#245;es em custos internos e potencialmente mais de US$
300 milh&#245;es para a SGI - se os marcos de pesquisa e desenvolvimento forem
atingidos com sucesso. 

"Embora ainda haja trabalho importante e anos de pesquisa e desenvolvimento pela
frente, se derem certo, os combust&#237;veis a base de algas podem ajudar a atender &#224;
crescente demanda por combust&#237;vel de transporte e, ao mesmo tempo, reduzir as
emiss&#245;es dos gases do efeito estufa", disse Michael Dolan, vice-presidente
s&#234;nior da ExxonMobil. "O nosso novo programa de biocombust&#237;veis de algas
complementa os esfor&#231;os cont&#237;nuos da ExxonMobil para reduzir as emiss&#245;es das
nossas opera&#231;&#245;es e dos consumidores dos nossos produtos, por meio de melhorias
de efici&#234;ncia e importantes descobertas tecnol&#243;gicas." 

Nos &#250;ltimos cinco anos, a ExxonMobil investiu mais de US$ 1,5 bilh&#227;o em
atividades que melhoram a efici&#234;ncia energ&#233;tica e reduzem as emiss&#245;es dos gases
do efeito estufa. Entre essas iniciativas incluem-se tecnologias para melhorar a
efici&#234;ncia automobil&#237;stica, como revestimentos de pneus que mant&#234;m os pneus
cheios por mais tempo, &#243;leo de motor avan&#231;ado para promover a economia de
combust&#237;vel e pl&#225;sticos automotivos leves. A empresa tamb&#233;m est&#225; desenvolvendo
pesquisas sobre maior efici&#234;ncia de motores, desenvolveu uma pel&#237;cula separadora
mais eficiente para baterias de l&#237;tio para carros el&#233;tricos h&#237;bridos e patrocina
pesquisa de vanguarda sobre formas de melhoria da energia solar, de
biocombust&#237;veis e de captura e armazenagem de carbono. 

"O verdadeiro desafio para a cria&#231;&#227;o de um biocombust&#237;vel de &#250;ltima gera&#231;&#227;o
vi&#225;vel est&#225; na capacidade de produzi-lo em grandes volumes, o que vai exigir
avan&#231;os significativos tanto em ci&#234;ncia quanto em engenharia", disse Venter,
diretor executivo da SGI. "A alian&#231;a entre a SGI e a ExxonMobil reunir&#225;
capacidades complementares e o conhecimento especializado das duas empresas para
desenvolver solu&#231;&#245;es inovadoras que podem levar &#224; produ&#231;&#227;o em larga escala de
biocombust&#237;vel de algas." 

Conhecimentos especializados de ci&#234;ncia e engenharia ser&#227;o utilizados em todo o
programa, desde o desenvolvimento de sistemas para aumentar a escala de produ&#231;&#227;o
de algas at&#233; a fabrica&#231;&#227;o de combust&#237;veis acabados. 

Jacobs acrescentou: "Depois de um volume consider&#225;vel de estudos, conclu&#237;mos que
as vantagens e os benef&#237;cios potenciais do biocombust&#237;vel de algas podem ser
significativos. Entre outras vantagens, a luz solar e o di&#243;xido de carbono
imediatamente dispon&#237;veis usados para cultivar algas fotossint&#233;ticas podem
oferecer benef&#237;cios de redu&#231;&#227;o dos gases de efeito estufa. O cultivo de algas
n&#227;o se baseia em &#225;gua doce e terra cultiv&#225;vel utilizadas para a produ&#231;&#227;o de
alimentos. Por fim, as algas t&#234;m o potencial de produzir grandes volumes de
&#243;leos que podem ser processados em refinarias j&#225; existentes, para fabricar
combust&#237;veis compat&#237;veis com a tecnologia e a infraestrutura de transporte j&#225;

&lt;p&gt;* Fokus p&#229; utvikling av avanserte typer biodrivstoff fra fotosyntetiske alger
* Allianse med Synthetic Genomics Inc., en ledende nyskaper innen genforskning

IRVING, TX--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) kunngjorde i dag at de har inng&#229;tt en
allianse med det ledende bioteknologiske selskapet Synthetic Genomics Inc.
(SGI), for &#229; drive forskningsvirksomhet og utvikle neste generasjon biodrivstoff
fra fotosyntetiske alger. 

- Denne investeringen kommer etter flere &#229;r med planlegging og studier, og er et
viktig tilskudd til ExxonMobils l&#248;pende arbeide knyttet til
gjennombruddsteknologi som kan v&#230;re med p&#229; &#229; hjelpe verden med &#229; m&#248;te fremtidens
energiutfordringer, sier Dr. Emil Jacobs, visepresident for forskning og
utvikling hos ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. 

- &#197; m&#248;te verdens &#248;kende energibehov vil kreve en rekke teknologier og
energikilder. Vi tror at biodrivstoff produsert fra alger kan v&#230;re en
meningsfull del av l&#248;sningen i fremtiden, dersom v&#229;re fors&#248;k f&#248;rer til et
transportdrivstoff som er &#248;konomisk levedyktig og har lavt netto karbonutslipp. 

ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company har inng&#229;tt en forsknings- og
utviklingsallianse med SGI, et privat selskap som fokuserer p&#229; &#229; utvikle
genetisk drevne l&#248;sninger. Selskapet ble etablert av Dr. J. Craig Venter, med
form&#229;l &#229; utvikle avanserte typer biodrivstoff fra fotosyntetiske alger som er
kompatible med dagens bensin- og dieseldrivstoff. 

Som del av programmet forventer ExxonMobil &#229; bruke mer enn $600 millioner - det
omfatter ca. $300 millioner i interne omkostninger og potensielt mer enn $300
millioner til SGI - hvis m&#229;lene som er knyttet til forskning og utvikling, n&#229;s. 

- Selv om det gjenst&#229;r betydelig med arbeid og flere &#229;r med forskning og
utvikling kan algebaserte drivstoff, hvis vi lykkes, hjelpe med &#229; m&#248;te verdens
&#248;kende behov for transportdrivstoff, samtidig som det er med p&#229; &#229; redusere
utslipp av klimagasser, sier Michael Dolan, senior visepresident hos ExxonMobil.
- V&#229;rt nye biodrivstoffprogram komplementerer ExxonMobils l&#248;pende arbeide med &#229;
redusere utslipp fra v&#229;r virksomhet, og hos brukerne av v&#229;re produkter gjennom
b&#229;de effektivitetsforbedringer og teknologiske gjennombrudd. 

ExxonMobil har investert mer enn $1,5 milliarder i l&#248;pet av de siste fem &#229;rene
p&#229; aktiviteter som forbedrer energieffektivitet og reduserer utslippet av
klimagasser. Tiltakene omfatter teknologi som forbedrer bilers effektivitet,
slik som oppbyggingen av bildekk som gj&#248;r at dekk holder lengre p&#229; lufttrykket,
avansert motorolje som forbedrer drivstoff&#248;konomi, og lettvektsplast for biler.
I tillegg forsker selskapet p&#229; forbedret motoreffektivitet, vi har utviklet et
forbedret sperrelag for litiumbatterier brukt i hybridbiler, og sponser
banebrytende forskning for &#229; finne l&#248;sninger som kan forbedre solenergi,
biodrivstoff og karbonfangst- og lagring. 

- Den virkelige utfordringen for &#229; skape levedyktige neste-generasjons
biodrivstoff, er evnen til &#229; produsere i stor m&#229;lestokk, noe som vil kreve
betydelige fremskritt innen b&#229;de vitenskap og maskinteknikk, sier Venter, SGIs
administrerende direkt&#248;r. - Alliansen mellom SGI og ExxonMobil vil f&#248;re sammen
de komplimenterende egenskapene og ekspertisen hos begge selskaper til &#229; utvikle
nyskapende l&#248;sninger som kan f&#248;re til produksjon av biodrivstoff fra alger i
stor m&#229;lestokk. 

ExxonMobils ekspertise innen maskinteknikk og vitenskap vil bli tatt i bruk
under programmet, fra utvikling av systemer for storskala produksjon av alger
helt fram til fremstillingen av ferdige drivstoff. 

Jacobs legger til: - Etter grundige unders&#248;kelser har vi sl&#229;tt fast at de
potensielle fordelene og gevinstene knyttet til fremstilling av biodrivstoff fra
alger, kan v&#230;re betydelige. Blant annet kan fri tilgang p&#229; sol og karbondioksid
brukes til &#229; dyrke frem fotosyntetiske alger som kan v&#230;re fordelaktig med tanke
p&#229; &#229; redusere utslipp av klimagasser. Dyrking av alger er ikke avhengig av
ferskvann eller dyrket jord som ellers blir brukt til matproduksjon. Og endelig:
alger har potensiale til &#229; produsere store mengder olje som kan behandles i
eksisterende raffinerier til &#229; produsere drivstoff som er kompatible med
eksisterende transportteknologier og infrastruktur.

&lt;p&gt;* L`obbiettivo &#232; lo sviluppo di biocarburanti avanzati prodotti da alghe
fotosintetiche
* Sviluppo di una collaborazione con la societ&#224; Synthetic Genomics Inc., leader
nell`innovazione nel campo della genomica

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
La Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) ha annunciato oggi l`avvio di una
collaborazione con la Synthetic Genomics Inc. (SGI), societ&#224; leader nel campo
delle biotecnologie, per la ricerca e lo sviluppo di biocarburanti di prossima
generazione dalle alghe fotosintetiche. 

"Questo investimento giunge dopo diversi anni di pianificazione e studio e
rappresenta un importante tassello che va ad aggiungersi al continuo impegno
della ExxonMobil per lo sviluppo di tecnologie d`avanguardia che contribuiscano
a vincere le sfide energetiche mondiali," ha dichiarato il Dr. Emil Jacobs,
Vicepresidente del settore Ricerca e Sviluppo della ExxonMobil Research and
Engineering Company. 

"Per soddisfare la crescente domanda energetica mondiale, sar&#224; necessario un
insieme di tecnologie e di fonti energetiche. Riteniamo che i biocarburanti
prodotti dalle alghe potrebbero rappresentare, in futuro, una parte
significativa della soluzione, laddove le nostre ricerche ci portino allo
sviluppo di un carburante che sia economicamente valido e a basse emissioni di
anidride carbonica." 

La ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company ha siglato una collaborazione con
la SGI - societ&#224; privata la cui attivit&#224; &#232; incentrata sullo sviluppo di
soluzioni a indirizzo genomico e fondata dal pioniere negli studi sul genoma,
Dr. J. Craig Venter - per la ricerca e lo sviluppo di biocarburanti avanzati da
alghe fotosintetiche, compatibili con la benzina e il gasolio di oggi. 

Nell`ambito di questo programma, la ExxonMobil prevede un investimento di oltre
600 milioni di dollari - che comprendono circa 300 milioni di dollari di ricerca
interna e, potenzialmente, oltre 300 milioni di dollari di contributo alla SGI -
se gli obiettivi di ricerca e sviluppo verranno raggiunti con successo. 

"Sebbene siano ancora necessari tanto lavoro e anni di ricerca e sviluppo, se
avremo successo, i carburanti derivati dalle alghe potrebbero contribuire a
soddisfare la crescita della domanda mondiale di carburanti per il trasporto,
riducendo al contempo le emissioni di gas a effetto serra," ha dichiarato
Michael Dolan, Senior Vice President della ExxonMobil. "Il nostro nuovo
programma sui biocarburanti prodotti dalle alghe si affianca all`impegno
costante della ExxonMobil per ridurre le emissioni derivanti dalle nostre
operazioni e dai consumatori finali dei nostri prodotti, attraverso i
miglioramenti nel campo dell`efficienza e l`innovazione tecnologica." 

La ExxonMobil ha investito oltre 1.5 miliardi di dollari negli ultimi cinque
anni in attivit&#224; che migliorano l`efficienza energetica e riducono le emissioni
di gas a effetto serra. Esse includono lo sviluppo di tecnologie per migliorare
l`efficienza delle autovetture, come ad esempio rivestimenti interni per
pneumatici che mantengono a lungo la corretta pressurizzazione, lubrificanti
avanzati per ridurre i consumi e plastiche leggere per componenti dell`auto.
Inoltre, la societ&#224; sta svolgendo attivit&#224; di ricerca per migliorare
l`efficienza dei motori, ha sviluppato una membrana separatrice per batterie a
ioni di litio per veicoli ibridi ed elettrici e sostiene la ricerca avanzata per
il progresso degli studi nel campo dell`energia solare, dei biocarburanti e
della cattura e stoccaggio del carbonio. 

"La vera sfida nel creare una prossima generazione di biocarburanti
effettivamente valida sta nella possibilit&#224; di produrli in grandi volumi, cosa
che richieder&#224; progressi significativi sia sotto il profilo scientifico che
ingegneristico," ha dichiarato Venter, CEO della SGI. "La collaborazione tra la
SGI e la ExxonMobil unir&#224; le diverse competenze e le capacit&#224; di entrambe le
societ&#224; per sviluppare soluzioni innovative che possano portare alla produzione
su larga scala di biocarburanti derivati dalle alghe." 

Le competenze della ExxonMobil nel settore ingegneristico e scientifico saranno
utilizzate in ogni aspetto del programma, dallo sviluppo di sistemi per
aumentare la scala di produzione delle alghe alla produzione di carburanti
finiti. 

Emil Jacobs ha aggiunto: "Dopo studi approfonditi, abbiamo constatato che le
potenzialit&#224; e i benefici dei biocarburanti derivati dalle alghe potrebbero
essere significativi. Tra questi, la disponibilit&#224; della luce solare e
l`anidiride carbonica utilizzata per coltivare le alghe fotosintetiche
potrebbero produrre effetti positivi sulla riduzione delle emissioni di gas a
effetto serra. La coltivazione delle alghe non necessita di acqua dolce n&#232; di
terreni coltivabili utilizzati per la produzione alimentare. E, non ultimo, le
alghe hanno il potenziale di produrre grandi volumi di petrolio che pu&#242; essere
lavorato nelle raffinerie oggi esistenti per produrre carburanti compatibili con
le attuali tecnologie e infrastrutture per il trasporto."

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE : XOM) a annonc&#233; aujourd`hui la mise en place
d`une alliance avec la soci&#233;t&#233; Synthetic Genomics Inc. (SGI), leader sur le
march&#233; de la biotechnologie, pour travailler sur la recherche et le
d&#233;veloppement de la future g&#233;n&#233;ration de biocarburants &#224; base d`algues
photosynth&#233;tiques. 

&#171; Cet investissement survient apr&#232;s plusieurs ann&#233;es d`analyses et d`&#233;tudes.
C`est un nouvel &#233;l&#233;ment important qui vient s`ajouter aux efforts continus
d`ExxonMobil pour d&#233;velopper les technologies de pointe qui permettront de
relever les d&#233;fis &#233;nerg&#233;tiques mondiaux &#187;, a expliqu&#233; le Docteur Emil Jacobs,
vice-pr&#233;sident de la recherche et du d&#233;veloppement pour ExxonMobil Research and
Engineering Company. 

&#171; R&#233;pondre &#224; la demande mondiale croissante en &#233;nergie va exiger une multitude
de technologies et de sources d`&#233;nergies. Nous pensons que les biocarburants
produits &#224; partir d`algues pourraient &#234;tre une des r&#233;ponses dans l`avenir, si le
r&#233;sultat de nos travaux se traduit par la mise au point de carburants pour les
transports &#233;conomiquement viables et &#224; faibles &#233;missions de carbone. &#187; 

ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company a conclu une alliance pour la
recherche et le d&#233;veloppement avec SGI, soci&#233;t&#233; &#224; capitaux priv&#233;s, qui concentre
ses activit&#233;s sur le d&#233;veloppement de solutions bas&#233;es sur le g&#233;nome et qui a
&#233;t&#233; fond&#233;e par le pionnier du s&#233;quen&#231;age g&#233;n&#233;tique le Docteur J. Craig Venter.
Cette alliance devrait permettre de d&#233;velopper des biocarburants de pointe &#224;
base d`algues photosynth&#233;tiques, compatibles avec les essences et gazoles
d`aujourd`hui. 

Dans le cadre de ce programme, ExxonMobil s`appr&#234;te &#224; investir plus de 600
millions de dollars, dont environ 300 millions de dollars en co&#251;ts internes et
potentiellement plus de 300 millions de dollars au sein de SGI, si les &#233;tapes
identifi&#233;es pour la recherche et le d&#233;veloppement sont franchies avec succ&#232;s. 

&#171; M&#234;me si un important travail de recherche et d&#233;veloppement reste &#224; accomplir,
les carburants &#224; base d`algues pourraient, en cas de succ&#232;s, permettre de
satisfaire la demande mondiale croissante en carburant dans le domaine des
transports tout en r&#233;duisant les &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre &#187;, a expliqu&#233;
Michael Dolan, vice-pr&#233;sident d`ExxonMobil. &#171; Notre programme de biocarburants &#224;
base d`algues s`ajoute aux efforts continus d`ExxonMobil pour r&#233;duire les
&#233;missions de CO2 dans nos op&#233;rations et lors de la consommation de nos produits,
gr&#226;ce aux gains d`efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique et aux avanc&#233;es technologiques. &#187; 

ExxonMobil a investi plus de 1,5 milliard de dollars au cours des cinq derni&#232;res
ann&#233;es pour am&#233;liorer l`efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique et r&#233;duire les &#233;missions de gaz &#224;
effet de serre. Ces initiatives int&#232;grent les avanc&#233;es technologiques dans le
secteur automobile, telles que les rev&#234;tements int&#233;rieurs des pneus pour que
ceux-ci restent parfaitement gonfl&#233;s, une huile moteur de pointe permettant des
&#233;conomies de carburant ou encore des plastiques automobiles l&#233;gers. Par
ailleurs, la soci&#233;t&#233; cherche &#224; am&#233;liorer l`efficacit&#233; des moteurs et a notamment
d&#233;velopp&#233; un film s&#233;parateur pour les batteries au lithium utilis&#233; pour les
voitures &#233;lectriques ou hybrides. Elle parraine aussi les recherches dans les
domaines de l`&#233;nergie solaire, des biocarburants, du captage et du stockage du
carbone. 

&#171; Le v&#233;ritable d&#233;fi de cr&#233;er une nouvelle g&#233;n&#233;ration durable de biocarburants
repose sur la capacit&#233; &#224; les produire en grande quantit&#233;, ce qui va exiger des
avanc&#233;es scientifiques et technologiques importantes &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; M. Venter, PDG
de SGI. &#171; L`alliance entre SGI et ExxonMobil va permettre de mettre en commun
les comp&#233;tences compl&#233;mentaires et l`expertise des deux soci&#233;t&#233;s pour d&#233;velopper
des solutions innovantes qui pourraient mener &#224; une production &#224; grande &#233;chelle
de biocarburant &#224; base d`algues. &#187; 

L`ensemble des travaux s`appuiera sur l`expertise technique et scientifique
d`ExxonMobil depuis le d&#233;veloppement des syst&#232;mes permettant d`accro&#238;tre la
capacit&#233; de production d`algues jusqu`&#224; la fabrication de carburants
commerciaux. 

M. Jacobs a ajout&#233; : &#171; Apr&#232;s une &#233;tude approfondie, nous avons estim&#233; que les
atouts potentiels et les b&#233;n&#233;fices des biocarburants &#224; base d`algues pouvaient
&#234;tre majeurs. Entre autres, l`utilisation de la lumi&#232;re solaire et du dioxyde de
carbone facilement disponibles et n&#233;cessaires &#224; la croissance des algues
photosynth&#233;tiques permettrait de r&#233;duire les &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre.
La production d`algues ne n&#233;cessite pas d`eau douce ou de terres cultivables
n&#233;cessaires &#224; l`agriculture. Enfin, les algues ont les qualit&#233;s n&#233;cessaires pour
produire de grandes quantit&#233;s d`huile qui pourra &#234;tre trait&#233; dans les
raffineries existantes afin de produire des carburants compatibles avec les
technologies actuelles et qui pourront &#234;tre transport&#233;s dans les infrastructures
existantes. &#187;

&lt;p&gt;* Nadruk ligt op ontwikkeling van geavanceerde biobrandstoffen uit
fotosynthetische algen
* Samenwerking met Synthetic Genomics Inc.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) gaat samenwerken met het vooraanstaande
biotechnologiebedrijf Synthetic Genomics Inc. (SGI), om een nieuwe generatie
biobrandstoffen uit fotosynthetische algen te ontwikkelen. 

"Deze investering volgt op jaren van planning en onderzoek en is een belangrijke
aanvulling op ExxonMobil`s inspanningen om een doorbraak te realiseren op
energietechnologiegebied," zo zegt dr. Emil Jacobs, vice president research &amp;
development bij ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. 

"Om aan de groeiende energiebehoefte van de wereld te kunnen voldoen, zullen
meerdere technologie&#235;n en energiebronnen vereist zijn. Wij menen dat
biobrandstoffen geproduceerd door algen een belangrijk deel kunnen zijn van de
toekomstige oplossing op voorwaarde dat onze inspanningen leiden tot een
rendabele brandstof met lage netto CO2-uitstoot " aldus Emil Jacobs. 

ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company is een samenwerkingsverband
aangegaan op het gebied van onderzoek en ontwikkeling met SGI, een private
onderneming die zich richt op de ontwikkeling van genoom-gerichte oplossingen.
SGI is opgericht door genoom-pionier Dr. J. Craig Venter. De samenwerking
behelst de ontwikkeling van geavanceerde biobrandstoffen uit fotosynthetische
algen die uitwisselbaar zijn met de huidige generatie motorbrandstoffen. 

Indien het onderzoeks- en ontwikkelingsprogramma succesvol verloopt, verwacht
ExxonMobil in het kader van het project meer dan $600 miljoen uit te geven. De
interne kosten worden geraamd op $300 miljoen en mogelijk zal meer dan $300
miljoen aan SGI betaald worden. 

"Hoewel nog jaren van onderzoek en ontwikkeling voor de boeg liggen kunnen de op
algen gebaseerde brandstoffen helpen om aan de groeiende wereldvraag naar
transportbrandstoffen te voldoen. Tegelijkertijd kunnen ze bijdragen aan
vermindering van de broeikasgasemissies," aldus Michael Dolan, senior vice
president van ExxonMobil. "Ons nieuwe, op algen gebaseerde
biobrandstoffenproject past in ExxonMobil's streven om emissies van onze
productieprocessen en onze producten zowel via efficiencyverbeteringen als
technologiedoorbraken te verminderen." 

ExxonMobil heeft de afgelopen vijf jaar meer dan $1,5 miljard ge&#239;nvesteerd in
verbetering van de energie-effici&#235;ntie en het verminderen van de
broeikasgasemissies. Tot de initiatieven behoort het ontwikkelen van
technologie&#235;n die het brandstofverbruik beperken, zoals synthetische materialen
die autobanden langer op druk houden, geavanceerde motoroli&#235;n en lichtgewicht
kunststoffen. 

Ook doet bedrijf onderzoek naar verbeterde motoreffici&#235;ntie, heeft het de
lithiumbatterij-scheidingsfilm voor hybride en elektrische auto`s verbeterd en
financiert het baanbrekend onderzoek naar verbetering van zonne-energie,
biobrandstoffen en CO2-opslag. 

"De werkelijke uitdaging bij het ontwikkelen van een nieuwe generatie
biobrandstoffen is de mogelijkheid om grote hoeveelheden te produceren.
"Hiervoor zullen doorbraken in zowel wetenschap als technologie nodig zijn,"
aldus Craig Venter, CEO van SGI. "Het samenwerkingsverband tussen SGI en
ExxonMobil brengt kennis en expertise samen om innovatieve oplossingen te
ontwikkelen die kunnen leiden tot productie van biobrandstoffen uit algen op
grote schaal." 

ExxonMobil`s technologische en wetenschappelijke ervaring zal gedurende het
gehele project worden gebruikt, van de ontwikkeling van systemen ter vergroting
van de schaal van de algenproductie tot en met de productie van brandstoffen als
eindproduct. 

Emil Jacobs van ExxonMobil voegde hieraan toe: "Na uitgebreid onderzoek hebben
we vastgesteld dat de productie van biobrandstoffen uit algen mogelijk
belangrijke voordelen biedt. Het belangrijkste voordeel is dat broeikasgassen
verminderd kunnen worden door gebruik te maken van volop beschikbaar zonlicht en
CO2 voor het kweken van de fotosynthetische algen. Dit gaat niet ten kosten van
de beschikbaarheid van drinkwater en akkerland en dus niet van de
voedselproductie. Tenslotte kunnen algen grote hoeveelheden olie produceren die
verwerkt kunnen worden in bestaande raffinaderijen om brandstoffen te produceren
die zijn aangepast aan de bestaande transporttechnologie en infrastructuur." 

Over ExxonMobil

ExxonMobil, de grootste internationale naamloze vennootschap op het gebied van

&lt;p&gt;* Focus is on Development of Advanced Biofuels from Photosynthetic Algae
* Alliance Developed with Leading Genomics Innovator, Synthetic Genomics Inc.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) announced today an alliance with leading
biotech company, Synthetic Genomics Inc. (SGI), to research and develop next
generation biofuels from photosynthetic algae. 

"This investment comes after several years of planning and study and is an
important addition to ExxonMobil`s ongoing efforts to advance breakthrough
technologies to help meet the world`s energy challenges," said Dr. Emil Jacobs,
vice president of research and development at ExxonMobil Research and
Engineering Company. 

"Meeting the world`s growing energy demands will require a multitude of
technologies and energy sources. We believe that biofuel produced by algae could
be a meaningful part of the solution in the future if our efforts result in an
economically viable, low net carbon emission transportation fuel." 

ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company has entered into a research and
development alliance with SGI, a privately held company focused on developing
genomic-driven solutions and founded by genome pioneer, Dr. J. Craig Venter, to
develop advanced biofuels from photosynthetic algae that are compatible with
today`s gasoline and diesel fuels. 

Under the program, if research and development milestones are successfully met,
ExxonMobil expects to spend more than $600 million, which includes $300 million
in internal costs and potentially more than $300 million to SGI. 

"While significant work and years of research and development still must be
completed, if successful, algae-based fuels could help meet the world`s growing
demand for transportation fuel while reducing greenhouse gas emissions," said
Michael Dolan, senior vice president of ExxonMobil. "Our new algae biofuels
program complements ExxonMobil`s ongoing efforts to reduce emissions in our
operations and by consumers of our products, through both efficiency
improvements and technology breakthroughs." 

ExxonMobil has invested more than $1.5 billion over the past five years on
activities that improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Initiatives include technologies to improve automobile efficiency, such as tire
liners that keep tires inflated longer, advanced fuel-economy engine oil and
light-weight automobile plastics. As well, the company is researching enhanced
engine efficiency, has developed an improved lithium battery separator film for
hybrid electric cars, and sponsors breakthrough research into ways to improve
solar energy, biofuels and carbon capture and storage. 

"The real challenge to creating a viable next generation biofuel is the ability
to produce it in large volumes which will require significant advances in both
science and engineering," said Venter, CEO of SGI. "The alliance between SGI and
ExxonMobil will bring together the complementary capabilities and expertise of
both companies to develop innovative solutions that could lead to the large
scale production of biofuel from algae." 

ExxonMobil`s engineering and scientific expertise will be utilized throughout
the program, from the development of systems to increase the scale of algae
production through the manufacturing of finished fuels. 

Added Jacobs: "After considerable study, we have determined that the potential
advantages and benefits of biofuel from algae could be significant. Among other
advantages, readily available sunlight and carbon dioxide used to grow the
photosynthetic algae could provide greenhouse gas mitigation benefits. Growing
algae does not rely on fresh water and arable land otherwise used for food
production. And lastly, algae have the potential to produce large volumes of
oils that can be processed in existing refineries to manufacture fuels that are
compatible with existing transportation technology and infrastructure."

&lt;p&gt;July 14 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is expected to
announce on Tuesday a $600 million investment to produce liquid
transportation fuels from algae, the New York Times said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The oil major's biofuel effort involves a partnership with
Synthetic Genomics, a biotechnology company founded by the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - If results from Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are any indication of what's to come, earnings season may not be that bad after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's still early in the earnings season, and estimates for the Standard  Poor's 500 .SPX as a whole remain dismal, but chip maker Intel and investment bank Goldman dabbed a bit of hope into the market after handily beating expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel's revenue outlook topped analyst estimates, boosting U.S. and European stocks, and sending the PHLX semiconductor index .SOXX up 4.4 percent in late trading Wednesday. The world's largest chipmaker is seen as an economic bellwether and its results helped push indexes up 3.0 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts were less inclined to see Goldman as a barometer of the financial sector, however, but were still heartened by the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is probably one of the most important weeks in terms of what we're hoping to learn," about earnings and the market, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Intel is the model for the rest of the week, we're going to have a very good week," Ablin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has often outperformed its peers in earnings periods, but banking analyst Richard Bove said JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) second-quarter results could also beat expectations, based on Goldman's strong results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is scheduled to report on Thursday, along with International Business Machines (IBM.N) and Google Inc (GOOG.O). Bank of America (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) are expected on Friday, along with General Electric (GE.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The earnings season so far has been the typical 'beat expectations,' and I think it's just been enough with the market oversold to push things higher," said Brian Rauscher, director of portfolio strategy with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early earnings reports have buoyed sentiment, but going forward, investors will want to see more upbeat outlooks from companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And investors would be remiss in interpreting Goldman's optimism as indicative of the rest of the financial sector, particularly as the company's revenue came, in part, because of an increase in funds it was putting at risk through trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would be a mistake to apply Goldman earnings to the rest of the investment banking industry... They are in a unique position to scoop up market share as the 800-pound gorilla," said Bill Fitzpatrick of Optique Capital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter earnings for SP 500 companies are projected to decline 36 percent from a year ago, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Patrick Rucker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Wednesday filed civil charges for insider trading against 11 people, including a 26-year-old former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) investment banking analyst accused of leaking confidential merger information to his brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charges against five of the defendants involve trading ahead of the announcement last year that Liberty Mutual Insurance Company would buy Safeco Corp, a Seattle-based insurer, for $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other charges, against six different defendants, involve trading ahead of the buyout of Neff Corp, a Miami-based rental equipment company, by private equity firm Odyssey Investment Partners LLC, announced in 2005. These cases are unrelated to the lawsuits stemming from the Safeco trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators said they uncovered the activity through surveillance of unusual trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Anthony Perez, formerly a junior analyst with Goldman Sachs in New York, illegally tipped his brother, Ian, with material nonpublic information that he learned from his job about the potential acquisition of Safeco in April 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian Perez, 23, of Orlando, traded Safeco call options on the illicit information and made more than $150,000, the SEC contends in papers filed in federal court in Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said the Perez brothers have agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations. Anthony Perez will pay a penalty of $25,000 and Ian Perez agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $152,992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Perez, of Maitland, Florida, worked with Goldman's financial institutions group in New York from July 2007 to May 2008, according to the SEC's lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman, Ed Canaday, said on Wednesday that the analyst was fired immediately after the firm learned of the SEC matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the SEC accused Math Hipp Jr. of Seattle of insider trading in Safeco call options based on confidential information he misappropriated from his wife, an executive assistant at the insurer. Hipp made more than $118,000 through his trading, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hipp will pay $239,770 to settle the SEC's charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, the agency said. His lawyer declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the other cases was a lawsuit against Peter Talbot, of Springfield, Massachusetts, a former analyst at a subsidiary of The Hartford Financial Services Group, whom the SEC accused of illegally tipping his nephew after he learned at work that Safeco was a takeover target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two bought Safeco call options and sold them for a profit of more than $615,000, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talbot's lawyer said his client was disappointed that the SEC had filed the case, and that the investment decision Talbot's family made was based upon publicly available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Martha Graybow; Editing by Matt Daily and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day

Here are highlights from Tuesday`sAnalyst Blog: 

ENER Gets Out of Hybrid JV

On Monday, July 13, both Ovonic Battery Company, Inc. and Chevron Technology
Ventures LLC offloaded their equal stakes in the joint venture Cobasys L.L.C.
Ovonic is a subsidiary of Michigan-based Energy Conversion Devices, Inc.
(Nasdaq: ENER) while Chevron Technology is a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation
(NYSE: CVX). 

Cobasys develops and manufactures energy storage systems for hybrid electric
vehicles. The stakes were bought by South Korea-based SB LiMotive Company Ltd.
(SBL) - a $520 million joint venture between German car-parts maker, Robert
Bosch GmbH and South Korean electronics player Samsung SDI Company Inc. Through
the deal SB LiMotive expanded its product portfolio with nickel-metal hydride
batteries. 

The deal gets Energy Conversion Devices out of the unprofitable Cobasys JV. It
can now focus on its core solar laminates business, which has been hit hard in
recent times by falling demand for solar power on account of lack of project
financing. Project financing for solar projects became scarce in light of
ongoing recessionary trends. 

The Cobasys sale also opened up a revenue stream for Energy Conversion Devices.
Since Chevron and Ovonic Battery will continue to receive future royalties due
to Cobasys by Panasonic till 2014, with Ovonic`s share being 20%. 

Secondly, it puts an end to the long-standing legal tussle with Mercedes Benz
U.S. International, Inc. (MBUSI) over supply of batteries for a luxury hybrid
SUV being developed by MBUSI. To settle the lawsuit, OBC paid MBUSI $1.1 million
from the $1.3 million it received from Cobasys royalty income. Cobasys had the
royalty amount accumulated since January 2008 from Panasonic EV Energy Company
Ltd. 

Energy Conversion Devices is a leading global manufacturer of thin-film flexible
solar laminate products for building integrated and commercial rooftop markets.
We maintain our BUY recommendation on ENER. Our other strong BUY rated names in
the solar space are Evergreen Solar (Nasdaq: ESLR) and First Solar Inc. (Nasdaq:
FSLR). 

Virgin Media: 4 New HD Channels

Virgin Media (Nasdaq: VMED) on July 13, 2009, announced that it will soon launch
four new High Definition (HD) channels -- LIVING, FX, MTV Networks International
(MTVNHD) and National Geographic -- which will be available to VMED`s 3.6
million TV customers. The first channel is scheduled to be launched by the end
of July 2009. 

Virgin Media intends to increase its High Definition (HD) capabilities in 2009
to cope with the increasing demand for HD. The company currently has around 300
hours of HD content on its Video on Demand (VOD) platform. This consists of
around 60 movies at any one time and popular TV programs from the BBC and ITV.
VMED recently added HD content to the BBC iPlayer service on its TV platform. 

Since the first quarter of 2009, the company began the process of adding more HD
channels, and is in negotiations with a number of broadcasters. Currently, VMED
is in talks with UKTV about Good Food HD.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's market share of the U.S. Internet search market increased modestly in June, the first month that it fielded its new Bing search engine, according to the latest data from research firm ComScore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft captured 8.4 percent of U.S. Internet searches in June, up from 8 percent the month before, largely at the expense of rival Yahoo Inc, whose market share fell to 19.6 percent in June from 20.1 percent in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market leader Google Inc's share GOOG.O was unchanged from the prior month at 65 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given all the publicity and advertising around Bing, we were expecting a month-on-month increase," said Citi analyst Mark Mahaney, in a research note issued soon after the figures were published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But we think it's too early -- need three to four months to call a trend -- and the June move wasn't material enough to make any definitive statements as to whether Bing is a search market share game changer," said Mahaney. "We continue to view Bing as a very solid product, but one facing a very large uphill battle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been pouring investment into its money-losing online services business in an attempt to counter Google's dominance in the Internet search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still a possibility that Microsoft will strike a partnership with Yahoo to combine their online advertising strengths, after Microsoft's aborted attempt to buy Yahoo outright last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 3.1 percent to $23.83 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;Episcopal Delegates Pledge Not to Return to Disney if Workers Call for a Boycott
in their Fight for Affordable Health Insurance


ANAHEIM, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Hundreds of delegates of the National Episcopalian Convention taking place in
Anaheim this week took to the streets with hundreds of Disney workers and their
supporters to protest Disney`s proposal that would make health insurance
unaffordable for Disney hotel employees. The National Episcopal Convention is
being held in Anaheim this year and hundreds of delegates are staying at the
three Disney owned hotels. More than a thousand delegates to the convention have
pledged to not return to the Disney hotels, and to ask members of their
congregations across the country to do the same, if workers call for a boycott
or strike. 

2,300 Disney hotel workers employed as restaurant servers, dishwashers,
housekeepers, front desk agents, and bellmen at the three Disneyland Hotels,
Paradise Pier Hotel, Disneyland Hotel, and Grand California Hotel, have been
working without a union contract since February 2008. The crux of the fight is
over Disney`s proposals to increase costs and raise eligibility requirements for
health care, and to establish part time classifications. Disney`s proposal would
make it so that in a few years hotel workers would have to pay up to $500 a
month for health coverage. The Company`s proposals would produce substantial
hardship for Disney hotel workers, many of whom would no longer be able to
afford the cost of Disney`s health insurance and may be forced to use publicly
funded health care options like Healthy Families for their children`s
healthcare. 

Juan Ruiz, a restaurant server who makes the state minimum wage plus tips at
Disney`s Grand California Hotel is one of the workers who might be forced to use
public health care if Disney`s health care proposal were accepted. "I have two
daughters, ages 8 and 5 years, and I am the sole provider for my family. If
Disney shifts the cost of health insurance to their workers, I will be forced to
choose between paying my mortgage or paying for my family`s health insurance. In
order for my children to have health insurance I may be forced to rely on the
Healthy Families program," said Ruiz. 

"We are asking our delegates to pledge not to return to the three Disney hotels
and to ask members of their congregations around the country to honor a boycott
if the workers ask us to do so. We will continue to pray for justice for the
Disney hotel workers and for the larger Anaheim community," said The Rev. Canon
Dr. Henry L. Atkins Jr. of the Episcopal Network for Economic Justice. 

Hundreds of delegates from the Episcopal convention will be staying at the three
Disney hotels during this convention but have pledged not to return if asked by
the workers. As of yet a boycott has not been called, but workers are preparing
for the possibility in their ongoing fight for affordable health insurance. 

Last month the City of Anaheim granted a $40 million dollar subsidy to the
Garden Walk project, a hotel project that Disney is reportedly in negotiations
to manage. "Taxpayers will pay tens of millions of dollars in public subsidies
for two hotel projects that Disney is reportedly in negotiations to manage, and
now Disney is trying to force us to pay for the cost of health insurance for
their workers` families, who might be forced to use publicly funded health
insurance," said Anaheim Councilwoman Lorri Galloway.

(MSFT.O) market share of the U.S. Internet search market
increased modestly in June, the first month that it fielded its
new Bing search engine, according to the latest data from
research firm ComScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft captured 8.4 percent of U.S. Internet searches in

Bing as a very solid product, but one facing a very large
uphill battle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has been pouring investment into its money-losing
online services business in an attempt to counter Google's
dominance in the Internet search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is still a possibility that Microsoft will strike a

Server, or removing mainframe syntax from programs, the Micro Focus solution
typically leaves the source code unchanged, thereby reducing costs, risk, and
delivering the highest levels of performance and reliability. 

This integration with the Microsoft Application Platform enables customers to
extract the maximum value from their enterprise applications, removing the
requirement for customers to re-write or replace valuable COBOL applications, at
a time when companies look to increase business efficiency and reduce costs. 

"Our number one priority is to help customers realize the most value from their
existing IT assets and move into tomorrow with complete confidence," said Eddie
Amos, general manager, Developer Tools and Platform Business, Microsoft Corp.

&lt;p&gt;Data Suggest Pfizer`s Humanized Anti-Amyloid Monoclonal Antibody was
Well-Tolerated in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer`s Disease

Safety Results from Dimebon in Combination with Donepezil Showed that
Combination was Well-Tolerated
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today results from two Phase 1 safety studies, one of
PF-04360365, a humanized anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (mAb), and another of
dimebon (latrepirdine*) in combination with donepezil HCl tablets, in patients
with Alzheimer`s disease.1,2 Based on the Phase 1 study results, PF-04360365 has
advanced into Phase 2.3 Dimebon (latrepirdine), being co-developed by Pfizer and
Medivation Inc., is in Phase 3 development.4 These data were presented this week
at the Alzheimer`s Association 2009 International Conference on Alzheimer`s
Disease (ICAD) in Vienna, Austria. 

A Phase 1, single-dose, dose escalation study (0.1 to 10 mg/kg) showed that the
investigational compound PF-04360365 was well-tolerated in all patients, with no
clinical or imaging evidence of vasogenic edema, and no new microhemorrhage or
encephalitis reported to date in the ongoing follow-up period.1 In the Phase 1
dimebon (latrepirdine) study, results from a four-week, placebo-controlled trial
of 24 patients on a stable dose of donepezil for at least 60 days showed that
dimebon (latrepirdine) was well-tolerated when used in combination with
donepezil.2 Alzheimer`s disease, a progressive and degenerative brain disease,
is the most common type of dementia.5 Worldwide societal costs associated with
dementia were estimated to be $315.4 billion in 2005.6

"Alzheimer`s disease is a destructive illness and Pfizer is committed to lifting
the burden of the disease on patients and those who care for them," said Steven
J. Romano, MD, vice president, Medical Affairs Head for Pfizer`s Primary Care
Business Unit. "We are continuing to work with the global Alzheimer`s community
to advance research in Alzheimer`s disease and currently have an investigational
compound, dimebon (latrepirdine), in Phase 3 and two other compounds in Phase
2." 

Pfizer`s mAb PF-04360365 Well-Tolerated in Phase 1

Pfizer`s PF-04360365 is a highly selective and potent monoclonal antibody that
targets the C-terminal end of the beta amyloid 1-40 peptide. It does not bind to
the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), from which beta amyloid is derived, and
which the body needs to function normally. This may contribute to a favorable
risk/benefit profile, which will be further examined in long-term pivotal
trials. This mAb has been designed to remove the toxic beta amyloid from the
brain and potentially slow or halt Alzheimer`s disease progression. 

In the Phase 1 double-blind, placebo controlled trial, patients with
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer`s disease (n=37) were randomized to one of five study
groups to receive PF-04360365 as a single two-hour intravenous infusion ranging
from 0.1-10 mg/kg (n=26) or placebo (n=11).1 These patients were monitored for
one-year, and to date, four of the five study groups have completed the one year
observation period. Results showed PF-04360365 was well-tolerated over this dose
range. Routine safety lab values were unremarkable and there were no safety
signals from brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs), electrocardiograms (ECGs),
cognitive scales or physical/neurological examinations.1 While the one-year
observation period is still ongoing, the most common adverse events observed to
date were upper respiratory tract infection (n=10), headache (n=9), back pain
(n=6) and diarrhea (n=5), and all were mild to moderate in severity.1

"We are encouraged by these preliminary safety results and look forward to
studying the safety, as well as the efficacy, of PF-04360365 in Phase 2 multiple
dose trials," said Martin M. Bednar, MD, PhD, senior director and Pfizer
clinical lead for the PF-04360365 program. "As we explore multiple compounds and
mechanisms to treat Alzheimer`s disease, safety is of paramount importance given
the vulnerability of the elderly population afflicted." 

Dimebon (latrepirdine)Shown to be Well-Tolerated in a Four-Week Combination
Study

In another study presented earlier in the week, Medivation and Pfizer announced
that the investigational drug dimebon (latrepirdine) was well-tolerated when
used in combination with donepezil HCl tablets. In this Phase 1, four-week,
placebo-controlled safety study, 24 patients with Alzheimer`s disease on a
stable dose of donepezil for at least 60 days were randomized to receive dimebon
(latrepirdine) or placebo for two to four weeks.2

The first group of patients enrolled (dimebon, n=9, placebo, n=5) underwent
gradual dose-titration in one-week intervals ranging from 2.5 mg three times
daily (TID) up to 20 mg TID, over one month. The second group of patients
(dimebon, n=6, placebo, n=4) titrated from 10 mg TID for one week to 20 mg TID
for one week. No serious adverse events were reported in the study.2 The most
commonly reported adverse events compared to placebo were fatigue (dimebon,
n=3/15, placebo, n=0), abdominal distension (dimebon, n=2/15, placebo, n=0),
fall (dimebon, n=2/15, placebo, n=0), hyperkalemia (dimebon, n=2/15, placebo,
n=1/9) and nightmare (dimebon, n=2/15, placebo, n=0). These events were mild to
moderate in severity and resolved with continued treatment.2

In addition to PF-04360365 and dimebon (latrepirdine), Pfizer is investigating
several other compounds targeting different pathways for the treatment of
Alzheimer`s disease. 

About Dimebon (latrepirdine)

Dimebon (latrepirdine) is an investigational compound for the treatment of
Alzheimer's disease. Three Phase 3 trials are underway and two additional Phase
3 trials are scheduled to start later this year. CONCERT is a 12-month clinical
trial examining the safety and efficacy of dimebon (latrepirdine) when added to
donepezil in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer`s disease, which recently
began enrollment. CONCERT is designed to complement previous and ongoing studies
evaluating the potential for dimebon (latrepirdine) to be used as monotherapy,
as well as in combination with donepezil. 

Based on preclinical studies completed thus far, dimebon (latrepirdine) is
thought to potentially stabilize or improve mitochondrial function in a way that
prevents neurons from damage and dysfunction. The mechanism of action of dimebon
(latrepirdine) is thought to be distinct from currently available Alzheimer`s
medications. 

* Latrepirdine is the proposed generic (nonproprietary) name for dimebon. 

About Pfizer`s Commitment to Alzheimer`s Disease

Alzheimer`s disease touches everyone. As the world population over age 65 grows
rapidly, more people are at risk for this degenerative brain disease. Pfizer
researchers are working diligently to find a way to help those affected by the
disease. Building on a foundation of more than two decades of research,
education and support for the global Alzheimer`s community, the company is
investing heavily to advance understanding of the disease. Pfizer forms
partnerships to develop novel therapies, supports policy initiatives that help
ensure availability and access to treatments, and works collaboratively with
academia and government on biomarker and diagnostic research initiatives to
enable earlier Alzheimer`s diagnosis. 

Pfizer is studying different compounds targeting various central nervous system
pathways that may be able to better treat Alzheimer`s disease symptoms and/or
modify its underlying causes. Four novel compounds in clinical trials include:
dimebon (latrepirdine), an investigational compound believed to impact
mitochondrial function currently in Phase 3 trials; an antagonist of the
Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) in Phase 2 trials in
partnership with the Alzheimer`s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) group; a
highly selective humanized anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in Phase 2 trials;
and a phosphodiesterase-9A (PDE9A) inhibitor, moving into Phase 2 trials. Pfizer
is co-developing dimebon (latrepirdine) with Medivation, and the RAGE
development program is a Pfizer-TransTech collaboration. 

The Pfizer team is working with the global Alzheimer`s community to make a
better future in Alzheimer`s disease a reality.

&lt;p&gt;Data Suggest Pfizer`s Humanized Anti-Amyloid Monoclonal Antibody was
Well-Tolerated in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer`s Disease

Safety Results from Dimebon in Combination with Donepezil Showed that
Combination was Well-Tolerated
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today results from two Phase 1 safety studies, one of
PF-04360365, a humanized anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (mAb), and another of
dimebon (latrepirdine*) in combination with donepezil HCl tablets, in patients
with Alzheimer`s disease.1,2 Based on the Phase 1 study results, PF-04360365 has
advanced into Phase 2.3 Dimebon (latrepirdine), being co-developed by Pfizer and
Medivation Inc., is in Phase 3 development.4 These data were presented this week
at the Alzheimer`s Association 2009 International Conference on Alzheimer`s
Disease (ICAD) in Vienna, Austria. 

A Phase 1, single-dose, dose escalation study (0.1 to 10 mg/kg) showed that the
investigational compound PF-04360365 was well-tolerated in all patients, with no
clinical or imaging evidence of vasogenic edema, and no new microhemorrhage or
encephalitis reported to date in the ongoing follow-up period.1 In the Phase 1
dimebon (latrepirdine) study, results from a four-week, placebo-controlled trial
of 24 patients on a stable dose of donepezil for at least 60 days showed that
dimebon (latrepirdine) was well-tolerated when used in combination with
donepezil.2 Alzheimer`s disease, a progressive and degenerative brain disease,
is the most common type of dementia.5 Worldwide societal costs associated with
dementia were estimated to be $315.4 billion in 2005.6

"Alzheimer`s disease is a destructive illness and Pfizer is committed to lifting
the burden of the disease on patients and those who care for them," said Steven
J. Romano, MD, vice president, Medical Affairs Head for Pfizer`s Primary Care
Business Unit. "We are continuing to work with the global Alzheimer`s community
to advance research in Alzheimer`s disease and currently have an investigational
compound, dimebon (latrepirdine), in Phase 3 and two other compounds in Phase
2." 

Pfizer`s mAb PF-04360365 Well-Tolerated in Phase 1

Pfizer`s PF-04360365 is a highly selective and potent monoclonal antibody that
targets the C-terminal end of the beta amyloid 1-40 peptide. It does not bind to
the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), from which beta amyloid is derived, and
which the body needs to function normally. This may contribute to a favorable
risk/benefit profile, which will be further examined in long-term pivotal
trials. This mAb has been designed to remove the toxic beta amyloid from the
brain and potentially slow or halt Alzheimer`s disease progression. 

In the Phase 1 double-blind, placebo controlled trial, patients with
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer`s disease (n=37) were randomized to one of five study
groups to receive PF-04360365 as a single two-hour intravenous infusion ranging
from 0.1-10 mg/kg (n=26) or placebo (n=11).1 These patients were monitored for
one-year, and to date, four of the five study groups have completed the one year
observation period. Results showed PF-04360365 was well-tolerated over this dose
range. Routine safety lab values were unremarkable and there were no safety
signals from brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs), electrocardiograms (ECGs),
cognitive scales or physical/neurological examinations.1 While the one-year
observation period is still ongoing, the most common adverse events observed to
date were upper respiratory tract infection (n=10), headache (n=9), back pain
(n=6) and diarrhea (n=5), and all were mild to moderate in severity.1

"We are encouraged by these preliminary safety results and look forward to
studying the safety, as well as the efficacy, of PF-04360365 in Phase 2 multiple
dose trials," said Martin M. Bednar, MD, PhD, senior director and Pfizer
clinical lead for the PF-04360365 program. "As we explore multiple compounds and
mechanisms to treat Alzheimer`s disease, safety is of paramount importance given
the vulnerability of the elderly population afflicted." 

Dimebon (latrepirdine)Shown to be Well-Tolerated in a Four-Week Combination
Study

In another study presented earlier in the week, Medivation and Pfizer announced
that the investigational drug dimebon (latrepirdine) was well-tolerated when
used in combination with donepezil HCl tablets. In this Phase 1, four-week,
placebo-controlled safety study, 24 patients with Alzheimer`s disease on a
stable dose of donepezil for at least 60 days were randomized to receive dimebon
(latrepirdine) or placebo for two to four weeks.2

The first group of patients enrolled (dimebon, n=9, placebo, n=5) underwent
gradual dose-titration in one-week intervals ranging from 2.5 mg three times
daily (TID) up to 20 mg TID, over one month. The second group of patients
(dimebon, n=6, placebo, n=4) titrated from 10 mg TID for one week to 20 mg TID
for one week. No serious adverse events were reported in the study.2 The most
commonly reported adverse events compared to placebo were fatigue (dimebon,
n=3/15, placebo, n=0), abdominal distension (dimebon, n=2/15, placebo, n=0),
fall (dimebon, n=2/15, placebo, n=0), hyperkalemia (dimebon, n=2/15, placebo,
n=1/9) and nightmare (dimebon, n=2/15, placebo, n=0). These events were mild to
moderate in severity and resolved with continued treatment.2

In addition to PF-04360365 and dimebon (latrepirdine), Pfizer is investigating
several other compounds targeting different pathways for the treatment of
Alzheimer`s disease. 

About Dimebon (latrepirdine)

Dimebon (latrepirdine) is an investigational compound for the treatment of
Alzheimer's disease. Three Phase 3 trials are underway and two additional Phase
3 trials are scheduled to start later this year. CONCERT is a 12-month clinical
trial examining the safety and efficacy of dimebon (latrepirdine) when added to
donepezil in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer`s disease, which recently
began enrollment. CONCERT is designed to complement previous and ongoing studies
evaluating the potential for dimebon (latrepirdine) to be used as monotherapy,
as well as in combination with donepezil. 

Based on preclinical studies completed thus far, dimebon (latrepirdine) is
thought to potentially stabilize or improve mitochondrial function in a way that
prevents neurons from damage and dysfunction. The mechanism of action of dimebon
(latrepirdine) is thought to be distinct from currently available Alzheimer`s
medications. 

* Latrepirdine is the proposed generic (nonproprietary) name for dimebon. 

About Pfizer`s Commitment to Alzheimer`s Disease

Alzheimer`s disease touches everyone. As the world population over age 65 grows
rapidly, more people are at risk for this degenerative brain disease. Pfizer
researchers are working diligently to find a way to help those affected by the
disease. Building on a foundation of more than two decades of research,
education and support for the global Alzheimer`s community, the company is
investing heavily to advance understanding of the disease. Pfizer forms
partnerships to develop novel therapies, supports policy initiatives that help
ensure availability and access to treatments, and works collaboratively with
academia and government on biomarker and diagnostic research initiatives to
enable earlier Alzheimer`s diagnosis. 

Pfizer is studying different compounds targeting various central nervous system
pathways that may be able to better treat Alzheimer`s disease symptoms and/or
modify its underlying causes. Four novel compounds in clinical trials include:
dimebon (latrepirdine), an investigational compound believed to impact
mitochondrial function currently in Phase 3 trials; an antagonist of the
Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) in Phase 2 trials in
partnership with the Alzheimer`s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) group; a
highly selective humanized anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in Phase 2 trials;
and a phosphodiesterase-9A (PDE9A) inhibitor, moving into Phase 2 trials. Pfizer
is co-developing dimebon (latrepirdine) with Medivation, and the RAGE
development program is a Pfizer-TransTech collaboration. 

The Pfizer team is working with the global Alzheimer`s community to make a
better future in Alzheimer`s disease a reality.

&lt;p&gt;  SUNNYVALE, CA, Jul 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ShoreTel(R) (NASDAQ: SHOR), the leading provider of brilliantly simple IP
phone systems with fully integrated Unified Communications, today
announced an agreement with IBM (NYSE: IBM) to deliver a unique unified
communications (UC) and collaboration offering that combines a small
business appliance, presence awareness, instant messaging and VoIP
telephony in an "out-of-the-box" integrated solution for small and
midsize businesses (SMB).

    The ShoreTel offering leverages the newly announced Lotus Foundations
Reach, which customizes and extends the IBM Sametime UC and collaboration
capabilities, in an appliance designed for SMBs that does not require an
enterprise administrator. The result is designed to be a tightly
integrated solution that delivers on ShoreTel's commitment to brilliantly
simple solutions and lets SMB customers quickly realize the productivity
gains and simplicity associated with UC solutions. The combined solution
will bring enterprise-class reliability, rapid scalability and lower IT
costs to the SMB market that frees them from vendor lock-in and upgrade
requirements.

    ShoreTel's easy-to-use IP telephony will connect to Lotus Foundations
Reach to provide an all-in-one integrated communications and collaboration
solution. ShoreTel takes advantage of the self-managing capabilities of
the Lotus Foundations appliance to further simplify deployment and reduce
costs for smaller businesses that often have limited IT resources and
skills. The combined simplicity and autonomic management capabilities of
ShoreTel and IBM help eliminate the complexities of UC typically
associated with other systems, and result in a simple, affordable and
comprehensive communications solution.

    "IBM and ShoreTel are putting the cost savings and productivity gains of
unified communications and collaboration within reach of even the smallest
businesses," said Phil Salm, IBM software solutions specialist for
technology solutions reseller, CDW. "With Lotus Foundations Reach and
ShoreTel telephony, small businesses can afford this comprehensive
communications solution without sacrificing in terms of quality and
features. Additionally, the simplicity of installation and ongoing
operation will result in a quick ROI for customers."

    Under the agreement, ShoreTel plans to integrate the IBM Lotus Foundations
platform with the intuitive ShoreTel Director Management platform in a
single "office in a box" appliance. ShoreTel's use of open standards
leverages IBM's standard-based software to easily extend its telephony
solutions to help increase employee productivity, speed business processes
and reduce overall costs. This open approach also allows smaller
businesses to expand without worrying about upgrade costs or requirements
to purchase additional technology.

    ShoreTel is adding its popular UC features, such as telephony presence,
click to call, unified messaging and a single management console for voice
applications, to the UC and collaboration capabilities of Lotus
Foundations Reach. The result is an out-of-the-box solution that houses
all of a user's communications tools, including e-mail, calendars,
contacts, office productivity tools, network security, remote access,
file and print sharing, and instant messaging, in one place to improve
the overall user experience.

    "The combined IBM and ShoreTel solution provides us with a comprehensive
unified communications and collaboration offering designed specifically
for our small and midsized businesses," said Michael Reed, president,
NextiraOne Mexico. "With capabilities such as e-mail, instant messaging
and telephony, our SMB customers will have access to the communications
tools needed to effectively run their businesses all rolled into one
affordable and easy to manage offering."

    "Just this year, over 1,000 Microsoft partners have turned to IBM Lotus
Foundations as a simple, fast to deploy and inexpensive alternative to
Microsoft Small Business Server and Essential Business Server," said Caleb
Barlow, director, Lotus Foundations, IBM. "The combined solution from IBM
and ShoreTel provides SMBs with a complete set of communications and
collaboration tools that are easy to use and affordable."

    The agreement represents a significant opportunity for both companies to
gain additional market share in the expanding UC sector, which continues
to attract major vendors from other IT fields because of its rapidly
growing popularity.

    "Working with IBM, we're taking the next step in bringing unified
communications to organizations of all sizes, with a solution that
combines ShoreTel's IP telephony expertise and experience with IBM's
collaborative technology," said John W. Combs, president and CEO at
ShoreTel. "Together, we plan to offer SMBs easy-to-manage, efficient and
cost-effective tools with the advanced collaboration and communications
capabilities that until now have only been accessible to large
enterprises."

&lt;p&gt;         * EU executive proposal for Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia           * Visa-free travel would start Jan. 1          * Similar proposal hoped for Albania, Bosnia next year                            (adds quotes, details)          By David Brunnstrom          BRUSSELS, July 15 (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Wednesday letting citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, which have been promised eventual EU membership, travel to the European Union without visas from Jan. 1.          The EU executive said it hoped to make a similar proposal for Albania and Bosnia by the middle of next year if they meet the 27-nation bloc's standards.          It said Macedonia had already met EU conditions and the concession for Serbia and Montenegro was dependent on their doing so by the time EU states approved the proposal.          Offering visa-free travel to the states of the Western Balkans, all of which have been promised EU entry, is a cornerstone of EU policy aimed at stabilising the region.          EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called it an important day for the Western Balkans.          It will mean a further Europeanisation of the civil societies in the Western Balkans, he told a news briefing.          The Commission said Albania and Bosnia needed to improve their efforts to fight organised crime and corruption and in procedures for delivering passports and border control.          Residents of Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia last year, are not included in the plan, which will require citizens to have biometric passports and cover the EU's border-free Schengen area.          Schengen includes all EU states apart from Britain and Ireland, as well as Switzerland, Norway and Iceland.          Citizens of former Yugoslavia were able to travel visa-free to Western Europe until Yugoslavia's break-up in the 1990s. Of the former Yugoslav states, only Slovenia is an EU member, but neighbouring Croatia already has visa-free status.                    CRITICISM          The plan to offer visa-free status to Serbia before Bosnia has met criticism. Greens in the European Parliament said it would deepen ethnic divisions by excluding Bosnian Muslims but not Bosnian Serbs who have access to Serbian passports.          Bosnian Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj said at the weekend the visa plan would create a ghetto for Bosnian Muslims.          Rehn said it was up to Bosnia to pursue reforms and accused Bosnian politicians of wasting time with nationalist bickering.          We can't punish the other citizens of the Western Balkans because of slow motion in some other countries, he said.          A package of reforms needed for visa liberalisation was blocked for months by Bosnian Serbs in the Bosnian parliament before being adopted under Western and public pressure in June.

&lt;p&gt;The DataCore and Microsoft Partnership Enables Virtualization Resellers to Be
More Competitive and Drive More Business; Fast-Track Initiatives Help Partners
Overcome Storage-Related Barriers to Virtualization
NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
At the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference (WPC) 2009, DataCore Software, the
leading provider of storage virtualization, business continuity and disaster
recovery software solutions, today announced that it has developed a fast-track
for Microsoft partners to sign on and grow their business. DataCore is using the
Microsoft WPC09 event to extend a direct invitation to Microsoft partners to
experience the "DataCore Difference." The storage virtualization leader has even
developed a self-serve portal - whereby Microsoft partners can directly access: 

1. The DataCore "How to" video presentation: `Knock Down Storage-Related Sales
Barriers to Virtualization`

2. Special promotions to cost-effectively deliver shared storage SAN solutions
into Microsoft Exchange, SQL, Cluster and Server &amp; Desktop Virtualization
environments. 

3. Software promotions for educational institutions - up to 50% discounts. 

4. A "Revitalize, Refresh and Repurpose" program enabling Microsoft solution
providers to target installed accounts and existing storage. With DataCore,
partners can avoid "rip and replace" and new storage hardware buys since they
can take full advantage of the equipment already in place. 

5. Sales tools and materials to grow your Microsoft and DataCore business. 

According to Barry Martin, partner and chief technical architect, The Mirazon
Group, a DataCore-accredited partner and Microsoft Gold partner, "Nobody has the
complete feature set that DataCore has in a software-based storage
virtualization solution. In terms of the quality of DataCore`s virtualization
solutions, our experience has been - install it and it works. That is how a SAN
has to function. It has to be rock-solid. More than that, it is very enjoyable
to work together with DataCore as a partner company and we appreciate that they
are 100% channel-driven." 

DataCore: A Strategic Complement to Your Microsoft Practice

Martin adds, "Mirazon fundamentally sees software-based storage virtualization
as strategic because of the value it provides and because of the flexibility of
the solutions that virtualization enables our firm to create." 

IDC Viewpoint: Software-based Storage Virtualization

To learn more about software-based storage virtualization and overcoming the
barriers to virtualization please see the recent IDC Viewpoint Report titled:
Removing Storage-Related Barriers to Server and Desktop Virtualization. 

This IDC Viewpoint discusses an alternative to costly investments in high-end
storage systems. It covers the key considerations of a software-based storage
virtualization solution and proposes using storage virtualization software to
create scalable, robust SANs using equipment already in place. 

Win virtualization deals without compromising on quality or margins

DataCore storage virtualization solutions offer advanced features and hardware
independence that give Microsoft resellers a competitive advantage by helping
their customers avoid risk, boost productivity, contain costs and protect
financial investments. See:
http://www.datacore.com/solutions/sanwide_features_home.asp. 

DataCore offers your customers the features they want: 

&#8226; Hardware independence 

&#8226; High availability for split or "stretch" clustering 

&#8226; SAN-wide performance acceleration 

&#8226; Synchronous or asynchronous mirroring 

&#8226; Fibre channel and ISCSI support 

&#8226; Business Continuity &amp; Remote Site Recovery Solutions 

&#8226; SAN-wide management versus device by device admin 

With DataCore, partners can capitalize on the economic crunch by meeting
availability and recovery goals at a fraction of their competitors` hardware
costs. Avoid "rip-and-replace" barriers by repurposing their existing equipment.
And best of all, as a DataCore partner you can adapt to last minute budget
changes without compromising on quality of the solution or margin points.

As the original pioneer in the PPS fiber market, Chevron Phillips Chemical`s
predecessor in the business, Phillips Petroleum Company, spun its first fiber in
1973. After nearly 30 years of innovations in the fibers market, Chevron
Phillips Chemical is poised to recapture its share of the fibers market with
three new PPS resins, specifically formulated for fibers. In a break from its
competitors, Chevron Phillips Chemical only functions as a resin supplier; the
company is not involved in fiber spinning or filter bag production. 

Chevron Phillips Chemical also offers exceptional technical support, complete
with a fully operational plastics technical center and pilot polymerization
plant for product and process development. In addition, the company produces and
tests its resins on its in-house, lab-size multifilament line. 

Ryton&#174; PPS has excellent chemical and hydrolysis resistance in fiber
applications. As an inherently flame retardant material, Ryton&#174; PPS is well
suited as a filter media for harsh environments such as hot liquids and gases,
fuel, and oil filtration applications. With a strong history of success in the
fiber market, Chevron Phillips Chemical is ready and able to assist with the
most challenging endeavors.

Phillips Chemical Company LP`s (Chevron Phillips Chemical) line of high
performance engineering resins and alloys has a long-standing reputation for

&lt;p&gt; * Forecast-beating results boost financial, tech shares&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Energy, mining equities surge on firm commodity prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * For up-to-the-minute market news, click on [STXNEWS/EU]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Atul Prakash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - European equities advanced for a
third straight session to hit a two-week high on Wednesday as
reassuring results from Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Intel (INTC.O)
boosted banking and tech shares, while oils tracked crude
higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 1128 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European shares was up 1.6 percent at 853.82 points after rising
as high as 856.20, the highest level since July 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark index, which slumped 45 percent in 2008 due to
the credit crisis, rose 1.2 percent in the previous session and
has gained 32 percent since hitting a record low on early March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial stocks were among the top gainers, with HSBC
(HSBA.L), Barclays (BARC.L), Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L),
Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and
KBC Groep (KBC.BR) jumping 3.3-7.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is prepared to shake off weak economic data and
preferring to focus on consensus breaking results and upbeat
outlook form corporates," said Henk Potts, equity strategist at
Barclays Stockbrokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are some longer term factors to take into account,
but certainly in the short term the direction of the markets
will be determined by the percentage of companies that either
meet or exceed analysts' expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sentiment improved after Goldman Sachs pleased investors on
Tuesday with better-than-expected results.Intel Corp's (INTC.O)
quarterly results and outlook also trumped analyst forecasts on
better-than-expected consumer demand for PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, some analysts advised caution. Marie-Pierre
Peillon, head of equity and credit research at Groupama Asset
Management, said that Goldman's strong results are not
necessarily a preview of what to expect from all the banks, said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're in the process of making the distinction between the
winners and the losers. Goldman is one of the winners, but other
banks are still struggling," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Economic data also highlighted difficult conditions. British
unemployment hit its highest rate since January 1997 in the
three months to May, although the number of people claiming
jobless benefit rose by much less than expected last month.
[ID:nLF150992]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TECH, COMMODITIES JUMP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology stocks also gained ground, with the DJ STOXX
European technology index .SX8P rising 3.6 percent. Nokia
(NOK1V.HE) climbed 5 percent, Infineon (IFXGn.DE) advanced 7.3
percent and STMicroelectronics (STM.PA) put on 6.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alcatel-Lucent (ALUA.PA) surged 9.6 percent, while Dutch
chip equipment maker ASML (ASML.AS) was up 3.4 percent after it 
reported an upsurge in orders for its technology. [ID:nLF497717]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commodity shares were also in demand as crude oil prices
CLc1 jumped 1.8 percent to trade above $60 a barrel, while
copper MCU3, aluminium MAL3, nickel MNI3 and zinc MXN3
rose 2.8-3.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among energy equities, BP (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell
(RDSb.L), BG Group (BG.L), Tullow Oil (TLW.L), Repsol (REP.MC),
Total (TOTF.PA) and StatoilHydro (STL.OL) added 1.2-5.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While among miners, BHP Billiton (BLT.L), Anglo American

&lt;p&gt; * EU executive proposal for Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia  * Visa-free travel plan would start from Jan. 1 * Similar proposal hoped for Albania, Bosnia next year By David Brunnstrom BRUSSELS, July 15 (Reuters) - The EU executive proposed on Wednesday allowing citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, which have been promised eventual EU membership, to travel to the European Union without visas from the start of next year. The European Commission said it hoped to make a similar proposal for Albania and Bosnia by the middle of next year if they meet EU standards. The Commission said Macedonia had already met EU conditions and the concession for Serbia and Montenegro was dependent on their doing so by the time EU states approved the proposal. It said offering visa-free travel to the states of the Western Balkans, all of which have been promised eventual EU entry, was a cornerstone of EU policy aimed at bringing stability to the region. Our proposal brings truly good news to the people of the Western Balkans ... I know how much visa-free travel means to them, Justice Commissioner Jacques Barrot said in a statement.  EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said it was the Commission's aim that Albania and Bosnia follow suit soon.  If all the conditions are fulfilled, the Commission could envisage making a new proposal, which would include them, by mid-2010, he said. The Commission said both countries needed to improve their efforts in fighting organised crime and corruption and in procedures for delivering passports and border control. Residents of Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia last year, are not included in the plan, which will require citizens to have biometric passports and cover the border-free Schengen area of the 27-country European Union. Schengen includes all EU states apart from Britain and Ireland, as well as Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. Citizens of the former Yugoslavia used to be able to travel visa-free to Western Europe until Yugoslavia's break-up in the 1990s. Of the ex-Yugoslav states, only Slovenia is an EU member, but neighbouring Croatia already has visa-free status. The plan to offer visa-free status to Serbia before Bosnia has faced criticism. The Green group in the European Parliament warned on Tuesday that the move would deepen ethnic divisions. Bosnian Serb forces led by General Ratko Mladic massacred more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in July 1995. Mladic remains at large, something that has stalled Serbia's EU entry bid.  (Editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)

&lt;p&gt;IBM Informix, ShoreTel Earn Top Scores; Verizon Posts Lowest Overall Mark
LOS GATOS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
VendorRate, the only Web-based business information service that offers quick,
confidential performance ratings and comparisons of technology vendors,
announced today that customer satisfaction scores for Microsoft plunged
dramatically in the second quarter of 2009 while IBM Informix and telecom
equipment maker ShoreTel earned the top scores in the quarter. 

IT pros rating vendors on VendorRate in April, May and June downgraded Microsoft
across the board with poor customer satisfaction scores for the company`s server
and infrastructure software (55 out of 100, down nearly 17 percent), operating
systems (67, down 9.5 percent) and applications (64, off nearly 18 percent).
Verizon Communications received the lowest overall vendor score of 61. 

"Microsoft was cruising along with satisfactory scores in earlier reports but it
simply fell off a cliff in this quarter," said Rick Schaefer, CEO of VendorRate.
"Meanwhile, IBM Informix was among the top rated vendors for the fourth straight
quarter, and this is the first time that ShoreTel made it into the top
rankings." 

IBM Informix scored 96, while ShoreTel`s score was 92. Among other notable
results in the quarter, GovConnection was the top rated reseller with a score of
98, the highest ever posted for a VendorRate quarterly report. 

VendorRate users rate vendors confidentially on ten specific performance
criteria that include customer service, reliability, integrity, budget and
effectiveness. The results produce a cumulative score up to 100. 

The report summarizes customer satisfaction ratings entered by technology
professionals at the VendorRate website, trade shows, professional conferences,
and virtual events. VendorRate also collects rating information by cooperating
with user groups, trade associations, event management, and IT and telecom
departments from organizations of all sizes. VendorRate is vendor neutral and
accepts neither vendor sponsorship nor advertising. 

The report is now available free on the VendorRate site here.

on Wednesday, giving up earlier gains made on upbeat results from
Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Intel (INTC.O) after investors grew
cautious ahead of more earnings in the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bank of Japan extended its corporate funding support
measures beyond their planned expiry in September, and it kept
interest rates on hold. The impact was limited as the moves were
within expectations. [ID:nT132248]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts also said big blocks of both buy and sell
orders in futures were creating volatility in a thin cash market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market earlier eked out gains after upbeat results from
Goldman Sachs and Intel lifted hopes of a recovery for the global
economy and helped weaken the yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are hopes for corporate earnings, but it's still hard
to imagine many companies will come out and revise up their
earnings prospects," said Junichi Misawa, senior fund manager at
STB Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With somewhat overly optimistic views on the economic
recovery receding, the market now wants to take a look at
corporate earnings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark Nikkei .N225 edged up 7.44 points to
9,269.25, after rising as much as 0.8 percent at one stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It fell to an eight-week low of 9,050.33 on Monday after
climbing to a six-month high of 10,170.82 in mid-June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broader Topix .TOPX fell 0.3 percent to 866.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The BOJ's decision to maintain policy and to extend
corporate finance support steps are all within expectations, and
I see little direct impact on the stock market," said Tsuyoshi
Segawa, equity strategist at Mizuho Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Having said that, however, the fact that economic conditions
warrant an extension of the central bank's extraordinary support
measures for companies cannot be a plus for the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANKS DOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of banks such as Shinsei Bank (8303.T) and Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group (8306.T) fell on profit-taking a day after
they rose on upbeat analyst comments about the U.S. financial
sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors are still cautious despite a jump in quarterly
earnings at Goldman Sachs as other financial institutions have
yet to unveil their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other closely watched U.S. bank earnings include those of
JPMorgan Chase  CO (JPM.N) on Thursday and Citigroup Inc (C.N)
and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shinsei Bank fell 4.5 percent to 128 yen and MUFG dropped 2.4
percent to 538 yen. Mizuho Financial Group (8411.T) shed 4
percent to 190 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some exporters also ran out of steam, with Toyota Motor Corp
(7203.T) slipping 0.9 percent to 3,470 yen and industrial robot
maker Fanuc Ltd (6954.T) falling 1.6 percent to 7,240 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But chip-related stocks rose after Intel's results, with
Tokyo Electron (8035.T) gaining 0.9 percent to 4,280 yen and
Advantest Corp (6857.T) adding 1.5 percent to 1,741 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs trounced forecasts with a 33 percent surge in
quarterly earnings, while chipmaker Intel reported results after
the bell that surpassed expectations, sending its stock 7.4
percent higher in extended trade. [ID:nN14260734] [ID:nN14289399]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Toko Electric 6921.T soared by their daily limit
after the company and Toshiba (6502.T) said they plan to set up a
joint venture to make electronic gauges to measure electricity,
gas and water use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toko Electric jumped by its daily limit of 80 yen to 380 yen,
up 26.7 percent from Tuesday's close, while Toshiba added 1.5
percent to 338 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Square Enix (9684.T) climbed 2.2 percent to 2,085 yen after
the video game maker said shipments in Japan of its latest sequel
to the blockbuster 'Dragon Quest' game passed 3 million units
four days after its launch on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 2.2 billion shares changed hands on the Tokyo exchange's

&lt;p&gt; (Adds with analyst expectations, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, July 16 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa reported a worse-than-expected 0.7 percent fall in
second-quarter met profit due to higher financing costs and
losses at some of its affiliates, despite strong sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grupo Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) earned 1.83 billion
pesos ($139 million) in April-June compared with 1.84 billion
pesos a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected a net profit
of 1.95 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's quarterly revenue rose 10.2 percent to 12.67
billion pesos as sales of cable and satellite television
surged, helped by the consolidation of Televisa's cable company
Cablemas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the company was hit by higher interest payments on its
debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financing costs rose to 828 million pesos, a 612-million
peso jump from the second quarter of 2008, partly due to
interest rate fluctuations and derivative losses as the global
financial crisis weakened the Mexican peso against the U.S
dollar.

The market's average forecast had been for $23.5 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net profit for the quarter rose to $3.1 billion from $2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Profit per share rose to $2.32 from $1.97, much higher than the average Wall Street forecast of $2.01 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In an unpleasant economic and financial world, these are incredible results," said Mike Holland, chairman of investment firm Holland  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGHER MARGINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts say IBM's strong outlook may not necessarily signal improvement for the overall sector, since the stronger profit was largely a result of higher margins rather than sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has fared better than many other technology companies over the past year as it focuses on software and services in outsourcing, automation and technology support -- areas that have enjoyed relatively strong demand in the global economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also credit IBM's cost-cutting measures.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Google Inc's quarterly profit beat Wall Street expectations but its revenue growth was not as stellar as some investors had hoped, sending shares down 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on Thursday, IBM reported a 13 percent slide in revenue as corporate spending fell, but cost cuts and a shift to more profitable businesses helped it trump earnings expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company raised its profit outlook for the full year, helping send its shares higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAXMI PORURI, ANALYST, PRIMARY GLOBAL RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They did decently, but obviously it's not high enough for the Street. We expected some slowness for a couple of reasons: one is that in the first quarter, we saw some click-through rates go down a bit, and there is definitely a bit of lag time between when that happens and what advertisers do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And the other thing is, there was definitely some weakness in pharma spending earlier in the quarter because some of the pharma companies got punished (by regulators) a bit in their search practices.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Google Inc's quarterly profit beat Wall Street expectations but its revenue growth was not as stellar as some investors had hoped, sending shares down 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on Thursday, IBM reported a 13 percent slide in revenue as corporate spending fell, but cost cuts and a shift to more profitable businesses helped it trump earnings expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company raised its profit outlook for the full year, helping send its shares higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAXMI PORURI, ANALYST, PRIMARY GLOBAL RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They did decently, but obviously it's not high enough for the Street. We expected some slowness for a couple of reasons: one is that in the first quarter, we saw some click-through rates go down a bit, and there is definitely a bit of lag time between when that happens and what advertisers do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And the other thing is, there was definitely some weakness in pharma spending earlier in the quarter because some of the pharma companies got punished (by regulators) a bit in their search practices. They had to cut down on search spending and some of the companies haven't ramped up again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIKE HOLLAND, CHAIRMAN, HOLLAND  CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was outperformance on the bottom line, but the top line was also solid.

But the revenue per click -- an indication of advertisers' appetite for clicks and for advertising -- was up sequentially, so you can assume that in terms of ad budgets out there, we probably reached a bottom some time in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we need now is rebound in consumer spending."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAMEET SINHA, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers are good.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. today acknowledged that it had "absolutely" considered replacing the maligned storage engine in its Exchange e-mail server software with its SQL Server database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But "after much debate," the company decided to stick with the existing Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) in Exchange, and issued a promise of a significant ESE performance boost in Exchange 2010, the next version of the software, Microsoft said in a blog post today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes! Some very smart engineers did amazing work and we had mailboxes up and running using SQL Server," wrote Microsoft. "It was ultimately determined that the best way to ensure we could drive compelling innovation into Exchange for 2010 and beyond was to remain committed to ESE."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it has been considering swapping out ESE, better-known as Jet, on and off for at least seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jet is often blamed by users critical of Exchange's scalability or performance. That has traditionally forced e-mail administrators to restrict user inbox sizes or engage in complicated archiving schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of cloud-based e-mail services, such as Google Inc.'s Gmail, that offer unlimited inbox sizes at low cost and with minimal management requirements has put pressure on the market-leading Exchange to address its technical shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its Tech Ed conference this spring, Microsoft said Exchange 2010, using an upgraded jet database, will be able to read and write e-mails to disk 70% faster than Exchange 2007. It will also be able to store five times as many items per folder than Exchange 2007, and handle ten times more active connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts still predict that Microsoft will still switch to SQL Server in a future Exchange version, perhaps in the subsequent version slated to ship in 2013. Microsoft said it's keeping its options open beyond Exchange 2010, and that the company is only committed "to stay on ESE at this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM surprised markets by sharply raising its full-year earnings forecast as its growing software and services businesses boosted profit margins, lifting its shares in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stock in the world's largest technology services firm rose as much as 3 percent, building on gains of more than 3 percent in the regular session, as the company's outlook and higher-than-expected quarterly earnings gave investors hope that the worst of the technology downturn may be over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, was impressed by the outlook and earnings despite the lower revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This, combined with Intel's results, is pushing me to be more optimistic.

&lt;p&gt;CEO Riggs Eckelberry Says Oil Giant`s Move Points to Algae`s Potential to
Overtake Petroleum
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
OriginOil, Inc. (OOIL), the developer of a breakthrough technology to transform
algae, the most promising source of renewable oil, into a true competitor to
petroleum, commented on the announcement by Exxon Mobil (ExxonMobil) of a
long-term partnership with algae research company, Synthetic Genomics. 

In an article by its Greenwire affiliate, the New York Times quoted CEO Riggs
Eckelberry`s remarks: "A couple years ago, the petroleum institute said there's
only [twenty] years left for oil, and now they're really finally acting on that&#8230;
Algae is the feedstock to overtake petroleum. It's the real alternative to
petroleum." Read the New York Times article. 

Simultaneously, Eckelberry`s commentary was also featured in the July 14 issue
of Biodiesel Magazine, where he stated, "Algae is now being validated as a
legitimate feedstock. It is going to have a long-term outlook with an investment
like this." 

In other remarks, Riggs Eckelberry said: "Our own focus is on building the
industrial platform for producing any type of algae and we welcome large-scale
research into new strains." The $600 million partnership between Exxon Mobil and
Synthetic Genomics plans to genetically engineer new strains of algae. 

Speaking at a renewable energy conference held at the United Nations on June 11,
CEO Eckelberry outlined a plan to overtake petroleum. He warned that without a
new approach, petroleum could remain strong until 2060. Watch this OriginOil
video. 

"In the world`s planning for renewable energy, the tendency has been to follow
old-school energy thinking which focuses on large, centralized facilities,"
Eckelberry continued. "OriginOil believes the solution is networked and
distributed, and based on large-scale information sharing." He continued, "We
know that entrepreneurs worldwide want to start making biofuels now for their
local communities and industries. That`s the model of the future - we call it

OriginOil, Inc. is developing a breakthrough technology that will transform
algae, the most promising source of renewable oil, into a true competitor to
petroleum. Much of the world's oil and gas is made up of ancient algae deposits.
Today, our technology will produce "new oil" from algae, through a
cost-effective, high-speed manufacturing process. This endless supply of new oil
can be used for many products, such as diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, plastics and
solvents, without the global warming effects of petroleum. Other oil-producing
feedstock, such as corn and sugarcane, often destroy vital farmlands and
rainforests, disrupt global food supplies and create new environmental problems.
Our unique technology, based on algae, is targeted at fundamentally changing our
source of oil without disrupting the environment or food supplies. To learn more

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights CDC Corporation (Nasdaq: CHINA) as the Bull of
the Day and Overstock.com (Nasdaq: OSTK) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell
(NYSE:RDS.A) and Valero (NYSE:VLO). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

With a strong track record in consolidation and organic growth of its software
business, we believe CDC Corporation (Nasdaq: CHINA) is poised for growth. The
1Q 2009 revenue was below expectations, due to the global economic recession as
well as a negative impact from currency fluctuations. 

With a continual focus on vertical industries, cost reduction initiatives in its
software segment, new launches and upgrades in its product line as well as
integration efforts, CDC should develop a significant competitive advantage in
2009 and beyond. Also, increase in license bookings and strong pipeline of sales
opportunities at CDC Software should drive growth. 

As such, we maintain our Buy rating on the shares of CDC with a six-month target
price of $2.50. 

Bear of the Day: 

Overstock.com (Nasdaq: OSTK) reported a first quarter net loss of $0.09 per
share, which was narrower-than-expected. The company's sales declined 8%
year-over-year. 

Gross margin improved 280 basis points, which more than offset the 230 basis
point increase in total operating expenses. Overstock.com reduced sales and
marketing and technology expenses, but had a big increase in general and
administrative expenses. 

We think these results support our view that Overstock.com's cost structure is
still too high relative to its gross profit margin. We reiterate our Sell rating
and $5 target price.

Exxon`s $600m Biofuel Deal

ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), the largest publicly traded international oil and gas
company, has joined the race for making biofuel to help meet the world`s energy
challenges. On Tuesday, the company inked a multi-year research and development
agreement with La Jolla, California-based Synthetic Genomics Inc. for
algae-based biofuels. 

ExxonMobil will invest $600 million over the next 5 to 6 years for this project
and hinted the final development could cost billions. It will be the world`s
largest biofuel development project of its kind. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Synthetic Genomics will try to find, optimize
and engineer superior strains of algae as well as to detect and develop the best
systems for large-scale cultivation of algae and conversion of their products
into useful biofuels. ExxonMobil's engineering and scientific expertise will be
utilized throughout the program. 

We believe that this is a prudent step taken by ExxonMobil following the
criticism levied against it that the company should hone its focus on renewable
and cleaner-burning fuels. The company`s move follows those of its rivals such
as Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) and Valero (NYSE:VLO), who have both
progressed into the biofuel arena, either by backing research programs,
investing in small energy businesses or buying them outright.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Google Inc's quarterly profit beat Wall Street expectations but its revenue growth was not as stellar as some investors had hoped, sending shares down 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on Thursday, IBM reported a 13 percent slide in revenue as corporate spending fell, but cost cuts and a shift to more profitable businesses helped it trump earnings expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company raised its profit outlook for the full year, helping send its shares higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAXMI PORURI, ANALYST, PRIMARY GLOBAL RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They did decently, but obviously it's not high enough for the Street. We expected some slowness for a couple of reasons: one is that in the first quarter, we saw some click-through rates go down a bit, and there is definitely a bit of lag time between when that happens and what advertisers do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And the other thing is, there was definitely some weakness in pharma spending earlier in the quarter because some of the pharma companies got punished (by regulators) a bit in their search practices. They had to cut down on search spending and some of the companies haven't ramped up again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIKE HOLLAND, CHAIRMAN, HOLLAND  CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was outperformance on the bottom line, but the top line was also solid. The stock seems to be trading down here. But they were in line with heightened expectations that I had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a challenging world, I am happy to be an owner here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHARD FETYKO, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MERRIMAN CURHAN FORD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The top line is in line with consensus. But on the bottom-lime they seem to have crushed" expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unspoken anticipation (on revenue) was perhaps slightly better than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't seem like things are turning around per se. But the revenue per click -- an indication of advertisers' appetite for clicks and for advertising -- was up sequentially, so you can assume that in terms of ad budgets out there, we probably reached a bottom some time in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we need now is rebound in consumer spending."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAMEET SINHA, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers are good. Revenue was in line with expectations, and strong operating efficiencies were brought about by the new CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It definitely shows that Google is a best-of-breed company for online advertising, and it's a must buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In my opinion, Google is gaining market share. My guess is that Google will gain share over the others. If Google is doing well, then others will not be doing as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whisper number for revenue growth was probably much higher and they came in a little lower."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google's results were mixed. They consensus numbers which came up a bit in the last few days. The EPS was boosted by 30 cents by a lower tax rate and offsetting that was negative interest income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're talking about 23 cents of lift from below the line items. If you take a step back, the top line was a bit light of where the raised expectations were, but in line with the Street. Margins were in line. Performance in the U.S. was in line and international was where the upside came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the focus is on what's going to happen in the back half. The tone of this call will be important, and whether they're talking about stabilization and potentially a pickup in paid search."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRED WEISS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ATLANTIC TRUST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They did very well on the cost side of the ledger. That was quite important. In terms of revenues, they pretty much came in  line, at 23 and a quarter billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Revenues were down as expected, about 13 percent. About half of that is currency. Half of that is non-currency. Business is slow. Customers are buying less because their budgets are tight, but the question is, can you control costs? The company was successful at managing the costs well. This was a pretty good challenge at minus 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it was revenue growth, then you could say it was more broad-based. If revenues were coming in better than expected, then probably everyone's revenues were going to come in somewhat better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was the ability of IBM to manage the business more than generically, 'business is healthy and improving dramatically in technology.' Revenues were down 13 percent, about 7 percent without currency, which is not good. Seven percent down is not good, but it was no worse than expected, so what you have here is margin improvement, which is IBM-specific."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEPHEN MASSOCCA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH MORGAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM was pretty big. The revenues weren't, but the guidance I think was a surprise. Google's numbers were fine, but the stock had moved up so much, it needed to be more than fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you have these dramatic moves (in stocks), you start needing bigger and bigger surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I think this will keep IBM higher, and I think (the stock) will do well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIKE HOLLAND, CHAIRMAN, HOLLAND  CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Big blue blockbuster. I expected good numbers. I was shocked by how good these were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The full-year guidance for $9.70 was incredible. I have never seen anything like that in the years I have been following IBM. In an unpleasant economic and financial world, these are incredible results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is still some vitality in the world. There is some growth left. It is not only in China, there are some other places in the world. As Steve Ballmer said, we have reset to a lower position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From that lower position we are able to make some profit and progress. That is what IBM and Intel have done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER MISEK, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are very impressive on cost containment, on margins, on signings. It should alleviate a lot of people's concerns. They also raised guidance, which I think is reflective of how good they've been at really showing their value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Revenues still were weak. I think a lot of this cost containment was really IBM execution so I wouldn't go crazy on" implications for broader tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEITH WIRTZ, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FIFTH THIRD ASSET MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At first blush this is all good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were  hoping to see discipline in their cost structure and they maintained their discipline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wirtz holds shares in IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were a little light on the revenue, but super strong on the EPS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance "is a pretty good hike. They're concentrating very, very hard on costs, which I have to tell you, as somebody who's followed this stock for a decade now, I'm impressed. To me, this says they really know how to run their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This, combined with Intel's results, is pushing me to be more optimistic (about the technology sector)... Seeing they made it on the bottom line, and were pretty darned close on the top line, it gives me confidence looking at technology in general."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZACH ROSENSTOCK, ANALYST, WAYNE HUMMER WEALTH MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's another great quarter. They've raised their full year guidance by 50 cents and the Street was below their full year guidance anyway. It seems analysts continue to underestimate the company's ability to generate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their earnings power is very much underestimated despite the fact that revenues continue to be weak. I imagine there will be a pretty positive response to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's up just a couple of percent so far in after hours trading, but it seems like the whole thought process that services are going to be late-cycle and IBM is going to lag just doesn't seem to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can't be used as justification for their discount in valuation anymore in my opinion. They come out and they say they are on pace to be past $10 or $11 next year. If they're $11, they're about 10 times earnings right now and the market's at, what 14 or 15. So it doesn't seem like a company that is growing that consistently and so solidly should be at a discount to the market PE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The earnings power is there... Until the revenues come back, it's tough to extrapolate to the wider tech industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenstock holds a buy rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Clare Baldwin in San Francisco, Bill Rigby in Seattle, Robert MacMillan and Edward Krudy in New York, Jim Finkle in Boston, Sue Zeidler and Laura Isensee in Los Angeles; Compiled by Edwin Chan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co said record investment banking and trading results drove quarterly profit 36 percent higher, topping Wall Street forecasts, but reported a surge in consumer credit losses that foreshadows deeper problems on Main Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the second-largest U.S. bank is among the nation's healthiest major lenders, it more than doubled the amount set aside for bad loans, to $9.7 billion. JPMorgan expects its credit card business to lose money this year and next, and sees higher commercial real estate losses for several quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're still obviously in a pretty big recession," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said rising unemployment will put upward pressure on credit losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results nonetheless benefited from improving credit markets and regulators' efforts to stimulate the economy by keeping borrowing costs low, bolstering mortgage and other lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bank has done reasonably well on the trading side and less well on the home and private lending side," said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed down 13 cents at $36.13 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have risen 15 percent this year, while the KBW Bank Index is down 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter profit rose to $2.72 billion from $2 billion a year earlier. Profit per share fell to 28 cents from 53 cents as the number of shares outstanding increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank said net revenue jumped 41 percent to $27.71 billion and according to general accounting principles was $25.62 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results included per-share charges of 10 cents to bolster a federal deposit insurance program and 27 cents tied to last month's repayment of $25 billion taken from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program. JPMorgan has said it will let the Treasury Department auction the attached stock warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expected profit of 4 cents per share on revenue of $25.91 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Core earnings power appears strong," wrote Standard  Poor's equity analyst Stuart Plesser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading profits helped Goldman Sachs Group Inc post much better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday. Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc are expected on Friday to post relatively weaker operating performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon skirted the worst of the credit crisis by avoiding big losses on complex debt and mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's balance sheet shrank for a third straight quarter, shedding $52.5 billion of assets to $2.03 trillion. Among the six largest U.S. banks, JPMorgan is the only one to make money in every quarter since the recession began in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like good, strong numbers," said Michael Hecht, a JMP Securities analyst. "We are in an increasing world of haves and have-nots and we know where JPMorgan and Goldman fall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan added $1.8 billion to credit reserves, ending with $29.82 billion, while nonperforming assets rose $2.86 billion from the end of March to $17.52 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call with reporters, Dimon said the bank will likely not raise its dividend before early next year, following an 87 percent cut in February. He said he would rather resume stock buybacks before raising the payout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Dimon said loan loss reserves are probably "getting pretty close to their peaks." He said the bank sees "a little bit of a leveling off of delinquencies" and a "little bit of resilience" in the battered California housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said losses tied to the Washington Mutual Inc banking units it bought last September are in line with its forecasts. It said it has no material exposure to CIT Group Inc, the troubled lender to small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon echoed rivals in opposing an Obama administration plan for a new consumer finance protection agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more agencies, the more politics and bureaucracy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPENSATION PRESSURES RISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit in JPMorgan's investment bank more than tripled to $1.47 billion. Revenue rose by one-third to $7.3 billion, including a record $2.24 billion of investment banking fees and a record $4.93 billion from fixed-income trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though investment bankers were paid 15 percent less, Dimon acknowledged more pressure from competitors to attract talent. Exiting TARP freed JPMorgan from some pay limits. Pay at Goldman, which also exited TARP, may set a record this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's just going back to where it was," Dimon told reporters, discussing compensation. "We will be facing the real compensation issues when we get to the end of the year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit card operations posted a $672 million loss. JPMorgan boosted its projected loss rate on cards to 10 percent for this quarter and sees a 24 percent loss rate from Washington Mutual by year-end, the high end of a range it forecast in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer banking's profit nearly vanished, falling to $15 million from $503 million, hurt by housing losses. Mortgage volume rose 9 percent from the first quarter to $41.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan now expects near-term quarterly losses of about $600 million from prime-quality mortgages, up from $500 million it forecast in April, and $500 million from subprime mortgages, up from a previous forecast of $375 million to $475 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To boost the lending margin, which fell to 2.96 percent from the first quarter's 3.18 percent, Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said JPMorgan will let high-yielding certificates of deposit sold by Washington Mutual roll off its books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not going to be chasing those hot money deposits," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

principles was $25.62 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results included per-share charges of 10 cents to bolster a
federal deposit insurance program and 27 cents tied to last
month's repayment of $25 billion taken from the government's
Troubled Asset Relief Program. JPMorgan has said it will let
the Treasury Department auction the attached stock warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average expected profit of 4 cents per share on
revenue of $25.91 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Core earnings power appears strong," wrote Standard 
Poor's equity analyst Stuart Plesser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading profits helped Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) post
much better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday. Bank
of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) are expected on
Friday to post relatively weaker operating performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon skirted the worst of the credit crisis by avoiding
big losses on complex debt and mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's balance sheet shrank for a third straight
quarter, shedding $52.5 billion of assets to $2.03 trillion.
Among the six largest U.S. banks, JPMorgan is the only one to
make money in every quarter since the recession began in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It looks like good, strong numbers," said Michael Hecht, a
JMP Securities analyst. "We are in an increasing world of haves
and have-nots and we know where JPMorgan and Goldman fall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan added $1.8 billion to credit reserves, ending with
$29.82 billion, while nonperforming assets rose $2.86 billion
from the end of March to $17.52 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a conference call with reporters, Dimon said the bank
will likely not raise its dividend before early next year,
following an 87 percent cut in February. He said he would
rather resume stock buybacks before raising the payout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Dimon said loan loss reserves are probably "getting
pretty close to their peaks." He said the bank sees "a little
bit of a leveling off of delinquencies" and a "little bit of
resilience" in the battered California housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said losses tied to the Washington Mutual Inc
WAMUQ.PK banking units it bought last September are in line
with its forecasts. It said it has no material exposure to CIT
Group Inc (CIT.N), the troubled lender to small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon echoed rivals in opposing an Obama administration
plan for a new consumer finance protection agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The more agencies, the more politics and bureaucracy," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COMPENSATION PRESSURES RISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profit in JPMorgan's investment bank more than tripled to
$1.47 billion. Revenue rose by one-third to $7.3 billion,
including a record $2.24 billion of investment banking fees and
a record $4.93 billion from fixed-income trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though investment bankers were paid 15 percent less, Dimon
acknowledged more pressure from competitors to attract talent.
Exiting TARP freed JPMorgan from some pay limits. Pay at
Goldman, which also exited TARP, may set a record this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's just going back to where it was," Dimon told
reporters, discussing compensation. "We will be facing the real
compensation issues when we get to the end of the year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit card operations posted a $672 million loss. JPMorgan
boosted its projected loss rate on cards to 10 percent for this
quarter and sees a 24 percent loss rate from Washington Mutual
by year-end, the high end of a range it forecast in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer banking's profit nearly vanished, falling to $15
million from $503 million, hurt by housing losses. Mortgage
volume rose 9 percent from the first quarter to $41.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan now expects near-term quarterly losses of about
$600 million from prime-quality mortgages, up from $500 million
it forecast in April, and $500 million from subprime mortgages,
up from a previous forecast of $375 million to $475 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To boost the lending margin, which fell to 2.96 percent
from the first quarter's 3.18 percent, Chief Financial Officer
Mike Cavanagh said JPMorgan will let high-yielding certificates
of deposit sold by Washington Mutual roll off its books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're not going to be chasing those hot money deposits,"
he said.

&lt;p&gt; * Visa says action has the effect of a share buyback&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Shares unchanged after the bell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's
largest credit card network, said on Thursday it deposited $700
million in an account to cover legal expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before becoming a public company in March 2008, Visa set
aside $3 billion to cover lawsuits. Last December, it added
$1.1 billion to its litigation account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The credit and debit card network has spent $2.1 billion in
a settlement with American Express Co (AXP.N) over
anti-competitive practices, and last year it agreed to pay
$1.89 billion to Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) over
several quarters in a similar settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said the new addition to its litigation account had
the effect of a $700 million repurchase of the company's common
shares. Under the terms of its initial public offering, Visa's
U.S. bank shareholders agreed to have their stakes diluted to
fund litigation in order to save other shareholders from direct
losses from lawsuits in certain court cases in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa shares were almost unchanged after the bell at
$64.41.

bell but warning of deteriorating consumer credit. The bank's
stock was underwater for most of the day, but edged higher late
in the day with the rest of the market. JPMorgan added 0.1
percent to $36.31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investors have ratcheted up expectations for earnings
almost across the board, so that optimism is still there even
if today's action is rather muted," said Paul Baiocchi, senior

or 0.76 percent, to 8,682.12. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index

Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 18.39 points, or 0.99
percent, at 1,880.96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gains put the market on course for a fourth-straight
day of gains.

&lt;p&gt;    * IBM up ahead of results, bolsters broader market &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Analysts say company may raise full-year outlook &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Shares in IBM rose 2.5 percent in afternoon trade, leading the market higher ahead of the company's quarterly results, as investors bet on the possibility of an improved full-year forecast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts, on average, expect International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) to report later on Thursday a 12 percent drop in second-quarter revenue to $23.5 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But earnings per share are expected to rise slightly to $2.01, helped by a shift to more profitable businesses and by cost cuts. as well as by a lower number of shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    William Lefkowitz, options strategist at vFinance Investments, said the whisper number was much higher, around $2.20 per share to $2.30 per share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts also said they were focusing on the possibility of a higher outlook from IBM. The company's previous outlook was for full-year earnings of "at least $9.20" per share -- a target many said looked easily achievable due to a stabilizing economy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi said IBM may raise its outlook to reflect a solid first half of the year, "perhaps to 'at least $9.30'." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM has fared better than many other technology companies, helped in part by its growing focus on profitable software and services like outsourcing and technology support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "EPS is likely to see upward revisions as the year progresses, and the strong defensiveness of IBM's portfolio makes it attractive in an uncertain spending environment," Sacconaghi said in a research report earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM shares rose $2.74, or 2.6 percent, to $109.96 in afternoon trade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ritsuko Ando, with additional reporting by Doris Frankel in Chicago) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((ritsuko.ando@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 223 6084; Reuters Messaging: ritsuko.ando.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: IBM/SHARES &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

 LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - Upbeat results from JP Morgan boosted banks
while energy and pharmaceutical stocks also gained, leading Britain's top share
index to close at a one-month high, up for a fourth session on Thursday.

 The index was trading in slightly negative territory in early trade but the
JP Morgan results which were announced around midsession lifted the FTSE 100
.FTSE which closed 0.35 percent, or 15.38 points up at 4,361.84.

 The index shrugged off weak U.S. factory activity data which hit stocks on
Wall Street; the FTSE 100 is up 5.7 percent on the week and is set for its best
weekly performance in four months.

 Investors will look to second-quarter results from IBM (IBM.N) and Google
(GOOG.O) after U.S. markets close for more clues on the corporate outlook and
whether shares can continue their upward trajectory.

 "It all depends on how good the results from IBM and Google are," said Nick
Serff, analyst from City Index. "The results this week have been good and more
positive results should see consolidation of the gains."

 Citigroup (C.N) General Electric (GE.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) report
on Friday.

 Banks were the biggest driver of gains, continuing the bull run from the
last couple of sessions following the results from JP Morgan.

 HSBC (HSBA.L), Barclays (BARC.L) and Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) added
between 0.6 and 1.7 percent.

 Among other financials, Schroders (SDR.L) climbed 3.3 percent, after
Citigroup raised the fund firm to "buy" from "sell". 

 


 ENERGY UP

 Energy stocks were also among stocks in positive ground, with crude oil
stable above $61 per barrel CLc1.

 Heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) added 0.5 and 0.9
percent respectively.

 Oil services company Petrofac (PFC.L) was the top riser, gaining 5.3 percent
after it said its Petrofac Emirates unit, in partnership with GS EC, was
awarded a $2.1 billion Abu Dhabi integrated gas development contract.

 But mining firms took the most points off the index as doubts still hovered
over the demand outlook for metals. Anglo American (AAL.L), Kazakhmys (KAZ.L)
and Rio Tinto (RIO.L) lost between 0.6 and 2.3 percent.

   UK software firm Autonomy AUTN.L was the biggest faller on the index,
down 8.6 percent, as analysts said although the firm reported second-quarter
revenue which was in line with expectations, it missed a number of top-end
estimates, and the market expected more from its outlook.

 Risk appetite, while slightly improved, was still fragile, leading investors
to move into defensive pharmaceutical and tobacco stocks.

 AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and Shire (SHP.L) added 1.5 and 0.5 percent,
respectively, while British American Tobacco (BATS.L) gained 1.5 percent and
Imperial Tobacco (IMT.L) was up 1 percent.

&lt;p&gt;  DULLES, VA, Jul 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Grab Networks, a video software and syndication services company enabling
the widespread distribution of professional video clips across multiple
platforms, announced today it will incorporate Microsoft VC-1 Internet
Information Services 7.0 (IIS7) Smooth Streaming encoding into its
Anystream Agility 2G, furthering its ability to provide a superior video
experience for all audiences across multiple devices. By combining
Microsoft's acclaimed high-definition (HD) and live streaming technology
with Grab Networks' automated video management and production platform,
video producers and content owners can automatically encode video assets
to the new VC-1 IIS7 Smooth Streaming standard and make high-quality,
professional-grade video available to users on virtually any platform.
The new fully-integrated Anystream Agility 2G with IIS7 Smooth Streaming
will be available for enterprise customers at the end of the summer in
2009.

    IIS7 Smooth Streaming enables Web-based television-like delivery of HD
media content. The underlying technology builds on Microsoft VC-1 codec
components to create multiple pre-defined streams, adding mechanisms to
automatically adjust the playback to varying consumer connection speeds,
and other network playback challenges, enabling higher-quality streaming
media delivery over IP and mobile networks.

    "As online media become more mainstream, consumer's expectations for
quality increase. Microsoft embraces this," said Steve Sklepowich, group
product manager for Silverlight at Microsoft Corp. "By incorporating
Microsoft VC-1 IIS7 Smooth Streaming encoding into Anystream Agility 2G,
Grab Networks' media customers are well-equipped to deliver exceptional HD
online video experiences to their viewers."

    Anystream successfully tested IIS7 Smooth Streaming capability with its
Agility platform during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games to provide a
superior on-demand viewing experience worldwide.

    "Our positive experience with the Beijing Summer Olympics proved that
incorporating IIS7 Smooth Streaming with the Agility platform allows our
enterprise customers to deliver unprecedented video quality while reducing
complexity and streamlining workflows," said Bill Holding, President, Grab
Networks. "Our customers are constantly striving to create new ways to
improve the value of their content and IIS7 Smooth Streaming VC-1 video in
an interactive Microsoft Silverlight player is a new package that offers
exactly that capability."

    Anystream Agility is currently being used by more than 700 enterprise
customers to automate and streamline the production of high-quality video
for multiplatform delivery. Designed for scale, volume and efficiency,
Anystream Agility enables companies to rapidly transcode, manage and
distribute content for broadcast and cable television, broadband and
handheld devices.

    About Grab Networks

    Created from the merger between Anystream and Voxant Media, Grab Networks
offers a comprehensive video operating system and syndication network for
profitably publishing video anywhere on the Internet. The system
automatically manages, transcodes and tags video assets -- turning clips
into searchable packets that can be combined with relevant advertising and
distributed to any device. With more than 75,000 syndication partners,
Grab Networks enables video producers and content owners to build
profitable virtual networks and generate ad-based revenue from a broader
audience.

&lt;p&gt;--James Saft is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By James Saft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUNTSVILLE, Alabama (Reuters) - As much as bonus-eligible employers may rejoice, the government, taxpayers and shareholders have real reasons to be concerned about Goldman Sachs' huge surge in profits and how they are being generated and allocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman this week notched up its largest ever profit as a public company - $3.44 billion for the second quarter - but did it while taking on considerably more risk by a key measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Goldman set aside 48 percent of its total revenue, or $6.65 billion, to fund employee compensation, an amount that is not only titanic for a company that only recently was in receipt of direct government support but is, even more astonishingly, the same percentage as was doled out to employees in 2007, in the supposedly bad old pre-crisis days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our model never really changed," Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told Bloomberg News. "We've said very consistently that our business model remained the same." I'll say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have just lived through the biggest financial markets blowup in several generations, one in which a catastrophic mixture of bad policy, lax regulation, failed risk management and perverse incentives combined to throw the world into recession and put taxpayers in the position of having to bail out the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But yet, Goldman is taking on more risk than before the deluge, and, when it makes more money, allocating the same amount to the no-doubt brilliant employees who helped produce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I were a politician who might need to underwrite the next bailout if Goldman's bets go bad, I'd be a bit worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I were a Goldman shareholder who had seen Lehman and Bear Stearns fall, I'd be wondering why, given the risks they exemplify, I don't get a bigger share of the pie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all puts me very much in mind of the old and doubtless apocryphal joke about the out of town J.P. Morgan client a century ago who, when his salesman sought to impress him by pointing out the yachts of Mr. Morgan and his executive lying at anchor at the foot of Wall Street quipped, "Where are the customer's yachts?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where, indeed, are the shareholders' yachts, and, if the taxpayers can't get yachts, where are their harbor fees to help clean up the oil slicks when the yachts sink?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CREATURE OF GOVERNMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's value-at-risk (VAR), a calculation which attempts to measure potential daily losses, increased to $245 million in the quarter, up from $185 million last May and just $127 million in the palmy days of February, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholder equity has also increased, so you could argue that there is a bigger cushion to buffer losses, but even so Goldman is taking on nearly 15 percent more VAR as compared to shareholder equity than in February 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, leverage, the ratio of assets to shareholders equity, at the bank is falling and stands at 14.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VAR has been widely criticized, not least because of claims it is poor at discounting the kinds of very rare events which ruin firms, but I think it is fair to use it as a proxy for changes in the direction of risk taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman may well be better, smarter and even safer than all of the competition, and I am sure they will argue persuasively that they are never going to need to have recourse to the public purse, but a lesson of the past year is that if private risk taking at a big enough institution goes wrong, the government will have to pick up the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and virtually every other bank and investment bank around the world are creatures of government. They exist, whether they want to or not, only by grace of the taxpayers who, it has been demonstrated, stand ready to pick up the pieces when risk management fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if all the government equity and FDIC-insured bonds are paid back, that is still true and is understood by Goldman and everyone else's clients, lenders and counterparties. This gives regulators the right to do what they think is needed to control risk taking, and compensation too, given the strong relationship between incentives and foolish risk taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be that Goldman's stonking profits and increase in risk are an anomaly, as Goldman was strong enough to be the firm best able to function and take on more risk in the aftermath of last autumn's blowup, and it may also be that regulators become more effective and better at limiting and controlling risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mooted plan to impose fees on activities like proprietary trading is promising and seems both more elegant and easier to manage than outright controls on compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain: if regulators don't act there will be a lot of competitors gunning to make Goldman-like profits and not all of them will be as well managed or successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will open stores close to those of Apple Inc this fall, according to its chief operating officer, as it looks to win back the initiative in the battle for Main Street PC and gadget buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're going to have some retail stores opened up right next door to Apple stores this fall," said Microsoft's Kevin Turner at a webcast conference in New Orleans on Wednesday. "Stay tuned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company announced in February that it would open its own chain of branded stores as it looks to counter Apple's successful foray into retailing, hiring a former Wal-Mart Stores Inc executive to run them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few details have emerged since then. A Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed on Wednesday only that "there will be scenarios where we have stores in proximity to Apple," and that some stores would open "in the fall timeframe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co JPM.N on Thursday posted a higher quarterly profit, saying strength in its core consumer and investment banking businesses offset a jump in credit losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income rose to $2.72 billion from $2 billion a year earlier, JPMorgan said. Profit per share fell to 28 cents from 53 cents. Net revenue jumped 41 percent to $27.71 billion. The bank said it set aside $9.7 billion for credit losses, up from $4.29 billion a year earlier but down from the first quarter's $10.07 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earnings beat analysts' forecasts of 4 cents a share and the revenue beat a $25.9 billion forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL HOLLAND, MONEY MANAGER, HOLLAND  CO, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The revenue growth in this environment, whether Intel, or Goldman Sachs, or these guys, is very precious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were able to come through the worst financial crisis in the last quarter century in such a way that they have the opportunity to grow revenues, meaning that they were not only in the great transaction business raising capital for other people, but also on the trading side. They took advantage of some of the dislocations in the market because they were able to ease their balance sheet and take some risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see anything other than some glory there for them, having come through this period and make money in the old fashion way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER DIXON, ECONOMIST, COMMERZBANK, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The performance of JP Morgan relative to consensus is generally much more patchy than Goldman Sachs, but it's clear that the bank has done reasonably well on the trading side and less well on the home and private lending side."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's basically telling us that the banks which have a reasonably strong trading presence will be bailed out hopefully by the second quarter results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the longer run, we probably shouldn't get too excited about the banks' ability to generate profits because they will be constrained by government actions to prevent them from taking the kind of risk they took in past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOERG RAHN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT WEALTH MANAGERS MARCARD, STEIN  CO. HAMBURG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was really very, very good news and confirms the development of the banking sector in the United States. It was a truly positive surprise which does away with the question whether we actually have reached the end of the crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL HECHT, ANALYST at JMP SECURITIES, NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like good, strong numbers, and it looks pretty broad based. This is a lot better than expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So far, we've seen numbers out of Goldman Sachs and numbers out of these guys. We are in an increasing world of haves and have-nots, and we know where JPMorgan and Goldman fall in that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHARD HUNTER, HEAD OF EQUITIES AT HARGREAVES LANSDOWN, LONDON.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(JP Morgan results) have given a shot in the arm to the markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's too early to call the earnings season a success, but the early signs are positive as evidenced by a shift to risk taking on both sides of the pond."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRIS HOSSAIN, SENIOR SALES MANAGER, ODL SECURITIES, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JP Morgan Chase numbers reiterated the growing confidence that the banking sector may be coming back from the nadir. With better than expected headline numbers, this might give the markets further impetus following the recent two day rally. Futures have perked up on release of the numbers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVID MORRISON, MARKET STRATEGIST AT GFT GLOBAL MARKETS, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have been taken positively. They have come in above expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When Meredith Whitney upped her guidance on Goldman Sachs, it was a very specific recommendation and not to be taken to read through for the rest of the banks. But having said that JPMorgan is in a somewhat similar situation to Goldman Sachs. There is a lot of water between those two and the rest of the banks. I think it is narrowly positive for the market... But I don't think we can take too much read through to the broader market and not ahead of the numbers from Citi and Bank of America tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAN GREENHAUS, ANALYST AT MILLER TABAK  CO IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's certainly encouraging to see a bank like JPMorgan beat estimates, because it's more representative of the economy than something like Goldman Sachs. I think that certainly if the beat was built on a solid foundation, I would expect the market to react favorably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thus far, the earnings season has been OK, but you have to remember how far expectations have been depressed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ryan Vlastelica and Steve Eder in New York and Simon Falush, Juan Lagorio, Atul Prakash and Dominic Lau in London and Christoph Steitz in Frankfurt)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Investors fret about CIT's survival&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * For up-to-the-minute market news click [STXNEWS/US]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were
little changed on Thursday as a jump in quarterly profit at
JPMorgan Chase  Co(JPM.N) was overshadowed by investor angst
about the future of lender CIT Group Inc and caution ahead of a
key report on the labor market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's second quarter results topped Wall Street's
estimates, continuing a stream of reassuring news on bank
earnings after Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) posted similarly
stronger results on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the market was confronted by news that bankruptcy
loomed over small-business lender CIT  (CIT.N) a day after Wall
Street racked its biggest three-day gain since March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks between the government and CIT about a potential
bailout collapsed on Wednesday, a reminder that fallout from
the financial crisis and the recession is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is going to continue to look for fuel from
earnings," said Andre Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial
Group in Princeton, New Jersey. "The concern is that CIT does
not appear to be getting a government bailout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 were 1.9 points lower and were about
even with fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by
taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to
expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average
futures DJc1 gained 4 points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures
fell 4 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors will be closely monitoring the weekly number of
initial filings for jobless benefits, expected not to change
from the previous week's 565,000. Continuing claims are
expected to inch lower to 6.850 million, from 6.883 million the
week before. This key data is due at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other data on tap for Thursday includes the Philadelphia
Federal Reserve Bank's release of its July business activity
survey at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT). Economists in a Reuters survey
forecast a reading of -5.0 versus -2.2 in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is scheduled to
testify before a Congressional panel about the takeover of
Merrill lynch by Bank of America at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT).

Thursday, with gains by banks on better-than-expected results

in tech shares as bellwether Nokia warned on margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 1111 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European shares was up 0.5 percent at 868.00 points, rising for

 By David Brett 

 LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - Upbeat results from JP Morgan
boosted banks, lifting Britain's top share index into positive
territory for a fourth session in mid-session trade on Thursday.

 The index was trading in slightly negative territory in
early trade but the JP Morgan results lifted the FTSE 100
.FTSE index 0.2 percent, or 8.53 points, to 4,354.99 by 1110
GMT. 

 The index closed at a four-week high on Wednesday, and is
set for its best weekly performance in two months.

 "(JP Morgan results) have given a shot in the arm to the
markets," said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves
Lansdown. 

 "It's too early to call the earnings season a success, but
the early signs are positive as evidenced by a shift to risk
taking on both sides of the pond."

 Banks were the biggest driver of gains, continuing the bull
run from the last couple of sessions following the results from
JP Morgan. 

 HSBC (HSBA.L), Barclays (BARC.L) and Standard Chartered
(STAN.L) added between 0.6 and 1.7 percent. 

 Among other financials, Schroders (SDR.L) climbed 2.7
percent, after Citigroup raised the fund firm to "buy" from
"sell". 

 The U.S. will continue to be the main focus on Thursday as
second-quarter earnings season continues with Google GOOG.N
and IBM (IBM.N) both due to report later in the session.

 


 DEMAND SOGGY

 However, the overall outlook for the global economy was
still looking difficult with a soggy demand outlook dragging
metals and crude prices lower, putting pressure on miners and
energy stocks.

 Mining firms took the most points off the index. Anglo
American (AAL.L), BHP Billiton (BLT.L), Kazakhmys (KAZ.L) and
Rio Tinto (RIO.L) lost between 0.3 and 2.3 percent. 

 Oil stocks retreated following Wednesday's rally as crude
again softened back below the $61 a barrel a mark CLc1.

 Energy firms Tullow Oil (TLW.L), Cairn Energy (CNE.L), Royal
Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), BP (BP.L) and BG Group (BG.L) fell between
0.3 and 2.3 percent.

 However, Petrofac (PFC.L) moved 4.7 percent higher to lead
the FTSE risers, after the company said its Petrofac Emirates
unit, in partnership with GS EC, was awarded a $2.1 billion Abu
Dhabi integrated gas development contract.

 UK software firm Autonomy AUTN.L was the biggest faller on
the index, down 8.6 percent, as analysts said although the firm
reported second-quarter revenue which was in line with
expectations, it missed a number of top-end estimates, and the
market expected more from its outlook.

 Risk appetite, while slightly improved, was still fragile
leading investors to move into defensive pharmaceutical and
tobacco stocks.

 AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and Shire (SHP.L) added 1.1 and 1
percent, respectively, while British American Tobacco (BATS.L)
gained 1 percent and Imperial Tobacco (IMT.L) was up 1.2
percent. 

 On the economic front, China's growth rate shot up in the
second quarter on the back of a surge in state spending and bank
lending, boosting hopes the biggest emerging economy will lead
the way out of the worst global downturn since the 1930s.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported second-quarter 2009 net income
of $2.7 billion, an increase of 36% compared with net income of $2.0 billion in
the second quarter of 2008. Earnings per share were $0.28, compared with $0.53
in the second quarter of 2008. Current-quarter earnings per share reflected a
one-time, non-cash reduction in net income applicable to common stockholders of
$1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share, resulting from repayment of TARP preferred
capital. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results: "We
are pleased that, despite a continued difficult economic environment, we were
able to report $2.7 billion in earnings and record revenue of almost $28
billion. Of particular note, the Investment Bank reported record overall revenue
for the first half of the year, which included record fees and Fixed Income
Markets revenue for this quarter. In addition, Commercial Banking, Asset
Management, Treasury &amp; Securities Services and Retail Banking each delivered
another quarter of solid performance. These results were negatively affected by
the continued high levels of credit costs in Consumer Lending and Card Services,
which we expect will remain elevated for the foreseeable future." 

Regarding balance sheet strength, Dimon added: "Even after further strengthening
our credit reserves by $2 billion to $30 billion and repaying the $25 billion of
TARP capital, the firm ended the quarter with a very strong Tier 1 Capital ratio
of 9.7% and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 7.7%. With these additions to reserves, we
now have an extremely high loan loss coverage ratio of 5%." 

Dimon further remarked: "Throughout this crisis, we have remained committed to
doing our part to help bring stability to the communities in which we operate
and to the financial system overall. During the quarter, we maintained our
efforts to support economic recovery and to help keep people in their homes. We
continued to lend, extending approximately $150 billion in new credit to
consumer and corporate customers. We approved 138,000 trial mortgage
modifications, bringing total foreclosures prevented since 2007 to 565,000 - a
number we expect to continue to grow." 

Commenting on the second half of 2009, Dimon concluded: "While we do not know if
the economy will deteriorate further, we feel confident that, with our strong
capital and reserve levels and significant earnings power, we can continue to
reinvest in our businesses and do well for our clients, communities and
shareholders over the long term." 

In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a
firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with
GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the
firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded; and for
each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a
tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other
non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of
each line of business, see page 13.

The following discussion compares the second quarter of 2009 with the second
quarter of 2008 unless otherwise noted.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $1.5 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from the prior year.
The results reflected higher net revenue and lower noninterest expense,
partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses. 

Net revenue was $7.3 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion from the prior year.
Investment banking fees were up 29% to a record $2.2 billion and comprised the
following: advisory fees, up 6% to $393 million; equity underwriting fees, up by
$561 million to a record $1.1 billion; and debt underwriting fees, down 10% to
$743 million. Fixed Income Markets revenue was a record $4.9 billion, up by $2.6
billion from the prior year, driven by strong results across all products, as
well as the absence of markdowns related to leveraged lending funded and
unfunded commitments and mortgage-related exposure. The current period had
modest gains on those exposures, compared with losses totaling $1.1 billion in
the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue was offset partially by losses of
$773 million from the tightening of the firm`s credit spread on certain
structured liabilities.Equity Markets revenue was $708 million, down by $371
million, or 34%, reflecting weak trading results and losses of $326 million from
the tightening of the firm`s credit spread on certain structured liabilities,
offset by strong client revenue, particularly in prime services. Credit
Portfolio revenue was a loss of $575 million, down by $914 million, reflecting
mark-to-market losses on hedges of retained loans, partially offset by the net
impact of credit spreads on derivative assets and liabilities and net interest
income on loans. 

The provision for credit losses was $871 million, compared with $398 million in
the prior year, due to higher charge-offs, as well as a higher allowance
reflecting continued deterioration in the credit environment. Net charge-offs
were $433 million, while the increase to the allowance for loan losses was $438
million. The resulting allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained
was 7.91%, compared with 3.44% in the prior year. Nonperforming loans were $3.5
billion, up by $3.2 billion from the prior year and $1.7 billion from the prior
quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $4.1 billion, compared with $4.7 billion in the prior
year.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $15 million, a decrease of $488 million, or 97%, from the prior
year. A higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense were
offset partially by higher net revenue, reflecting the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction. Compared with the prior quarter, net income decreased by
$459 million, or 97%, reflecting a decline in MSR risk management results,
narrower loan spreads and lower loan balances; these effects were offset
partially by higher deposit- related fees, efficiencies related to the
Washington Mutual transaction and wider deposit spreads. 

Net revenue was $8.0 billion, an increase of $2.9 billion, or 56%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $5.0 billion, up by $1.9 billion, or 60%,
reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan spreads,
wider deposit spreads and higher deposit balances, offset partially by lower
loan balances in the heritage Chase portfolio. Noninterest revenue was $2.9
billion, up by $980 million, or 50%, driven by the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction and higher deposit-related fees. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion
from the prior year. Weak economic conditions and housing price declines
continued to drive higher estimated losses for the home equity and mortgage loan
portfolios. The provision included a $1.2 billion addition to the allowance for
loan losses, compared with an addition of $600 million in the prior year and
$1.7 billion in the prior quarter. Home equity net charge-offs were $1.3 billion
(4.61% net charge-off rate2), compared with $511 million (2.16% net charge-off
rate) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $410 million
(11.50% net charge-off rate2), compared with $192 million (4.98% net charge-off
rate) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs were $481 million (3.07%
net charge-off rate2), compared with $104 million (1.08% net charge-off rate) in
the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $4.1 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 52%,
reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher servicing
expense and higher FDIC insurance premiums. 

Retail Banking reported net income of $970 million, up by $296 million, or 44%,
from the prior year. Compared with the prior quarter, net income increased by
$107 million, or 12%, due to higher deposit-related fees, wider deposit spreads,
and efficiencies related to the Washington Mutual transaction. 

Net revenue was $4.5 billion, up by $1.8 billion, or 65%, reflecting the impact
of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider deposit spreads, higher deposit
balances and higher deposit-related fees. 

The provision for credit losses was $361 million, compared with $62 million in
the prior year, reflecting higher estimated losses and an increase in the
allowance for loan losses for Business Banking loans. 

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up by $1.0 billion, or 64%, due to the
impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher FDIC insurance premiums.

Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $955 million, compared with a net loss
of $171 million in the prior year and $389 million in the prior quarter.
Compared with the prior quarter, results reflected a decline in MSR risk
management results, narrower loan spreads, lower loan balances and an increase
in reserves for the repurchase of previously-sold loans, partially offset by a
lower provision for credit losses. 

Net revenue was $3.4 billion, up by $1.1 billion, or 45%, from the prior year.
The increase was driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and
wider loan spreads, largely offset by lower loan balances in the heritage Chase
portfolio. Mortgage fees and related income increased due to higher net mortgage
servicing revenue, partially offset by a decline in mortgage production revenue.
Mortgage production revenue was $284 million, down $110 million from the prior
year, as an increase in reserves for the repurchase of previously-sold loans and
markdowns on the mortgage warehouse were offset partially by wider margins on
new originations. Net mortgage servicing revenue (which includes loan servicing
revenue, other changes in fair value and MSR risk management results) was $523
million, an increase of $221 million from the prior year. Loan servicing
revenue, net of other changes in fair value of the MSR asset, was up $191
million, reflecting a 70% growth in third-party loans serviced. MSR risk
management results were $81 million, compared with $51 million in the prior
year. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.5 billion, compared with $1.5 billion in
the prior year, reflecting weakness in the home equity, mortgage and student
loan portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for
credit losses, above, for further detail). 

Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, up by $399 million, or 36%, from the prior
year, reflecting higher servicing expense due to increased delinquencies and
defaults and the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see notes on page 13for further explanation of
managed basis. 

Discussion of Results:

Net loss was $672 million, a decline of $922 million from the prior year. The
decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by
higher net revenue. 

End-of-period managed loans were $171.5 billion, an increase of $16.1 billion,
or 10%, from the prior year and a decrease of $4.6 billion, or 3%, from the
prior quarter. Average managed loans were $174.1 billion, an increase of $21.3
billion, or 14%, from the prior year and a decrease of $9.3 billion, or 5%, from
the prior quarter. The increases from the prior year in both end-of-period and
average managed loans were predominantly due to the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction, partially offset by lower charge volume and a higher level
of charge-offs. Excluding the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
end-of-period and average managed loans were $148.4 billion and $149.7 billion,
respectively. 

Managed net revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 29%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $4.3 billion, up by $1.3 billion, or
43%, from the prior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction and wider loan spreads. These benefits were offset partially by
higher revenue reversals associated with higher charge-offs and a decreased
level of fees. Noninterest revenue was $557 million, a decrease of $207 million,
or 27%, from the prior year. The decline was driven by an increase in the credit
enhancement for securitization trusts combined with lower securitization income,
partially offset by higher merchant servicing revenue related to the dissolution
of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $4.6 billion, an increase of $2.4
billion from the prior year, reflecting a higher level of charge-offs due to
continued deterioration in the credit environment. The managed net charge-off
rate for the quarter was 10.03%, up from 4.98% in the prior year and 7.72% in
the prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 5.86%, up from 3.46%
in the prior year and down from 6.16% in the prior quarter, reflecting normal
seasonal patterning. Excluding Washington Mutual, the managed net charge-off
rate for the second quarter was 8.97% and the 30-day delinquency rate was 5.27%.


Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $148 million, or 12%, from
the prior year, due to the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint
venture and the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $368 million, an increase of $13 million, or 4%, from the prior
year. Higher net revenue, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction, was predominantly offset by a higher provision for credit losses
and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of $347 million, or 31%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $995 million, up by $272 million, or 38%,
driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. Excluding Washington
Mutual, net interest income was flat compared with the prior year, as wider loan
spreads, a shift to higher-spread liability products and overall growth in
liability balances were offset predominantly by spread compression on liability
products and lower loan balances. Noninterest revenue was $458 million, an
increase of $75 million, or 20%, reflecting the second straight quarter of
record levels of lending- and deposit-related fees. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $772 million, an increase of $64 million,
or 9%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $224
million, a decrease of $4 million, or 2%, from the prior quarter. Record revenue
from Mid-Corporate Banking was $305 million, an increase of $70 million, or 30%,
from the prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $120 million, an
increase of $26 million, or 28%, from the prior year, due to the impact of the
Washington Mutual transaction. 

The provision for credit losses was $312 million, compared with $47 million in
the prior year, reflecting continued deterioration in the credit environment.
The allowance for loan losses to end- of-period loans retained was 2.87%, up
from 2.59% in the prior year and 2.65% in the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans
were $2.1 billion, up by $1.6 billion from the prior year, reflecting the impact
of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher levels of such loans in each
business segment. Compared with the prior quarter, nonperforming loans were up
by $580 million, driven by continued deterioration in the credit environment
across all business segments. Net charge-offs were $181 million (0.67% net
charge-off rate), compared with $49 million (0.28% net charge-off rate) in the
prior year and $134 million (0.48% net charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $535 million, an increase of $59 million, or 12%, from
the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and
higher FDIC insurance premiums offset partially by lower headcount-related
expense.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $379 million, a decrease of $46 million, or 11%, from the prior
year, driven by lower net revenue offset partially by lower noninterest expense.
Compared with the prior quarter, net income increased by $71 million, or 23%,
reflecting seasonal activity in securities lending and depositary receipts as
well as the effect of market appreciation on assets under custody. 

Net revenue was $1.9 billion, a decrease of $119 million, or 6%, from the prior
year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $966 million, a decrease of
$148 million, or 13%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by the effect
of market depreciation on assets under custody and lower securities lending
balances, primarily as a result of declines in asset valuations and demand.
Treasury Services net revenue was $934 million, an increase of $29 million, or
3%, reflecting growth across cash management products and higher trade revenue
driven by wider spreads, partially offset by spread compression on deposit
products. TSS firmwide net revenue, which includes net revenue recorded in other
lines of business, was $2.6 billion, a decrease of $79 million, or 3%, compared
with the prior year, primarily due to declines in Worldwide Securities Services.
Treasury Services firmwide net revenue grew to $1.7 billion, an increase of $69
million, or 4%, from the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $5 million, compared with an
expense of $7 million in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $29 million, reflecting
lower headcount-related expense, partially offset by higher FDIC insurance
premiums.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $352 million, a decrease of $43 million, or 11%, from the prior
year, due to lower net revenue and higher provision for credit losses offset
partially by lower noninterest expense. Compared with the prior quarter, net
income increased by $128 million, or 57%, driven by higher valuations of seed
capital investments, higher brokerage fees and the effect of improved market
levels. 

Net revenue was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $82 million, or 4%, from the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $135 million, or 8%,
due to the effect of lower market levels and lower placement fees; these effects
were offset partially by higher valuations of seed capital investments. Net
interest income was $414 million, up by $53 million, or 15%, from the prior
year, predominantly due to wider loan and deposit spreads and higher deposit
balances. 

Private Bank revenue decreased by 10% to $640 million due to the effect of lower
market levels and lower placement fees, largely offset by wider loan and deposit
spreads. Institutional revenue increased by 3% to $487 million due to higher
valuations of seed capital investments, largely offset by the effect of lower
market levels. Retail revenue decreased by 16% to $411 million due to the effect
of lower market levels and net equity outflows, partially offset by higher
valuations of seed capital investments. Private Wealth Management revenue
decreased by 6% to $334 million due to the effect of lower market levels and
narrower deposit spreads. Bear Stearns Private Client Services contributed $110
million to revenue. 

Assets under supervision were $1.5 trillion, a decrease of $68 billion, or 4%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, a decrease of
$14 billion, or 1%, from the prior year. The decreases were due to the effect of
lower market levels and outflows from non-liquidity products, predominantly
offset by liquidity product inflows. Custody, brokerage, administration and
deposit balances were $372 billion, down $54 billion, due to the effect of lower
market levels on brokerage and custody balances, partially offset by brokerage
inflows in the Private Bank. 

The provision for credit losses was $59 million, an increase of $42 million from
the prior year, reflecting continued deterioration in the credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $46 million, or 3%, from the
prior year due to lower performance-based compensation and lower
headcount-related expense, largely offset by the impact of the Bear Stearns
merger and higher FDIC insurance premiums.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see notes on page 13 for further explanation
of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was $25,623 million, $25,025
million, and $18,399 million for the second quarter of 2009, first quarter of
2009 and second quarter of 2008, respectively. 

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $2.7 billion, an increase of $718 million, or 36%, from the prior
year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue, predominantly
offset by a higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. 

Managed net revenue was $27.7 billion, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 41%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.0 billion, up by $3.5 billion, or
37%. The increase was driven by higher principal transactions, higher lending-
and deposit-related fees, and record Investment Banking fees; these were offset
partially by the effect of lower market levels on fees and commission revenue.
Net interest income was $14.7 billion, up by $4.5 billion, or 45%, due to the
impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan spreads and higher
investment- and trading-related net interest income. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $9.7 billion, up by $5.4 billion,
from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit losses was
$8.5 billion, compared with $3.8 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher
net charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for credit losses, largely
related to home lending. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $7.0 billion,
compared with $2.9 billion in the prior year, resulting in managed net
charge-off rates of 6.18%2 and 3.08%, respectively. The wholesale provision for
credit losses was $1.2 billion, compared with $505 million in the prior year,
reflecting an increase in the allowance for credit losses, largely in the
Investment Bank. Wholesale net charge-offs were $679 million, compared with net
charge-offs of $41 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates
of 1.19% and 0.08%, respectively. The firm`s nonperforming assets totaled $17.5
billion at June 30, 2009, up from the prior-year level of $6.2 billion. 

Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion, up by $1.3 billion, or 11%, from the
prior year. The increase was driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction, a $675 million (pretax) FDIC special assessment and higher FDIC
insurance premiums.

1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:

a. In addition to analyzing the firm`s results on a reported basis, management
analyzes the firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a
managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm`s definition of
managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the
following adjustments. 

First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of
credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit
losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services
results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been
securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance
sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same
manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan
Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and
overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio.
Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as
employees and capital, based on managed financial information. In addition, the
same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans
on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in
the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the
ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their
credit cards; accordingly, the customer`s credit performance will affect both
the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan
Chase believes managed-basis information is useful to investors, enabling them
to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the
balance sheet and the firm`s retained interests in securitized loans. 

Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each
of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax
credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the
comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The
corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income
tax expense. 

See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase`s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (second
quarter 2009) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase`s income statement from a
reported basis to a managed basis. 

b. Tier 1 Common Capital ("Tier 1 Common") is calculated, for all purposes, as
Tier 1 Capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust
preferred securities, and qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries. 

c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total
net revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into
consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate
the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective
competitors. 

2 Coverage Ratio: Allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes
purchased credit-impaired loans and loans from the Washington Mutual Master
Trust, which were consolidated on the Firm's balance sheet at fair value during
the second quarter of 2009. No allowance for loan losses was recorded for these
loans at June 30, 2009.

 (c) The calculation of second quarter 2009 earnings per share includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share, resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital.                                                                             
 (d) Ratios are based upon annualized amounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 (e) The calculation of second quarter and year-to-date 2009 net income applicable to common equity includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. Excluding this reduction the adjusted ROE and ROE-GW were 6% and 10% for the second quarter 2009 , respectively, and 6% and 9% for the year-to-date, respectively. The Firm views the adjusted ROE and ROE-GW, non-GAAP financial measures, as meaningful because it increases the comparability to prior 
 periods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (f) Net income applicable to common equity divided by total average common equity (net of goodwill). The Firm uses return on equity less goodwill, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of the Firm. The Firm utilizes this measure to facilitate comparisons to competitors.

&lt;p&gt;July 16 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan upgraded American Express
Co (AXP.N) to "neutral" from "underweight," saying it sees
falling network revenues at the largest U.S. credit card
company to be outpaced by lower expenses and provisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We maintain rising unemployment, a spiking savings rate,
and a slow return for business spending will retard revenues
through 2010, but expense savings will allow the company to
achieve its goal of remaining profitable through this credit
cycle," JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The upgrade comes a day after the company said U.S. credit
card defaults grew less-than-expected in the second quarter and
could be lower-than-estimated in the second half.
[ID:nN15352318] [ID:nN15343757]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following previously announced expense cuts, the company's
comments on Wednesday should strengthen near-term earnings
expectations, said the brokerage, which raised its price target
on the company's stock to $25 from $16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Express was the fastest growing credit card
company during the credit boom of 2003-07, but the company paid
a heavy price when the bubble burst last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mounting credit losses sent its earnings spiraling lower.
Since then, American Express has been slashing lending,
trimming expenses by $2.5 billion -- including 11,000 job cuts
-- and divesting to shore up its balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, American Express said it halted its
contributions to employees' pension plans in the United States
and the UK, as part of a restructuring process to slash costs
amid mounting credit losses. [ID:nN15379058]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the only credit card company that did not cut its
dividend and the only one that remains profitable, according to
quarterly reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, JP Morgan said it still expects normalized
earnings levels at the company to disappoint as discount
revenue fails to grow on the back of a weakened consumer,
smaller credit card portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Sandler O'Neill raised its price target on the
stock to $20 from $17 to reflect the improved earnings outlook,
but kept its "sell" rating on concerns related to consumer
spending and leverage. [ID:nWNAB7640]

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported second-quarter 2009 net income
of $2.7 billion, an increase of 36% compared with net income of $2.0 billion in
the second quarter of 2008. Earnings per share were $0.28, compared with $0.53
in the second quarter of 2008. Current-quarter earnings per share reflected a
one-time, non-cash reduction in net income applicable to common stockholders of
$1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share, resulting from repayment of TARP preferred
capital. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results: "We
are pleased that, despite a continued difficult economic environment, we were
able to report $2.7 billion in earnings and record revenue of almost $28
billion. Of particular note, the Investment Bank reported record overall revenue
for the first half of the year, which included record fees and Fixed Income
Markets revenue for this quarter. In addition, Commercial Banking, Asset
Management, Treasury &amp; Securities Services and Retail Banking each delivered
another quarter of solid performance. These results were negatively affected by
the continued high levels of credit costs in Consumer Lending and Card Services,
which we expect will remain elevated for the foreseeable future." 

Regarding balance sheet strength, Dimon added: "Even after further strengthening
our credit reserves by $2 billion to $30 billion and repaying the $25 billion of
TARP capital, the firm ended the quarter with a very strong Tier 1 Capital ratio
of 9.7% and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 7.7%. With these additions to reserves, we
now have an extremely high loan loss coverage ratio of 5%." 

Dimon further remarked: "Throughout this crisis, we have remained committed to
doing our part to help bring stability to the communities in which we operate
and to the financial system overall. During the quarter, we maintained our
efforts to support economic recovery and to help keep people in their homes. We
continued to lend, extending approximately $150 billion in new credit to
consumer and corporate customers. We approved 138,000 trial mortgage
modifications, bringing total foreclosures prevented since 2007 to 565,000 - a
number we expect to continue to grow." 

Commenting on the second half of 2009, Dimon concluded: "While we do not know if
the economy will deteriorate further, we feel confident that, with our strong
capital and reserve levels and significant earnings power, we can continue to
reinvest in our businesses and do well for our clients, communities and
shareholders over the long term." 

In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a
firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with
GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the
firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded; and for
each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a
tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other
non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of
each line of business, see page 13.

The following discussion compares the second quarter of 2009 with the second
quarter of 2008 unless otherwise noted.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $1.5 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from the prior year.
The results reflected higher net revenue and lower noninterest expense,
partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses. 

Net revenue was $7.3 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion from the prior year.
Investment banking fees were up 29% to a record $2.2 billion and comprised the
following: advisory fees, up 6% to $393 million; equity underwriting fees, up by
$561 million to a record $1.1 billion; and debt underwriting fees, down 10% to
$743 million. Fixed Income Markets revenue was a record $4.9 billion, up by $2.6
billion from the prior year, driven by strong results across all products, as
well as the absence of markdowns related to leveraged lending funded and
unfunded commitments and mortgage-related exposure. The current period had
modest gains on those exposures, compared with losses totaling $1.1 billion in
the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue was offset partially by losses of
$773 million from the tightening of the firm`s credit spread on certain
structured liabilities.Equity Markets revenue was $708 million, down by $371
million, or 34%, reflecting weak trading results and losses of $326 million from
the tightening of the firm`s credit spread on certain structured liabilities,
offset by strong client revenue, particularly in prime services. Credit
Portfolio revenue was a loss of $575 million, down by $914 million, reflecting
mark-to-market losses on hedges of retained loans, partially offset by the net
impact of credit spreads on derivative assets and liabilities and net interest
income on loans. 

The provision for credit losses was $871 million, compared with $398 million in
the prior year, due to higher charge-offs, as well as a higher allowance
reflecting continued deterioration in the credit environment. Net charge-offs
were $433 million, while the increase to the allowance for loan losses was $438
million. The resulting allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained
was 7.91%, compared with 3.44% in the prior year. Nonperforming loans were $3.5
billion, up by $3.2 billion from the prior year and $1.7 billion from the prior
quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $4.1 billion, compared with $4.7 billion in the prior
year.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $15 million, a decrease of $488 million, or 97%, from the prior
year. A higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense were
offset partially by higher net revenue, reflecting the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction. Compared with the prior quarter, net income decreased by
$459 million, or 97%, reflecting a decline in MSR risk management results,
narrower loan spreads and lower loan balances; these effects were offset
partially by higher deposit- related fees, efficiencies related to the
Washington Mutual transaction and wider deposit spreads. 

Net revenue was $8.0 billion, an increase of $2.9 billion, or 56%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $5.0 billion, up by $1.9 billion, or 60%,
reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan spreads,
wider deposit spreads and higher deposit balances, offset partially by lower
loan balances in the heritage Chase portfolio. Noninterest revenue was $2.9
billion, up by $980 million, or 50%, driven by the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction and higher deposit-related fees. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion
from the prior year. Weak economic conditions and housing price declines
continued to drive higher estimated losses for the home equity and mortgage loan
portfolios. The provision included a $1.2 billion addition to the allowance for
loan losses, compared with an addition of $600 million in the prior year and
$1.7 billion in the prior quarter. Home equity net charge-offs were $1.3 billion
(4.61% net charge-off rate2), compared with $511 million (2.16% net charge-off
rate) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $410 million
(11.50% net charge-off rate2), compared with $192 million (4.98% net charge-off
rate) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs were $481 million (3.07%
net charge-off rate2), compared with $104 million (1.08% net charge-off rate) in
the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $4.1 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 52%,
reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher servicing
expense and higher FDIC insurance premiums. 

Retail Banking reported net income of $970 million, up by $296 million, or 44%,
from the prior year. Compared with the prior quarter, net income increased by
$107 million, or 12%, due to higher deposit-related fees, wider deposit spreads,
and efficiencies related to the Washington Mutual transaction. 

Net revenue was $4.5 billion, up by $1.8 billion, or 65%, reflecting the impact
of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider deposit spreads, higher deposit
balances and higher deposit-related fees. 

The provision for credit losses was $361 million, compared with $62 million in
the prior year, reflecting higher estimated losses and an increase in the
allowance for loan losses for Business Banking loans. 

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up by $1.0 billion, or 64%, due to the
impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher FDIC insurance premiums.

 Key Metrics and Business Updates:                                  
 (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  


* Checking accounts totaled 25.3 million, up from 11.3 million in the prior year
(primarily due to the Washington Mutual transaction) and up 1% from the prior
quarter. 
* Average total deposits grew to $348.1 billion, up 63% from the prior year
(primarily due to the Washington Mutual transaction) and 1% from the prior
quarter. 
* Deposit margin was 2.92%, compared with 2.88% in prior year and 2.85% in the
prior quarter. 
* Average Business Banking and other loans were $18.0 billion, and originations
were $578 million. 
* Branch sales of credit cards increased 37% from the prior year and 2% from the
prior quarter. 
* Branch sales of investment products increased 2% from the prior year and 20%
from the prior quarter. 
* Overhead ratio (excluding amortization of core deposit intangibles) was 55%,
compared with 53% in the prior year and 58% in the prior quarter. 
* Number of branches grew to 5,203, up 65% from the prior year, and
substantially flat compared with the prior quarter. 
* Successfully completed the first phase of Washington Mutual deposit
conversions, by migrating nearly 3 million consumer banking and small business
accounts from 341 branches onto the Chase deposit platform.

Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $955 million, compared with a net loss
of $171 million in the prior year and $389 million in the prior quarter.
Compared with the prior quarter, results reflected a decline in MSR risk
management results, narrower loan spreads, lower loan balances and an increase
in reserves for the repurchase of previously-sold loans, partially offset by a
lower provision for credit losses. 

Net revenue was $3.4 billion, up by $1.1 billion, or 45%, from the prior year.
The increase was driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and
wider loan spreads, largely offset by lower loan balances in the heritage Chase
portfolio. Mortgage fees and related income increased due to higher net mortgage
servicing revenue, partially offset by a decline in mortgage production revenue.
Mortgage production revenue was $284 million, down $110 million from the prior
year, as an increase in reserves for the repurchase of previously-sold loans and
markdowns on the mortgage warehouse were offset partially by wider margins on
new originations. Net mortgage servicing revenue (which includes loan servicing
revenue, other changes in fair value and MSR risk management results) was $523
million, an increase of $221 million from the prior year. Loan servicing
revenue, net of other changes in fair value of the MSR asset, was up $191
million, reflecting a 70% growth in third-party loans serviced. MSR risk
management results were $81 million, compared with $51 million in the prior
year. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.5 billion, compared with $1.5 billion in
the prior year, reflecting weakness in the home equity, mortgage and student
loan portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for
credit losses, above, for further detail). 

Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, up by $399 million, or 36%, from the prior

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see notes on page 13for further explanation of
managed basis. 

Discussion of Results:

Net loss was $672 million, a decline of $922 million from the prior year. The
decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by
higher net revenue. 

End-of-period managed loans were $171.5 billion, an increase of $16.1 billion,
or 10%, from the prior year and a decrease of $4.6 billion, or 3%, from the
prior quarter. Average managed loans were $174.1 billion, an increase of $21.3
billion, or 14%, from the prior year and a decrease of $9.3 billion, or 5%, from
the prior quarter. The increases from the prior year in both end-of-period and
average managed loans were predominantly due to the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction, partially offset by lower charge volume and a higher level
of charge-offs. Excluding the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
end-of-period and average managed loans were $148.4 billion and $149.7 billion,
respectively. 

Managed net revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 29%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $4.3 billion, up by $1.3 billion, or
43%, from the prior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction and wider loan spreads. These benefits were offset partially by
higher revenue reversals associated with higher charge-offs and a decreased
level of fees. Noninterest revenue was $557 million, a decrease of $207 million,
or 27%, from the prior year. The decline was driven by an increase in the credit
enhancement for securitization trusts combined with lower securitization income,
partially offset by higher merchant servicing revenue related to the dissolution
of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $4.6 billion, an increase of $2.4
billion from the prior year, reflecting a higher level of charge-offs due to
continued deterioration in the credit environment. The managed net charge-off
rate for the quarter was 10.03%, up from 4.98% in the prior year and 7.72% in
the prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 5.86%, up from 3.46%
in the prior year and down from 6.16% in the prior quarter, reflecting normal
seasonal patterning. Excluding Washington Mutual, the managed net charge-off
rate for the second quarter was 8.97% and the 30-day delinquency rate was 5.27%.


Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $148 million, or 12%, from
the prior year, due to the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint
venture and the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $368 million, an increase of $13 million, or 4%, from the prior
year. Higher net revenue, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction, was predominantly offset by a higher provision for credit losses
and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of $347 million, or 31%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $995 million, up by $272 million, or 38%,
driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. Excluding Washington
Mutual, net interest income was flat compared with the prior year, as wider loan
spreads, a shift to higher-spread liability products and overall growth in
liability balances were offset predominantly by spread compression on liability
products and lower loan balances. Noninterest revenue was $458 million, an
increase of $75 million, or 20%, reflecting the second straight quarter of
record levels of lending- and deposit-related fees. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $772 million, an increase of $64 million,
or 9%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $224
million, a decrease of $4 million, or 2%, from the prior quarter. Record revenue
from Mid-Corporate Banking was $305 million, an increase of $70 million, or 30%,
from the prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $120 million, an
increase of $26 million, or 28%, from the prior year, due to the impact of the
Washington Mutual transaction. 

The provision for credit losses was $312 million, compared with $47 million in
the prior year, reflecting continued deterioration in the credit environment.
The allowance for loan losses to end- of-period loans retained was 2.87%, up
from 2.59% in the prior year and 2.65% in the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans
were $2.1 billion, up by $1.6 billion from the prior year, reflecting the impact
of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher levels of such loans in each
business segment. Compared with the prior quarter, nonperforming loans were up
by $580 million, driven by continued deterioration in the credit environment
across all business segments. Net charge-offs were $181 million (0.67% net
charge-off rate), compared with $49 million (0.28% net charge-off rate) in the
prior year and $134 million (0.48% net charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $535 million, an increase of $59 million, or 12%, from
the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and
higher FDIC insurance premiums offset partially by lower headcount-related
expense.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $379 million, a decrease of $46 million, or 11%, from the prior
year, driven by lower net revenue offset partially by lower noninterest expense.
Compared with the prior quarter, net income increased by $71 million, or 23%,
reflecting seasonal activity in securities lending and depositary receipts as
well as the effect of market appreciation on assets under custody. 

Net revenue was $1.9 billion, a decrease of $119 million, or 6%, from the prior
year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $966 million, a decrease of
$148 million, or 13%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by the effect
of market depreciation on assets under custody and lower securities lending
balances, primarily as a result of declines in asset valuations and demand.
Treasury Services net revenue was $934 million, an increase of $29 million, or
3%, reflecting growth across cash management products and higher trade revenue
driven by wider spreads, partially offset by spread compression on deposit
products. TSS firmwide net revenue, which includes net revenue recorded in other
lines of business, was $2.6 billion, a decrease of $79 million, or 3%, compared
with the prior year, primarily due to declines in Worldwide Securities Services.
Treasury Services firmwide net revenue grew to $1.7 billion, an increase of $69
million, or 4%, from the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $5 million, compared with an
expense of $7 million in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $29 million, reflecting
lower headcount-related expense, partially offset by higher FDIC insurance
premiums.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $352 million, a decrease of $43 million, or 11%, from the prior
year, due to lower net revenue and higher provision for credit losses offset
partially by lower noninterest expense. Compared with the prior quarter, net
income increased by $128 million, or 57%, driven by higher valuations of seed
capital investments, higher brokerage fees and the effect of improved market
levels. 

Net revenue was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $82 million, or 4%, from the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $135 million, or 8%,
due to the effect of lower market levels and lower placement fees; these effects
were offset partially by higher valuations of seed capital investments. Net
interest income was $414 million, up by $53 million, or 15%, from the prior
year, predominantly due to wider loan and deposit spreads and higher deposit
balances. 

Private Bank revenue decreased by 10% to $640 million due to the effect of lower
market levels and lower placement fees, largely offset by wider loan and deposit
spreads. Institutional revenue increased by 3% to $487 million due to higher
valuations of seed capital investments, largely offset by the effect of lower
market levels. Retail revenue decreased by 16% to $411 million due to the effect
of lower market levels and net equity outflows, partially offset by higher
valuations of seed capital investments. Private Wealth Management revenue
decreased by 6% to $334 million due to the effect of lower market levels and
narrower deposit spreads. Bear Stearns Private Client Services contributed $110
million to revenue. 

Assets under supervision were $1.5 trillion, a decrease of $68 billion, or 4%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, a decrease of
$14 billion, or 1%, from the prior year. The decreases were due to the effect of
lower market levels and outflows from non-liquidity products, predominantly
offset by liquidity product inflows. Custody, brokerage, administration and
deposit balances were $372 billion, down $54 billion, due to the effect of lower
market levels on brokerage and custody balances, partially offset by brokerage
inflows in the Private Bank. 

The provision for credit losses was $59 million, an increase of $42 million from
the prior year, reflecting continued deterioration in the credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $46 million, or 3%, from the
prior year due to lower performance-based compensation and lower
headcount-related expense, largely offset by the impact of the Bear Stearns
merger and higher FDIC insurance premiums.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see notes on page 13 for further explanation
of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was $25,623 million, $25,025
million, and $18,399 million for the second quarter of 2009, first quarter of
2009 and second quarter of 2008, respectively. 

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $2.7 billion, an increase of $718 million, or 36%, from the prior
year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue, predominantly
offset by a higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. 

Managed net revenue was $27.7 billion, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 41%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.0 billion, up by $3.5 billion, or
37%. The increase was driven by higher principal transactions, higher lending-
and deposit-related fees, and record Investment Banking fees; these were offset
partially by the effect of lower market levels on fees and commission revenue.
Net interest income was $14.7 billion, up by $4.5 billion, or 45%, due to the
impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan spreads and higher
investment- and trading-related net interest income. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $9.7 billion, up by $5.4 billion,
from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit losses was
$8.5 billion, compared with $3.8 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher
net charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for credit losses, largely
related to home lending. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $7.0 billion,
compared with $2.9 billion in the prior year, resulting in managed net
charge-off rates of 6.18%2 and 3.08%, respectively. The wholesale provision for
credit losses was $1.2 billion, compared with $505 million in the prior year,
reflecting an increase in the allowance for credit losses, largely in the
Investment Bank. Wholesale net charge-offs were $679 million, compared with net
charge-offs of $41 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates
of 1.19% and 0.08%, respectively. The firm`s nonperforming assets totaled $17.5
billion at June 30, 2009, up from the prior-year level of $6.2 billion. 

Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion, up by $1.3 billion, or 11%, from the
prior year. The increase was driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction, a $675 million (pretax) FDIC special assessment and higher FDIC
insurance premiums.

1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:

a. In addition to analyzing the firm`s results on a reported basis, management
analyzes the firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a
managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm`s definition of
managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the
following adjustments. 

First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of
credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit
losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services
results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been
securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance
sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same
manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan
Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and
overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio.
Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as
employees and capital, based on managed financial information. In addition, the
same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans
on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in
the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the
ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their
credit cards; accordingly, the customer`s credit performance will affect both
the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan
Chase believes managed-basis information is useful to investors, enabling them
to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the
balance sheet and the firm`s retained interests in securitized loans. 

Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each
of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax
credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the
comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The
corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income
tax expense. 

See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase`s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (second
quarter 2009) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase`s income statement from a
reported basis to a managed basis. 

b. Tier 1 Common Capital ("Tier 1 Common") is calculated, for all purposes, as
Tier 1 Capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust
preferred securities, and qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries. 

c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total
net revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into
consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate
the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective
competitors. 

2 Coverage Ratio: Allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes
purchased credit-impaired loans and loans from the Washington Mutual Master
Trust, which were consolidated on the Firm's balance sheet at fair value during
the second quarter of 2009. No allowance for loan losses was recorded for these
loans at June 30, 2009.

 (b) Effective January 1, 2009, the Firm adopted FSP EITF 03-6-1. Accordingly, prior period numbers have been revised as required. For further discussion of this FSP, see page 36 of JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement.                               
 (c) The calculation of second quarter 2009 earnings per share includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share, resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital.                                                                             
 (d) Ratios are based upon annualized amounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 (e) The calculation of second quarter and year-to-date 2009 net income applicable to common equity includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. Excluding this reduction the adjusted ROE and ROE-GW were 6% and 10% for the second quarter 2009 , respectively, and 6% and 9% for the year-to-date, respectively. The Firm views the adjusted ROE and ROE-GW, non-GAAP financial measures, as meaningful because it increases the comparability to prior 
 periods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (f) Net income applicable to common equity divided by total average common equity (net of goodwill). The Firm uses return on equity less goodwill, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of the Firm. The Firm utilizes this measure to facilitate comparisons to competitors.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - Barclays Plc (BARC.L) named a
Goldman Sachs (GS.N) veteran to its board on Thursday on the day
a major review into UK corporate governance called for more
banking expertise on bank's boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Britain's second biggest bank said Reuben Jeffery III, who
served in the U.S. government as Under Secretary of State for
Economic, Energy and Agricultural Affairs from 2007 until
earlier this year, will join its board immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeffery, 55, spent 18 years at Goldman, including as
managing partner in Paris from 1997 to 2001 and head of its
European financial institutions group in London from 1992 to
1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Yale and Stanford graduate left Goldman to become
special adviser on Lower Manhattan Development after the
September 2001 attacks in New York and held other government
positions under George W. Bush's administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2005, he became chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. He is a senior advisor at the Center for
Strategic  International Studies in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Walker Report on corporate governance, released on
Thursday, said banks should recruit more non-executives with
banking experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A government review six years ago called for broader and
more diverse bank boards, but the financial crisis prompted
criticism that boards lacked relevant experience, with Royal
Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), HBOS and Northern Rock all chaired by
non-bankers. [ID:nLAG003603]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays also named Richard Broadbent as its deputy
chairman, replacing Nigel Rudd, who retired from the post in
April. Broadbent has been on the bank's board since 2003.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, July 16 (Reuters) - Chinese stocks, which
have heralded global market rebounds, may rise further as ample
liquidity chases high-yield assets in the improving economy, but
the government should take action to avoid price bubbles, Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) strategist Thomas Deng said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Confidence is back. Liquidity is abundant. Overseas money is
chasing China assets through various channels," Deng, managing
director of Asia-Pacific Investment Research, said in a media
briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The concern is that China may turn emergency measures into
long-term policies. The government should tighten liquidity if
economic growth reaches its target or on obvious signs of
inflation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deng declined to give a forecast for China stocks listed in
Hong Kong or the mainland, but said valuations were not yet
excessive. He added that banking, property and consumer-related
stocks were still worth buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC has jumped
more than 70 percent this year following a 65 percent tumble in
2008, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index .HSCE, which
tracks Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies, has surged nearly 40
percent so far this year. The rise was fuelled by a surge in
lending and signs of economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's economic growth accelerated to 7.9 percent in the
second quarter from 6.1 percent in the first three months, as the
country recovered from the global recession with the help of
powerful fiscal and monetary stimulus measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China would overtake Japan as the world's second-biggest
economy after the United States late this year or sometime next
year, said Deng, who forecast China's economy to grow 8.3 percent
this year and 10.9 percent in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government's 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) stimulus
package is starting to trigger private sector investment,
domestic consumption is rising faster than expected, and exports
may expand 7 to 9 percent next year as the global economy
stabilises, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corporate profits will rise as profit margins may have
already bottomed out, Deng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He projected that earnings per share for Chinese companies
listed in China and Hong Kong may fall 5 percent on average in
2008, and rise 20 percent next year.
 "China is a relative bright spot in the world," Deng said.
"Investors should buy stocks that would benefit from rising
domestic demand in China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's vehicle market is staging a stronger-than-expected
rebound, and will benefit from rising disposable incomes in
second- and third-tier cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Real estate developers were starting to acquire land again
after clearing inventories, and a revival of the property sector
would prompt investment and consumption, Deng said.
Future growth in China's economy could gain strength from
further deregulation of its service industries, and more balanced
development in coastal and hinterland regions, he added.

&lt;p&gt; * Journalistic 'icon'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * 'Honest, straightforward reporting'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Joined CBS in 1950
 (Adds Obama, Bush statements)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michelle Nichols&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - Former CBS News anchor Walter
Cronkite, whose authoritative delivery of news events from the
John F. Kennedy assassination to the Apollo moon landing and
Vietnam War, made him "the most trusted man in America," died
on Friday at age 92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cronkite died in New York after an illness, CBS said. His
family issued a statement weeks ago that he had been suffering
for some years with cerebrovascular disease and was not
expected to recuperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His death coincided with the 40th anniversary of the Apollo
11 mission, which took the first astronauts to the moon.
Cronkite was a passionate chronicler of the space program and
anniversary celebrations of Apollo 11 have featured frequent
rebroadcasts of his coverage of the historic moon landing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He was the consummate television newsman," said Don
Hewitt, a longtime CBS News executive and creator of the
long-running "60 Minutes" news program. "He had all the
credentials to be a writer, an editor, a broadcaster. There was
only one Walter Cronkite and there may never be another one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Barack Obama said Cronkite "was someone we could
trust to guide us through the most important issues of the day;
a voice of certainty in an uncertain world. He was family. He
invited us to believe in him, and he never let us down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former President George W. Bush called Cronkite "an icon of
American journalism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For nearly 20 years, millions of Americans tuned in to the
"CBS Evening News" to hear the day's major events as reported
by Cronkite, whose avuncular manner and deep voice made his
show the top-rated news program from 1969 until he retired in
1981 and was replaced by Dan Rather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cronkite's demeanor inspired the nickname "Uncle Walter"
and when he signed off his newscasts by saying, "And that's the
way it is," few doubted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During his years at the CBS anchor desk, Cronkite was
regularly voted the "most trusted man in America" in opinion
polls. Senator Robert Kennedy was so impressed he asked
Cronkite to run for public office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't understand my impact or success," Cronkite once
said. "That my delivery is straight, even dull at times, is
probably a valid criticism. But I built my reputation on
honest, straightforward reporting. To do anything else would be
phony."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writing in a blog on www.huffingtonpost.com in March 2006,
Cronkite explained his signature "the way it is" signoff by
saying, "To me, that encapsulates the newsman's highest ideal:
to report the facts as he sees them, without regard for the
consequences or controversy that may ensue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Born Nov. 4, 1916, in St. Joseph, Missouri, Walter Leland
Cronkite Jr. became a United Press correspondent in 1939. He
was one of the first journalists accredited to American forces
after the United States entered World War Two in 1941.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cronkite flew on the first bombing raids over Germany,
parachuting into the Netherlands with the 101st Airborne
Division and landing with Allied troops at Normandy, but he
never thought himself brave in World War Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Personally, I feel I was an overweening coward in the
war," he once said. "I was scared to death all the time. I did
everything possible to avoid getting into combat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'IF I'VE LOST CRONKITE ...'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cronkite joined CBS News in 1950 and hosted public affairs
programs. In 1953, he began narrating the long-running "You Are
There" series, which recreated historical events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He took over the CBS anchor chair on April 16, 1962, and
his stirring reports on issues from the space program to the
Vietnam War often had as much impact as the events themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cronkite grew teary and his voice cracked as he told the
nation in 1963 that President Kennedy had been assassinated in
Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After watching the bloody 1968 Tet Offensive in Vietnam, a
disillusioned Cronkite told his viewers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of
American leaders, both in Vietnam and in Washington, to have
faith any longer in the silver linings they find in the darkest
clouds. ... It seems now more than ever that the bloody
experience of Vietnam is to end in stalemate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cronkite said in 2006 the Tet report was his favorite story
and many believe it led President Lyndon Johnson not to seek
re-election in 1968. Johnson was quoted as saying, "If I've
lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he retired from the anchor job, Cronkite had expected
to still get special assignments and projects from CBS and was
disappointed it did not work out that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cronkite, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom
in 1981, spent his later years making documentaries, writing
books, giving speeches and exercising his passion for sailing.
He also campaigned against global warming and spoke out against
the Iraq war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cronkite's wife of 64 years, Betsy, died in 2005 from
cancer. They had three children.

&lt;p&gt; * Icahn says search deal would enhance shareholder value&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Icahn supports Yahoo CEO Bartz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexei Oreskovic and Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE, July 17 (Reuters) - Activist
investor Carl Icahn spoke out in favor of a search deal between
Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), as talks
between the two companies appeared to regain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn declined to comment on the state of any negotiations
between Yahoo and Microsoft. He had tried to broker a
partnership between the two companies last year, when talks on
Microsoft's $47.5 billion takeover bid for Yahoo fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I've been a strong advocate of getting a search deal done
with Microsoft," Icahn, who owns about 5 percent of Yahoo and
is a director on its board, told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It would enhance value if a deal got done, because of the
synergies involved," he said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and Yahoo are close to a long-discussed search
and online advertising deal, which could be announced in the
next week, according to another source familiar with the matter
who is not associated with Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news was first reported by the AllThingsDigital blog,
which said a deal would involve Microsoft paying Yahoo several
billion dollars upfront to take over its search advertising
business and guarantee certain payments back to Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies have talked about cooperating for months,
after Microsoft's bid to buy Yahoo was rebuffed last year and
Yahoo's attempt to seal a search advertising deal with Google
Inc (GOOG.O) fell apart under regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz said in May that any deal
to spin off or combine its search assets will require a partner
with "boatloads of money." She said at the time that Yahoo was
talking "a little bit" with Microsoft, but gave no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bartz is currently out of the office for two weeks,
following knee replacement surgery, according to an email that
she sent to her employees earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn, whose firm had a 5.4 percent stake in Yahoo as of
March 31, said he remains a "strong supporter" of Bartz, who
took the reins in January from Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bartz has made a number of changes since joining Yahoo,
including shutting down underperforming websites and laying off
5 percent of the Sunnyvale, California company's staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But many investors continue to see a deal with Microsoft as
Yahoo's best option, saying it will cut costs and create an
online entity big enough to better compete with Google, the top
search company in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest discussions involve a partnership in which
Microsoft would handle search capabilities for Yahoo, while
Yahoo could potentially handle online advertising for the two
online sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Kara Swisher, co-executive editor of
AllThingsDigital, a group of high-powered Microsoft online
executives flew to Silicon Valley on Thursday to iron out
remaining issues related to technology deployment. They
included Senior Vice President of Online Audience Business
Group Yusuf Mehdi, search head Satya Nadella, top digital
executive Qi Lu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives for Microsoft and Yahoo declined to
comment. Yahoo is scheduled to report quarterly results next
Tuesday, and Microsoft on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft withdrew its $47.5 billion offer to buy Yahoo in
May 2008 after Yahoo's board said the price was too low. The
software giant then offered to buy Yahoo's search advertising
assets for $1 billion upfront, and guarantee $2.3 billion in
annual revenue for five years, in a proposal backed by Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google is the dominant player in the search market, with a
65 percent market share in June, according to comScore. Yahoo
was second with 19.6 percent, while Microsoft was third with
8.4 percent. While Microsoft's share remains small, its new
search engine Bing has won positive early reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nasdaq, Yahoo finished Friday's regular trading session
up 4 percent at $16.84 while Microsoft closed 0.6 percent lower
at $24.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic and Bill Rigby; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles Federal Court Judge Philip Gutierrez's ruling prohibits Televisa from broadcasting TV programs over the Web in the United States that it has already licensed to Univision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit had centered on how to interpret a clause in a 1992 program license agreement that originally dealt with the spillover of Televisa's broadcast signal across the U.S.-Mexico border into Univision's licensed territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa executives had argued that the 1992 contract did not contemplate Internet distribution, and subsequent amendments and technological advances allow it to transmit programing via satellite into the U.S. as long as it originates in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Univision said it is exploring its legal options in order to provide such content to its own audience over the Internet in the U.S. in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Univision and Televisa have conceded that potential advertising revenue from Internet streaming of programs is not significant at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However a PriceWaterhouseCoopers study shows that Internet advertising is expected to grow by double-digit percentages over the next four years to about $40 billion in U.S. markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Yinka Adegoke; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed out their best week in four months on Friday on a flat note as strong earnings from IBM (IBM.N) softened the blow of disappointing results from General Electric Co (GE.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), the world's largest technology services provider, rose 4.3 percent to $115.42 and pushed the Dow slightly higher after boosting its profit outlook for the year after the close on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fellow Dow components GE and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) reined in the blue-chip average's gains as Bank of America's soaring credit losses, along with GE's unexpected drop in revenue, curbed recovery optimism after promising earnings and data earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With companies such as Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) posting strong quarterly results earlier in the week, investors had been eager to see some consistency from other bellwether names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some optimism was priced into the earnings already after Goldman had a good quarter and the financials rallied," said Kevin Kruszenski, head of listed trading at KeyBanc Capital Markets in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market has moved 7 percent this week, so it's time for a breather," Kruszenski added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 32.12 points, or 0.37 percent, to 8,743.94. But the Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX dipped just 0.36 of a point, or 0.04 percent, to 940.38. And the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 1.58 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,886.61.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAJOR INDEXES UP 7 PCT FOR THE WEEK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three major U.S. stock indexes recorded their best week since mid-March, as both the Dow and the SP 500 snapped four-week losing streaks. This week's gains marked the resumption of the rally from March 9, when the SP 500 hit a 12-year closing low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week, the Dow rose 7.3 percent, the SP 500 gained 7 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 7.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE's profit dropped nearly 50 percent as the slump that burdened its finance and media businesses spread to its industrial units, prompting Chief Executive Jeff Immelt to cut profit views for those parts of the company. The conglomerate's quarterly revenue fell 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE's stock shed 6.1 percent to $11.65 and led the SP Industrials index .GSPI down 1.5 percent to 194.85. The stock was the Dow's top percentage decliner while the industrials index was the worst performer among SP sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet search giant Google Inc (GOOG.O) fell 2.8 percent to $430.25 on Nasdaq after a slump in advertising spending took a toll on Google's quarterly revenue growth, overshadowing results that topped Wall Street's forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Citigroup Inc (C.N) fell 0.3 percent, or just 1 penny, to $3.02, erasing slight gains made after it announced results. The big U.S. banking company relied on a gain from its Smith Barney deal with Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THREADS OF HOPE FOR CIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of CIT Group Inc (CIT.N) surged nearly 71 percent to 70 cents and ranked among the most actively traded names on the New York Stock Exchange on reports the small business lender, which has a sizable clientele among fashion labels and retailers, was in talks with JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs Inc (GS.N) about short-term financing as it seeks to avoid bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helping sentiment was new data that showed U.S. housing starts and building permits jumped more than expected in June, propelled by a surge in single-family home starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 climbed as much as 40 percent from its 12-year closing low hit in early March before the run-up stalled in June. But the index has recovered from about a 7 percent loss since June's peak, based on an upbeat start to second-quarter earnings season, and is now up 39 percent from the March low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume was light on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1.29 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.49 billion, while on the Nasdaq, about 1.91 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declining stocks slightly outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,498 to 1,469, while on the Nasdaq, about three stocks fell for every two that rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc (CIT.N) is in talks with JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) about short-term financing as it looks for ways to avoid bankruptcy, a source close to the company said on Friday, sending the lender's shares and bonds up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bankruptcy, however, is still possible over the next few days, and CIT, a 101-year-old lender that services nearly one million small- and mid-sized businesses, is continuing to talk with regulators about the situation, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financing talks have turned primarily to arranging for a debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan for the lender in case of a bankruptcy, CNBC reported, adding that talks were also continuing for financing out of court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were in talks with other banks about a DIP loan, Bloomberg reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, CIT's bondholders were going to hold another conference call on Saturday, a source in the lender's bondholder group said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They haven't thrown the towel, and they still are trying to work very hard to get some sort of funding, but at the end of the day I still think that there is a very high risk of a bankruptcy event," said Sameer Gokhale, an analyst at KBW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIT is in search of $2 billion to $3 billion of financing, according to the source, who declined to be identified because the talks were private. The company also is in talks with bondholders about a debt for equity swap, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the source in the bondholders' group said many bondholders were pursuing a "debt for new debt" exchange and that a debt for equity exchange was not a real consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first source added one potential scenario is a sale of some assets to raise capital. The lender had wanted regulators' permission to transfer assets to its bank unit, but that did not happen, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is just going to allow them to pass the next 30 to 60 days, but they have exhausted their balance sheet condition so fast that it was kind of breathtaking," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares moderated early gains and closed up 29 cents, or 71 percent, at 70 cents, after more than doubling their price amid hopes of financing. The company lost 75 percent of its market value on Thursday as government talks for financing collapsed and bankruptcy loomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor's said on Friday that it was removing CIT from its SP 500 .SPX market index as of July 24 after the close of trade, replacing it with software maker Red Hat Inc (RHT.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIT's credit default swaps rose to about 51 percent as an upfront cost on Friday afternoon, according to Markit Intraday data, up from about 44 percent on Friday morning and up from about 48 percent late on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price of CIT's floating-rate notes due in August rose to 71.5 cents on the dollar in busy trading, from about 61 cents late on Thursday, according to MarketAxess, helped by news about the negotiations with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, bond fund manager Sean Simko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIMITED OPTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company sought additional help even after gaining the status of bank holding company in December so it could draw $2.33 billion of taxpayer money from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Obama administration declined help, saying it had set high standards for granting aid to companies and leaving private investors as the one alternative to avoid collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of CIT's demise would likely pale by comparison with the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers Inc LEHMQ.PK last September, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they can't survive, the market will resolve this for them and move on. I don't see massive systematic disruptions if CIT will not exist three months from now," Wirtz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the ripples of a collapse could be widespread and worsen the effects of the economic downturn for some firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIT has about $40 billion of long-term debt, according to independent research firm CreditSights. About $1.1 billion of debt will come due in August, followed by about $2.5 billion by year end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Post reported JPMorgan could acquire CIT's factoring unit, which finances more than $50 billion of wholesale inventory, at a time of the year when the collapse of the lender could disrupt retailers holidays plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIT declined to comment and JPMorgan was not available for comment. But analysts cooled expectations of an asset sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has some valuable franchises, but if they sell the assets in a distressed situation, they don't even get the par value for the assets. They will have to take losses and those losses will further weaken the balance sheet, so that doesn't seem to be a viable strategy," Gokhale said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Juan Lagorio; additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak, Burton Frierson, John Parry, Jennifer Ablan and Phil Wahba; editing by Leslie Gevirtz, Andre Grenon and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

adds CIT Group talks in new paragraph 14 )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed out their
best week in four months on Friday on a flat note as strong
earnings from IBM (IBM.N) softened the blow of disappointing
results from General Electric Co (GE.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), the world's
largest technology services provider, rose 4.3 percent to
$115.42 and pushed the Dow slightly higher after boosting its
profit outlook for the year after the close on Thursday.
[ID:nN16369660]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But fellow Dow components GE and Bank of America Corp
(BAC.N) reined in the blue-chip average's gains as Bank of
America's soaring credit losses, along with GE's unexpected
drop in revenue, curbed recovery optimism after promising
earnings and data earlier in the week. [ID:nSP533186]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With companies such as Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Goldman
Sachs Group (GS.N) posting strong quarterly results earlier in
the week, investors had been eager to see some consistency
from other bellwether names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some optimism was priced into the earnings already after
Goldman had a good quarter and the financials rallied," said
Kevin Kruszenski, head of listed trading at KeyBanc Capital
Markets in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market has moved 7 percent this week, so it's time for
a breather," Kruszenski added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 32.12
points, or 0.37 percent, to 8,743.94. But the Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX dipped just 0.36 of a point, or 0.04
percent, to 940.38. And the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC
added 1.58 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,886.61.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MAJOR INDEXES UP 7 PCT FOR THE WEEK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three major U.S. stock indexes recorded their best
week since mid-March, as both the Dow and the SP 500 snapped
four-week losing streaks. This week's gains marked the
resumption of the rally from March 9, when the SP 500 hit a
12-year closing low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the week, the Dow rose 7.3 percent, the SP 500 gained
7 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 7.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GE's profit dropped nearly 50 percent as the slump that
burdened its finance and media businesses spread to its
industrial units, prompting Chief Executive Jeff Immelt to cut
profit views for those parts of the company. The
conglomerate's quarterly revenue fell 17 percent.
[ID:nN17269520]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GE's stock shed 6.1 percent to $11.65 and led the SP
Industrials index .GSPI down 1.5 percent to 194.85. The
stock was the Dow's top percentage decliner while the
industrials index was the worst performer among SP sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Internet search giant Google Inc (GOOG.O) fell 2.8 percent
to $430.25 on Nasdaq after a slump in advertising spending
took a toll on Google's quarterly revenue growth,
overshadowing results that topped Wall Street's forecasts.
[ID:nN16436531]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elsewhere, Citigroup Inc (C.N) fell 0.3 percent, or just 1
penny, to $3.02, erasing slight gains made after it announced
results. The big U.S. banking company relied on a gain from
its Smith Barney deal with Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to turn a
profit. [ID:nSP533186]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THREADS OF HOPE FOR CIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of CIT Group Inc (CIT.N) surged nearly 71 percent
to 70 cents and ranked among the most actively traded names on
the New York Stock Exchange on reports the small business
lender, which has a sizable clientele among fashion labels and
retailers, was in talks with JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and
Goldman Sachs Inc (GS.N) about short-term financing as it
seeks to avoid bankruptcy. [ID:nN17353363]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helping sentiment was new data that showed U.S. housing
starts and building permits jumped more than expected in June,
propelled by a surge in single-family home starts.
[ID:nN16425610]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 climbed as much as 40 percent from its 12-year
closing low hit in early March before the run-up stalled in
June. But the index has recovered from about a 7 percent loss
since June's peak, based on an upbeat start to second-quarter
earnings season, and is now up 39 percent from the March low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volume was light on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1.29
billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated
daily average of 1.49 billion, while on the Nasdaq, about 1.91
billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.28
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining stocks slightly outnumbered advancing ones on
the NYSE by 1,498 to 1,469, while on the Nasdaq, about three
stocks fell for every two that rose.

US Bancorp - "Best Bank in the U.S."

On July 14, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) announced that it has been awarded the
"Best Bank in the U.S." by Euromoney magazine as part of its 2009 Awards for
Excellence. U.S. Bancorp's healthy performance during the economic turbulence in
2008 was lauded by the publication. As a leading financial markets magazine,
Euromoney has been picking out the top performers in finance since 1992. 

In May of this year, the Federal Reserve concluded that U.S. Bancorp did not
need any additional capital buffer. The decision came after estimating the
adequacy of the company's capital base under a hypothetical two-year scenario
that involved economic conditions more adverse than actually expected. 

Besides U.S. Bancorp, the other banks not required by the Federal Reserve to
raise capital included American Express (NYSE: AXP) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:
GS). However, banks such as Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB) and Wells Fargo
(NYSE: WFC) were asked to raise capital.

 (Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed out their
best week in four months on Friday on a flat note as strong
earnings from IBM (IBM.N) softened the blow of disappointing
results from General Electric Co (GE.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), the world's
largest technology services provider, rose 4.3 percent to
$115.42 and pushed the Dow slightly higher after boosting its
profit outlook for the year after the close on Thursday.
[ID:nN16369660]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But fellow Dow components GE and Bank of America Corp
(BAC.N) reined in the blue-chip average's gains as Bank of
America's soaring credit losses, along with GE's unexpected
drop in revenue, curbed recovery optimism after promising
earnings and data earlier in the week. [ID:nSP533186]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With companies such as Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Goldman
Sachs Group (GS.N) posting strong quarterly results earlier in
the week, investors had been eager to see some consistency
from other bellwether names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some optimism was priced into the earnings already after
Goldman had a good quarter and the financials rallied," said
Kevin Kruszenski, head of listed trading at KeyBanc Capital
Markets in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market has moved 7 percent this week, so it's time
for a breather," Kruszenski added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three major U.S. stock indexes recorded their best
week since mid-March, as both the Dow and the SP 500 snapped
four-week losing streaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the week, the Dow rose 7.3 percent, the SP 500 gained

[ID:nN17269520]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 32.12
points, or 0.37 percent, to 8,743.94. But the Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX dipped just 0.36 of a point, or 0.04
percent, to 940.38. And the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC
added 1.58 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,886.61.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GE's stock shed 6.1 percent to $11.65 and led the SP
Industrials index .GSPI down 1.5 percent to 194.85. The
stock was the Dow's top percentage decliner while the

 (Updates to afternoon, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little
changed on Friday, as stronger quarterly earnings from IBM Corp
(IBM.N) offset disappointing results from bellwether companies
like General Electric Co (GE.N) and Bank of America Corp
(BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N)  was the top
performer on the Dow, up 3.6 percent to $114.67 after sharply
lifting its full-year earnings outlook and reporting a
stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit after the close on
Thursday.  [ID:nN16369660]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But fellow Dow components GE and Bank of America kept a cap
on gains as a surge in Bank of America's credit losses, along
with an unexpected drop in GE's revenue, curbed recovery
optimism after promising earnings and data earlier in the week.
[ID:nSP533186]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market today is somewhat yawning because it's already
built in -- it's a little anti-climactic given the rally that's
occurred," said Matt Kaufler, portfolio manager and equity
analyst at Clover Capital Management in Rochester, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three major U.S. stock indexes are on track for their

commentary coming out from certain areas," added Kaufler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 17.98
points, or 0.21 percent, to 8,729.80. The Standard  Poor's 500

&lt;p&gt;The agreement required blogger Michael Morgan to post a disclaimer on his goldmansachs666.com website, saying it has no affiliation with the financial firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan, a Florida investment adviser, uses his blog -- whose name combines Goldman's name with numbers used to evoke connotations with the devil -- to criticize the bank and its large profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank this week posted a 33 percent increase in quarterly earnings on blowout trading results, putting its employees on pace for big bonuses at a time when many Americans are struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman attorney had sent Morgan a cease-and-desist letter in April, contending he was violating the firm's intellectual property rights by using its trademark.

&lt;p&gt; * Conditions include divesting some animal health opns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. regulatory approval still pending
 (Adds details, Pfizer comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, July 17 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust
authorities cleared U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) $68
billion takeover of rival Wyeth WYE.N on Friday, subject to
Pfizer's divesting a number of animal health operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The commission had concerns that the transaction, as
originally notified, would have raised competition issues in
the field of animal health products on a number of national
markets," the European Commission said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the light of the commitments offered by Pfizer, the
commission has now concluded that the proposed transaction
would not significantly impede effective competition in the EEA
(Eurpean Economic Area) or any substantial part of it," it
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said in response that it expected to close the deal
at the end of the third quarter or during the fourth. It also
said China's Ministry of Commerce had extended its review of
Pfizer's submission beyond the initial 30-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The transaction remains subject to regulatory approval in
the United States and in certain other jurisdictions and also
needs clearance from Wyeth shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Commission concluded that the two companies'
activities were largely complementary in human health but
raised competition concerns in animal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer therefore proposed divesting a number of vaccine
areas, sedatives, antibiotics and parasiticides and, in medical
feed additives, oral rehydration salts. It also offered to
divest Wyeth's manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have said the acquisition by Pfizer, the world's
largest drugmaker, would help the company diversify into
vaccines and injectable biologic medicines, seen as more immune
to generic products than traditional pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is expected to see sales impacted when its
blockbuster cholesterol treatment Lipitor begins to face U.S.
generic competition in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has forecast an earnings boost in the second full
year after closing the Wyeth deal, with cost savings estimated
at $4 billion by the third year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Double click on the newslinks below for the relevant

&lt;p&gt;DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) management is focused on reducing company debt, increasing the likelihood of an equity or equity-linked raising of capital within six months to a year, a J.P. Morgan analyst said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford appears "intensely focused" on addressing a $10.5 billion revolving credit that matures in December 2011 and would not be expected to wait to the last minute, Himanshu Patel said in a note to clients that referenced a visit with Ford management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see an equity raise within the next six to 12 months," Patel said in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford declined to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing the revolver is a positive for Ford's long-term survival odds, but raises the odds of material equity dilution of about 20 percent sooner rather than later, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan also expects a "meaningful" second-quarter earnings beat for Ford due to improved pricing in North America and Europe and sequential production improvement in both regions, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse also believes Ford could report a significant upside surprise in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan believes Ford will be able to roll at least part of the revolver into a new secured facility and is focused on overall debt, not a single maturity, raising the odds of an equity or equity-linked raise of capital, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford "seems fully cognizant of" its relatively riskier capital structure compared with the new General Motors Co, Patel said. GM emerged from bankruptcy with significantly less debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As such, we think Ford has its eyes on delevering, not just terming out maturities," Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford could consider initially raising longer-term debt financing, which with likely better-than-expected second-quarter and third-quarter earnings, could allow shares to rally and permit tapping equity markets to repay debt, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford could address the revolver through $3 billion of refinanced secured debt, $2 billion of excess Energy Department funds, $2 billion of free cash flow in 2011 and $3.5 billion of capital through an equity or equity-linked raise, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford shares were unchanged on the day at $6.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Bailey; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOLLYWOOD, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola`s famous curvy contour bottle is now available in 2-liter packages in
stores throughout Florida. Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE:CCE) recently introduced
the innovative bottle to the Florida market, which is one of several
Southeastern markets to roll out the convenient two-liter version of the iconic
package. After successful pilots in Birmingham, AL and Chattanooga, TN, the
curvy bottle was rolled out in multiple southern cities in 2008 and in
Philadelphia in May. 

The new two-liter form of Coca-Cola`s famous package was preferred over the
straight wall two-liter bottle overwhelmingly in consumer tests* and offers a
significant advantage beyond its classic good looks - it is also easier to hold
and easier to pour. All Coca-Cola trademark brands will be available in the new
two-liter contour package, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Caffeine
Free Coca-Cola and Caffeine Free Diet Coke. Consumer research conducted by
Coca-Cola North America (CCNA) suggests that the two-liter contour package has
the potential to re-energize sparkling beverage sales in their stores**. 

"We want to offer our brands to consumers in a special way that fits their
needs, and that includes sharing Coca-Cola products from a contour bottle," said
Carl Leroux, Vice President of Sales Operations. "Consumers love this package
innovation, and I`m proud of the partnership CCE and CCNA demonstrated in
bringing the contour bottle to our customers and consumers." 

Nearly 92 years after its creation, the contour bottle remains a symbol of
innovation, instantly differentiating the world's best known sparkling beverage
from all other products. Widely recognized as a pioneering example of
package-driven branding, the contour bottle is one of the few packages to ever
receive a trademark from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Leveraging
Coca-Cola`s iconic shape to further differentiate its two-liter package is one
part of the Coke system`s ongoing efforts to revitalize the sparkling beverage
category. The contour PET bottle and cap are both completely recyclable.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, July 17 (Reuters) - Giant Mexican media
company Televisa is exploring a new venture in Spain and will
soon launch a regional sports channel as part of its
fast-growing pay television business, a senior executive said
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Alfonso de Angoitia, Televisa's (TV.N) executive vice
president, told analysts during a conference call that the
company is also planning to produce a widely popular soap opera
in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Spain, where Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) holds a stake in
television company La Sexta, the Mexican company has not ruled
out La Sexta joining forces with top media conglomerate Grupo
Prisa, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Imagina, our partner in La Sexta, is in negotiations with
Grupo Prisa ... for a potential combination of La Sexta with
Prisa's Channel Four (Cuatro)," De Angoitia said. He added that
an agreement could be reached in the second half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa is the world's leading Spanish-language content
producer and its name is synonymous with tear-jerking soap
operas popular among Russian and Argentine audiences alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is preparing to tape its "La Fea Mas Bella" hit
soap in Brazil. The show is one of its most widely-seen dramas
in Mexico and currently running on its third season in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jose Baston, president of television and content, told
analysts that Televisa's new cable sports-only network is due
to launch in August, as it continues to strengthen its presence
in the pay television market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new business is expected to break even in 2011 and the
signal will be available in Mexico, Central America and the
Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa posted a 0.7 percent decline in second-quarter net
profit on Thursday, below results forecast in a Reuters poll,
due to higher financing costs and losses at some of its
affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's Sky direct-to-home business is feeling
pinched by increasing competition from Dish Mexico, as shown by
weaker quarterly customer base growth. Dish debuted in the
Mexican market late in 2008 and has already gathered half a
million clients, compared with Sky's nearly 1.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa shares were off 3.31 percent at 47 pesos in midday
trading on Friday.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has

acquisition of Wyeth. The Commission's decision includes Pfizer`s commitment to

In addition, Pfizer announced that China`s Ministry of Commerce has extended its
review of Pfizer`s regulatory submission beyond the initial thirty-day period.
The completion of the transaction remains subject to the expiration of the

jurisdictions, and approval by the stockholders of Wyeth. 

Ms. Schulman stated, "We continue to work cooperatively with the regulatory
agencies to obtain the requisite approvals, and continue to expect the
transaction to close at the end of the third quarter or during the fourth
quarter of 2009."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc are close to a long-discussed search and online advertising deal, which could be announced in the next week, according to the AllThingsDigital blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies have talked about cooperating for months, after Microsoft's bid to buy Yahoo was rebuffed last year and Yahoo's attempt to seal a search advertising deal with Google Inc fell apart under regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest discussions involve Microsoft paying Yahoo "several billion dollars upfront to take over its search advertising business and guarantee certain payments back to Yahoo," according to AllThingsDigital's Kara Swisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is likely to take the lead on selling display advertising for the companies, she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Senior Vice President of Online Audience Business Group Yusuf Mehdi, search head Satya Nadella, top digital executive Qi Lu and others flew to Silicon Valley on Thursday to iron out remaining issues, related with technology deployment, the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, a deal could be announced within the next week, Swisher wrote, citing sources at both companies. But she cautioned that an agreement was not certain, since both companies have been in talks before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Microsoft and Yahoo declined comment. Yahoo is scheduled to report quarterly results next Tuesday, and Microsoft on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz said in May that any deal to spin off or combine its search assets will require a partner with "boatloads of money." She said at the time that Yahoo was talking "a little bit" with Microsoft, but gave no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft withdrew its $47.5 billion offer to buy Yahoo in May 2008 after Yahoo's board said the price was too low. The software giant then offered to buy Yahoo's search advertising assets for $1 billion upfront, and guarantee $2.3 billion in annual revenue for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is the dominant player in the search market, with a 65 percent market share in June, according to comScore. Yahoo was second with 19.6 percent, while Microsoft was third with 8.4 percent. While Microsoft's share remains small, its new search engine Bing has won positive early reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo rose 3.9 percent to $16.82 in morning Nasdaq trading. Oppenheimer raised its price target on Yahoo shares to $19 from $13.25, with a 'perform' rating, saying the company was likely to benefit from a rebound in large advertiser spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tiffany Wu; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Here are the stocks seeing a bias toward call activity on Thursday. This
filtered scan is based on the International Securities Exchange (ISE)
buy-to-open data. It looks for stocks where the previous day's call volume on
the ISE is at least twice as great as the put volume. It then sorts the stocks
based on the call volume. Since this is buy-to-open data, this can be a good
source for finding stocks where optimism is emerging. Of particular interest to
me would be situations where we see call activity on stocks that are still in
intermediate-term downtrends. This would be a potentially cautionary sign from
the contrarian perspective. 

Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), IBM Corp (NYSE: IBM), and Wynn Resorts Limited
(NASDAQ: WYNN) are the situations that stood out to me - 

The activity on Bank of America came ahead of the earnings report. Earlier this
week, I discussed the stock and said it seemed like a crowded long trade. The
early reaction to earnings has been fairly tame. The equity is more or less flat
and still drifting in the near-term range.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts on Friday marked up their price targets on IBM (IBM.N) shares after the company raised its full-year earnings forecast and reported stronger-than-expected profit for the second quarter despite weaker sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts said International Business Machines Corp exceeded their profit expectations by cutting costs and focusing on more profitable software and services contracts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Many raised their profit forecasts for the coming quarters, while they lowered their revenue expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Moskowitz lifted his year-end price target to $122 from a previous $109 after IBM forecast 2009 profit of at least $9.70 per share, up from its previous outlook of $9.20 a share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM shares rose 3.5 percent to $114.50 in mid-morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    They are still trading at around 10.8 times J.P. Morgan's estimate for 2010 earnings, lower than the average of 12.1 times in the sector, Moskowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We continue to recommend building or adding positions in IBM as incremental leverage in the model should be sustainable and provide a partial buffer to the ongoing global downturn," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Citigroup raised its 12-month price target on IBM to $135 from $125 and reiterated a "buy" recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We continue to see compelling value in IBM shares, even on this morning's bounce," Citigroup analyst Richard Gardner said in a research note, adding it was "not a demand recovery, but we'll take it!" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Phil Berlowitz) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((ritsuko.ando@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 223 6084; Reuters Messaging: ritsuko.ando.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: IBM/RESEARCH &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft, Yahoo may seal ad deal next week - blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft to pay Yahoo several billion dollars - blog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Yahoo shares up 4 pct, Oppenheimer raises target&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and
Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) are close to a long-discussed search and
online advertising deal, which could be announced in the next
week, according to the AllThingsDigital blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies have talked about cooperating for months,
after Microsoft's bid to buy Yahoo was rebuffed last year and
Yahoo's attempt to seal a search advertising deal with Google
Inc (GOOG.O) fell apart under regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest discussions involve Microsoft paying Yahoo
"several billion dollars upfront to take over its search
advertising business and guarantee certain payments back to
Yahoo," according to AllThingsDigital's Kara Swisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is likely to take the lead on selling display
advertising for the companies, she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Senior Vice President of Online Audience Business
Group Yusuf Mehdi, search head Satya Nadella, top digital
executive Qi Lu and others flew to Silicon Valley on Thursday
to iron out remaining issues, related with technology
deployment, the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If all goes well, a deal could be announced within the next
week, Swisher wrote, citing sources at both companies. But she
cautioned that an agreement was not certain, since both
companies have been in talks before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives for Microsoft and Yahoo declined comment.
Yahoo is scheduled to report quarterly results next Tuesday,
and Microsoft on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz said in May that any deal
to spin off or combine its search assets will require a partner
with "boatloads of money." She said at the time that Yahoo was
talking "a little bit" with Microsoft, but gave no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft withdrew its $47.5 billion offer to buy Yahoo in
May 2008 after Yahoo's board said the price was too low. The
software giant then offered to buy Yahoo's search advertising
assets for $1 billion upfront, and guarantee $2.3 billion in
annual revenue for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google is the dominant player in the search market, with a
65 percent market share in June, according to comScore. Yahoo
was second with 19.6 percent, while Microsoft was third with
8.4 percent. While Microsoft's share remains small, its new
search engine Bing has won positive early reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Yahoo rose 3.9 percent to $16.82 in morning
Nasdaq trading. Oppenheimer raised its price target on Yahoo
shares to $19 from $13.25, with a 'perform' rating, saying the
company was likely to benefit from a rebound in large
advertiser spending. [ID:nBNG426322]

&lt;p&gt;July 17 (Reuters) - At least three brokerages, including
Wells Fargo, raised their full-year earnings estimates for
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) on Friday, a day after the bank
posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on record
investment banking and trading results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan showcased its balance-sheet strength and continued
execution across key businesses, analysts at Citigroup said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts at Wells Fargo, who also raised their
third-quarter earnings estimates, said at current prices, they
expect JPMorgan will likely return to share repurchases to
bolster shareholder returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup analysts led by Keith Horowitz, however, said
they do not see large scale buybacks by JPMorgan until the
second half of 2010, as the bank's Tier 1 ratio may be hurt by
the repayment of warrants and impact of accounting rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's Tier 1 ratio, which stands at 7.7 percent, could
fall to 7.2 percent by the first quarter of 2010, Horowitz
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although we believe credit may continue to deteriorate,
given JPMorgan's strong reserve and capital position, we
anticipate less of a need to build reserves going forward,"
analysts at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Fox-Pitt Kelton cut its second-half earnings
view for JPMorgan to 67 cents a share from 71 cents a share,
primarily on higher credit costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the earnings estimate changes, please double-click

&lt;p&gt;July 17 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities raised its price
target and earnings estimates for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and
recommended investors add positions in the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We expect a strong showing from Apple in the June
quarter," said analysts led by Mark Moskowitz, who raised his
target on the stock of the Mac computer and iPhone maker to
$167.50 from $155.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple's business volumes should exceed investors'
expectations and inputs from primary research contacts indicate
a Mac notebooks surge in the second half of the June quarter,
Moskowitz said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst raised his unit estimates for the company's
total Mac business to 2.50 million from 2.13 million for the
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The build activity in the supply chain related to the
iPhone continues to rise, said Moskowitz, who also raised his
iPhone unit estimates for the period to 4.34 million from 3.88
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said Apple's iPod touch -- "a quasi-netbook
device" -- offered enough features to partially take advantage
of increasing customer adoption of netbooks, which are
stripped-down, budget laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, he said he was concerned that the traditional
iPods could exhibit lighter volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moskowitz raised his third-quarter earnings estimate for
Apple to $1.23 a share from $1.12, and fiscal 2009 earnings
estimate to $5.68 a share from $5.51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple is scheduled to report third-quarter results on July
21. Analysts on average expect the company to post a profit
$1.17 a share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Apple closed at $147.52 Thursday on the Nasdaq.

same period of 2008. As of June 30, 2009, there were 1.31 billion basic common
shares outstanding. 

Debt, including Global Financing, totaled $29.4 billion, compared with $33.9
billion at year-end 2008. From a management segment view, Global Financing debt
decreased $1.6 billion from year-end 2008 to a total of $22.8 billion at June
30, 2009, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 6.9 to 1. Non-global financing
debt totaled $6.6 billion, a decrease of $3.0 billion since year-end 2008,
resulting in a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 35.0 percent from 48.7 percent. 

IBM ended the second quarter of 2009 with $12.5 billion of cash on hand and
generated free cash flow of $3.4 billion, excluding Global Financing
receivables. The company returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through $732
million in dividends and $1.7 billion of share repurchases. The balance sheet
remains strong, and the company is well positioned to take advantage of
opportunities.

an increase of 11 percent. Revenues for the six-month period totaled $45.0
billion, a decrease of 12 percent (5 percent, adjusting for currency) compared
with $51.3 billion for the six months of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite, whose authoritative delivery of news events from the John F. Kennedy assassination to the Apollo moon landing and Vietnam War, made him "the most trusted man in America," died on Friday at age 92.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cronkite died in New York after an illness, CBS said. His family issued a statement weeks ago that he had been suffering for some years with cerebrovascular disease and was not expected to recuperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His death coincided with the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, which took the first astronauts to the moon. Cronkite was a passionate chronicler of the space program and anniversary celebrations of Apollo 11 have featured frequent rebroadcasts of his coverage of the historic moon landing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was the consummate television newsman," said Don Hewitt, a longtime CBS News executive and creator of the long-running "60 Minutes" news program. "He had all the credentials to be a writer, an editor, a broadcaster. There was only one Walter Cronkite and there may never be another one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama said Cronkite "was someone we could trust to guide us through the most important issues of the day; a voice of certainty in an uncertain world. He was family. He invited us to believe in him, and he never let us down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former President George W. Bush called Cronkite "an icon of American journalism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly 20 years, millions of Americans tuned in to the "CBS Evening News" to hear the day's major events as reported by Cronkite, whose avuncular manner and deep voice made his show the top-rated news program from 1969 until he retired in 1981 and was replaced by Dan Rather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite's demeanor inspired the nickname "Uncle Walter" and when he signed off his newscasts by saying, "And that's the way it is," few doubted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his years at the CBS anchor desk, Cronkite was regularly voted the "most trusted man in America" in opinion polls. Senator Robert Kennedy was so impressed he asked Cronkite to run for public office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't understand my impact or success," Cronkite once said. "That my delivery is straight, even dull at times, is probably a valid criticism. But I built my reputation on honest, straightforward reporting. To do anything else would be phony."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing in a blog on www.huffingtonpost.com in March 2006, Cronkite explained his signature "the way it is" signoff by saying, "To me, that encapsulates the newsman's highest ideal: to report the facts as he sees them, without regard for the consequences or controversy that may ensue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born November 4, 1916, in St. Joseph, Missouri, Walter Leland Cronkite Jr. became a United Press correspondent in 1939. He was one of the first journalists accredited to American forces after the United States entered World War Two in 1941.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite flew on the first bombing raids over Germany, parachuting into the Netherlands with the 101st Airborne Division and landing with Allied troops at Normandy, but he never thought himself brave in World War Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Personally, I feel I was an overweening coward in the war," he once said. "I was scared to death all the time. I did everything possible to avoid getting into combat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'IF I'VE LOST CRONKITE ...'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite joined CBS News in 1950 and hosted public affairs programs. In 1953, he began narrating the long-running "You Are There" series, which recreated historical events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took over the CBS anchor chair on April 16, 1962, and his stirring reports on issues from the space program to the Vietnam War often had as much impact as the events themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite grew teary and his voice cracked as he told the nation in 1963 that President Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the bloody 1968 Tet Offensive in Vietnam, a disillusioned Cronkite told his viewers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of American leaders, both in Vietnam and in Washington, to have faith any longer in the silver linings they find in the darkest clouds. ... It seems now more than ever that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in stalemate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite said in 2006 the Tet report was his favorite story and many believe it led President Lyndon Johnson not to seek re-election in 1968. Johnson was quoted as saying, "If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he retired from the anchor job, Cronkite had expected to still get special assignments and projects from CBS and was disappointed it did not work out that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981, spent his later years making documentaries, writing books, giving speeches and exercising his passion for sailing. He also campaigned against global warming and spoke out against the Iraq war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite's wife of 64 years, Betsy, died in 2005 from cancer. They had three children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Bill Trott; Editing by Peter Cooney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn spoke out in favor of a search deal between Yahoo Inc and Microsoft Corp, as talks between the two companies appeared to regain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icahn declined to comment on the state of any negotiations between Yahoo and Microsoft. He had tried to broker a partnership between the two companies last year, when talks on Microsoft's $47.5 billion takeover bid for Yahoo fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been a strong advocate of getting a search deal done with Microsoft," Icahn, who owns about 5 percent of Yahoo and is a director on its board, told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would enhance value if a deal got done, because of the synergies involved," he said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo are close to a long-discussed search and online advertising deal, which could be announced in the next week, according to another source familiar with the matter who is not associated with Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news was first reported by the AllThingsDigital blog, which said a deal would involve Microsoft paying Yahoo several billion dollars upfront to take over its search advertising business and guarantee certain payments back to Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies have talked about cooperating for months, after Microsoft's bid to buy Yahoo was rebuffed last year and Yahoo's attempt to seal a search advertising deal with Google Inc fell apart under regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz said in May that any deal to spin off or combine its search assets will require a partner with "boatloads of money." She said at the time that Yahoo was talking "a little bit" with Microsoft, but gave no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz is currently out of the office for two weeks, following knee replacement surgery, according to an email that she sent to her employees earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn, whose firm had a 5.4 percent stake in Yahoo as of March 31, said he remains a "strong supporter" of Bartz, who took the reins in January from Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz has made a number of changes since joining Yahoo, including shutting down underperforming websites and laying off 5 percent of the Sunnyvale, California company's staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many investors continue to see a deal with Microsoft as Yahoo's best option, saying it will cut costs and create an online entity big enough to better compete with Google, the top search company in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest discussions involve a partnership in which Microsoft would handle search capabilities for Yahoo, while Yahoo could potentially handle online advertising for the two online sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kara Swisher, co-executive editor of AllThingsDigital, a group of high-powered Microsoft online executives flew to Silicon Valley on Thursday to iron out remaining issues related to technology deployment. They included Senior Vice President of Online Audience Business Group Yusuf Mehdi, search head Satya Nadella, top digital executive Qi Lu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Microsoft and Yahoo declined to comment. Yahoo is scheduled to report quarterly results next Tuesday, and Microsoft on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft withdrew its $47.5 billion offer to buy Yahoo in May 2008 after Yahoo's board said the price was too low. The software giant then offered to buy Yahoo's search advertising assets for $1 billion upfront, and guarantee $2.3 billion in annual revenue for five years, in a proposal backed by Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is the dominant player in the search market, with a 65 percent market share in June, according to comScore. Yahoo was second with 19.6 percent, while Microsoft was third with 8.4 percent. While Microsoft's share remains small, its new search engine Bing has won positive early reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Nasdaq, Yahoo finished Friday's regular trading session up 4 percent at $16.84 while Microsoft closed 0.6 percent lower at $24.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic and Bill Rigby; Editing by Tiffany Wu and Richard)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Televisa prohibited from streaming shows online in U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Univision is exploring options to provide shows online&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Televisa says it will appeal court decision&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - Spanish language media
company Univision Communications said on Friday a U.S. court
ruled in its favor in an Internet rights litigation case with
rival Grupo Televisa, which vowed to appeal the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Los Angeles Federal Court Judge Philip Gutierrez's ruling
prohibits Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) from broadcasting TV programs
over the web in the United States that it has already licensed
to Univision [UVN.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A long-drawn-out lawsuit between the two companies had
centered on how to interpret a clause in a 1992 license
agreement that originally dealt with the spillover of
Televisa's broadcast signal across the U.S.-Mexico border into
Univision's licensed territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa executives had argued that the 1992 contract did
not contemplate Internet distribution, and subsequent
amendments and technological advances allow it to transmit
programming via satellite into the U.S. as long as it
originates in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  As part of a "truce" over the issue, neither company
offers the popular programming, including daily telenovelas, on
U.S.-facing websites, but Televisa said the programs would
continue to be widely pirated until the disputed contract
expires in 2017 if viewers have no Internet option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is wrong for Univision to characterize this decision as
a victory, because is simply maintains the status quo," said a
statement from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The only winners in this decision will be the Internet
sites that illegally transmit Televisa programming," the
statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Univision, like many other U.S. broadcasters and cable
companies, said it was exploring its legal options in order to
provide content to its own audience over the Internet in the
U.S. in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But both Univision and Televisa have conceded that
potential advertising revenue from Internet streaming of
programs is not significant at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However a PriceWaterhouseCoopers study shows that Internet
advertising is expected to grow by double-digit percentages
over the next four years to about $40 billion in U.S. markets.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will likely report the first annual sales dip in its history as a public company, but investors are looking beyond that for upbeat comments on Windows 7, signs of a tech sector recovery, and even a deal with Yahoo Inc to challenge Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question for investors when the world's largest software company reports quarterly results on Thursday is whether it can present enough optimism to maintain the momentum that has pushed shares up 63 percent since early March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech heavyweights IBM and Intel Corp ratcheted up expectations last week by blowing through Wall Street forecasts and setting ambitious outlooks that suggest the worst may be over for the sagging computer business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose software drives more than 90 percent of the world's PCs, stands to benefit as it prepares to roll out its new Windows 7 operating system in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's been a sentiment shift," said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital management. "People are starting to get excited now about the visibility of Windows 7 -- it's got good reviews and they've got some pent-up demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've turned the corner in a lot of their businesses," said Lowenstein, a manager of HighMark's Value Momentum mutual fund, which holds about 530,000 Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from Windows 7 -- which should help erase bad memories of its poorly received predecessor Vista -- Microsoft has a new version of its huge-selling Office suite of applications in the works, and it is finally making headway against Google with its six-week old Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of intermittent negotiations, and an aborted takeover bid last year, Microsoft finally looks ready to strike an Internet search and online advertising deal with Yahoo, according to a source familiar with the situation. An announcement could come before the results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sooner these two decide to bring the best of what they both have together and then jointly go after the market, the more it will benefit both," said Lowenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC RECOVERY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader technology economy could be moving in Microsoft's direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last quarter's worldwide PC shipments fell about 3 percent from a year ago, a much smaller drop than expected in the depths of a U.S. recession. Analysts are now talking about growth in PC sales returning in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft's Windows 7 scheduled to launch in late October, that could bode well for the company's fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The new product pipeline, combined with even a modest rebound in IT spending growth, could have significant impact on Microsoft's top-line" in its new fiscal year, which started July 1, according to a Goldman Sachs analyst report last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman put Microsoft on its top stock picks list -- calling it a "conviction buy" last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the stock rises after earnings, it could trigger an "investor snowball effect", according to Goldman, whose analysts point out that fund managers in the "growth" sector -- looking for share price appreciation rather than undervalued stocks or high dividends -- are significantly underinvested in Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock was under-owned for a while -- it was in growth stock purgatory," said Lowenstein. "It hadn't delivered the higher expectations that some of the other software companies were producing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If growth fund managers rush to buy an outperforming Microsoft stock to rebalance their positions, that could push the share price even higher, said Lowenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after its recent surge, Microsoft stock is still reasonably priced relative to comparable investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Friday's closing price, Microsoft shares are trading at 13.3 times expected earnings per share for fiscal 2010, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Apple Inc shares are trading at 23.4 times expected earnings for fiscal 2010, Google at 17.4 times and IBM at 11 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite rising hopes for Microsoft, some still sound a note of caution not to get ahead of a recovery that has not materialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would love to see higher revenues but I don't know if that's realistic," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think their customers are expanding and thus need systems and processes to grow that. I want to see new (technology) projects starting up and I don't see that anywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney Channel's crossover special "Wizards on Deck With Hannah Montana" was the most-watched scripted telecast on cable so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 90-minute Friday night event, which featured episodes of "Hannah Montana," "The Suite Life on Deck" and "Wizards of Waverly Place," was seen by a massive 9.3 million viewers. It also marked TV's top scripted telecast this year among kids 6-11 and tweens 9-14. Disney Channel out delivered second-place CBS for the evening by than 4 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program marked the best time-period numbers for Disney Channel since the 2007 premiere of "High School Musical 2." It also topped previous network crossover events, drawing 82% more viewers than 2007's "Cory in the House," "The Suite Life of Zack  Cody" and "Hannah Montana" mash-up, and 41% more than 2006's "That's So Raven," "Zack  Cody" and "Hannah Montana" combo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dean Goodman at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  BALTIMORE, MD, Jul 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Retirement Living TV (RLTV), the only network dedicated to the 50+
community, salutes the timeless contribution made to journalism by Walter
Cronkite, who died on Friday, July 17th, at his Manhattan home. In his
over six decades in radio, print, and television, Cronkite became a
household name and an international media icon. During the Vietnam War
and amidst criticism of American policy, President Johnson spoke of the
very pervasive nature of Cronkite's work by stating: "If I've lost
[Walter] Cronkite, I've lost middle America." To honor his legacy,
beginning on Saturday, July 18th, at 11:00 pm RLTV aired "The Most Trusted
Man in America," an original tribute to Cronkite, which includes his final
on-air appearance. The program will repeat commercial-free on Sunday, July
19th and Monday, July 20th.

    John Erickson, Founder and Executive Chairman of RLTV, developed a
relationship with the legendary journalist which culminated with the
creation of a series of editorials called the "Cronkite Commentaries."
Cronkite is also celebrated for having been instrumental to the founding
of RLTV. "We mourn the loss of Walter -- not only as someone who helped
create our network, but as a friend. He was an international legend who
quickly became one of our most trusted sources and a mentor to us all,"
said Erickson. "We take great pride in the fact that we have his final
moments on air -- it has a bittersweet sentiment that will forever
resonate."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite, whose authoritative delivery of news events from the John F. Kennedy assassination to the Apollo moon landing and Vietnam War, made him "the most trusted man in America," died on Friday at age 92.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cronkite died in New York after an illness, CBS said. His family issued a statement weeks ago that he had been suffering for some years with cerebrovascular disease and was not expected to recuperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His death coincided with the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, which took the first astronauts to the moon. Cronkite was a passionate chronicler of the space program and anniversary celebrations of Apollo 11 have featured frequent rebroadcasts of his coverage of the historic moon landing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was the consummate television newsman," said Don Hewitt, a longtime CBS News executive and creator of the long-running "60 Minutes" news program. "He had all the credentials to be a writer, an editor, a broadcaster. There was only one Walter Cronkite and there may never be another one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama said Cronkite "was someone we could trust to guide us through the most important issues of the day; a voice of certainty in an uncertain world. He was family. He invited us to believe in him, and he never let us down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former President George W. Bush called Cronkite "an icon of American journalism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly 20 years, millions of Americans tuned in to the "CBS Evening News" to hear the day's major events as reported by Cronkite, whose avuncular manner and deep voice made his show the top-rated news program from 1969 until he retired in 1981 and was replaced by Dan Rather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite's demeanor inspired the nickname "Uncle Walter" and when he signed off his newscasts by saying, "And that's the way it is," few doubted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his years at the CBS anchor desk, Cronkite was regularly voted the "most trusted man in America" in opinion polls. Senator Robert Kennedy was so impressed he asked Cronkite to run for public office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't understand my impact or success," Cronkite once said. "That my delivery is straight, even dull at times, is probably a valid criticism. But I built my reputation on honest, straightforward reporting. To do anything else would be phony."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing in a blog on www.huffingtonpost.com in March 2006, Cronkite explained his signature "the way it is" signoff by saying, "To me, that encapsulates the newsman's highest ideal: to report the facts as he sees them, without regard for the consequences or controversy that may ensue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born November 4, 1916, in St. Joseph, Missouri, Walter Leland Cronkite Jr. became a United Press correspondent in 1939. He was one of the first journalists accredited to American forces after the United States entered World War Two in 1941.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite flew on the first bombing raids over Germany, parachuting into the Netherlands with the 101st Airborne Division and landing with Allied troops at Normandy, but he never thought himself brave in World War Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Personally, I feel I was an overweening coward in the war," he once said. "I was scared to death all the time. I did everything possible to avoid getting into combat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'IF I'VE LOST CRONKITE ...'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite joined CBS News in 1950 and hosted public affairs programs. In 1953, he began narrating the long-running "You Are There" series, which recreated historical events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took over the CBS anchor chair on April 16, 1962, and his stirring reports on issues from the space program to the Vietnam War often had as much impact as the events themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite grew teary and his voice cracked as he told the nation in 1963 that President Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the bloody 1968 Tet Offensive in Vietnam, a disillusioned Cronkite told his viewers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of American leaders, both in Vietnam and in Washington, to have faith any longer in the silver linings they find in the darkest clouds. ... It seems now more than ever that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in stalemate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite said in 2006 the Tet report was his favorite story and many believe it led President Lyndon Johnson not to seek re-election in 1968. Johnson was quoted as saying, "If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he retired from the anchor job, Cronkite had expected to still get special assignments and projects from CBS and was disappointed it did not work out that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981, spent his later years making documentaries, writing books, giving speeches and exercising his passion for sailing. He also campaigned against global warming and spoke out against the Iraq war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cronkite's wife of 64 years, Betsy, died in 2005 from cancer. They had three children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Bill Trott; Editing by Peter Cooney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which is fighting a long-running environmental lawsuit in Ecuador, is planning to fight the case in the United States, the Wall Street Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're not paying and we're going to fight this for years if not decades into the future," Chevron spokesman Don Campbell told the paper in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ongoing suit in Ecuador, which has run for a decade and a half, locals charge that Chevron's Texaco unit damaged their health by dumping billions of gallons of oil-laden water from 1972 to 1992, before turning over operations to state-run Petroecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ruling has been expected some time this year, but the company has argued that public criticism of Chevron by Ecuador President Rafael Correa makes a fair trial impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters email seeking comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nivedita Bhattacharjee in Bangalore)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today updated Office 2008 for Mac to Service Pack 2 (SP2), adding a tool that beefs up access to documents stored on enterprise SharePoint servers and Microsoft's free Office Live Workspace service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office 2008 SP2 is the first major update to the suite since May 2008's SP1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft touted several stability and performance improvements to the Mac suite, including faster launch and scrolling for Word, and 24% faster calculating in Excel. But it focused attention on the new Document Connection tool, which it first unveiled in January 2009 at the Macworld Conference  Expo. At the time, Microsoft was coy about a delivery date, saying only that it would ship the tool "later this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool is meant to make it easier for business users to share documents with colleagues running the Mac and Windows editions of Office, as it streamlines opening and saving documents to Office Live Workspace, the for-free online document access, storage and sharing service. At the same time, Office Live Workspace supports Safari 4.0, Apple's newest browser, as of today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also talked up Document Connection's improved access to SharePoint, the corporate-grade document sharing and collaboration server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With SP2, we are not only delivering on top customer requests mid-cycle, but also taking a first step in bringing Microsoft software plus services to Mac users," Mike Tedesco, a senior product manager for Microsoft's Mac business unit, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last January, the company also promised it would upgrade Entourage this year as part of an effort to migrate to Exchange Web Services (EWS) for connecting to Exchange mail servers, and drop the currently supported WebDAV. A beta of EWS was released in January, but a final has not yet appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office for Mac 2008 SP2 is available for manual download from Microsoft's site, although users can also use the "Help/Check for updates" command within any of the suite's applications, or simply wait for the auto-update tool to offer the service pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mac version of Office will continue to lag behind the Windows edition. Although Microsoft has said it will ship Office 2010 for Windows in the first half of 2010, it has not set any timetable for the next version of the Mac suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft started Office 2010's first round of beta testing last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM) as the Bull of the
Day and Marriott International (NYSE:MAR) the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America
(NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

As a result of its large non-US revenue base, IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has
been better insulated from the recent weakness in the U.S. economy than many of
its peers. IBM reported strong 2Q09 results ahead of our and Wall Street
expectations. 

Profitability in the quarter was fueled by higher gross profit margins as IBM
shifted to high-margin software and services business. The company also raised
its EPS outlook for fiscal 2009 from $9.20 to $9.70. However, currency
fluctuations are taking a toll on its revenue, which may be critical to earnings
growth over the next two years. 

Moreover, the company has focused on driving its bottom line through
cost-cutting efforts. IBM is well positioned to benefit from the market
recovery. We maintain our Buy rating on IBM shares and maintain our six-month
price target of $120.00. 

Bear of the Day: 

We maintain our Sell rating on shares of Marriott International (NYSE:MAR)
following the release of second quarter results. Although Q2 earnings results
exceeded our expectation, we have lowered our full-year EPS estimate. 

The operating environment in the lodging sector is expected to remain weak
throughout 2009, with substantial RevPAR declines forecasted. 

Given our forecast for negative earnings growth in 2009, along with the ongoing
uncertainty regarding the state of the economy and its potential impact on
Marriott's lodging and timeshare businesses, we rate the shares a Sell at this
time. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Citi Profits on Smith Barney Sale

Citigroup (NYSE:C) today reported net income for 2Q09 at $4.3 billion, or $0.49
per diluted share. These results included a $6.7 billion after-tax gain
associated with the sale of Smith Barney, which closed on June 1, 2009. 

Excluding the one-time gain, the operating loss for the quarter was about $0.27
per share, which is better than the analysts` estimates of a loss of $0.37 per
share. Like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the range of the analysts` estimates for
Citi was very wide -- from a loss of 3 cents per share to a loss of 76 cents per
share -- thus the consensus does not mean much, in our view. 

Total revenues were $30.0 billion, up $12.4 billion from 2Q08. Unlike some of
the other big banks such as BAC and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which had strong
revenues from trading activities, Citi's results benefited mainly from the sale
of Smith Barney and the increasing values of some of its risky assets (favorable
net write-ups and gains), relative to the prior year period. This was partially
offset by the impact of foreign exchange and declines in Regional Consumer
Banking revenues, primarily in credit cards business.

Here are highlights from Friday`sAnalyst Blog: 

BofA "Beats," But&#8230;

Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) reported its 2Q09 income at $3.22 billion, or $0.33
per share, down from $3.41 billion, or $0.72 per share, a year earlier. The
results were down 5.5% on higher merger charges and credit costs, but were ahead
of analysts' expectations of $0.28 per share. 

We may add that the analysts` estimates ranged from a loss of 11 cents per share
to a profit of 70 cents per share, and with so many one-time items it is
difficult to conclude which items were included or excluded in the estimates and
whether the results actually exceeded the expectations. 

Results were driven by strong performance in the wholesale capital markets and
home loans businesses, gains on the sale of China Construction Bank shares and
the sale of the company's merchant processing business to a joint venture, but
were partly offset by high credit costs, and a special FDIC assessment. 

During the current year, banks have seen record revenues from trading actives,
as we saw in the recent results of Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and JP Morgan (NYSE:
JPM) and also from the ongoing boom in mortgage financing. For BAC, sales and
trading revenue rose to a record $6.7 billion during the quarter. The bank
funded $110.6 billion in first mortgages, of which approximately 29% were for
purchases and rest for refinancing. 

Biogen Beats Consensus

Yesterday, Biogen Idec (Nasdaq:BIIB) reported financial results for the second
quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.75,
beating the consensus estimate of $0.68. EPS declined on a y-o-y basis due to a
$110 million charge (EPS impact of $0.32) taken by Biogen related to its
recently signed deal with Acorda Therapeutics (Nasdaq:ACOR). GAAP EPS, which
includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, declined 30%
to $0.49. 

Although EPS declined from the year-ago quarter, revenues jumped 10% to 1,093.3
million, slightly above ours and the Street`s estimate of $1.07 billion. Avonex
and Tysabri were the primary growth drivers. 

Avonex sales increased 12% to $591.2 million (U.S. sales increased 20%; ex-U.S.
sales increased 2%). New long-term efficacy data and increased promotional
efforts should drive Avonex sales going forward.

Here are highlights from Friday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Apple Restricts PALM Access

According to media releases, Apple Inc. (Nasdaq:AAPL) introduced an update to
its iTunes software, the iTunes 8.2.1, that limits Palm (Nasdaq:PALM) users'
access to the updated iTunes on the recently launched Palm Pre smartphone. 

During Pre`s release, Palm said that users will be able to download free music,
photos and videos via iTunes. Now Pre owners can no longer use Apple's iTunes to
sync their smartphones to Macs or PCs. This move is expected to hurt Pre sales
going forward as users` ability to download music and videos now will be
restricted. 

Pre will not be able to act much like an iPhone or iPod. This is a setback for
Palm as it had expected Pre to drive sales and turn the company`s fortunes
around. 

Apple has the prerogative to take such action as it exclusively owns iTunes.
Although Apple has blocked the use of updated iTunes software, Pre owners can
use the older version of iTunes. But we believe it will be of no use as
consumers would not want an old system that restricts music access. 

The new updated iTunes Version 8.2.1 provides a number of important features.
The access to new iTunes will be allowed only to authorize devices, such as its
iPods and iPhones. Apple also said that iTunes do not support non-Apple
hardware. We believe this action will greatly undercut competition and generate
higher sales and profits for Apple. 

In our opinion, this move by Apple to lock away the advantage of the iTunes
software for Palm Pre is to maintain its monopoly in the market and reduce the
growing threat from Pre. 

This move should help Apple defend its market from competition for its newly
introduced iPhone 3G S. Though a number of other competitors, such as Microsoft
(Nasdaq:MSFT), SanDisk (Nasdaq:SNDK), Samsung, and Sony (NYSE: SNE) have
launched rival products and are trying to undercut iPod with additional features
and attractive pricing, Apple`s iPhone and iPod carry strong brand equity among
consumers, giving it a dominant position amid the high-end digital music
players.

&lt;p&gt;  BELLEVUE, WA, Jul 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Bsquare Corporation (NASDAQ: BSQR), the leading software solutions
provider to the global embedded device community, today announced its
role as a lead systems integrator for Coca-Cola Freestyle(TM), a
proprietary, software-driven fountain dispenser from The Coca-Cola
Company.

    Currently in testing in the United States, Coca-Cola Freestyle(TM) brings
innovative technology to consumers by offering upwards of 100 sparkling
and still branded beverage selections from one machine. Rich graphical
user interfaces make the dispenser attractive for all types of users --
including consumers, restaurant operators and field service technicians.

    Over the past two years, Bsquare has provided consulting, architecture,
services and products to develop the dispenser. Significant work and
investment have gone into preparing an architectural design for the
dispensers, which are flexible, reusable and have user interfaces unlike
any other fountain dispenser available. See Bsquare's tour of the
Coca-Cola Freestyle(TM) at www.bsquare.com

    "Creating a simple-to-use design is very complex. Bsquare has worked
side-by-side with The Coca-Cola Company to create this innovative new
'fountain of the future.' Its graphically rich, exciting user interfaces
-- created without the horsepower of a PC -- are attractive and easy to
use by multiple types of users which makes its design necessarily
complex," says Carey Butler, Bsquare's vice president of professional
engineering services.

    Unlike a typical fountain dispenser that offers less than 10 beverages
with a significant "back room" dependency, Coca-Cola Freestyle(TM) uses
highly concentrated ingredients along with microdosing technology to
enable it to make more than 100 different types of beverages with minimal
"back room" requirements such as carbonated water and sweetener.

    Key to the Coca-Cola Freestyle(TM) dispensers is the different user
interfaces that appeal to different types of users. For consumers, it's a
simple, easy to understand user interface that intuitively guides the user
through all the beverage choices. The same flexible functionality also
guides a typical outlet crew through the steps necessary to maintain the
machine. A technician interface provides service personnel with
troubleshooting tips and essential service data.

    Connected directly to Coca-Cola's network, operational activity now can be
managed remotely. For example, restaurant operators can order new supplies
based on demand consumption; sales and equipment status can be retrieved
from the dispenser unit; and software, artwork for its LCD panel or new
beverage recipes can be downloaded directly to the dispensers.

    About Bsquare

    Bsquare is an industry leader with a proven track record in providing
engineering services and production-ready software products for the smart
device market. Since 1994, Bsquare has provided device manufacturers with
software solutions for personal navigation devices, point-of-sale
terminals, handheld data terminals, smart phones and many other device
categories allowing them to get to market more quickly and cost
effectively.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 20 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
filed an appeal on Monday of a ruling that stopped work on a
new hydrogen plant at its refinery in Richmond, California, the
oil company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron had said earlier this month it planned to appeal a
judge's ruling that halted the $1 billion project at the
107-year-old San Francisco Bay area refinery, which is
Chevron's oldest. [ID:nN09461350]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge Barbara Zuniga
ruled this month that the environmental impact report filed to
get construction permits for the new hydrogen plant failed to
detail how it would change pollution levels from the refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe there is ample factual and expert evidence, as
well as law, supporting the Environmental Impact Review and the
project," refinery manager Mike Coyle said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Work started last September on the plant, which is being
built by industrial gas supplier Praxair (PX.N) and would ship
excess hydrogen to nearby refineries owned by ConocoPhillips
(COP.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) through a new
pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the project's future remains "in question"
until the California State Court of Appeal can decide the
issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case was "Communities for a Better Environment v City
of Richmond" in the Contra Costa County Superior Court of
California, case no. MSN08-1429.

&lt;p&gt;July 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs reinstated its
"Conviction Buy" rating on Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N) and its
12-month price target of $23 on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Analyst Robert Koort believes that the increased portfolio
of intermediate and specialty chemical assets that Dow has
following the Rohm and Haas deal -- representing over $30
billion in revenues or about two-thirds of total company sales
-- will experience impressive margin recovery in the next 18-24
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, following recent debt and equity offerings
and asset sales, Dow has substantially improved its post-merger
credit profile suggesting a shift of investor focus away from
survival worries towards its transformation strategy, the
analyst wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Koort believes that the next few quarters should allow Dow
to demonstrate its historic strength in cost-cutting and
synergy delivery, alongside its leverage to a recovering
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As earnings recover so too should investor confidence and
its share price, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were trading up 4 percent at $17.67
in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has
traded in a range of $5.89 to $38.50 in the last one year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading (GSET) announced today the release of several
significant enhancements to the Goldman Sachs Shortfall Model (GSSM). The GSSM
generates expected shortfall numbers, which are estimates for the average change
in stock price a trader may create by executing an order. Two major enhancements
to the GSSM include:

* improvements to the US equities model 
* calibration of that new model specifically for US exchange traded funds
(ETFs).

The key enhancement to the US equities model is the removal of market
capitalization buckets. Stocks within the GSSM are no longer classified into
small, mid, and large-cap categories, which can be extremely fluid in times of
increased volatility. Instead, the model has been enriched with a more flexible
functional form that captures liquidity differences across the market
capitalization spectrum and allows the model to better predict trading costs. 

The addition of an ETF-specific version of the enhanced shortfall model allows
for better transaction cost prediction when trading ETFs. While the old model
included ETFs as part of the estimation universe for equities, ETF model
coefficients are now estimated separately based on a large sample of executed
orders for ETFs only. 

"While we continuously monitor the predictive ability of our shortfall model,
the significant volatility and dramatically changing US equity landscape of the
past year underscores the value of these changes, which we researched over an
extensive period of time," said Ingrid Tierens, Managing Director and head of
equity execution strategies, GSET. "With this new model, clients benefit from an
enhanced ability to predict shortfall estimates, not only for single-stock and
portfolio trades, but also for ETFs, which have seen significant growth over the
past few years." 

The GSSM is based on Goldman Sachs` own executed orders data, rather than
publicly available tick data, and is re-estimated frequently to reflect recent
market conditions and uses factor inputs that are updated on a daily basis. Both
customers of GSET, utilizing its electronic tools and services, and Goldman
Sachs traders utilize the GSSM. 

Goldman Sachs customers can access the GSSM in a variety of ways. The model is
utilized for pre-trade analytics as well as daily, monthly, and quarterly
post-trade reports. The GSSM is fully integrated in two GSET algorithms, OptimIS
and Port X. The GSET Strategies team also utilizes the model in equity execution
and portfolio optimization analyses. Clients trading electronically will be able
to access the model in REDIPlus version 9.1 (to be released in September, 2009),
or via web-based reports. In addition, the model is fully integrated with Axioma
Portfolio OptimizerTM, a third-party optimization and portfolio construction
tool.

&lt;p&gt;Company initiates round of financing to advance development of combination drug
EMB-001 for treatment of drug addiction and obesity
SHREVEPORT, La.--(Business Wire)--
Embera NeuroTherapeutics, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company developing
novel treatments for drug addiction and obesity, announced today that the
company has recently expanded its management team to prepare for its next stage
of development, following the successful completion of the company`s pilot study
of cocaine addiction treatment. 

Bob Linke was named President and CEO earlier this year, bringing over
twenty-four years of healthcare experience to the company that includes building
two life science companies. Mr. Linke has also held senior management positions
at Baxter International and Caremark. Dr. Bruce McCarthy recently joined as
Embera`s consultant Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Clinical
Development. Dr. McCarthy, a neurologist, has extensive experience in neurology
and psychiatry drug development and previously led neuroscience clinical
development at Pfizer. Dr. Carol Gloff has also joined the company as a
pharmaceutical regulatory consultant. Dr. Gloff has over twenty-five years
experience in drug development and regulatory affairs, from preparation of INDs
through FDA product approval. Prior to establishing her consulting practice, Dr.
Gloff was Vice President of Regulatory Affairs for Alkermes and ImmunoGen. 

At the end of 2008, the company completed a forty-five subject pilot study of
its lead combination drug product, EMB-001, in cocaine dependent subjects at the
Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center`s Psychopharmacology Research
Clinic. This was the first placebo-controlled investigation in humans with
EMB-001, the combination drug approach developed by Embera`s Chief Scientific
Officer, Dr. Nicholas Goeders. The company believes its treatment approach,
which targets the neurological mechanisms of addiction, may also prove useful in
other addiction disorders such as smoking and alcohol dependence. 

Mr. Linke commented: "I am very excited to serve as the new President and CEO of
Embera as the company prepares for its next phase of development. The positive
findings in the company`s pilot clinical study of craving in cocaine dependent
subjects, along with the preclinical studies conducted at Louisiana State
University Health Sciences Center by Embera`s Chief Scientific Officer, Dr.
Nicholas Goeders, laid the foundation for the company`s plans to move EMB-001
forward in clinical development. There is a significant unmet need for new
treatments for individuals who suffer from addictions or eating disorders in
obesity. Embera`s novel approach to addressing these disorders offers the
potential of new treatment options for these populations." 

Embera is currently raising capital to advance the clinical development of its
lead combination drug product, EMB-001, in a financing round led by its current
investors, Louisiana Ventures and Louisiana Fund I. Ross Barrett, Chairman of
Embera NeuroTherapeutics and Managing Partner of Louisiana Ventures, LP
commented: "The Board is enthused about our expanded management team that
includes new CEO Bob Linke, as well as Dr. McCarthy and Dr. Gloff. Their
commitment speaks volumes regarding the potential value EMB-001 can bring to
addiction and obesity-related therapeutics." 

About the Company

Embera NeuroTherapeutics, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company founded in
2005 to develop and commercialize novel treatments for addiction and obesity -
significant, growing problems in the United States and worldwide for which there
are limited effective drug therapies. Embera is developing a patent-pending drug
combination, targeting specific brain functions related to the neurobiology of
addiction. The company`s lead product, EMB-001, is based on technology licensed
from Louisiana State University and developed by the company`s Chief Scientific
Officer, Dr. Nicholas Goeders, Head of the Department of Pharmacology,
Toxicology and Neuroscience at LSUHSC Shreveport. Dr. Goeders has been a
recipient of NIH funding to support studies of drug addiction and stress for
over twenty-five years and has authored over eighty scientific publications on
this subject. By targeting two neurological mechanisms associated with
addiction, EMB-001 may affect the neurobiology of addiction, including the brain
functions of craving and loss of control, rather than blocking or mimicking the
effect of the abused drug, as most treatment approaches do today. For additional
information about the company, please visit www.emberaneuro.com.

&lt;p&gt;Solution Enables Customers to Reap Benefits of Real-Time Replication and
Automatic Failover without Dedicated IT Support


SOUTHBOROUGH, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Double-Take Software (NASDAQ: DBTK)and HEROware today announced that they are
teaming up to offer HERO Backup Continuity Appliance (BCA), a real-time disaster
recovery appliance for the Microsoft Small Business Server (SBS) industry that
is simple and affordable, and has all of the features that SBS customers
require: constant protection, error-proof setup and fast, reliable recovery. 

HERO BCA is the first and only solution to deploy Double-Take Software`s
award-winning real-time replication technology in an appliance specially
designed for the SBS market. It allows SBS customers to avoid regular backups to
tape or disk, a time-consuming and complex task that increases the risk of data
loss. By using Double-Take Software technology, HERO BCA allows customers to
automatically backup their entire SBS system, including the operating system,
applications, files and data. HERO BCA is currently available in the United
States and Canada and will soon be available globally. 

"SBS customers now have access to a simple, reliable and affordable way to
recover and protect their data," said Alan Shafer, CEO of HEROware. "This is the
first time Double-Take Software`s technology has been available to the SBS
industry in such a practical and convenient package. The solution will provide
the recoverability, availability and protection that is essential to running a
successful, growing business." 

HERO BCA allows SBS customers to take advantage of both real-time replication
and automatic failover whether or not they have a dedicated IT staff and
extensive IT resources. The HERO BCA also provides both local and remote
protection; the solution can be run and located in-house and can replicate
simultaneously over the cloud to a HEROguard data center. 

"Our partnership with HEROware is based on the idea that even SBS customers, who
frequently have constrained financial and personnel resources, should have
access to disaster recovery solutions," said Dan Jones, vice president of North
American sales and marketing at Double-Take Software. "This solution puts
Double-Take Software`s enterprise class solution into a package that is
practical for small businesses and provides the company with an entry point to
the SBS industry, extending its first-class technology to small businesses with
constrained financial and personnel resources."

&lt;p&gt;10 Gigabit Ethernet Boosts Value Proposition of Server Virtualization for End
Users and Business Partners
CUPERTINO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Neterion, Inc., the industry pioneer of I/O Virtualization (IOV) in 10 Gigabit
Ethernet (10 GbE), today announced that its third generation I/O Virtualized 10
GbE adapter, the Neterion X3100 series, has been qualified under the prestigious
IBM ServerProven program. 

In addition to compatibility and interoperability testing, the IBM ServerProven
program requires that vendors maintain a close relationship with IBM, including
engineering level collaboration, commitment to expedite problems and a
cooperative customer support agreement. This program is designed to allow
customers to choose non-IBM options that have been tested with IBM servers,
providing peace of mind by deploying compatibility tested solutions. 

Neterion`s X3110 series adapter was conferred the ServerProven status on a broad
line of IBM System x servers, among the 34xx, 35xx, 36xx, 37xx, 38xx and 39xx
series, running on the latest editions of virtualized environments such as
VMware vSphere 4, and industry standard operating systems such as Microsoft
Windows Server 2003 and 2008 and Red Hat and SuSE Linux. 

IBM`s System x enterprise servers feature leading-edge technologies, offering
the highest level of performance and an exceptional reliability: eX4 chipset,
high-speed I/O support, large memory expansion and the latest quad- and six-core
processors. System x are also the only x86 servers in the industry to include a
centralized virtualization management console at no additional charge, making
virtualization simple and affordable. 

Neterion was invited by IBM to participate in the ServerProven program based on
its enterprise-class reliability features and a unique set of I/O virtualization
technologies, such as Hypervisor Offload (Hy-O), allowing greater Virtual
Machine (VM) density per platform, hardware-based I/O Quality of Service (IOQoS)
and Neterion's exclusive Virtual Link Technology (VLT), which presents the
adapter to the system as several fully independent controllers. 

"IBM`s enterprise servers are designed for virtualization from the ground-up,"
stated James Northington, Vice-President of Portfolio Management for IBM System
x Server Division. "The combination of Neterion`s best-in-class I/O
Virtualization technology and IBM`s superior server architecture provides an
unmatched value proposition for end-users in virtualized environments." 

"Neterion is proud to be part of IBM`s ServerProven program," said Todd Oseth,
President and CEO of Neterion. "The industry-leading 10 Gigabit Ethernet
virtualization technology is now available on industry-leading servers. It`s a
win-win for all: customers gain access to low-cost, highly scalable virtualized
servers, and resellers can service this exciting market opportunity with the
lowest price-per-VM ratio ever achieved in our industry." 

Neterion`s partner program, named Xforce, is a channel framework for value-added
resellers and system integrators. It features a motivating compensation package
and a web portal, named Xforce Central, to facilitate collaboration between
Neterion and its partners. Neterion encourages IBM System x resellers that have
not yet become Xforce partners to sign up to the program, by logging on to:
http://www.neterion.com/partners/channel/reseller.html. 

To celebrate the award of the IBM ServerProven label, Neterion will soon launch
a special incentive program for its partner community. More details will be
announced later. 

About Neterion

Neterion is the leader in I/O Virtualization for 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapters.
Xframe and the X3100 Series are the industry's highest performing line of 10 GbE
adapters, allowing IT managers to virtualize many more applications per physical
server - including the most I/O-intensive ones - drastically decreasing costs
when deploying virtualized servers. The company was founded in 2001 and is
headquartered in Cupertino, California with an additional office in Ottawa,
Canada. More information on Neterion, Inc. can be found at www.neterion.com.

&lt;p&gt;PITTSFORD, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Infinite Group, Inc. (OTCBB:IMCI) today announced that it has entered into a
nationwide Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Microsoft Corporation
(NASDAQ:MSFT). Under the agreement, Infinite Group, Inc. (IGI) can engage
Microsoft services on a formal Prime/Subcontractor basis in support of client
projects. The MSA provides an agreed-upon structure that enables the parties to
work together quickly through a Statement of Service and engage on time-critical
projects more efficiently. 

As a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, IGI is working directly with Microsoft
Sales and Services Engineers to pursue business development opportunities at the
State Government level in the Southeastern US. While IGI will offer a range of
Microsoft solutions, the initial focus of the MSA will be on messaging and
collaboration initiatives. State governments have a compelling need for unified
communication and collaboration across agencies, and the combination of IGI and
Microsoft will readily provide integrated and adaptable business solutions on
virtual machines running Windows 2008 R2 Active Directory, Exchange 2007, and
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server. Overall manageability is also simplified by
using IGI System Center experts for new "zero touch" deployments, operational
efficiency, and data protection management. 

"Our relationship with Microsoft continues to grow and create new and exciting
opportunities," said Rodney Moore, Microsoft Practice Director for Infinite
Group. "With the range of enhanced Microsoft offerings available under the
Master Services Agreement, IGI has extended our reach. Through packaged and
professional service offerings, IGI is now positioned with Microsoft for
delivery of leading-edge products such as Windows 7, System Center Configuration
Manager, Operations Manager Virtual Machine Manager, Data Protection Manager,
SharePoint, and Windows 2008 R2 for Enterprise Software Assurance Customers.
Ultimately, IGI and Microsoft will help clients put together IT game plans and
implementations that deliver meaningful cost savings." 

The demand on state government IT operations is greater than ever. Computing
environments must be improved, even as budgets shrink, by building more
efficient datacenters and gaining efficiency through virtualization and
infrastructure optimization. Careful attention must also be paid to IT security.
IGI`s Microsoft Gold Certified competencies in the areas of Advanced
Infrastructure Solutions and Unified Communications will help meet these needs
and enable IT professionals to accomplish more with shrinking resources. IGI`s
proprietary market research suggests that Information Technology Modernization
initiatives that leverage Microsoft technology are a high priority for state IT
departments. The Master Services Agreement with Microsoft is a valuable step for
IGI, enabling delivery of efficient, fast, and robust solutions. 

"IGI and Microsoft solutions can help balance computing efficiency and cost,"
said Jim Frost, IGI`s Chief Technology Officer. "The latest Microsoft
technologies enable us to integrate the business processes of a state agency
while addressing IT modernization objectives, and delivering overall operational
benefits."

&lt;p&gt;New Features in Data Recovery Utility Help System Administrators to Repair Most
Recent SQL Server Database Formats 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
OfficeRecovery.com announces improved support for Microsoft SQL Server backups
and logs in its data recovery software. Corrupted backup file recovery has been
introduced for SQL Server 2008 and x64 editions of 2008 and 2005 Servers. 

Log support is available for SQL Server versions 2008, 2005 and 2000. When
recovering a corrupted database, the user now has the Advanced mode option for
creating a set of SQL scripts with data recovered from the logs. An important
capability is to recover data even from corrupted logs, which cannot be
processed with the standard server maintenance tools. 

The results of log recovery can be used later along with the data recovered from
the main database to rebuild the corrupted SQL Server deployment. 

"OfficeRecovery products help customers to recover important data when there is
no backup available. Lately we have been asked whether it's possible to recover
when the backup is present but corrupted. With recent additions to Recovery for
SQL Server the answer is yes," says Emil Sildos, Recoveronix CEO. 

Recovery for SQL Server prices start at US $499 for a standard license. The
license allows one installation of the product and use for one server. Other
types of licenses are Enterprise, allowing two servers, and 1-Year Service, a
special license for companies providing data recovery services. 

A free demo version of Recovery for SQL Server is available at
http://www.officerecovery.com/mssql/

OfficeRecovery.com is a trade name for Recoveronix, a software company in the
data recovery business since 1998. More than 40 products offered by Recoveronix
have provided millions of businesses and individuals the chance to regain data
accessibility and integrity after the event of data corruption.

&lt;p&gt; * Icahn says search deal would enhance shareholder value&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Icahn supports Yahoo CEO Bartz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexei Oreskovic and Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE, July 17 (Reuters) - Activist
investor Carl Icahn spoke out in favor of a search deal between
Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), as talks
between the two companies appeared to regain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn declined to comment on the state of any negotiations
between Yahoo and Microsoft. He had tried to broker a
partnership between the two companies last year, when talks on
Microsoft's $47.5 billion takeover bid for Yahoo fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I've been a strong advocate of getting a search deal done
with Microsoft," Icahn, who owns about 5 percent of Yahoo and
is a director on its board, told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It would enhance value if a deal got done, because of the
synergies involved," he said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and Yahoo are close to a long-discussed search
and online advertising deal, which could be announced in the
next week, according to another source familiar with the matter
who is not associated with Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news was first reported by the AllThingsDigital blog,
which said a deal would involve Microsoft paying Yahoo several
billion dollars upfront to take over its search advertising
business and guarantee certain payments back to Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies have talked about cooperating for months,
after Microsoft's bid to buy Yahoo was rebuffed last year and
Yahoo's attempt to seal a search advertising deal with Google
Inc (GOOG.O) fell apart under regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz said in May that any deal
to spin off or combine its search assets will require a partner
with "boatloads of money." She said at the time that Yahoo was
talking "a little bit" with Microsoft, but gave no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bartz is currently out of the office for two weeks,
following knee replacement surgery, according to an email that
she sent to her employees earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn, whose firm had a 5.4 percent stake in Yahoo as of
March 31, said he remains a "strong supporter" of Bartz, who
took the reins in January from Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bartz has made a number of changes since joining Yahoo,
including shutting down underperforming websites and laying off
5 percent of the Sunnyvale, California company's staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But many investors continue to see a deal with Microsoft as
Yahoo's best option, saying it will cut costs and create an
online entity big enough to better compete with Google, the top
search company in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest discussions involve a partnership in which
Microsoft would handle search capabilities for Yahoo, while
Yahoo could potentially handle online advertising for the two
online sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Kara Swisher, co-executive editor of
AllThingsDigital, a group of high-powered Microsoft online
executives flew to Silicon Valley on Thursday to iron out
remaining issues related to technology deployment. They
included Senior Vice President of Online Audience Business
Group Yusuf Mehdi, search head Satya Nadella, top digital
executive Qi Lu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives for Microsoft and Yahoo declined to
comment. Yahoo is scheduled to report quarterly results next
Tuesday, and Microsoft on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft withdrew its $47.5 billion offer to buy Yahoo in
May 2008 after Yahoo's board said the price was too low. The
software giant then offered to buy Yahoo's search advertising
assets for $1 billion upfront, and guarantee $2.3 billion in
annual revenue for five years, in a proposal backed by Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google is the dominant player in the search market, with a
65 percent market share in June, according to comScore. Yahoo
was second with 19.6 percent, while Microsoft was third with
8.4 percent. While Microsoft's share remains small, its new
search engine Bing has won positive early reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nasdaq, Yahoo finished Friday's regular trading session
up 4 percent at $16.84 while Microsoft closed 0.6 percent lower
at $24.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic and Bill Rigby; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;West Hollywood Restaurant Owner Readies Civil Lawsuit against Sheriff`s
Department
WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The L.A. County District Attorney has refused to file DUI charges against West
Hollywood restaurant/nightclub owner Sandy Sachs, who was arrested at home in
the early hours of April 16, 2009 by Sheriff`s deputies in response to earlier
"anonymous" 911 calls, according to Horn. 

Ms. Sachs should never have been arrested, Sachs` attorney, Gerson S. Horn,
said, stating, "The actions and tactics of the West Hollywood Sheriff`s
Department were highly questionable, brutal and unconstitutional. A blood test,
forced after arrest, showed Sachs was not driving under the influence. In fact,
no police officer actually witnessed her driving or behind the wheel of her
car." 

As reported by Rush-Malloy in the Sunday July, 8, 2009 New York Daily News, the
Beverly Hills branch of the District Attorney`s offices said following a full
investigation and review of all evidence, the decision was made not to proceed
with the case. 

Horn continued, "Moreover, our investigation revealed a 911 call was made by a
girlfriend of a disgruntled short-term ex business associate, Chris Paciello,
who alleged Sachs was driving erratically. This call followed an earlier call by
an off-duty Special Enforcement Bureau Deputy Sheriff who, at Paciello`s
request, urged Sachs be arrested at her restaurant, where they would find her
drunk." Deputies responding told their dispatcher Sachs had no symptoms of being
intoxicated. Additionally, videotapes showed Sachs perfectly poised and in
control. 

Chris Paciello, aka Christian Ludwigsen, former Madonna beau, pleaded guilty in
2000 to felony/murder, conspiracy to commit murder, money laundering and armed
robbery. 

According to Horn, following another 911 call by the same girlfriend, multiple
deputies broke into Sachs` condominium complex, threw her down, handcuffed her
and hauled her to the back of a hospital for a blood test. Finally, still
handcuffed, she was jailed at the West Hollywood Sheriff`s Station. 

Horn adds, the DMV set aside any license suspension after a full hearing and now
the district attorney has refused to file criminal charges after reviewing all
evidence including videotapes, dispatch tapes and witnesses` statements. 

A civil lawsuit will soon be filed against the Sheriff's department, according
to a statement by Sachs. "Through this experience, we learned many citizens are
treated in similar fashion by the West Hollywood Sheriff`s Department. We plan
to present our case in court in hopes of preventing this from happening again."

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--

In addition, Pfizer announced that China`s Ministry of Commerce has extended its

the United States, governmental and regulatory approvals in certain other
jurisdictions, and approval by the stockholders of Wyeth.

&lt;p&gt;July 20 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which is fighting
a long-running environmental lawsuit in Ecuador, is planning to
fight the case in the United States, the Wall Street Journal
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We're not paying and we're going to fight this for years if
not decades into the future," Chevron spokesman Don Campbell
told the paper in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an ongoing suit in Ecuador, which has run for a decade
and a half, locals charge that Chevron's Texaco unit damaged
their health by dumping billions of gallons of oil-laden water
from 1972 to 1992, before turning over operations to state-run
Petroecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A ruling has been expected some time this year, but the
company has argued that public criticism of Chevron by Ecuador
President Rafael Correa makes a fair trial impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters email
seeking comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For related stories, see [ID:nN01527013]

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, July 22 (Reuters Life!) - Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N)
Japan unit said it would sell movies on flash memory cards as
small as a fingernail so that people can watch them on mobile
phones and other portable devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The movie studio plans to package pre-recorded microSD
cards together with DVDs holding the same movie content,
allowing customers to watch at home as well as on the go. These
cards will be available in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Users can watch movies stored on microSD cards on mobile
phones capable of showing terrestrial digital broadcasting, and
other portable gear such as car navigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  For new movies, the package of a DVD and microSD card is
expected to retail for 4,935 yen ($53), about 1,000 yen higher
than the DVD alone, a spokesman at the Japan unit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is difficult to make a sales forecast since this would
be the first time for Disney to put its movies in microSD
cards, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Initial titles in the microSD format include "Pirates of
the Caribbean" and "National Treasure" series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panasonic Corp (6752.T) is set to provide Disney with
microSD cards, the spokesman said.

details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; CIT makes loans to small and medium-sized businesses to buy

is hoping to stave off bankruptcy protection with emergency
financing from private investors secured on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft did not put a value on the loans CIT had issued
to customers under its pact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft works with a number of financial institutions,

"Microsoft Financing has contingency plans in place to protect
our customers and partners needs."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) knows it may be losing the battle of public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hears the outrage over lavish bonuses and does not like being excoriated on late-night comedy shows or in pop culture magazines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, come December, Goldman Sachs is expected to pay its traders and bankers out-sized bonuses for a year that looks like it will bring blockbuster profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street recruiters and headhunters have said some of Goldman's star traders, especially those in high growth areas like currency, commodities and fixed income, are in for the biggest payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among them are David Heller, Harvey Schwartz, Edward Eisler, and Pablo Salame, all of whom lead units that oversee bond, stock, currency and commodity sales and trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the foreseeable future, until investment banking really comes back, we are going to see the traders really ruling the roost on Wall Street and Goldman is the cream of the crop," said Richard Lipstein, a recruiter with Boyden Global Executive Search in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Goldman reported second-quarter net revenue of $3.4 billion, far surpassing analysts' expectations, largely because of strong trading results. The company set aside $6.65 billion in the quarter for compensation and benefits, or $226,156 per employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projected over a full year, that is $904,624 per employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAIR-RAISING BONUSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A likely return to record bonuses has raised the hackles of some commentators and politicians, even though the bank has paid back $10 billion it received from the U.S. government at the height of the banking crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat and member of the influential Senate banking committee, called Goldman "tone deaf" on the issue of compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They get all this public money, so it is a thumb in the eye when they pay these kinds of bonuses in a banking community that helped bring down our economy," Brown said in an interview. "I just would hope that they would be a little bit embarrassed and maybe pull back a little."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They think differently from the rest of us," Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's second-quarter profits and bonus cache have also drawn derision from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who called it "good news for Goldman and the people who work there" and "bad news for almost everyone else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Show's Jon Stewart mockingly celebrated Goldman as "the eye of the U.S. economic pyramid, thanks to the government-funded scaffolding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day Goldman reported its earnings, its chief financial officer, David Viniar, said the company understood the public's concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STICKS AND STONES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know it. We see it. We don't like it," Viniar said. "We believe we are doing good things. We are helping the economy recover. I don't like reading bad things about Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, known for having a "pay-for-performance" culture, is likely to take great pains to make sure bonuses stay below the record levels of 2007, when it paid out $20.2 billion, said Alan Johnson, a compensation consultant with Johnson Associates in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are very smart people," Johnson said. "I'm sure they don't want the story to be that 'We are back to the madness of before'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that does not necessarily mean Goldman will shy away from rewarding people like Heller, Schwartz, Eisler and Salame. Heller and Schwartz are based in New York, and Eisler and Salame work in London. All four were promoted last year and serve on Goldman's top management committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's trading division has generated about $18 billion from fixed income and equities trading so far this year, compared with $12 billion in all of 2008 and $27 billion in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson expects the pay of Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who in 2007 reaped about $100 million in compensation and the vesting of stock, to remain in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he said he still thinks Goldman's bonus pool will be among the biggest percentage gainers compared to its peers and enough to draw the ire of some politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The level of anger of the American people and the politicians is real and large, so hopefully we will avoid a train wreck at the end of the year," Johnson said. "But unfortunately the two trains are heading for each other on the track at this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) as the Bull of the Day
and SurModics (Nasdaq: SRDX) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO), CNOOC Ltd.
(NYSE: CEO) and Sinopec (NYSE: SNP). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We are maintaining our Buy recommendation for ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) shares
ahead of the quarterly results, reflecting its strong operational and financial
position on the back of solid business portfolio and prudent investment
approach. 

The company's capital spending plans remain unaffected by the current
commodity-price and credit market turmoil, with annual capital outlays in the
$25 billion to $30 billion range over the next five years. 

We are, however, keeping our estimates and target price unchanged. 

Bear of the Day: 

SurModics (Nasdaq: SRDX) provides surface modification and drug delivery
technologies to medical device and pharmaceutical companies. Revenue continues
to decline in fiscal 2Q09 and outlook for the whole fiscal year is bleak. 

Cypher stent sales from J declined dramatically again during the April-June
quarter and will continue to fall in the coming quarters. This is certainly not
good news to SRDX since revenue from Cypher sales makes significant contribution
to the company's top line. The current economic environment also has a negative
impact on the company's outlook. 

Both revenue and EPS will decline in fiscal 2009 and 2010. As such, we maintain
our Sell rating for the company with a price target of $15.50.

Chinese Oil Buying into Angola

On Friday, July 17, integrated oil major Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO)
announced the sale of its 20% interest in a block offshore Angola for $1.3
billion. A subsidiary of Marathon has reached an agreement with Chinese oil
companies CNOOC Ltd. (NYSE: CEO) and Sinopec (NYSE: SNP). The transaction is
expected to close by year-end 2009, subject to government and regulatory
approvals. 

Per the deal, CNOOC and Sinopec will form a 50-50 venture to buy the stake in
the subsea Angolan oilfield located some 150 kilometers off the country's coast
in a water depth of 1400 to 2200 meters. Known as `Block 32,` the
5,090-square-kilometer field has already yielded 12 successful exploration
wells. Pursuant to the proposed sale, the Houston-based, fifth-largest refiner
and marketer of petroleum products in the U.S. would retain a 10% interest in
the enterprise of the 30% it originally had.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Four free stock picks are being made available today on Zacks.com. The
industry`s leading independent research firm highlights one Zacks #1 Rank Strong
Buy or a Zacks #2 Rank Buy stock for each of the four main styles of investing:
Aggressive Growth, Growth &amp; Income, Momentum, and Value. 

The four highlighted picks are: Longtop Financial Technologies, Ltd (NYSE: LFT),
National Semiconductor Corporation (NYSE: NSM), Rovi Corp. (Nasdaq: ROVI) and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS). 

Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Four daily picks
are offered free at http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

Zacks #1 Rank Stocks have nearly tripled the S 500 since 1988, producing an
average annual return of +26%. Performance has been notable even during volatile
and down times. For example, during the last bear market, 2000-2002, the market
tumbled -37.6% - but Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained +43.8%. 

Here is a summary of today's selected stocks that are now highly rated by Zacks:

Aggressive Growth - Longtop Financial Technologies, Ltd (NYSE: LFT) 

Longtop Financial Technologies, Ltd topped analyst estimates and investors
continue to flock to Chinese stocks.

ending May 2010 are up 192% over the past 2 months.

months on strong earnings and bullish projections.

Goldman Sachs is a value stock, trading at just 10x forward earnings.

How to Regularly Access Picks from the Zacks Rank Discovery for
Free:http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

Underlying the four free stock picks is a simple truth that first appeared in a
Financial Analysts Journal article published in 1979. Leonard Zacks, a Ph.D. in
Mathematics from M.I.T. found that "earnings estimate revisions are the most
powerful force impacting stock prices." Zacks #1 Rank is awarded to a stock when
analysts sharply upgrade their estimates of what the company will earn. 

Today, Zacks is promoting its stock recommendations by offering four daily picks
free to those who register at http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

3 Things to Watch This Week

1. Reaction to Bank Earnings - Nearly 1 out every 4 reports will be from the
financial sector. Many of these are well-known firms such as Morgan Stanley
(NYSE: MS), American Express (NYSE: AXP) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB). 

Big positive surprises from Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM)
did not move the market last week, and if bank earnings are met again with
apathy this week the market will have a hard time sustaining its rally.

Some TARP Uses to Be Revealed

Is the credit issues became apparent in October 2008, much of the press with
respect to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) has revolved around the nine
largest financial institutions, including but not limited to Citigroup (NYSE:
C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), State Street (NYSE:
STT) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS). However, more than 600 institutions have
received investments from the U.S. government. 

When dealing in hundreds of billions of dollars, accountability should be
expected. Unfortunately, the U.S. Treasury so far has required only 21 of the
largest institutions to issue public filings on their dollar volumes of new
lending monthly. 

While the largest institutions have received the lion`s share of the funds, it
seems a bit unfair they are the only ones being held accountable. Moreover, it
appears the Treasury has been less than willing to date to collect such data.
However, this may be changing.

Do We Cheer Banks` Earnings?

It appears that the divide in the banking landscape between the "haves" and
"have-nots" is increasing. Even among the big banks, there is now a clear
two-tier system. 

On one hand, we have Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM), which
delivered record profits from their trading and investment banking revenues.
There is no doubt that these two managed their affairs well, have increased
their market share after the collapse of Lehman and Bear Stearns and also have
benefitted tremendously from the various programs by the Treasury and the
regulators. And, we should not forget the generous AIG (NYSE: AIG) payout to
Goldman. 

On the other hand, the second-quarter profits of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and
Citigroup (NYSE: C) were reliant on several one-time gains, resulting from asset
sales etc, while weaknesses in some businesses and continued credit
deterioration showed that there is more pain to come. 

Bank of America`s credit-card unit lost $1.6 billion amid rising delinquencies,
compared with a year-ago profit of $582 million. Its home-loan and insurance
unit lost $725 million. The bank reported $8.7 billion in credit losses, up from
$3.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Its nonperforming loans jumped to 3.3%, up
from 1.1% a year ago.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded and revised Rating Outlooks on J.P. Morgan Chase
Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., Series 2005-CIBC12 as follows: 

--$32.5 million class D to 'BBB' from 'A-'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$27.1 million class E to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'; Outlook to Negative from Stable. 

Fitch has downgraded and maintained the Rating Outlooks as follows: 

--$29.8 million class H to 'B-' from 'B'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch has downgraded and revised the Recovery Rating (RR) as follows: 

--$8.1 million class J to 'CC/RR3' from 'CCC/DR1'; 

--$8.1 million class K to 'C/RR6' from 'CC/DR3'. 

Fitch has affirmed and maintained Rating Outlooks as follows: 

--$140.1 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$163.6 million class A-3A1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$122.9 million class A-3A2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$200 million class A-3B at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$649.3 million class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$137.4 million class A-SB at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$216.7 million class A-M at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$162.5 million class A-J at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$24.4 million class F at 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$24.4 million class G at 'BB'; Outlook Negative; 

--$50 million class UHP at 'B-'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch has affirmed and revised Rating Outlooks as follows: 

--$43.3 million class B at 'AA-'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$19 million class C at 'A'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

Fitch has also affirmed and revised the RR as follows: 

--$8.1 million class L to 'C/RR6' from 'C/DR6'; 

--$5.4 million class M to 'C/RR6' from 'C/DR6'; 

--$8.1 million class N to 'C/RR6' from 'C/DR6'; 

--$5.4 million class P to 'C/RR6' from 'C/DR6'. 

The $27.1 million Class NR is not rated by Fitch. Class A-1 has paid in full. 

The downgrades and the assignment of the Recovery ratings (RR) reflect the loss
expectations on the 11 specially serviced loans (5.3%). Three loans (1.3%) have
transferred to special servicing since Fitch's last rating action in March 2009.
The Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any rating changes over the
next one to two years. 

Currently, Fitch has identified 28 Loans of Concern (10.1%), including the 11
specially serviced assets. 

The largest specially serviced asset (0.9%) is a 124,894 square foot (sf) retail
property in Pomona, CA. The loan transferred to special servicing in March 2009.
Losses are expected. 

The second largest specially serviced asset (0.7%) is a 34,938 sf retail
property in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The asset has been real estate owned
(REO) since August 2008. The property has suffered from a deteriorating retail
environment stemming from a reduction in vacation travel. The most recent
appraisal value indicates significant losses upon disposition. 

The third largest specially serviced loan (0.7%) is secured by a 129,689 sf
office building located in Scottsdale, AZ. The loan transferred to special
servicing in November 2008 when its sole tenant notified the borrower that it
intended to vacate at the end of its lease in December 2008. The property is
currently 100% vacant. The property is in foreclosure. 

The fourth largest specially serviced loan (0.6%) is collateralized by a 575,276
sf industrial building in South Plainfield, NJ, that transferred in May 2009.
The borrower and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection are currently
working on an environmental remediation plan. 

Two loans, 4250 North Fairfax Drive (2.2%), and 450 Roxbury Drive (1.2%)
maintain investment grade shadow-ratings. Watertower Place at Celebration has
paid in full. 

The largest shadow rated loan, 4250 North Fairfax Drive, is an office property
located in Arlington, VA, that reported year-end 2008 occupancy of 97%, in line
with issuance occupancy of 98.6% and a decrease in net operating income (NOI) of
5% since issuance. The second loan, 450 Roxbury Drive, is a medical office
property in Los Angeles, CA. Occupancy as of year-end 2008 was 100%, an increase
from the issuance occupancy of 88.4% and an increase in NOI of 28% since
issuance. 

As of the June 2009 distribution date, the transaction has paid down 4.7% to
$2.1 billion from $2.2 billion at issuance. Four loans, 2.8% of the pool, have
defeased. 

None of the non-defeased loans in the pool are scheduled to mature in 2009 and
10 non-defeased loans (8.3%) are scheduled to mature in 2010. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

&lt;p&gt;San Diego First Market on the West Coast to Test Coca-Cola FreestyleTM, New
Touch Screen Fountain Dispenser 


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola North America today announced that it will test Coca-Cola FreestyleTM,
The Coca-Cola Company`s new proprietary fountain dispenser in the Southern
California area. The dispenser offers consumers an unprecedented variety of
ice-cold branded beverages. Dispensers already are installed in ten Jack in the
Box restaurants in San Diego County with installations planned for select
SUBWAY, Carl`s Jr., El Pollo Loco, Noodles and Pei Wei Asian Diner restaurants
throughout the summer. 

The new self-serve fountains - which represent a complete departure from
anything The Coca-Cola Company has offered before - have been in development for
more than four years. The sleek, stylish units are touch screen operated,
enabling consumers to select from more than 100 regular and low-calorie beverage
brands - including many varieties of waters, juices, teas and sparkling
beverages that have never before been sold in the U.S. 

"We have captured the essence of what is so magical about Coca-Cola and the
fountains of the past and partnered with technology leaders across a variety of
industries to create a completely new beverage experience," said Gene Farrell,
vice president, Special Projects, Coca-Cola North America. "I believe we have
created a concept that will become the soda fountain of the future - a
representation of the way people will experience our beverages years from now." 

The Coca-Cola FreestyleTM dispenser uses proprietary PurePour TechnologyTM and
has the capacity to dispense up to 100 beverages in the same amount of space as
a standard eight-valve machine. 

The fountains also are being tested currently in select quick-serve restaurants
in Atlanta, Ga. In early testing, consumers gave the equipment high marks for
appearance, product taste, beverage selection and overall experience.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
As wireless mobile networks continue to grow and become more robust, the path to
Long Term Evolution (LTE) remains certain with operators deploying the
technology the first half of this next decade, a new Visant Strategies report
finds. 

"LTE for many operators, if not almost all operators, is the 4G end goal for
upgrading wireless networks," said report author Andy Fuertes of Visant
Strategies. "In the most established markets carriers are systematically
deploying upgrades to HSPA or CDMA2000 and awaiting the commercial arrival of
LTE, which will begin to be strongly deployed within three to five years. 

"Despite announced deployment roll backs of LTE due to recent economy woes there
really is no fragmentation when it comes to 4G," Fuertes added. "All operators,
except for the comparatively few that will migrate to mobile WiMAX, will use LTE
to create an OFDM-based 4G wireless network, creating unprecedented economies of
scale for LTE handsets and infrastructure." 

According to the findings in "Long Term Evolution 2009: The World Role of LTE in
Mobile Wireless Networks through 2015," LTE macro base stations will account for
roughly 10% of total deployed macro base stations by year-end 2015, with the
bulk of the LTE shipments occurring between 2012 and 2015. Also, over 60 million
LTE femtocells will be shipped in 2015, with the Asia-Pacific market accounting
for a good percentage of these shipments 

"LTE really is the Hollywood ending to real 4G," said Larry Swasey of Visant
Strategies. "While there will be a continued use of GSM and EDGE Evolution in
lower-tier mobile markets and WCDMA and CDMA EV-DO throughout the world, when it
comes to real 4G, LTE will eventually account for over 90% of global
subscribers." 

The study evaluates LTE-based services, devices, selling points and
infrastructure on a world-by-region basis through 2015. Annual world and
regional shipments for LTE handsets, base stations and femtocells are given as
are LTE subscribers, revenues, average revenue per unit, handset ASPs and LTE
femtocell subscribers and revenues.

&lt;p&gt;The Alabama Property and Casualty Insurer is Using Lyza to Integrate and Analyze
Historical Data for Reinsurance Modeling and Rate Analysis
DENVER--(Business Wire)--
Lyzasoft, Inc. announced today that Baldwin Mutual Insurance Company, serving
Alabama`s property and casualty insurance needs since 1921, has purchased Lyza,
the company`s desktop data analysis solution, to integrate and analyze
historical data for reinsurance modeling and rate analysis. 

"As a small, regional insurance company, we operate under the constraints of a
tight budget," said Kevin Russell, Vice President with Baldwin Mutual Insurance
Company, who in his role is responsible for business intelligence (BI) for
modeling policies, pricing, reinsurance, financials, and accounting. "Our BI
initiatives seem relatively straightforward until you recognize not only where
some of this historical data comes from, but also the sizes of the policy and
claims data sources alone. The systems in place before Lyza required intensive
development, custom scripting, and rework," Russell said. 

Accessing Legacy Data

Baldwin Mutual Insurance has legacy data stored in spreadsheets, AS/400 spool
files, AS/400 DB2 tables and MySQL&#174; databases. It had become increasingly
difficult to access historical data and to integrate these sources manually each
time they need to perform an analysis to derive meaningful business insights. 

Baldwin Mutual Insurance previously resorted to performing SQL build-ups of the
data through temporary tables until achieving the desired query results-not an
efficient solution. "We had no automation in place, so it was a custom build
every time there was a request for a change to the report, which was taking a
considerable amount of time and effort," Russell said. 

"With Lyza, we can visualize each step in the data integration process and
evaluate the results immediately, without waiting for lengthy SQL queries to
run," Russell added. "We've used Lyza extensively to pull datasets from
different sources and different formats. It is enabling us to quickly
consolidate data, and to conduct rate reviews and to create ad hoc financial
reporting for our accountants in a timely fashion." 

According to Russell, the insurance carrier`s biggest use of Lyza is in
"breaking down the policy"; understanding how much premium was generated and how
many claims were filed in order to determine whether rates are adequate. "A
recent analysis conducted with Lyza concluded that pricing needed to be adjusted
in numerous locations in order stay competitive, attract new customers, and to
keep our current client base happy," Russell said. "Lyza has proven to be an
invaluable tool for us." 

About Lyzasoft, Inc.

Lyza desktop software enables analysts to synthesize, explore and visualize
data, then to publish compelling reports - all without the reliance on lengthy
IT development cycles. With a visual drag-and-drop interface, spreadsheet-like
formulas, interactive charting and statistics -- Lyza keeps you in touch with
the data as you observe relationships, refine your assumptions, and solve
problems iteratively. Lyza provides an environment that enables the sharing and
harvesting of data. Derivational insight is provided for the analysts, while
also providing the transparency and manageability of information flows for the
business and IT. 

Founded in 2008, Lyzasoft, Inc. is a spin-off of a successful business
intelligence consulting practice. For more information, please call 303.825.1040

broad-based unit case volume growth of 5 percent, cycling 5 percent growth in
the prior year quarter. In the quarter, unit case volume growth increased
strongly in key emerging markets with 33 percent growth in India and 14 percent
growth in China. We realized sound unit case volume growth in other key markets
around the world including Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Thailand, Korea and
Northwest Europe. 

Globally, we gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink
beverages for the eighth consecutive quarter. Through our global Open Happiness

targets, despite very challenging global economic conditions. We outperformed
the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry in most of our key markets and drove
further global volume and value share gains. Our consistent strategies are
working, and together with our productivity efforts, we are prudently focused on
investing in the long-term growth of our resilient business. Our investments in
key growth markets contributed to the good performance in China, Mexico, India
and Brazil. And, with our disciplined approach to productivity initiatives, we
remain on track to achieve our $500 million target in annualized savings by 2011
and expect to deliver more than half of the savings by the end of this year." 

"We have also begun rolling out our 2020 Vision, the roadmap for winning
together with our worldwide bottling partners. Our 2020 Vision roadmap is
bringing new clarity and focus to our global business and is ensuring that our
system is ideally positioned to make the most of the abundant opportunities
ahead of us. We believe our unique global franchise model is the best way to win
in the market, while providing sustainable profitable growth for our customers
and shareowners. Our priorities remain centered on superior execution to drive

The Coca-Cola Company and our system." 

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Our reported operating income decreased 9 percent in the quarter versus the
second quarter of 2008. Items impacting comparability reduced second quarter
operating income by $72 million in 2009 and by $110 million in 2008. After
considering these items, operating income was down 10 percent in the quarter. As
in the first quarter, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar continued to
impact our results. Excluding the impact of currency, operating income increased
4 percent in the quarter on a comparable basis. Year-to-date 2009, reported
operating income decreased 6 percent, while comparable currency neutral
operating income increased 9 percent, exceeding our long-term growth target. 

For the second quarter of 2009, we are reporting earnings per share of $0.88, a
44 percent increase versus the second quarter of 2008. Reported earnings per
share for the second quarter of 2009 and 2008 included a net charge of $0.04 and
$0.40 per share, respectively, primarily related to charges recorded by our
equity method investees, restructuring charges and asset write-downs. After

were $0.92, a decrease of 9 percent versus the second quarter of 2008.
Year-to-date 2009, reported earnings per share increased 18 percent, while

Eurasia &amp; Africa

* Our Eurasia and Africa Group`s unit case volume increased 7 percent in the
quarter, successfully cycling 6 percent growth in the prior year quarter.
Year-to-date, unit case volume increased 5 percent, cycling 6 percent growth in
the prior year. Net revenues for the quarter decreased 8 percent, reflecting a
double-digit negative impact from currencies, partially offset by positive
pricing and mix and a 2 percent increase in concentrate sales. Operating income
in the quarter decreased 10 percent, reflecting the decrease in net revenues
primarily related to currency, and the continued investment in key marketing and
business initiatives. 
* Eurasia and Africa delivered solid unit case volume growth, with sparkling
beverages increasing 6 percent and still beverages increasing 13 percent in the
quarter. Unit case volume increased across most markets in the quarter, led by
India increasing 33 percent, cycling 6 percent growth in the prior year. India
gained volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages. Southern
Eurasia increased unit case volume 5 percent in the quarter, cycling 11 percent
growth in the prior year. 
* In the quarter, unit case volume growth was even in South Africa, increased 9
percent in Nigeria, increased 15 percent in Pakistan and increased 4 percent in
Turkey. Russia`s unit case volume declined 9 percent in the quarter, reflecting
the impact of a continued challenging macroeconomic environment.

Europe

* Our Europe Group`s unit case volume increased 1 percent in the quarter,
cycling even volume performance in the prior year quarter, reflecting a
challenging macroeconomic environment. Year-to-date, unit case volume decreased
1 percent, cycling 2 percent growth in the prior year. Net revenues for the
quarter decreased 17 percent, primarily driven by a double-digit negative impact
from currencies and a 2 percent decrease in concentrate sales, partially offset
by positive pricing and mix. Operating income decreased 15 percent reflecting
the impact of the lower net revenues, primarily related to currency, partially
offset by tight expense control. 
* Unit case volume growth in Northwest Europe was partially offset by weakness
in Spain and Eastern Europe due to significant macroeconomic challenges in those
regions. 
* In the quarter, Europe gained value share, and volume and value share across
key countries.

Latin America

* Our Latin America Group continued to deliver strong unit case volume growth of
6 percent in the quarter, successfully cycling 7 percent growth in the prior
year quarter. Year-to-date, unit case volume increased 6 percent, cycling 8
percent growth in the prior year. Net revenues for the quarter decreased 6
percent, primarily due to a double-digit negative impact from currencies,
partially offset by an 8 percent increase in concentrate sales and positive
pricing and mix. Operating income for the quarter decreased 11 percent
reflecting the net revenue decrease, primarily related to currency, and
continuing investment in key marketing and business initiatives. 
* Strong unit case volume growth of 6 percent in the quarter was led by a 6
percent increase in Mexico, a 5 percent increase in Brazil and a 6 percent
increase in Argentina. 
* Latin America delivered growth across the portfolio with sparkling beverages
increasing 3 percent and still beverages increasing 24 percent for the quarter.
Notably brand Coca-Cola grew 4 percent and Trademark Coca-Cola grew 3 percent in
the quarter.

North America

* Our North America Group`s unit case volume declined 1 percent in the quarter
primarily due to the continuing difficult macroeconomic environment partially
offset by holiday shifts into the quarter and strong customer and consumer
programs. In the quarter, Retail unit case volume declined 4 percent, while
Foodservice and Hospitality unit case volume increased 7 percent, due to strong
growth in still beverages through tea, coffee and smoothies, as well as
improving trends in sparkling beverages. Year-to-date, unit case volume
decreased 2 percent, cycling even volume growth in the prior year. Net revenues
for the quarter decreased 2 percent, reflecting a 1 percent decrease in
concentrate sales and a 1 percent negative currency impact. Operating income was
even in the quarter reflecting tight expense control and a benefit from
productivity initiatives. 
* North America grew volume share slightly in the quarter and gained significant
value share for the third consecutive quarter. 
* Though integrated marketing programs positively impacted sparkling beverages
and improved brand health, unit case volume for sparkling beverages declined 2
percent in the quarter reflecting industry-leading bottler pricing. Importantly,
Coca-Cola Zero unit case volume grew 24 percent in the quarter, delivering more
than 12 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. 
* Still beverage unit case volume increased 1 percent in the quarter, led by
strong performance in our Foodservice and Hospitality business. Strong share
performance of Fuze, glac&#233;au and Trademark Simply led to share gains for the
eighth consecutive quarter. Additionally, the performance of these premium
brands delivered significant value share gains in the quarter.

Pacific

* Our Pacific Group delivered unit case volume growth of 6 percent in the
quarter, successfully cycling 5 percent growth in the prior year quarter.
Year-to-date, unit case volume growth increased 5 percent, cycling 7 percent
growth in the prior year. Net revenues for the quarter were even, reflecting an
8 percent increase in concentrate sales offset by negative country mix.
Operating income for the quarter decreased 2 percent reflecting even net
revenues and continued investments in key business initiatives and marketing
efficiencies. 
* Pacific delivered unit case volume growth across the portfolio with sparkling
beverages increasing 7 percent and still beverages increasing 5 percent in the
quarter. Importantly, Trademark Coca-Cola grew 6 percent in the quarter. 
* In China, unit case volume grew 14 percent in the second quarter driven by
double-digit growth in Trademark Sprite and Minute Maid as well as high
single-digit growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, contributing to volume and value
share gains across sparkling and still beverages. 
* In Japan, unit case volume growth was 2 percent in the quarter and continued
to outperform the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry resulting in the fifth
consecutive quarter of share gains. Sparkling beverage unit case volume grew 6
percent in the quarter, led by Trademark Coca-Cola with unit case volume growth
of 10 percent. Still beverage unit case volume growth of 1 percent was driven by
unit case volume growth of 9 percent in Sokenbicha partially offset by a unit
case volume decline in Georgia Coffee. Due to the weak economy, Georgia Coffee
was negatively impacted by shifts away from the at-work vending channel.

Bottling Investments

* Our Bottling Investments Group`s unit case volume decreased 3 percent in the
quarter, reflecting bottling divestitures in the prior year partially offset by
organic growth. Net revenues decreased 17 percent in the quarter reflecting
prior year divestitures, a double-digit negative currency impact and negative
mix. Operating income declined 22 percent primarily driven by the prior year
divestitures and a double-digit negative currency impact, partially offset by
tight expense control.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Net operating revenues for the second quarter decreased 9 percent, primarily
driven by a 9 percent negative currency impact, a 2 percent negative impact from
structural changes and a 1 percent negative impact from pricing and mix, offset
by a 3 percent increase in concentrate sales. Structural changes relate to the
divestiture of certain bottling operations in 2008. Excluding the impact of
these divestitures, our comparable currency neutral net operating revenues
increased 6 percent year-to-date, in line with our long-term growth target. 

Cost of goods sold decreased 8 percent for the quarter. This decrease is
primarily driven by a 3 percent increase in concentrate sales offset by a 5
percent decrease from currencies and a 3 percent decrease from structural
changes related to bottling investments. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 8 percent in the quarter
primarily driven by an 8 percent negative currency impact. The positive impact
from prior year divestitures was offset by the impact of lower incentive costs
in the prior year and the timing of certain corporate expenses in the current
quarter. 

Second quarter operating income decreased 9 percent versus 2008. Items impacting
comparability reduced second quarter operating income by $72 million in 2009 and
by $110 million in 2008 and were related to restructuring costs, productivity
initiatives and asset impairments. After considering items impacting
comparability, operating income was down 10 percent for the quarter. Currency
negatively impacted comparable operating income by 14 percent in the quarter.
For the third quarter of 2009, we expect currencies to have an estimated 12 to
14 percent negative impact on operating income, including the anticipated
benefits of our hedging coverage and the exchange rates we are cycling in the
prior year. In addition, we currently expect currencies to have a low
single-digit negative impact on operating income in the fourth quarter. 

Cash from operations was $3.7 billion year-to-date compared with $3.2 billion in
the prior year period, an increase of 14 percent. This increase was driven by an
improvement in working capital versus the prior year. 

Effective Tax Rate

The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.9 percent. The underlying
effective tax rate on operations for the quarter was 23.5 percent. The variance
between the reported rate and the underlying rate was due to the tax impact of
various separately disclosed items impacting comparability. 

We estimate that our underlying effective tax rate on operations for the full
year 2009 will be approximately 23.5 percent. Our estimated underlying effective
tax rate reflects, among other items, our best estimates of 2009 operating
results and foreign currency exchange rates. If actual results are different
than these estimates the underlying effective tax rate could change. This rate
does not reflect the impact of discrete events, which, if and when they occur,
are separately recognized in the appropriate period. 

Items Impacting Prior Year Results

Second quarter 2008 results included a net charge of $0.40 per share primarily
related to charges recorded by our equity method investees, restructuring
charges and asset write-downs. 

First quarter 2008 results included a net charge of $0.03 per share primarily
related to restructuring charges and asset write-downs. 

NOTES

* All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the
period to those of the prior year comparable period. 
* All references to unit case volume percentage changes are computed based on
average daily sales for all periods presented. 
* 2009 year-to-date results are positively impacted by five additional selling
days, which will be offset by six fewer selling days in the fourth quarter. 
* Our long-term profit targets are on a comparable currency neutral basis.

 (6)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended June 27, 2008, was reduced by approximately $1.1 billion for Bottling Investments, primarily as a result of our proportionate share of an impairment charge recorded by Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.

 (7)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended June 27, 2008, was increased by approximately $102 million for Bottling Investments and Corporate, primarily due to the gain on the sale of Refrigerantes Minas Gerais Ltda.

 (7)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the six months ended June 27, 2008, was reduced by approximately $1.1 billion for Bottling Investments, primarily as a result of our proportionate share of an impairment charge recorded by CCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (8)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the six months ended June 27, 2008, was increased by approximately $102 million for Bottling Investments and Corporate, primarily due to the gain on the sale of Remil to Coca-Cola FEMSA.

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because 
 they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability.  Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.  See the tables above for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the six months ended July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008.

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because 
 they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.  See the tables above for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008.

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because 
 they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.  See the tables above for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the six months ended July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and 
 not as an alternative for, the Company`s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


At 96-week follow up, data from the MERIT ES analysis show that treatment-na&#239;ve
HIV patients taking Celsentri/Selzentry (maraviroc), in combination with
Combivir&#174; (zidovudine/lamivudine) experienced comparable virologic suppression
to undetectable levels and significantly greater increases in CD4 T-cell count
through 96-weeks, compared to patients taking efavirenz in combination with
zidovudine/ lamivudine. The data also show the favorable tolerability of
Celsentri/Selzentry, which was associated with fewer discontinuations due to
adverse events.1

The 96-week results from MERIT ES were presented today at the 5th International
AIDS Society (IAS) Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention in
Cape Town, South Africa. MERIT ES is an analysis of the data from the MERIT
(Maraviroc versus Efavirenz Regimens as Initial Therapy) study following
retesting of screening samples using the enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay -
therefore representing a subset of the MERIT primary analysis population. This
enhanced sensitivity test was not available at the time of the MERIT study and
is the only version of Trofile currently available. 

Results from the MERIT ES population show that, at 96 weeks, a similar number of
patients taking Celsentri/Selzentry achieved undetectable viral load compared to
those taking efavirenz (&lt;50 copies/mL = 58.5 percent and 62.4 percent,
respectively). Comparable results were seen based on a Time to Loss of Virologic
Response* (TLOVR) analysis (&lt;50 copies/mL = 60.5 percent on Celsentri/Selzentry
versus 60.7 percent on efavirenz). Results also show that, at the end of almost
two years, a similar number of patients taking Celsentri/Selzentry remained on
therapy compared to those taking efavirenz (66.9 percent and 66.0 percent,
respectively). 

"Durable HIV treatments are critical as they better ensure that patients remain
on therapy, which can delay disease progression and help patients live
considerably longer lives," said Dr. Michael Saag, professor of Medicine and
director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham, who presented the results. "These results further support
maraviroc`s durability and safety profile and, therefore, offer the potential to
enhance currently available treatment options for treatment-na&#239;ve HIV patients."


For patients from the MERIT ES population with higher viral loads at screening
(&gt;100,000 copies/mL), a similar number of patients taking Celsentri/Selzentry
maintained undetectable viral load compared to those taking efavirenz (56.0
percent and 56.7 percent, respectively, based on TLOVR analysis). Additionally,
at Week 96 the increase in CD4 T-cell count was significantly greater with
Celsentri/Selzentry than with efavirenz (median change from baseline was +212
cells/mm3 and +171 cells/mm3, respectively, a difference of 41 cells/mm3 [95
percent CI: 17, 65]). 

Safety results from the full MERIT population show that, among those patients
who remained on therapy (total patient years of exposure of 506 years for
Celsentri/Selzentry and 507.9 years for efavirenz), less than half the number of
malignancies were observed in patients taking Celsentri/Selzentry compared to
those taking efavirenz (1.1 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively). There were
also fewer cases of tuberculosis with Celsentri/Selzentry compared to efavirenz
(0.3 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively). 

At 96-weeks, similar to 48-weeks, the most common adverse events reported by
patients taking Celsentri/Selzentry were nausea, headache, fatigue and
dizziness. For patients taking efavirenz, nausea, headache, diarrhea, dizziness,
vomiting and abnormal dreams were the most commonly reported adverse events. 

Among those patients taking Celsentri/Selzentry in MERIT at 96-weeks, 1.5
percent had elevated LDL-cholesterol levels that exceeded established thresholds
to consider lipid-lowering drug initiation (defined by the NCEP guidelines)2,
compared to 9.9 percent for patients taking efavirenz. 

About MERIT and MERIT ES

MERIT is an ongoing randomized, blinded, non-inferiority trial in
treatment-na&#239;ve patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1. The Phase 3 trial compares the
safety and efficacy of Celsentri/Selzentry 300 mg twice daily versus efavirenz
600 mg once daily, administered with the fixed-dose combination Combivir (a
standard of care at the time of trial enrollment). Results of MERIT at 48-weeks
were presented in July 2007 at the IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment
and Prevention in Sydney, Australia. 

Overall for the MERIT ES analysis, 106 patients (15 percent) originally
classified as having CCR5-tropic virus were reclassified as having dual or mixed
tropic virus. Results of MERIT ES at 48-weeks were presented in October 2008 at
the 48th Annual Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy
(ICAAC)/ 46th Annual Meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America
(IDSA) in Washington D.C., USA. 

* A patient classified as a TLOVR non-responder required two consecutive viral
load measurements of &gt;50 copies/mL. A patient classified as a primary efficacy
non-responder required one viral load measurement of &gt;50 copies/mL. 

About Celsentri/Selzentry

Celsentri/Selzentry is an oral medicine that blocks viral entry to human cells.
Rather than fighting HIV inside white blood cells, Celsentri/Selzentry prevents
the virus from entering uninfected cells by blocking its predominant entry
route, the CCR5 co-receptor. 

Celsentri/Selzentry has been approved for use in several markets around the
world including the United States, Canada and European Union in combination with
other antiretroviral medicinal products, for the treatment of experienced adult
patients with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable. 

In South Africa, maraviroc is not available commercially and is currently under
review by the Medicine Control Council. Maraviroc is marketed under the trade
name Selzentry&#174; in the United States and Celsentri&#174; in all other countries in
which it is approved.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) is set to begin
shipping new UNIX servers using next-generation microprocessors
called POWER7 in the first half of 2010, in an attempt to win more
customers away from rivals like Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O and
Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; IBM also said customers can buy current servers with POWER6
microprocessors and upgrade to POWER7 as they become available,
to ensure potential buyers don't hold off purchases until next
year. Some customers will start testing the new products soon,
it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM led the $17 billion market for UNIX servers, top-end
computer systems that are popular with corporations, with a
share of around 37 percent in 2008, followed by Sun with 28
percent, according to market research firm IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said last week that it gained share in the Unix
market in the second quarter for the fifth straight quarter,
although its systems and technology business suffered a 26
percent year-on-year decline in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott Handy, vice president of marketing, strategy and
sales support for IBM Power Systems, said IBM wanted to make
sure those who were considering a switch from Sun or HP found
IBM's product launches and upgrade processes both predictable
and smooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has said it expects to benefit from uncertainty
over how Sun's products might change following its acquisition
by Oracle Corp ORCL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will surprise some of our customers with how cleanly we
can take what they bought ... and upgrade them to the new POWER7
based system," Handy told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And of course that really helps our sellers keep selling
during the third and fourth quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said the upgrade from POWER6 to POWER7 will be easy,
done simply by swapping the processor "books" that contain the
chips and memory. IBM software can also help to ease the
process by allowing applications to run without any
disruptions, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said POWER7 will be more efficient than the POWER6,
which was launched in May 2007, capable of two to three times
performance while using the same amount of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Details on pricing were not yet available, but Handy said
the company was planning the transition so there would be no
penalty for buying POWER6 now and upgrading later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)

&lt;p&gt;Os contribuintes americanos obt&#234;m um retorno de 23%
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
A empresa The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) anunciou hoje que resgatou os
t&#237;tulos de subscri&#231;&#227;o que o governo dos EUA recebeu em conex&#227;o ao seu

valor total determinado pelo Minist&#233;rio da Fazenda dos EUA. 

Apesar de haver diversas maneiras de avaliar os t&#237;tulos, incluindo por meio de
uma concorr&#234;ncia p&#250;blica, acreditamos que no contexto das a&#231;&#245;es extraordin&#225;rias

Em junho, a Goldman Sachs reembolsou o investimento da Fazenda dos EUA de 10
bilh&#245;es e durante os oito meses de investimento, a firma pagou 318 milh&#245;es em
dividendos preferenciais. Estamos satisfeitos com o pagamento dos dividendos e
com o resgate dos t&#237;tulos, cujo total de 1,418 bilh&#245;es de d&#243;lares representa um
retorno anualizado de 23% para os contribuintes americanos. 

"Este retorno reflete a ajuda do governo, que beneficiou o sistema financeiro, a
nossa firma e os nossos acionistas", disse Lloyd C. Blankfein, presidente do
conselho e diretor executivo. "Estamos agradecidos pelos esfor&#231;os do governo e
satisfeitos por este dinheiro adicional poder ser usado pelo governo para
revitalizar a economia, uma prioridade onde todos temos uma participa&#231;&#227;o comum".


Ele acrescentou, "Como a Goldman Sachs fornece consultoria &#224;s empresas com

&lt;p&gt;I contribuenti statunitensi realizzano un rendimento del 23%
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Il Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) ha annunciato oggi la propria
riscossione dei warrant che il governo USA ha ricevuto in relazione al suo
investimento nell'azienda mediante il Capital Purchase Program del TARP al costo
di 1,1 miliardi di dollari, il valore completo determinato dal Dipartimento del
Tesoro americano. 

Sebbene esistano molti modi per valutare i warrant, come ad esempio attraverso
un'asta pubblica, riteniamo che nell'ambito delle azioni straordinarie compiute
dal governo per contribuire a stabilizzare il sistema finanziario, questa
valutazione dei warrant rispecchi il loro valore completo ed equo. 

A giugno, Goldman Sachs aveva ripagato l'investimento dei titoli del Tesoro di
stato USA di 10 milioni di dollari e nel corso degli otto mesi
dell'investimento,l'azienda aveva pagato la somma di 318 milioni di dollari in
dividendi di azioni privilegiate. Siamo lieti di constatare che il pagamento dei
dividendi e il riscatto dei warrant, cje ammonta a un totale di 1,418 miliardi
di dollari, rappresenta un rendimento su base annua del 23% per i contribuenti
statunitensi. 

"Tale rendimento &#232; indicativo del supporto del governo di cui hanno beneficiato
il sistema finanziario, la nostra azienda e i nostri azionisti," ha affermato
Lloyd C. Blankfein, Presidente e CEO. "Siamo grati per gli sforzi compiuti dal
governo e siamo lieti che questi fondi aggiuntivi possono essere utilizzati dal
governo per rivitalizzare l'economia, una priorit&#224; in cui tutti noi abbiamo un
interesse comune." 

Ha poi aggiunto, "Dal momento che Goldman Sachs fornisce consulenza alle aziende
in merito ai loro piani di crescita e raccoglie capitale per sostenere quella
crescita, il miglior ambiente operativo per noi &#232; quello in cui la fiducia del
consumatore e dell'azienda e la crescita economica prosperano. Siamo impegnati
ad effettuare l'allocazione del capitale, a fornire liquidit&#224; ai nostri clienti
per contribuire a stimolare la crescita e la creazione di posti di lavoro."

&lt;p&gt;US-Steuerzahler erzielen 23-prozentige Rendite
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) gab heute bekannt, dass das Unternehmen die
Schatzanweisungen, welche die US-Regierung in Verbindung mit der Investition der
Regierung in das Investment- und Effektenhaus mittels des TARP Capital Purchase
Program in H&#246;he von 1,1 Milliarden US-Dollar t&#228;tigte, dessen gesamter Wert vom
US-Finanzministerium festgelegt wurde, abgel&#246;st hat. 

Zwar gibt es eine ganze Reihe von M&#246;glichkeiten, die Schatzanweisungen zu
valutieren, darunter auch die einer &#246;ffentlichen Auktion, doch sind wir der
Auffassung, dass angesichts der au&#223;erordentlichen Ma&#223;nahmen, welche die
Regierung einleitete, um zur Stabilisierung des Finanzsystems beizutragen, diese
Art der Valutierung der Schatzanweisungen dem umfassenden und angemessenen Wert
dieser Aktion gleichkommt. 

Im Juni zahlte Goldman Sachs die Anlage des US-Finanzministeriums in H&#246;he von 10
Milliarden US-Dollar zur&#252;ck, und w&#228;hrend der achtmonatigen Laufzeit dieser
Anlage sch&#252;ttete das Unternehmen 318 Millionen US-Dollar an Vorzugsdividenden
aus. Wir sind erfreut, dass die Aussch&#252;ttung der Dividenden und die Abl&#246;sung der
Schatzanweisungen, deren Gesamtsumme 1,418 Milliarden US-Dollar betr&#228;gt, eine
annualisierte Rendite von 23 Prozent f&#252;r die US-amerikanischen Steuerzahler
einbrachte. 

&#8222;Dieser Ertrag spiegelt die Unterst&#252;tzung der Regierung wider, die das
Finanzsystem, unser Unternehmen und unsere Aktion&#228;ren beg&#252;nstigte", so Lloyd C.
Blankfein, Chairman und CEO. &#8222;Wir sind dankbar f&#252;r die Bem&#252;hungen der Regierung
und freuen uns, dass dieses zus&#228;tzliche Geld von der Regierung f&#252;r die
Wiederankurbelung der Wirtschaft verwendet werden kann, eine Priorit&#228;t an der
wir alle gemeinsames Interesse haben." 

Lloyd C. Blankkfein erg&#228;nzte: &#8222;Da Goldman Sachs Unternehmen bei ihren
Wachstumspl&#228;nen ber&#228;t und deren Kapital erh&#246;ht, um dieses Wachstum zu
unterst&#252;tzen, ist f&#252;r uns das beste und nachhaltigste operative Umfeld eines,
bei dem das Verbraucher- und das Gesch&#228;ftsklima sowie das Wirtschaftswachstum
gedeiht. Wir sind verpflichtet, unseren Kunden Kapital zuzuteilen und sie mit
Liquidit&#228;t zu versorgen, um das Wachstum und die Entstehung von Arbeitspl&#228;tzen
zu f&#246;rdern."

&lt;p&gt; * CEO Iger foresees sale of customer preferences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Warns on privacy concerns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PASADENA, Calif., July 22 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co
(DIS.N) chief Robert Iger said on Wednesday advertising will
rapidly grow more sophisticated as media firms begin tracking
consumer preferences and selling the data on to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Iger warned that privacy concerns may come to the fore
with the growing ability of Web ads to monitor individual
preferences and target surfers with custom ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger has warned that fundamental changes now underway in
the broadcast and cable industries may permanently cut TV
advertising sales and prices, leaving traditional media
companies looking for ways to make up that revenue when the
economy recovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The executive told the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference
that media companies can pump up online sales volumes by either
selling consumer information or by marketing directly to
consumers based on individual tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we know that you've gone online and looked at five
different autos online, you are a great consumer for us to
serve up a 30-second ad for a car," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we could sell your behavior to an advertiser -- I am
actually pretty bullish about what technology is going to allow
in terms of behavioral tracking. I think we are going to have
information to sell to marketers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger conceded that consumer groups have raised privacy
concerns about such practices, but argued that such complaints
generally came from older consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Kids don't care," Iger said, adding that when he talked to
his adult children about their online privacy concerns "they
can't figure out what I'm talking about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's experience as an early proponent of putting
primetime TV shows and movies online, on Apple Inc's (AAPL.O)
iTunes and on its own broadband player gave it "ample evidence
that people are willing to pay for quality, choice content,"
Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a significant amount of headroom in being able to
charge for something on the Internet," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney estimates that people pay $5 per hour to see a movie
in theater, 75 cents to read a book or magazine, 50 cents per
hour for cable and 25 cents per hour for Internet content, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUBSCRIPTION PROMISING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger also predicted that media companies would use multiple
methods to monetize content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He reiterated Disney was developing a subscription service
to sell premium content like TV shows and movies but did not
indicate when such a service would be launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Subscription has the most promise because people will pay
to subscribe to something that is really good. Our brand offers
us some rich opportunities for subscription," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger, the first chief of a major media company to sell
content through iTunes and to make its prime time TV shows
available online in an ad-supported player, joked that while
Disney was was at the vanguard of user-generated content, he
missed the boat by not foreseeing the development of video
sharing phenomenon YouTube.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I kick myself for having put ("America's Funniest Home
Videos" ) on TV 20 years ago, and when I became interested in
what the Internet could do I didn't come up with YouTube," he
said. "I could kick myself for that."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Wednesday it is releasing the code for Windows 7 to PC manufacturers, keeping the software company on track to have machines running its new operating system in the stores by late October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move means Hewlett-Packard Co, Dell Inc, Acer Inc and other computer makers can start to load up new PCs, laptops and netbooks with the operating system, the successor to the unpopular Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Microsoft and the manufacturers are hoping the full launch of Windows 7, scheduled for October 22, will help lift PC sales out of the slump caused by the global economic downturn, and give the holiday shopping season an extra lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers have been testing early versions of Windows 7 for several months, but this week marks the release of the "gold code," according to a Lenovo Group Ltd executive, referring to the software industry jargon for the finished product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC makers no longer have to fly discs in helicopters to their manufacturing plants, as the transfer is now done electronically. But it still marks a dramatic day as manufacturers hustle to get new products into stores in time for the release date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machines that have Windows 7 installed, or devices that are compatible with it, will simply have the Windows 7 logo on them, a Microsoft executive said. The company will not be splashing the word "capable" around in marketing efforts, after it received complaints at its last launch that some machines branded "Windows Vista Capable" could only run the lower-end versions of the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few industry watchers expect such problems to hit Microsoft this time around as the company has spent more time making sure PCs will be able to run the new software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Half Income From Continuing Operations Up 33.8 Percent Versus Prior Year 

First Half Metallurgical Coal Sales Totaled 2.8 Million Tons; Third Quarter 2009
Metallurgical Coal Sales Expected to Total 1.4 - 1.6 Million Tons 
TAMPA, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Walter Energy(NYSE:WLT), a leading U.S. producer and exporter of premium
metallurgical coal for the global steel industry, today reported income from
continuing operations of $11.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the
quarter ended June 30, 2009, compared to $45.6 million, or $0.85 per diluted
share in the second quarter 2008. The Company`s former Financing and
Homebuilding operations have now been classified as discontinued operations. 

"The Company delivered a solid second quarter despite difficult market
conditions," said Walter Energy Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Victor
P. Patrick. "Our shipments improved dramatically in June after a lull in April
and May and we are now seeing signs of improvement in the global steel industry.
With ample inventory and the ability to start the Mine No. 7 East longwall as
soon as market conditions warrant, we are well positioned to take advantage of a
strengthening market." 

Second Quarter 2009 Financial &amp; Operating Results from Continuing Operations

Net sales and revenues for the second quarter 2009 totaled $169.1 million,
compared to $274.4 million in the prior-year period, and operating income
totaled $21.4 million for the quarter, down $50.6 million versus the prior-year
period. Both net sales and revenues and operating income were negatively
impacted by lower metallurgical coal and coke sales volumes. 

Operating income for the first six months of 2009 totaled $122.9 million, up
18.5 percent compared to the first six months of 2008. 

Underground Mining

Metallurgical coal sales volumes were 1.1 million tons in the second quarter at
an average selling price of $116.15 per short ton FOB Port, versus 1.7 million
tons at an average price of $110.79 in the prior-year period. Sales volumes
declined 37.6 percent on lower global metallurgical coal demand resulting from
lower steel capacity utilization. Second quarter results also include fewer tons
shipped due to the delivery of approximately 300,000 tons late in the first
quarter originally expected to be shipped in the second quarter. 

"The improving shipments were very encouraging, with 630,000 tons sold in June
alone. As a result, we exceeded our initial sales expectations for the quarter
by about 100,000 tons," said Jim Walter Resources Chief Executive Officer George
R. Richmond. 

On a year-to-date basis, metallurgical coal sales volumes totaled 2.8 million
tons, down 12 percent versus the first six months of 2008. This compares to
steel production declines in Europe and Brazil of approximately 40 percent in
the same period. 

Total metallurgical coal production in the quarter was 1.3 million tons versus
1.4 million tons in the prior-year period. This is the result of management`s
decision to reduce production to match sales by eliminating Saturday production
for part of the quarter, as well as a longwall move at Mine No. 7. 

Metallurgical coal production at Mine No. 4 totaled 0.7 million tons in the
second quarter, down 0.1 million tons versus the prior year. Production costs at
No. 4 were $59.66 per ton, an increase of $12.89 over the prior year, primarily
as a result of the shortened production week. 

Mine No. 7 produced 0.6 million tons in the second quarter, essentially even
with the second quarter last year. Production costs at Mine No. 7 were $80.02
per ton compared to $70.64 per ton in the prior-year period. The increase
resulted primarily from the shorter operating week and higher labor costs
associated with management`s decision to continue development work to enhance
productivity in the future. Depreciation was higher as a result of development
costs associated with the East expansion. 

The natural gas business sold 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas, essentially even
with the prior year, at an average price of $3.45 per thousand cubic feet in the
second quarter 2009 compared to an average price of $8.99 per thousand cubic
feet in the prior-year period. 

Surface Mining

Steam and industrial coal sales were 277,000 tons during the second quarter
compared to sales of 224,000 tons in the prior-year period. Average selling
price increased by 19.3 percent due to higher contract prices. Production
totaled 374,000 tons in the second quarter versus prior-year production of
221,000 tons. Sales and production increases resulted primarily from the
acquisition of Taft Coal Sales in the third quarter 2008. 

Walter Coke (formerly Sloss)

Walter Coke reported a $2.7 million operating loss in the second quarter on
sales of 28,247 tons of metallurgical coke at an average price of $369.07 per
ton. In the prior year, Walter Coke sold 106,431 tons at $397.50 per ton.
Declines in revenue and operating income in the current period reflect
significantly lower coke sales driven by lower demand from the domestic steel
industry. Production has been reduced in response to weak demand; however, fixed
costs negatively impacted profitability. Results in the current period also
include $1.1 million in legal settlement costs. 

Corporate and Other

Interest expense totaled $4.4 million in the quarter, down $6.8 million versus
the prior-year period. The Company reduced interest expense in the current
quarter by paying down its revolving credit facility balance to zero. Interest
expense in the second quarter last year included $3.1 million in costs
associated with the early repayment of debt and also reflected higher average
debt outstanding. 

As of June 30, 2009, the Company had available liquidity of $325.9 million,
including cash of $42.0 million and $283.9 million available under its credit
facility. Total net debt outstanding at June 30, 2009 was $147.2 million
compared to $115.5 million at the end of the first quarter 2009. Total credit
availability reflects a step down of the total revolver commitment to $350.0
million at June 30, 2009.

Third quarter 2009 metallurgical coal sales expectations are based on shipments
to date and expected shipping schedules for the remainder of the quarter. 

"In April and May, we sold tons into the spot market and delivered provisionally
priced coal as we waited for the market to develop," said Richmond. "We are now
seeing strengthening demand and contract pricing opportunities in line with, and
in some cases better than, the Australian benchmark of $129 per metric ton." 

Metallurgical coal production is expected to be between 1.4 and 1.6 million tons
in the third quarter. Jim Walter Resources recently restarted Saturday
production on improving sales demand early in the period. The Company plans to
begin longwall production from its 7 East expansion in early January 2010. 

Third quarter metallurgical coal operating margins are expected to be reduced by
higher costs in inventory at the beginning of the period. Production costs are
expected to drop to an average $60 - $65 per ton in the quarter as production
volumes increase and the mix of longwall tons to continuous miner tons improves.


Capital expenditures were $17.2 million in the second quarter, totaling $52.4
million in the first half. The Company expects capital expenditures to total
about $34 million in the second half.

get out of TARP. JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) has said it will
let Treasury auction its warrants rather than pay an inflated
price to buy them back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many banks have faulted TARP for its stigma as a sign of
weakness, and its restrictions, including curbs on executive
pay. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has said TARP
participation is a "scarlet letter" for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which also paid back $10 billion of
TARP money last month, remains in talks with the government on
shedding the warrants, Chief Financial Officer Colm Kelleher
told Reuters Television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement, Goldman said the $1.1 billion payment is in
addition to $318 million of dividends that it paid the
government on the bailout money. It said this represents a 23
percent annualized return on the initial $10 billion
investment, which took the form of preferred shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman announced the purchase eight days after it posted
an unexpectedly large 33 percent jump in quarterly profit. It
also at the time set aside $6.65 billion for compensation,
prompting questions about the government's perceived role in
positioning Goldman to pay out huge bonuses while the rest of
the economy remains under duress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The spotlight was on them because we just bailed out these
companies, and now Goldman is making billions," said Ken
Crawford, a portfolio manager with Argent Capital Management.
"It doesn't look good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics of TARP have questioned whether the government has
been misusing taxpayer money in trying to prop up the banking
sector, following hundreds of billions of dollars of credit
losses and writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crawford said that for Goldman, "to fully give back
everything the federal government gave them, from a publicity
standpoint, makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, a Congressional oversight panel
estimated that Goldman's warrants were worth $940 million, but
could be worth as much as $1.25 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Treasury is pleased with the $1.1 billion Goldman
paid, the head of the Treasury's financial bailout fund said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Herbert Allison, assistant secretary for financial
stability, told a House Financial Services subcommittee that he
he believes that the warrants were priced fairly under a
process similar to those used for smaller banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the case of Goldman, however, a liquidity discount was
not applied by the Treasury as it was for smaller banks, whose
warrants and options are not widely traded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a
Democrat from Massachusetts, welcomed Goldman's repurchase of
the warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I appreciate that Goldman Sachs did the right thing today,
and we urge all the others to follow this example," Frank said
in a statement. "I hope that this will lead to greater
cooperation by other firms that have outstanding warrants owed
to the American taxpayer."

&lt;p&gt;Amerikaanse belastingbetalers boeken winst van 23 percent
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
De Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) heeft vandaag de aflossing aangekondigd
van de warrants die de Amerikaanse regering ontvangen heeft met betrekking tot
haar investering in het bedrijf door middel van het TARP`s Capital Purchase
Program voor een bedrag van $1,1 miljard, de volledige waarde die door het
Amerikaanse Ministerie van Financi&#235;n is vastgesteld. 

Daar er een aantal manieren zijn om de waarde van de warrants vast te stellen,
inclusief door middel van een openbare veiling, geloven wij dat deze waardering
in de context van buitengewone acties die door de regering ondernomen worden om
het financi&#235;le systeem te stabiliseren, een weergave is van de volledige en
rechtmatige waarde hiervan. 

In juni heeft Goldman Sachs het door het Amerikaanse Ministerie van Financi&#235;n
ge&#239;nvesteerde bedrag van $10 miljard terugbetaald, en tijdens de acht maanden
van investering, heeft de firma $318 miljoen aan preferente aandelen betaald. We
zijn er verheugd over dat de betaling van dividenden en de aflossing van de
warrants die een totaal bedrag van $1,418 miljard vormen, een jaarlijkse winst
van 23 percent voor de Amerikaanse belastingbetalers weergeven. 

"Deze winst weerspiegelt de hulp van de regering, waarvan het financi&#235;le
systeem, ons bedrijf en onze aandeelhouders profijt van hebben kunnen trekken,"
aldus Lloyd C. Blankfein, voorzitter en CEO. "We zijn dankbaar voor de
inspanningen van de regering en verheugen ons erover dat dit extra bedrag door
de regering kan worden gebruikt om de economie weer leven in te blazen. Dit is
een prioriteit waarin wij allen een gemeenschappelijk aandeel in hebben." 

Hij voegde hieraan toe: "Daar Goldman Sachs bedrijven adviseert met betrekking
tot hun groeiplannen en ook fondsen verwerft om die groei te ondersteunen, is de
beste en meest duurzame handelsomgeving er &#233;&#233;n waar het vertrouwen van de klant
en bedrijven evenals de economische groei tot bloei komen. We verbinden ons met
het toekennen van kapitaal en verstrekken van liquiditeit aan onze klanten om de
groei en creatie van banen te helpen stimuleren." 

De Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is een toonaangevend globaal financi&#235;el
dienstenbedrijf die diensten levert voor investment banking, effecten en
investment management aan een aanzienlijke en gespreide klantengroep die
bedrijven, financi&#235;le instellingen, regeringen en personen met hoge

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft releases code for new operating system&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * PC makers can start producing Windows 7 machines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * On target for Oct. 22 launch date in stores&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, July 22 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said
on Wednesday it is releasing the code for Windows 7 to PC
manufacturers, keeping the software company on track to have
machines running its new operating system in the stores by late
October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move means Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), Dell Inc
DELL.O, Acer Inc (2353.TW) and other computer makers can
start to load up new PCs, laptops and netbooks with the
operating system, the successor to the unpopular Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Microsoft and the manufacturers are hoping the full
launch of Windows 7, scheduled for Oct. 22, will help lift PC
sales out of the slump caused by the global economic downturn,
and give the holiday shopping season an extra lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Manufacturers have been testing early versions of Windows 7
for several months, but this week marks the release of the
"gold code," according to a Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK)
executive, referring to the software industry jargon for the
finished product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PC makers no longer have to fly discs in helicopters to
their manufacturing plants, as the transfer is now done
electronically. But it still marks a dramatic day as
manufacturers hustle to get new products into stores in time
for the release date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Machines that have Windows 7 installed, or devices that are
compatible with it, will simply have the Windows 7 logo on
them, a Microsoft executive said. The company will not be
splashing the word "capable" around in marketing efforts, after
it received complaints at its last launch that some machines
branded "Windows Vista Capable" could only run the lower-end
versions of the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Few industry watchers expect such problems to hit Microsoft
this time around as the company has spent more time making sure
PCs will be able to run the new software.

underpriced by about a third, based on the panel's valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It estimated the Goldman warrants to have a "best estimate"

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said it paid the U.S. Treasury Department $1.1 billion to redeem warrants, becoming the largest bank to fully escape the government's bank bailout program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government got the warrants last year when it injected $10 billion into Goldman from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a sum that Goldman paid back last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman joins U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), BBT Corp (BBT.N) and State Street Corp (STT.N) among large financial companies to get out of TARP.

&lt;p&gt;US Taxpayers Make 23 Percent Return
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) announced today that it has redeemed
the warrants the U.S. government received in connection with its investment in
the firm through the TARP`s Capital Purchase Program at $1.1 billion, the full
value the U.S. Treasury Department has determined. 

While there are a number of ways to value the warrants, including through a
public auction, we believe that in the context of the extraordinary actions
taken by the government to help stabilize the financial system, this valuation
of the warrants represents full and fair value. 

In June, Goldman Sachs repaid the U.S. Treasury`s investment of $10 billion, and
during the eight months of the investment, the firm paid $318 million in
preferred dividends. We are pleased that the payment of the dividends and the
redemption of the warrants, which total $1.418 billion, represent an annualized
return of 23 percent for US taxpayers. 

"This return is reflective of the government`s assistance, which benefitted the
financial system, our firm and our shareholders," said Lloyd C. Blankfein,
Chairman and CEO. "We are grateful for the government efforts and are pleased
that this additional money can be used by the government to revitalize the
economy, a priority in which we all have a common stake." 

He added, "Because Goldman Sachs advises companies with their growth plans and
raises capital to support that growth, the best and most sustainable operating
environment for us is one where consumer and business confidence and economic
growth flourish. We are committed to allocating capital and providing liquidity
to our clients to help stimulate growth and job creation." 

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global financial services firm
providing investment banking, securities and investment management services to a

&lt;p&gt; KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, July 22 (Reuters)- Saudi Basic
Industries Corp 2010.SE (SABIC) and Exxon Mobil Chemical
(FXON.PA) are looking to drum up interest from bidders for a new
petrochemical project, contracting sources said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Building petrochemical capacity is part of the kingdom's
plan to diversify its economy away from oil exports. Sabic and
Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) chemical unit signed a preliminary
agreement in November to establish the multi-billion dollar
synthetic rubber joint venture at their plants in Jubail and
Yanbu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies would issue bid packages for the Jubail
plant by the end of the year, Saudi-based contracting sources
said. Executives from Sabic, Exxon and contracting companies
were meeting in Houston on Wednesday to discuss the project,
contractors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deadline for companies to submit documents for
prequalification to bid for the packages was Wednesday,
contractors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project would have a combined production capacity of
400,000 tonnes per year of carbon black, rubber and specialty
polymers for both domestic and international sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plants would be based at the Kemya complex in Jubail and the
Yanpet complex in Yanbu. Yanpet is a 50-50 joint venture between
Mobil Yanbu Petrochemical Co Inc, an affiliate of Exxon Mobil
Chemical and SABIC. Kemya is a 50-50 joint venture between SABIC
and Exxon Chemical Arabia Inc, also an affiliate of Exxon Mobil
Chemical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plans for Yanpet have yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SABIC said on Sunday it would raise its petrochemicals
output by about 12 million tonnes by the start of 2012 after it
posted a 76 percent drop in second-quarter profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sabic benefits from access to cheap energy feedstock in the
world's top oil exporter, giving it a competitive advantage over
global rivals.Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) is the world's largest
non-government controlled oil company by market capitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Reem Shamseddine; Editing by Simon Webb and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and assigns Outlooks to JP Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corporation's commercial mortgage pass-through certificates,
series 2002-CIBC4 as follows: 

--$24 million class E to 'A' from 'AA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$12 million class F to 'BBB from 'A'; Outlook Stable; 

--$14 million class G at 'BB' from 'BBB+'; Outlook Negative. 

In addition, Fitch downgrades and assigns recovery ratings to the following
classes: 

--$12.0 million class H to 'CCC/RR1' from 'BB+'; 

--$4.0 million class J to 'C/RR2' from 'BB'; 

--$6.0 million class K to 'C/RR6' from 'B+'; 

--$8.0 million class L to 'C/RR6' from 'B'; 

--$4.0 million class M to 'C/RR6' from 'B-'. 

Also, Fitch affirms the following classes: 

--$61.8 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$403.2 million class A-3 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$32.0 million class B at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$34.0 million class C at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$10 million class D at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch does not rate the $5.8 million class NR. Class A-1 has been paid in full. 

The downgrades and Negative Outlook assignments are due to expected losses on
the three loans currently in special servicing, as well as an increased
concentration of Fitch Loans of Concern. The affirmations reflect sufficient
credit enhancement to the senior classes. The Rating Outlooks reflect the likely
direction of any rating changes over the next one to two years. As of the July
2009 distribution date, the pool has been reduced 21.6% to $626.5 million from
$798.9 million at issuance. Twenty-seven loans, 30.8% of the pool, have
defeased. 

There are currently three loans (11.4%) in special servicing and losses are
expected. The largest loan in special servicing (10.3%), the Highland Mall loan,
is collateralized by 487,170 square feet (sf) of a 1,120,347 sf Regional Mall
located in Austin, TX. The mall is anchored by Dillard's Women's, Macy's and
Dillard's Men's and Home. Dillard's Women and Macys own their own stores and
underlying land. Dillard's Women's has an expired operating covenant and have
the right to close their store at this location. The borrower is currently in
discussions with Dillard's for a possible renewal but this is not finalized.
There are co-tenancy clauses with nine in-line tenants if Dillard's Women's
closes, which include Gap, Foot Locker, RadioShack, Aeropostale. As of March 31,
2009 the rent roll indicates that in-line occupancy is 68%, and overall
occupancy, which includes the 80,000 Dillard's Men's and Home space, is 74%.
Assuming the Dillard's Women's space and the tenants with co-tenancy clauses are
not renewed, Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and occupancy
would fall to 0.58 times (x) and 68%, respectively. Fitch expects that losses
could materialize upon the possible liquidation of this asset. 

The second largest specially serviced asset (0.6%) is real estate owned (REO)
and is a multi-family building located in Austell, GA. The third specially
serviced loan (0.6%) is secured by a multi-family building located in
Greenville, NC and is in foreclosure. Losses are expected on both loans,
however, the class NR is currently able to absorb these losses. 

Exclusive of the three specially serviced loans, an additional eight loans
(6.4%) have been identified as Fitch Loans of Concern. The largest non-specially
serviced loan of concern (1.3%) is secured by a retail property in Hickory, NC.
The most recent servicer reported DSCR is 1.67x, however, this number does not
reflect a drop in occupancy following the loss of a major tenant. 

The deal does not contain any loans maturing in 2008 through 2010. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) knows it may be losing the battle of public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hears the outrage over lavish bonuses and does not like being excoriated on late-night comedy shows or in pop culture magazines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, come December, Goldman Sachs is expected to pay its traders and bankers out-sized bonuses for a year that looks like it will bring blockbuster profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street recruiters and headhunters have said some of Goldman's star traders, especially those in high growth areas like currency, commodities and fixed income, are in for the biggest payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among them are David Heller, Harvey Schwartz, Edward Eisler, and Pablo Salame, all of whom lead units that oversee bond, stock, currency and commodity sales and trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the foreseeable future, until investment banking really comes back, we are going to see the traders really ruling the roost on Wall Street and Goldman is the cream of the crop," said Richard Lipstein, a recruiter with Boyden Global Executive Search in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Goldman reported second-quarter net revenue of $3.4 billion, far surpassing analysts' expectations, largely because of strong trading results. The company set aside $6.65 billion in the quarter for compensation and benefits, or $226,156 per employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projected over a full year, that is $904,624 per employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAIR-RAISING BONUSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A likely return to record bonuses has raised the hackles of some commentators and politicians, even though the bank has paid back $10 billion it received from the U.S. government at the height of the banking crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat and member of the influential Senate banking committee, called Goldman "tone deaf" on the issue of compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They get all this public money, so it is a thumb in the eye when they pay these kinds of bonuses in a banking community that helped bring down our economy," Brown said in an interview. "I just would hope that they would be a little bit embarrassed and maybe pull back a little."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They think differently from the rest of us," Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's second-quarter profits and bonus cache have also drawn derision from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who called it "good news for Goldman and the people who work there" and "bad news for almost everyone else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Show's Jon Stewart mockingly celebrated Goldman as "the eye of the U.S. economic pyramid, thanks to the government-funded scaffolding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day Goldman reported its earnings, its chief financial officer, David Viniar, said the company understood the public's concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STICKS AND STONES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know it. We see it. We don't like it," Viniar said. "We believe we are doing good things. We are helping the economy recover. I don't like reading bad things about Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, known for having a "pay-for-performance" culture, is likely to take great pains to make sure bonuses stay below the record levels of 2007, when it paid out $20.2 billion, said Alan Johnson, a compensation consultant with Johnson Associates in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are very smart people," Johnson said. "I'm sure they don't want the story to be that 'We are back to the madness of before'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that does not necessarily mean Goldman will shy away from rewarding people like Heller, Schwartz, Eisler and Salame. Heller and Schwartz are based in New York, and Eisler and Salame work in London. All four were promoted last year and serve on Goldman's top management committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's trading division has generated about $18 billion from fixed income and equities trading so far this year, compared with $12 billion in all of 2008 and $27 billion in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson expects the pay of Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who in 2007 reaped about $100 million in compensation and the vesting of stock, to remain in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he said he still thinks Goldman's bonus pool will be among the biggest percentage gainers compared to its peers and enough to draw the ire of some politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The level of anger of the American people and the politicians is real and large, so hopefully we will avoid a train wreck at the end of the year," Johnson said. "But unfortunately the two trains are heading for each other on the track at this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday its second-quarter earnings fell 19 percent, as the strong dollar crimped revenue across its product line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest drugmaker earned $2.26 billion, or 34 cents per share, compared with $2.78 billion, or 41 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, the New York-based drugmaker earned 48 cents per share, one cent better than analyst expectations, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer sales fell 9 percent to $10.98 billion, shy of the $11.26 billion estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue would have been generally unchanged without the impact of the strong dollar, which weakens the value of overseas sales. International sales amounted to 59 percent of Pfizer's overall revenue in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker has been cutting jobs and other costs to shore up profits as its top-selling medicines endure generic competition and other pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said operational improvements resulting from cost-reduction initiatives lowered adjusted total costs by about 5 percent for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're a cost-cutting story and the story is beginning to play out, particularly in this quarter," Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Pfizer's Lipitor cholesterol fighter, which faces competition from generic versions of other cholesterol medicines, fell 10 percent to $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of its smoking cessation drug Chantix fell 7 percent to $192 million amid concerns over possible psychiatric side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its Lyrica drug for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia edged up 2 percent to $629 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer raised its full-year forecast for earnings, excluding items, to a range of $1.90 to $2.00 per share. Previously, it expected $1.85 to $1.95 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also projected full-year revenue in a range of $45 billion to $46 billion, lifting the lower end from $44 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were down 2 cents at $15.68 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Ransdell Pierson; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for second-quarter
2009. Revenues were $11.0 billion, a decrease of 9% compared with the year-ago
quarter and flat on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange unfavorably
impacted revenues by approximately $1.1 billion or 9%. For second-quarter 2009,
U.S. revenues were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 5% compared with the year-ago
quarter. International revenues were $6.5 billion, a decrease of 12% compared
with the prior-year quarter, and reflected operational growth of 2%, which was
more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 14%. U.S.
revenues represented 41% of the total compared with 39% in the year-ago quarter,
while international revenues represented 59% of the total compared with 61% in
the year-ago quarter. 

For first-half 2009, revenues were $21.9 billion, a decrease of 9% compared with
the same period in 2008 and a decrease of 2% on a constant currency basis.
Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $1.7 billion or
7%. U.S. revenues were $9.5 billion, a decrease of 7% compared with first-half
2008. International revenues were $12.4 billion, a decrease of 10% compared with
the same period last year, and reflected operational growth of 2%, which was
more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 12%. U.S.
revenues represented 43% of the total and international revenues represented 57%
of the total, comparable with first-half 2008. In addition to foreign exchange,
other factors that negatively impacted first-half 2009 revenues in comparison
with first-half 2008 included the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Zyrtec in January
2008 and Camptosar in February 2008, the loss of exclusivity in Japan for
Norvasc in July 2008, as well as the revenue declines for Lipitor, as a result
of continued intense competition, and for Chantix/Champix, mainly due to label
changes. 

Business Revenues

Effective January 1, 2009, Pfizer expanded its operating model within the
Pharmaceutical business to include five customer-focused units, in addition to
its Animal Health business. During second-quarter 2009, all Pharmaceutical units
and Animal Health generated revenue growth on a constant currency basis with the
exception of the Established Products unit, which manages a portfolio of
products that have generally lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity and
that have an expected decline in revenues at this stage in their lifecycle.

Primary Care revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $5.1 billion, a 6% decline
compared with $5.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operational growth of 1%,
primarily driven by the strong international performance of Lyrica, was more
than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Specialty Care revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $1.4 billion, a 5% decrease
compared with $1.5 billion in the same period last year. Operational growth of
2%, largely driven by the solid U.S performance of certain products, including
Revatio and Geodon, was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange. 

Oncology revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $352 million, an 8% decrease
compared with $384 million in the prior-year quarter. Operational growth of 4%,
due primarily to the strong performance in international markets of Sutent and
Aromasin, was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Established Products revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, a 20%
decline compared with $2.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, comprised of a 13%
operational decline and a 7% foreign exchange decline. Since the products in
this unit generally have lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity,
revenues have declined. This unit was created in 2008 with the goal of
recapturing value for these products in developed market geographies by
progressively slowing the erosion of, and ultimately stabilizing, revenue and
profit from established products. Supporting initiatives within the unit include
programs designed to expand patient and payor access to this portfolio, to
develop product enhancements, to expand the portfolio and to increase
promotional efforts for targeted products. 

Emerging Markets revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $1.5 billion, an 8%
decrease compared with $1.7 billion in second-quarter 2008. These revenues
include the revenue from both established products and patent-protected products
sold in emerging markets. Operational growth of 9%, largely attributable to
double-digit growth in high-priority countries, notably China and Turkey, was
more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Animal Health revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $648 million, a 9% decline
compared with $715 million in the year-ago quarter. Operational growth of 2%,
primarily driven by the solid performance in emerging markets and for certain
new products worldwide, was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign
exchange. 

Reported Net Income(2)and Reported Diluted EPS(2)

For second-quarter 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(2) of $2.3 billion, a
decline of 19% compared with $2.8 billion in the prior-year quarter, and
reported diluted EPS(2) of $0.34, a decline of 17% compared with $0.41 in the
prior-year quarter. For first-half 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(2) of
$5.0 billion, a decline of 10% compared with $5.6 billion in first-half 2008,
and reported diluted EPS(2) of $0.74, a decline of 10% compared with $0.82 in
the prior-year period. Results were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange and
an increase in the effective tax rate as well as costs incurred in connection
with the pending Wyeth acquisition. These factors were partially offset by
savings from cost-reduction initiatives, lower costs associated with those
initiatives and lower in-process research and development charges in 2009. The
increase in the effective tax rate on reported results to approximately 26% in
second-quarter 2009 from approximately 1% in second-quarter 2008, and to
approximately 27% in first-half 2009 from approximately 12% in first-half 2008,
was primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business
decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition as well as favorable
income tax adjustments in 2008. 

Adjusted Income(1) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(1)

Second-quarter 2009 adjusted income(1) was $3.2 billion, a decrease of 12%
compared with $3.7 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(1)
was $0.48, a decrease of 13% compared with $0.55 in the year-ago quarter.
First-half 2009 adjusted income(1) was $6.9 billion, a decrease of 11% compared
with $7.8 billion in first-half 2008, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) was $1.03, a
decrease of 10% compared with $1.15 in the year-ago period. Both adjusted
income(1) and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were negatively impacted by foreign
exchange and an increase in the effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) to
approximately 28% in second-quarter 2009 from approximately 20% in
second-quarter 2008, and to approximately 29% in first-half 2009 from
approximately 21% in first-half 2008, primarily due to the increased tax cost
associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth
acquisition as well as a favorable income tax adjustment in 2008. These factors
were partially offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives. 

In second-quarter 2009, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of revenues
was 15.4% compared with 16.9% in second-quarter 2008. This improvement reflects
the benefits from cost-reduction initiatives and foreign exchange. Excluding the
impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of
revenues was 16.2% in second-quarter 2009. 

Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI) expenses(1) were $3.3
billion in second-quarter 2009, a decrease of 12% compared with $3.7 billion in
the prior-year quarter. The decrease was due to the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives, as well as foreign exchange which reduced
second-quarter 2009 adjusted SI expenses(1) by $253 million compared with the
year-ago quarter. 

Adjusted research and development (R) expenses(1) were $1.7 billion in
second-quarter 2009, a decrease of 11% compared with $1.9 billion in the
prior-year period. The decrease was due to the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives, as well as foreign exchange which reduced
second-quarter 2009 adjusted R expenses(1) by $68 million compared with the
year-ago quarter. 

Overall, operational improvements resulting from cost-reduction initiatives
decreased adjusted total costs(10) by approximately $410 million or 5% in
second-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period, and foreign exchange
decreased adjusted total costs(10) by $585 million or 8%. The operational
improvements were driven partially by the reduction in workforce to
approximately 76,500 at the end of second-quarter 2009, a decline of 3,750
compared with the end of the first-quarter 2009, and a decline of 10,100 since
the beginning of 2008, as well as manufacturing and research and development
site exits. Throughout the remainder of 2009, a portion of the operational cost
reductions achieved in first-half 2009 is expected to be reinvested to further
execute strategies, primarily in emerging markets and established products, and
to support the late-stage development portfolio. 

Executive Commentary

"Our results this quarter demonstrate our ability to continue to deliver solid
operational performance despite a challenging and dynamic economic and operating
environment. On a constant currency basis, all of our Pharmaceutical units and
Animal Health generated revenue growth during the quarter, with the exception of
the Established Products unit, which manages a portfolio of products that have
an expected decline in revenues at this stage of their lifecycle," stated Jeff
Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

Kindler continued, "Additionally, significant progress was made in connection
with our pending Wyeth acquisition by achieving several key milestones,
including approval of the acquisition by the European Commission, which included
our commitment to divest certain animal health assets in the EU; the submission
of regulatory filings in other important international markets; the approval of
the acquisition by Wyeth shareholders; and further development of our
post-closing integration plans. At the same time, we remain focused on meeting
our commitments - generating revenues consistent with our expectations and
continuing to streamline our cost structure." 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "We remain committed to
delivering on our 2009 financial goals and today, are increasing our guidance
for adjusted diluted EPS(1) to a range of $1.90 to $2.00 from a range of $1.85
to $1.95 as well as narrowing our revenue guidance to a range of $45.0 to $46.0
billion from a range of $44.0 to $46.0 billion. We are also improving our
guidance on many of our expense line items. Additionally, we`ve made substantial
progress on our cost-reduction initiative with an operational decrease of
approximately $740 million in adjusted total costs(10) realized during
first-half 2009, a portion of which we expect will fund increased activity in
support of business opportunities, primarily in emerging markets and established
products, and in support of our late-stage development portfolio, among other
things, during second-half 2009. In connection with the pending Wyeth
acquisition, we replaced our bridge loan facility with permanent financing and
are making substantial progress in planning for a successful and rapid
integration of Wyeth following the closing." 

Financial Guidance

For full-year 2009, Pfizer`s financial guidance, at current exchange rates(11)
has been updated and is summarized below. Guidance for adjusted diluted EPS(1)
has been increased to a range of $1.90 to $2.00 from $1.85 to $1.95 and guidance
for reported revenues has been narrowed to a range of $45.0 to $46.0 billion
from a range of $44.0 to $46.0 billion. Guidance for reported diluted EPS(2) has
increased to a range of $1.30 to $1.45 from a range of $1.20 to $1.35, primarily
due to lower than anticipated costs to be incurred in 2009 in connection with
our cost-reduction initiatives. In addition, guidance for other line items,
adjusted SI expenses(1), adjusted R expenses(1) and adjusted other
(income)/deductions(1), has been either narrowed or improved as detailed below.
We continue to expect to achieve net savings compared to 2008 adjusted total
costs(10) of $2 billion by the end of 2011 at 2008 foreign exchange rates.

         excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted SI        
         expenses, Adjusted R expenses and Adjusted Other (Income)/Deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and therefore, components of the       
         overall adjusted income measure. As described under Adjusted Income in the Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section  
         of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 29, 2009, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the      
         performance of the overall company. We believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. Reconciliations of second-quarter 
         2009 and 2008 and first-half 2009 and 2008 adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS to reported net income(2) and its components and reported diluted  
         EPS(2), as well as reconciliations of full-year 2009 adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance to full-year 2009 reported net income(2) and reported diluted      
         EPS(2) guidance, are provided in the materials accompanying this report. The adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not 
         be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (2)     "Reported Net Income" is defined as net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. "Reported Diluted EPS" is    
         defined as reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

 (6)     The Established Products business unit generally includes revenues from human pharmaceutical products that have lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity in certain 
         countries and/or regions. In certain situations, products may be transferred to this unit before losing patent protection or marketing exclusivity in order to maximize

 1.    The above financial statements present the three-month and six-month periods ended June 28, 2009 and June 29, 2008. Subsidiaries operating outside the United States are included for the three-month and six-month periods ended May 24, 2009 and May 25, 2008.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 2.    The financial results for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 28, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results which could ultimately be achieved for the current year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 3.    On January 1, 2009, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 160 provides guidance for the accounting, reporting and disclosure of noncontrolling interests, previously referred to as minority interests. The adoption of SFAS 160 resulted in reclassifications of prior-period amounts to conform to the second-quarter and six-month 2009 presentations, primarily related 
       to the presentation of noncontrolling interests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 4.    Included in Restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 28, 2009are $184 million and $553 million, respectively, of transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other costs, directly related to our pending acquisition of Wyeth.                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 5.    In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded $20 million of Acquisition-related in-process research and development charges (IPR) due to the resolution of a contingency associated with our 2008 acquisition of CovX. In the second quarter of 2008, we expensed $156 million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of Serenex, Inc. and Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In the first quarter 2008 we expensed $398 million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of CovX and Coley Pharmaceutical      
       Group, Inc. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, beginning January 1, 2009, IPR related to acquisitions after adoption will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets. We made no acquisitions in the first or second quarters of 2009.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

1. Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues

The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the
euro, UK pound, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar unfavorably impacted our
revenues by approximately $1.1 billion, or 9%, in second-quarter 2009, compared
to the same period in 2008, and by approximately $1.7 billion, or 7%, in the
first six months of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. 

2. Change in Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales decreased 23% and 26% in the second quarter and first six
months of 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008. The
decreases primarily reflect the favorable impact of foreign exchange, the
savings impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and lower related
implementation costs. 

Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $45 million for the second quarter of 2009, $121
million for the first six months of 2009, $210 million for the second quarter of
2008, and $348 million for the first six months of 2008. 

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.9 percentage
points to 16.0% in second-quarter 2009, reflecting the favorable impact of our
cost-reduction initiatives, the impact of foreign exchange, as well as lower
implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, compared to
second-quarter 2008. 

3. Change in Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses, Research &amp;
Development (R) Expenses and In-Process R Charges (IPR)

Reported SI expenses decreased 13% and 15% in the second quarter and first six
months of 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008. The
decreases reflect the favorable impact of foreign exchange, savings associated
with our cost-reduction initiatives and lower related implementation costs. In
addition, the first six months of 2009 included certain insurance recoveries
related to legal defense costs. 

Reported SI expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $85 million for second-quarter 2009, $131 million
for the first six months of 2009, $100 million for second-quarter 2008, and $175
million for the first six months of 2008. 

Reported R expenses, excluding IPR, decreased 14% and 9% in the second
quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods
in 2008. The decreases are primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign
exchange, the realization of savings associated with our cost-reduction
initiatives and lower related implementation costs. The six-month 2009 decrease
was partially offset by a $150 million milestone payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb
in first-quarter 2009 in connection with the collaboration on apixaban. 

Reported R expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $32 million for second-quarter 2009, $73 million
for the first six months of 2009, $94 million for second-quarter 2008, and $240
million for the first six months of 2008. 

IPR charges in second-quarter 2009 of $20 million relate to the resolution of
a contingency associated with our 2008 acquisition of CovX. IPR charges in
second-quarter 2008 of $156 million primarily related to the acquisitions of
Serenex, Inc. and Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and in the first-quarter 2008,
$398 million primarily related to the acquisitions of CovX and Coley
Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. As a result of adopting Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R, Business
Combinations, beginning January 1, 2009, IPR related to acquisitions after
adoption will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived
intangible assets. We made no acquisitions in the first half of 2009.

 (a)    Net interest expense was $66 million in second-quarter 2009 compared to net interest income of $99 million in the same period in 2008. The change is due primarily to net 
        interest expense recorded in second-quarter 2009 associated with our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes on March 24, 2009 and $10.5 billion of senior    
        unsecured notes June 3, 2009, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Wyeth. In addition, lower interest rates, partially offset by higher cash balances,         
        contributed to the increased net interest expense compared to the year-ago quarter.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                  


5. Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income for second-quarter 2009 was 25.8%compared to 0.9%
in the second quarter of 2008, and in the first six months of 2009 was 27.1%
compared to 12.4% in the first six months of 2008. The higher tax rates for the
second quarter and first six months of 2009 are primarily due to the increased
tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the
pending Wyeth acquisition, partially offset by the change in geographic mix of
expenses incurred to execute our cost-reduction initiatives, as well as the
decrease in IPR charges, which generally are not deductible for tax purposes.
The lower tax rates in the second quarter and first six months of 2008 reflect
tax benefits of $305 million related to favorable tax settlements for multiple
tax years and $426 million related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical
companies, which were both recorded in the second quarter of 2008. 

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was 28.1% in second quarter 2009,
29.0% in the first six months of 2009, 20.0% in second-quarter 2008, and 21.0%
in the first six months of 2008. The higher tax rates on adjusted income(1) in
2009 are primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain
business decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition. The lower
tax rates in the second quarter and first six months of 2008 reflect $305
million in tax benefits related to the resolution of tax issues noted above.

________________ 

(1) "Adjusted income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are
defined as reported net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. and reported diluted
EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders excluding
purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued
operations and certain significant items. As described under Adjusted Income in
the Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations section of Pfizer`s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 29,
2009, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance
goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that
investors` understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this
measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and
should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS.

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for second-quarter
2009. Revenues were $11.0 billion, a decrease of 9% compared with the year-ago
quarter and flat on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange unfavorably
impacted revenues by approximately $1.1 billion or 9%. For second-quarter 2009,
U.S. revenues were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 5% compared with the year-ago
quarter. International revenues were $6.5 billion, a decrease of 12% compared
with the prior-year quarter, and reflected operational growth of 2%, which was
more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 14%. U.S.
revenues represented 41% of the total compared with 39% in the year-ago quarter,
while international revenues represented 59% of the total compared with 61% in
the year-ago quarter. 

For first-half 2009, revenues were $21.9 billion, a decrease of 9% compared with
the same period in 2008 and a decrease of 2% on a constant currency basis.
Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $1.7 billion or
7%. U.S. revenues were $9.5 billion, a decrease of 7% compared with first-half
2008. International revenues were $12.4 billion, a decrease of 10% compared with
the same period last year, and reflected operational growth of 2%, which was
more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 12%. U.S.
revenues represented 43% of the total and international revenues represented 57%
of the total, comparable with first-half 2008. In addition to foreign exchange,
other factors that negatively impacted first-half 2009 revenues in comparison
with first-half 2008 included the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Zyrtec in January
2008 and Camptosar in February 2008, the loss of exclusivity in Japan for
Norvasc in July 2008, as well as the revenue declines for Lipitor, as a result
of continued intense competition, and for Chantix/Champix, mainly due to label
changes. 

Business Revenues

Effective January 1, 2009, Pfizer expanded its operating model within the
Pharmaceutical business to include five customer-focused units, in addition to
its Animal Health business. During second-quarter 2009, all Pharmaceutical units
and Animal Health generated revenue growth on a constant currency basis with the
exception of the Established Products unit, which manages a portfolio of
products that have generally lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity and
that have an expected decline in revenues at this stage in their lifecycle.

Primary Care revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $5.1 billion, a 6% decline
compared with $5.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operational growth of 1%,
primarily driven by the strong international performance of Lyrica, was more
than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Specialty Care revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $1.4 billion, a 5% decrease
compared with $1.5 billion in the same period last year. Operational growth of
2%, largely driven by the solid U.S performance of certain products, including
Revatio and Geodon, was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange. 

Oncology revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $352 million, an 8% decrease
compared with $384 million in the prior-year quarter. Operational growth of 4%,
due primarily to the strong performance in international markets of Sutent and
Aromasin, was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Established Products revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, a 20%
decline compared with $2.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, comprised of a 13%
operational decline and a 7% foreign exchange decline. Since the products in
this unit generally have lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity,
revenues have declined. This unit was created in 2008 with the goal of
recapturing value for these products in developed market geographies by
progressively slowing the erosion of, and ultimately stabilizing, revenue and
profit from established products. Supporting initiatives within the unit include
programs designed to expand patient and payor access to this portfolio, to
develop product enhancements, to expand the portfolio and to increase
promotional efforts for targeted products. 

Emerging Markets revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $1.5 billion, an 8%
decrease compared with $1.7 billion in second-quarter 2008. These revenues
include the revenue from both established products and patent-protected products
sold in emerging markets. Operational growth of 9%, largely attributable to
double-digit growth in high-priority countries, notably China and Turkey, was
more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Animal Health revenues for second-quarter 2009 were $648 million, a 9% decline
compared with $715 million in the year-ago quarter. Operational growth of 2%,
primarily driven by the solid performance in emerging markets and for certain
new products worldwide, was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign
exchange. 

Reported Net Income(2)and Reported Diluted EPS(2)

For second-quarter 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(2) of $2.3 billion, a
decline of 19% compared with $2.8 billion in the prior-year quarter, and
reported diluted EPS(2) of $0.34, a decline of 17% compared with $0.41 in the
prior-year quarter. For first-half 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(2) of
$5.0 billion, a decline of 10% compared with $5.6 billion in first-half 2008,
and reported diluted EPS(2) of $0.74, a decline of 10% compared with $0.82 in
the prior-year period. Results were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange and
an increase in the effective tax rate as well as costs incurred in connection
with the pending Wyeth acquisition. These factors were partially offset by
savings from cost-reduction initiatives, lower costs associated with those
initiatives and lower in-process research and development charges in 2009. The
increase in the effective tax rate on reported results to approximately 26% in
second-quarter 2009 from approximately 1% in second-quarter 2008, and to
approximately 27% in first-half 2009 from approximately 12% in first-half 2008,
was primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business
decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition as well as favorable
income tax adjustments in 2008. 

Adjusted Income(1) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(1)

Second-quarter 2009 adjusted income(1) was $3.2 billion, a decrease of 12%
compared with $3.7 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(1)
was $0.48, a decrease of 13% compared with $0.55 in the year-ago quarter.
First-half 2009 adjusted income(1) was $6.9 billion, a decrease of 11% compared
with $7.8 billion in first-half 2008, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) was $1.03, a
decrease of 10% compared with $1.15 in the year-ago period. Both adjusted
income(1) and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were negatively impacted by foreign
exchange and an increase in the effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) to
approximately 28% in second-quarter 2009 from approximately 20% in
second-quarter 2008, and to approximately 29% in first-half 2009 from
approximately 21% in first-half 2008, primarily due to the increased tax cost
associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth
acquisition as well as a favorable income tax adjustment in 2008. These factors
were partially offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives. 

In second-quarter 2009, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of revenues
was 15.4% compared with 16.9% in second-quarter 2008. This improvement reflects
the benefits from cost-reduction initiatives and foreign exchange. Excluding the
impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of
revenues was 16.2% in second-quarter 2009. 

Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI) expenses(1) were $3.3
billion in second-quarter 2009, a decrease of 12% compared with $3.7 billion in
the prior-year quarter. The decrease was due to the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives, as well as foreign exchange which reduced
second-quarter 2009 adjusted SI expenses(1) by $253 million compared with the
year-ago quarter. 

Adjusted research and development (R) expenses(1) were $1.7 billion in
second-quarter 2009, a decrease of 11% compared with $1.9 billion in the
prior-year period. The decrease was due to the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives, as well as foreign exchange which reduced
second-quarter 2009 adjusted R expenses(1) by $68 million compared with the
year-ago quarter. 

Overall, operational improvements resulting from cost-reduction initiatives
decreased adjusted total costs(10) by approximately $410 million or 5% in
second-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period, and foreign exchange
decreased adjusted total costs(10) by $585 million or 8%. The operational
improvements were driven partially by the reduction in workforce to
approximately 76,500 at the end of second-quarter 2009, a decline of 3,750
compared with the end of the first-quarter 2009, and a decline of 10,100 since
the beginning of 2008, as well as manufacturing and research and development
site exits. Throughout the remainder of 2009, a portion of the operational cost
reductions achieved in first-half 2009 is expected to be reinvested to further
execute strategies, primarily in emerging markets and established products, and
to support the late-stage development portfolio. 

Executive Commentary

"Our results this quarter demonstrate our ability to continue to deliver solid
operational performance despite a challenging and dynamic economic and operating
environment. On a constant currency basis, all of our Pharmaceutical units and
Animal Health generated revenue growth during the quarter, with the exception of
the Established Products unit, which manages a portfolio of products that have
an expected decline in revenues at this stage of their lifecycle," stated Jeff
Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

Kindler continued, "Additionally, significant progress was made in connection
with our pending Wyeth acquisition by achieving several key milestones,
including approval of the acquisition by the European Commission, which included
our commitment to divest certain animal health assets in the EU; the submission
of regulatory filings in other important international markets; the approval of
the acquisition by Wyeth shareholders; and further development of our
post-closing integration plans. At the same time, we remain focused on meeting
our commitments - generating revenues consistent with our expectations and
continuing to streamline our cost structure." 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "We remain committed to
delivering on our 2009 financial goals and today, are increasing our guidance
for adjusted diluted EPS(1) to a range of $1.90 to $2.00 from a range of $1.85
to $1.95 as well as narrowing our revenue guidance to a range of $45.0 to $46.0
billion from a range of $44.0 to $46.0 billion. We are also improving our
guidance on many of our expense line items. Additionally, we`ve made substantial
progress on our cost-reduction initiative with an operational decrease of
approximately $740 million in adjusted total costs(10) realized during
first-half 2009, a portion of which we expect will fund increased activity in
support of business opportunities, primarily in emerging markets and established
products, and in support of our late-stage development portfolio, among other
things, during second-half 2009. In connection with the pending Wyeth
acquisition, we replaced our bridge loan facility with permanent financing and
are making substantial progress in planning for a successful and rapid
integration of Wyeth following the closing." 

Financial Guidance

For full-year 2009, Pfizer`s financial guidance, at current exchange rates(11)
has been updated and is summarized below. Guidance for adjusted diluted EPS(1)
has been increased to a range of $1.90 to $2.00 from $1.85 to $1.95 and guidance
for reported revenues has been narrowed to a range of $45.0 to $46.0 billion
from a range of $44.0 to $46.0 billion. Guidance for reported diluted EPS(2) has
increased to a range of $1.30 to $1.45 from a range of $1.20 to $1.35, primarily
due to lower than anticipated costs to be incurred in 2009 in connection with
our cost-reduction initiatives. In addition, guidance for other line items,
adjusted SI expenses(1), adjusted R expenses(1) and adjusted other
(income)/deductions(1), has been either narrowed or improved as detailed below.
We continue to expect to achieve net savings compared to 2008 adjusted total
costs(10) of $2 billion by the end of 2011 at 2008 foreign exchange rates.

 (1)     "Adjusted income" and its components and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are defined as reported net income(2) and its components and reported diluted EPS(2) 
         excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted SI        
         expenses, Adjusted R expenses and Adjusted Other (Income)/Deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and therefore, components of the       
         overall adjusted income measure. As described under Adjusted Income in the Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section  
         of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 29, 2009, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the      
         performance of the overall company. We believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. Reconciliations of second-quarter 
         2009 and 2008 and first-half 2009 and 2008 adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS to reported net income(2) and its components and reported diluted  
         EPS(2), as well as reconciliations of full-year 2009 adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance to full-year 2009 reported net income(2) and reported diluted      
         EPS(2) guidance, are provided in the materials accompanying this report. The adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not 
         be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (2)     "Reported Net Income" is defined as net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. "Reported Diluted EPS" is

 (3)     The Primary Care business unit includes revenues from human pharmaceutical products primarily prescribed by primary-care physicians, and may include, but is not limited  
         to, products in the following therapeutic and disease areas: Alzheimer`s disease, anxiety, cardiovascular (excluding pulmonary arterial hypertension), diabetes, pain,    
         genitourinary, obesity, osteoporosis and respiratory. Examples of products in this business unit include, but are not limited to, Lipitor, Lyrica, Celebrex and Viagra.   
         All revenues for such products are allocated to the Primary Care business unit, except those generated in emerging markets(7), and those that are managed by the          
         Established Products(6) business unit.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (4)     The Specialty Care business unit includes revenues from human pharmaceutical products primarily prescribed by physicians who are specialists, and may include, but is not 
         limited to, products in the following therapeutic and disease areas: antibacterials, antifungals, antivirals, bone, inflammation, gastrointestinal, growth hormones,      
         multiple sclerosis, ophthalmology, pulmonary arterial hypertension and psychosis. Examples of products in this business unit include, but are not limited to, Xalatan,    
         Zyvox, Geodon and Genotropin. All revenues for such products are allocated to the Specialty Care business unit, except those generated in emerging markets(7), and those  
         that are managed by the Established Products(6) business unit.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (5)     The Oncology business unit includes revenues from human oncology and oncology-related products. Examples of products in this business unit include, but are not limited   
         to, Sutent and Aromasin. All revenues for such products are allocated to the Oncology business unit, except those generated in emerging markets(7), and those that are    
         managed by the Established Products(6) business unit.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (6)     The Established Products business unit generally includes revenues from human pharmaceutical products that have lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity in certain 
         countries and/or regions. In certain situations, products may be transferred to this unit before losing patent protection or marketing exclusivity in order to maximize   
         their value. This unit also excludes revenues generated in emerging markets(7). Examples of products in this business unit include, but are not limited to, Norvasc,      
         Relpax, Medrol and Arthrotec.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (7)     The Emerging Markets business unit includes revenues from all human pharmaceutical products sold in emerging markets, including, but not limited to, Asia (excluding      
         Japan), Latin America, Middle East, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and Turkey.

 1.    The above financial statements present the three-month and six-month periods ended June 28, 2009 and June 29, 2008. Subsidiaries operating outside the United States are included for the three-month and six-month periods ended May 24, 2009 and May 25, 2008.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 2.    The financial results for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 28, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results which could ultimately be achieved for the current year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 3.    On January 1, 2009, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 160 provides guidance for the accounting, reporting and disclosure of noncontrolling interests, previously referred to as minority interests. The adoption of SFAS 160 resulted in reclassifications of prior-period amounts to conform to the second-quarter and six-month 2009 presentations, primarily related 
       to the presentation of noncontrolling interests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 4.    Included in Restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 28, 2009are $184 million and $553 million, respectively, of transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other costs, directly related to our pending acquisition of Wyeth.                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 5.    In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded $20 million of Acquisition-related in-process research and development charges (IPR) due to the resolution of a contingency associated with our 2008 acquisition of CovX. In the second quarter of 2008, we expensed $156 million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of Serenex, Inc. and Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In the first quarter 2008 we expensed $398 million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of CovX and Coley Pharmaceutical      
       Group, Inc. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, beginning January 1, 2009, IPR related to acquisitions after adoption will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets. We made no acquisitions in the first or second quarters of 2009.                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 6.    Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute our products is included in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in Cost of sales, Selling,informational and administrative expenses or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

1. Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues

The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the
euro, UK pound, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar unfavorably impacted our
revenues by approximately $1.1 billion, or 9%, in second-quarter 2009, compared
to the same period in 2008, and by approximately $1.7 billion, or 7%, in the
first six months of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. 

2. Change in Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales decreased 23% and 26% in the second quarter and first six
months of 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008. The
decreases primarily reflect the favorable impact of foreign exchange, the
savings impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and lower related
implementation costs. 

Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $45 million for the second quarter of 2009, $121
million for the first six months of 2009, $210 million for the second quarter of
2008, and $348 million for the first six months of 2008. 

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.9 percentage
points to 16.0% in second-quarter 2009, reflecting the favorable impact of our
cost-reduction initiatives, the impact of foreign exchange, as well as lower
implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, compared to
second-quarter 2008. 

3. Change in Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses, Research &amp;
Development (R) Expenses and In-Process R Charges (IPR)

Reported SI expenses decreased 13% and 15% in the second quarter and first six
months of 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008. The
decreases reflect the favorable impact of foreign exchange, savings associated
with our cost-reduction initiatives and lower related implementation costs. In
addition, the first six months of 2009 included certain insurance recoveries
related to legal defense costs. 

Reported SI expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $85 million for second-quarter 2009, $131 million
for the first six months of 2009, $100 million for second-quarter 2008, and $175
million for the first six months of 2008. 

Reported R expenses, excluding IPR, decreased 14% and 9% in the second
quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods
in 2008. The decreases are primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign
exchange, the realization of savings associated with our cost-reduction
initiatives and lower related implementation costs. The six-month 2009 decrease
was partially offset by a $150 million milestone payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb
in first-quarter 2009 in connection with the collaboration on apixaban. 

Reported R expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $32 million for second-quarter 2009, $73 million
for the first six months of 2009, $94 million for second-quarter 2008, and $240
million for the first six months of 2008. 

IPR charges in second-quarter 2009 of $20 million relate to the resolution of
a contingency associated with our 2008 acquisition of CovX. IPR charges in
second-quarter 2008 of $156 million primarily related to the acquisitions of
Serenex, Inc. and Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and in the first-quarter 2008,
$398 million primarily related to the acquisitions of CovX and Coley
Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. As a result of adopting Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R, Business
Combinations, beginning January 1, 2009, IPR related to acquisitions after
adoption will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived
intangible assets. We made no acquisitions in the first half of 2009.

 (a)    Net interest expense was $66 million in second-quarter 2009 compared to net interest income of $99 million in the same period in 2008. The change is due primarily to net 
        interest expense recorded in second-quarter 2009 associated with our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes on March 24, 2009 and $10.5 billion of senior    
        unsecured notes June 3, 2009, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Wyeth. In addition, lower interest rates, partially offset by higher cash balances,         
        contributed to the increased net interest expense compared to the year-ago quarter.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                  


5. Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income for second-quarter 2009 was 25.8%compared to 0.9%
in the second quarter of 2008, and in the first six months of 2009 was 27.1%
compared to 12.4% in the first six months of 2008. The higher tax rates for the
second quarter and first six months of 2009 are primarily due to the increased
tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the
pending Wyeth acquisition, partially offset by the change in geographic mix of
expenses incurred to execute our cost-reduction initiatives, as well as the
decrease in IPR charges, which generally are not deductible for tax purposes.
The lower tax rates in the second quarter and first six months of 2008 reflect
tax benefits of $305 million related to favorable tax settlements for multiple
tax years and $426 million related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical
companies, which were both recorded in the second quarter of 2008. 

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was 28.1% in second quarter 2009,
29.0% in the first six months of 2009, 20.0% in second-quarter 2008, and 21.0%
in the first six months of 2008. The higher tax rates on adjusted income(1) in
2009 are primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain
business decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition. The lower
tax rates in the second quarter and first six months of 2008 reflect $305
million in tax benefits related to the resolution of tax issues noted above.

investors` understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this
measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and
should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS.

&lt;p&gt;Previews Second-Quarter Results
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE: POR) announced today that it has
revised full-year 2009 earnings guidance to a range of $1.35 to $1.45 per
diluted share from previous guidance of $1.80 to $1.90 per diluted share. The
key drivers of the revised guidance are as follows:

* Decline in retail margins due to the impacts on retail load from the economic
recession, primarily in the industrial sector. 
* Power originally intended to meet forecasted load was sold into a declining
electricity market. 
* Extension of the scheduled 2009 maintenance outage of Unit 4 of the Colstrip
coal plant. During scheduled maintenance in late March, two turbines were found
to be in need of repair. Both have been sent to the manufacturer. These repairs
are expected to extend the outage from late May until mid-November 2009. 
* Extension of scheduled maintenance outage at the Boardman coal plant. In early
April, the plant was taken off-line for maintenance and generator overhaul,
including a new rotor, with an expected restart date of early June. The
generator did not pass acceptance testing, and the new rotor did not perform
satisfactorily, so the existing generator rotor is being reinstalled. The plant
is now scheduled to return to service by mid-August. 
* Lower-than-forecasted hydroelectric results. 
* Impacts from the above items result in lower income taxes owed, which requires
increased customer refunds under Senate Bill 408, an Oregon utility tax law.

For the second quarter 2009, PGE currently expects earnings to be approximately
$0.31 per diluted share. 

"Oregon`s economy continues to be impacted by the national recession. Retail
loads are down, primarily because our industrial customers` electricity use has
declined by more than we projected just three months ago. In addition, lower
prices in the wholesale energy market have made it difficult to offset lost
revenue with the sale of excess power. These issues, combined with an extended
outage at the Colstrip plant, have led us to reduce our full-year earnings
guidance," says Jim Piro, president and CEO of PGE. 

"Looking ahead, we are continuing to invest in our core utility business,
enhance service to our customers and deliver value to shareholders. We`re making
good progress with significant capital projects. Our Biglow Canyon Wind Farm
Phases II and III are on time and on budget. We are in the full deployment stage
of our new smart-metering technology with approximately 15 percent of the meters
installed. We believe our solid platform for growth provides long-term benefits
to our shareholders."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM on Wednesday announced it was stepping up its partnership with Juniper Networks Inc, but said it was also boosting ties with other equipment vendors including Cisco Systems Inc, playing down suggestions it was aiming to keep an increasingly competitive Cisco at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said it had agreed with Juniper on an original equipment manufacturing (OEM) partnership, under which IBM would rebrand Juniper's switches and routers as its own and sell them as part of its family of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said the move was aimed at providing its customers, in particular corporate data centers dealing with increasingly high-volume network traffic, with a wider range of server, data storage, and networking equipment to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of our customers want choice. They want best of breed," said Jim Comfort, vice-president of IBM's enterprise initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juniper executives said the deal would help expand its distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said it saw partnerships as a way of helping it become a one-stop shop for a diverse set of products, making it easier for customers to buy and manage their data center equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts, however, have said IBM is trying to expand relationships outside its long-standing partnership with top network equipment manufacturer Cisco, which recently announced it was entering the server market -- a move seen as a direct challenge to IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, which sells computer servers and software and technology services including outsourcing and automation, already helps to sell products made by Juniper, and Cisco, under resale partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An OEM deal provides a further incentive for IBM salesmen to promote Juniper products, and analysts have said that could be a way of retaliating against Cisco's encroachment into IBM's server space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, however, played down the rivalry and said it was bolstering its partnership with Cisco. IBM said it planned to resell Cisco's new storage switches using fiber channel over ethernet (FCoE), an emerging technology that improves network speeds, when the products are launched in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said it was also expanding its partnership with Brocade Communications Systems Inc, a much smaller rival to Cisco, to resell its FCoE switches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not in response to anything that any one partner did," Comfort said. "It's our recognition of the need in the data center for a much more integrated and automated environment. This is about IBM's agenda in the data center and how we want to leverage our partner relationships."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the expansion of various partnerships showed that while IBM was seeking to expand ties with Juniper and Brocade for diversity, it needed to remain friendly with Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since many customers used a combination of products from both Cisco and IBM, it was too risky for IBM and Cisco not to ensure their products worked together seamlessly, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No doubt, they are going to be competing. But at the same time, they are ultimately trying to deliver value to customers," said Seamus Crehan, a vice-president at research firm Dell'Oro Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cisco is a dominant player in ethernet switching and they have a very strong position in data center networking. So for IBM to offer their customers choice, they have to include Cisco."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando, Editing by Chris Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adds High-Performance Networking Solutions to IBM`s Data Center Portfolio
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Juniper Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:JNPR), the leader in high-performance networking,
today announced that Juniper and International Business Machines Corporation
(IBM) are continuing to broaden their strategic relationship by entering into an
OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) agreement that will enable IBM to provide
Juniper`s Ethernet networking products and support within IBM`s data center
portfolio of products. 

The addition of Juniper`s products to IBM`s data center networking portfolio
provides customers with a best-in-class networking solution and accelerates both
companies` shared vision of advancing the economics of networking and the data
center by reducing costs, improving services and managing risk. 

"With Juniper`s Ethernet technologies added to our data center portfolio, IBM is
able to offer customers more choice and flexibility in their networking
solutions to address the growing demands being placed on their IT environments,"
said Jim Comfort, IBM VP of Enterprise Initiatives. "This new OEM agreement with
Juniper will help support IBM`s data center networking initiatives through
unparalleled network scalability, carrier-class reliability and operational
simplicity, accelerating the deployment of our customers` virtualized
applications and services, and extending the value of their networks." 

Today`s data centers require higher performance and less complex networks as an
essential element of their evolution. While there are extreme cost pressures on
IT budgets, the demand on data centers only increases with exploding data
volumes, demand for new services, speed and security, and always-on reliability.
In addition, cloud computing will further drive the need for massive scale,
efficiency and elasticity from networks and data center architectures. The
broadened IBM and Juniper relationship is further evidence of the growing
importance of the high-performance network in the progression of data centers
toward cloud computing or cloud-like infrastructures. Both companies agree that
a high-performance network is vital to the backbone for both the data center
(enabling service production) and the global network (enabling service
delivery). 

"This OEM agreement represents a continued deepening of our relationship with
IBM, and a significant new route to market for Juniper," said Hitesh Sheth,
executive vice president and general manager, Ethernet Platforms Business Group,
Juniper Networks. "Our focus on delivering fast, reliable, secure, simplified
networks fits perfectly into IBM`s dynamic infrastructure initiative to help
customers accelerate growth and innovation, while creating operational
efficiencies and overall savings." 

"Today`s enterprise must balance IT budgets and growing network complexity with
increasing end-user demands and market competition," said Mark Fabbi, vice
president - distinguished analyst, Gartner. "Increasing enterprise options for
integrated data center solutions will allow enterprises to more easily achieve
more efficient and agile data center networking architectures. The industry will
clearly benefit from the innovative, open solutions coming from a range of
viable sources." 

The OEM agreement allows IBM System &amp; Technology Group (STG) to brand, label and
sell select Juniper EX Series Ethernet switches and MX Series Ethernet Services
routers. 

Helping Customers Reduce Costs, Become More Green

Juniper`s EX and MX Series products are designed to advance IT initiatives for
data center consolidation, server virtualization and sustainable information
technology. The combined product offering can significantly reduce network
complexity and total cost of ownership by up to 61 percent in capital
expenditures, up to 46 percent in power, up to 46 percent in cooling and up to
33 percent in rack space in the data center. With the EX and MX Series,
customers can achieve greater operational simplicity, agility and efficiency for
accelerating the deployment of new applications and services. 

Broadened Relationship

In 2007, IBM and Juniper signed a pan-IBM agreement with IBM`s Global Technology
Services (GTS) group that allows GTS to resell Juniper`s product portfolio as
part of their Service Product Line (SPL) solutions, including routing, switching
and security technologies. This reseller agreement will continue. IBM also
offers their Managed Maintenance Services (MMS) on the Juniper product
portfolio. The companies have since looked for opportunities to expand its
relationship including today`s OEM announcement with IBM`s STG. IBM and Juniper
have also been working together on joint technology solutions, standards
development, network management and managed security services. 

For the past year, IBM and Juniper have been working together on the Stratus
Project, Juniper`s initiative to create a single data center fabric that will
deliver a quantum jump in scale, performance and simplicity, with the
flexibility to support fully converged and virtualized data center environments.


The two companies have jointly collaborated on a global technology demonstration
highlighting how enterprises can seamlessly extend their private data center
clouds. Through this collaboration, IBM and Juniper continue to install advanced
networking capabilities into IBM`s ten worldwide Cloud Labs for customer
engagements. Once installed, IBM and Juniper will be able to seamlessly move
client computing workloads between private and publicly managed cloud
environments enabling customers to reliably deliver on service level agreements.


Continued research and innovation in cloud computing security has been another
focus for IBM and Juniper. The companies are jointly researching cloud computing
security models to highlight how customers can mitigate attacks on corporate
data and computer systems.

&lt;p&gt; * IBM and Juniper bolster partnership, agree to OEM deal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * IBM also boosts ties with Cisco and Brocade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * IBM plays down rivalry with Cisco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) on Wednesday
announced it was stepping up its partnership with Juniper
Networks Inc JNPR.O, but said it was also boosting ties with
other equipment vendors including Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O),
playing down suggestions it was aiming to keep an increasingly
competitive Cisco at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp said it had agreed
with Juniper on an original equipment manufacturing (OEM)
partnership, under which IBM would rebrand Juniper's switches
and routers as its own and sell them as part of its family of
products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said the move was aimed at providing its customers, in
particular corporate data centres dealing with increasingly
high-volume network traffic, with a wider range of server, data
storage, and networking equipment to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Most of our customers want choice. They want best of
breed," said Jim Comfort, vice-president of IBM's enterprise
initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Juniper executives said the deal would help expand its
distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said it saw partnerships as a way of helping it become
a one-stop shop for a diverse set of products, making it easier
for customers to buy and manage their data center equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts, however, have said IBM is trying to expand
relationships outside its long-standing partnership with top
network equipment manufacturer Cisco, which recently announced
it was entering the server market -- a move seen as a direct
challenge to IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM, which sells computer servers and software and
technology services including outsourcing and automation,
already helps to sell products made by Juniper, and Cisco,
under resale partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An OEM deal provides a further incentive for IBM salesmen
to promote Juniper products, and analysts have said that could
be a way of retaliating against Cisco's encroachment into IBM's
server space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM, however, played down the rivalry and said it was
bolstering its partnership with Cisco. IBM said it planned to
resell Cisco's new storage switches using fibre channel over
ethernet (FCoE), an emerging technology that improves network
speeds, when the products are launched in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said it was also expanding its partnership with Brocade
Communicatins Systems Inc  (BRCD.O), a much smaller rival to
Cisco, to resell its FCoE switches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's not in response to anything that any one partner
did," Comfort said. "It's our recognition of the need in the
data center for a much more integrated and automated
environment. This is about IBM's agenda in the data center and
how we want to leverage our partner relationships."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the expansion of various partnerships showed
that while IBM was seeking to expand ties with Juniper and
Brocade for diversity, it needed to remain friendly with Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since many customers used a combination of products from
both Cisco and IBM, it was too risky for IBM and Cisco not to
ensure their products worked together seamlessly, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No doubt, they are going to be competing. But at the same
time, they are ultimately trying to deliver value to
customers," said Seamus Crehan, a vice-president at research
firm Dell'Oro Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cisco is a dominant player in ethernet switching and they
have a very strong position in data center networking. So for
IBM to offer their customers choice, they have to include
Cisco."

 (Adds new annual cost forecast, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
posted the first-ever drop in annual sales of Windows and its
quarterly revenue fell a steeper-than-expected 17 percent as
its business continued to be hurt by the weak global PC and
server markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news sent Microsoft shares down 8 percent and took the
shine off a big U.S. stock market rally earlier in the day that
had driven the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI above 9,000
points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software maker, whose operating systems
power the vast majority of the world's personal computers,
offered little hope for a turnaround in technology until next
year, despite recent optimism from rival International Business
Machines Corp (IBM.N) and chip maker Intel Corp (INTC.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We still see conditions being challenging for the balance
of this calendar year," Chief Financial Officer Christopher
Liddell said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At least sequentially, we are seeing a little bit of
growth. While things are not necessarily getting better, they
may have bottomed out," said Liddell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LIGHT ON REVENUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft reported fiscal fourth quarter net profit of
$3.045 billion, or 34 cents per share, compared with $4.297
billion, or 46 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profit excluding items was 36 cents per share for the
quarter ended June 30, meeting analysts' average forecast,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales fell 17 percent to $13.1 billion, missing analysts'
average estimate of $14.48 billion. Annual sales of the
company's Windows operating system -- its first and most
important business -- fell for the first time on record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They were really light on revenue. They need to explain
where the money went. If I was Nancy Drew this would be the
case of the missing revenue," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst
at Fort Pitt Capital Group, referring to the fictional
detective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street highlighted the lack of big tech projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Spending has been sparse by businesses and we're not in
full recovery mode yet," said Laxmi Poruri, partner at Primary
Global Research. "We're not in big-ticket mode, which is
businesses purchasing a lot of equipment and a lot of software.
They're doing small projects and that's going to hurt your
margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SLASHING COSTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is preparing to bring out the latest version of
its operating system, Windows 7, on Oct. 22. Liddell said that
release would not, on its own, spark a recovery in PC sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With sales under pressure, the Redmond, Washington-based
company is focusing on controlling costs, announcing 5,000 job
cuts in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For fiscal year 2010, which started July 1, the company is
targeting $26.6 billion to $26.9 billion in operating expenses,
slightly cutting the lower end of its estimate from three
months ago. Comparable expenses in the fiscal year just ended
were $25.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's shares fell 8 percent to $23.44 in extended
trading, after closing up 3 percent at $25.56 on Nasdaq,
contributing to losses on stock futures across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Thursday's close, the stock had risen 70 percent since
early March, on hopes that Windows 7 system will be a hit and a
positive reaction to its new Bing search engine.

&lt;p&gt; * Tech stocks tumble in after hours trade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexei Oreskovic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, July 23 (Reuters) - The tech sector's road
to recovery just got a lot bumpier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) billion-dollar-plus revenue
shortfall in its fiscal fourth-quarter abruptly dampened hopes
that demand for PCs was on the mend and sent a spate of tech
stocks tumbling after-hours on Thursday. [ID:nN23403957]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Wall Street has rallied on better-than-expected
quarterly results from chipmakers Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Texas
Instruments Inc TXN.N this month, Thursday's disappointing
batch of earnings underscored the challenges still facing many
technology businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The problem is people have been running all stocks up,
there's hasn't been any kind of differentiation at all," said
Dan Niles, co-Chief Investment Officer of Alpha One Capital
Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Niles, the financial results of Intel and TI
are not a reliable indicator of demand since they were
component vendors that sold into the supply chain rather than
to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors have overlooked negative news from companies like
Dell Inc DELL.O, which sells its wares directly to customers
and which warned last week of profit margin contraction and
weak demand from corporate buyers of PCs. [ID:nLF83743]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft was a "reality check" said Niles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft fell 7 percent to $23.75, after the
software company reported its first ever annual decline in
sales of the Windows operating system used in an overwhelming
majority of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fellow bellwether Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), the world's
largest online retailer, delivered lackluster results on
Thursday, sending its shares down more than 6 percent in after
hours trade. [ID:nN23417518]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And chipmaker Broadcom Corp (BRCM.O), which reported
better-than-expected revenue quarterly revenue, shed 4.5
percent of its value in extended trade. [ID:nN23391190]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had a barrage of bad news. That will probably set the
market back a bit," said Fred Hickey, editor of the High-Tech
Strategist Newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHAT, ME WORRY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq has risen roughly 12 percent in the past two
weeks and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 9,000 on
Thursday for the first time since January, as earnings reports
and encouraging signs in the housing market bolstered investor
optimism that economic conditions are improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not all market watchers are equally downbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer for Solaris Asset
Management, thinks investors overreacted to the bad news from
Microsoft after Thursday's market close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It has been a really great earnings season for technology
in general. That strength was not confirmed by Microsoft," said
Ghriskey, whose firm manages $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it's tough to find fault with the results delivered by
Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday. The Cupertino, California
company bested analysts expectations as demand for the iPhone
and Mac computers remained strong. [ID:nN20471555]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apart from Apple, Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek said
the common theme among tech companies in the second quarter was
revenue that was either light or down double-digits
year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tech firms had been able to show strong profit from
cost-cutting, said Misek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If investors were buying tech stocks for current results
then they made a mistake," said Misek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he said if investors had been buying stocks in
anticipation of improving macroeconomic and banking conditions,
then the pullback following Thursday's disappointing earnings
results might not be as pronounced.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's plan to "sandbox" Office documents in the next version of its application suite is an admission that the company can't keep hackers from exploiting file format bugs, a security analyst said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's been happening is that Office has lots of vulnerabilities," said John Pescatore, Gartner's primary security analyst. "For the past 18 months, hackers have been fuzzing Office file formats," he said, referring to the practice of "fuzzing," a tactic that relies on automated tools that drop random data into applications to see if, and where, breakdowns occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuzzing has been a hacker's best friend: Microsoft has repeatedly had to patch file format vulnerabilities in Office applications, most recently in July when it fixed a flaw in Publisher 2007 and in June, when it patched seven vulnerabilities in Excel and two more in Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's happening is that the bad guys are using fuzzing tools to find vulnerabilities in Office, and now Microsoft is saying, 'Okay, we can't find, let alone fix, every vulnerability. So here's a way to put a sandbox around the vulnerability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sandbox technique Pescatore mentioned is a new addition to Office 2010, the upcoming upgrade to Microsoft's bestselling Windows application suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Brad Albrecht, a senior security program manager with the Office team, Office 2010 will sport something called "Protected View" that isolates Word, Excel and PowerPoint files in a read-only environment. The sandbox, said Albrecht in a post to a company blog this week, will have "minimal access to the system, and no access to your other files and information. Even if the file is malicious, it can't get out of the sandbox and do harm to your computer or data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a good thing," Pescatore agreed. "Sandboxing and isolation are always good things in security, if only to limit the damage of a malicious file."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albrecht also spelled out other security measures that Office 2010 will implement, including a more flexible file blocker and a suite-wide roll-out of "Office File Validation," a practice that was rolled out in Publisher 2007 Service Pack 2 (SP2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The file blocker, introduced in Office 2007 then back-ported to Office 2003 in September 2007 with SP3, automatically bars access to some document types. Albrecht said that Office 2010 will let users fine-tune the feature to better manage which formats Word, Excel and PowerPoint open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"File blocking was a real broad-brush thing in Office 2007," said Pescatore, "and it would give users obscure error messages." He applauded the move toward flexibility in the file blocker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office File Validation, meanwhile, is a system that validates older, pre-XML file formats for Word, Excel and PowerPoint, then blocks those that don't conform to the documented format. Documents that contain malicious code would presumably trigger the block. At that point, Office 2010 will hand off the file to the Protected View sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still a trade-off," said Pescatore, talking about the improved security Microsoft plans for Office 2010. "The file in the sandbox is read-only, but if I need to open it and add something to it, that's going to annoy users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another downside, said Pescatore: Sandboxing, which is essentially lightweight versions of virtual machines, consumes PC resources. "On the other hand, PCs are getting faster, so we have the ability to throw more cycles at [sandboxes]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albrecht claimed that the new security features in Office 2010 would have "an indistinguishable performance impact on your [document] load time," but didn't go into detail about system requirements or the impact on the machine's memory and processor resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to make Albrecht available to answer follow-up questions about Office 2010's security plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pescatore likes what he sees in Microsoft's bird's-eye view. "To build a sandbox, especially around Word docs, that's a very good idea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged on Thursday, driving the Dow industrials above the key 9,000 mark for the first time since January, as strong corporate profits and rebounding home sales spurred optimism about the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad-based rally helped all 10 of the SP 500's benchmark sectors finish the day in positive territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, stock index futures dropped in late trading, suggesting Wall Street might hit a roadblock on Friday after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and American Express (AXP.N) posted disappointing quarterly results after the bell, sending their stocks lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their reports provided a sharp contrast to robust results that diversified manufacturer 3M  Co (MMM.N) and telecommunications company ATT Inc (T.N) reported before the bell, giving the broader market a strong start on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market extended opening gains after data showed U.S. existing home sales rose in June -- the first time since 2004 that this measure has risen three months in a row. The Dow Jones U.S. home construction index .DJUSHB jumped 4.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq registered its 12th straight day of gains, its longest winning streak since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I like about the rally that we've seen so far is the breadth of it. It's not really confined to a single sector. It's broadly spread. That gives me confidence," said John Coyne, president of Philadelphia-based Brinker Capital, with $8 billion under management. "It's been a wonderful run-up here. It's certainly helping to restore investor confidence, given the trauma that people went through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI jumped 188.03 points, or 2.12 percent, to end at 9,069.29 -- its highest close since November 2008. It was the Dow's first close above 9,000 since January 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX gained 22.22 points, or 2.33 percent, to 976.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 47.22 points, or 2.45 percent, to 1,973.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The string of good news helped the SP 500 punch through a critical technical resistance level at 960, sparking a rally that lifted the benchmark index to 979.42 -- its highest intraday level in eight months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That breakout, according to some analysts, was an indication that the SP 500 could take aim at the 1,000 mark. The SP 500 is now up 44.3 percent since its 12-year closing low on March 9. But it's still 37.6 percent below its record closing high of 1,565.15 in October 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the year, the Nasdaq is up 25 percent, while the blue-chip Dow average is up 3.34 percent and the SP 500 is up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8.09 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICROSOFT, AMAZON AND AMEX SINK LATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bell, shares of Microsoft, a tech bellwether and a Dow component, fell about 8 percent to $23.60 from its Nasdaq close at $25.56. During the regular session, Microsoft's stock climbed 3.1 percent ahead of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Web retailer Amazon.com lost 7.7 percent to $86.60 in extended-hours trading, down from their Nasdaq close at $93.87. During regular trading, Amazon's shares rose 5.7 percent before the earnings were released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quarterly revenues of both Microsoft and Amazon.com missed forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express, a credit card company and a Dow component, posted a lower quarterly profit, hurt by weakness in card member spending, record credit losses, restructuring charges and repayment of government funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bell, American Express shares slid nearly 5 percent to $28.07 from a New York Stock Exchange close at $29.45. In regular trading, the stock was up 2.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POST-IT NOTE: 3M AND EBAY FLY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the regular session, 3M's stock rose 7.4 percent to $69.43 and contributed the most to the Dow's gain after the diversified manufacturer's profit handily beat analysts' expectations, and the company lifted its revenue outlook for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue-chip ATT's stock gained 2.6 percent to $25.48 after it reported a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit as strong sales of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone helped increase wireless subscriber growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the Nasdaq's major advancers was eBay Inc (EBAY.O), whose second-quarter results beat Wall Street's expectations. The online marketplace's stock shot up 10.6 percent to $21.52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only three of the Dow's 30 components ended lower, including McDonald's Corp (MCD.N). The hamburger chain's stock fell 4.6 percent to $56.09 after it posted lower-than-expected June same-store sales and its quarterly profit matched Wall Street's forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, shares of Moody's Corp (MCO.N) fell 3.8 percent to $25.52 following news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) reduced its stake in the credit ratings provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the opening bell, U.S. government data showed claims for jobless benefits rose last week, roughly in line with expectations, while continuing claims declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1.40 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.49 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 3.01 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a ratio of more than 5 to 1, while on the Nasdaq, about seven stocks rose for every two that fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Updates with Microsoft, Amazon.com and American Express
after the bell, indexes' yearly gains and volume figures)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged on
Thursday, driving the Dow industrials above the key 9,000 mark

suggesting Wall Street might hit a roadblock on Friday after
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and American
Express (AXP.N) posted disappointing quarterly results after
the bell, sending their stocks lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their reports provided a sharp contrast to robust results
that diversified manufacturer 3M  Co (MMM.N) and
telecommunications company ATT Inc (T.N) reported before the
bell, giving the broader market a strong start on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market extended opening gains after data showed U.S.
existing home sales rose in June -- the first time since 2004
that this measure has risen three months in a row. The Dow
Jones U.S. home construction index .DJUSHB jumped 4.9
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq registered its 12th straight day of gains, its

points, or 2.12 percent, to end at 9,069.29 -- its highest
close since November 2008. It was the Dow's first close above
9,000 since January 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX gained 22.22
points, or 2.33 percent, to 976.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index
.IXIC climbed 47.22 points, or 2.45 percent, to 1,973.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The string of good news helped the SP 500 punch through a
critical technical resistance level at 960, sparking a rally
that lifted the benchmark index to 979.42 -- its highest
intraday level in eight months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That breakout, according to some analysts, was an
indication that the SP 500 could take aim at the 1,000 mark.
The SP 500 is now up 44.3 percent since its 12-year closing

closing high of 1,565.15 in October 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the year, the Nasdaq is up 25 percent, while the
blue-chip Dow average is up 3.34 percent and the SP 500 is up
 8.09 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICROSOFT, AMAZON AND AMEX SINK LATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the bell, shares of Microsoft, a tech bellwether and
a Dow component, fell about 8 percent to $23.60 from its
Nasdaq close at $25.56. During the regular session,
Microsoft's stock climbed 3.1 percent ahead of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Web retailer Amazon.com lost 7.7 percent to
$86.60 in extended-hours trading, down from their Nasdaq close
at $93.87. During regular trading, Amazon's shares rose 5.7
percent before the earnings were released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The quarterly revenues of both Microsoft and Amazon.com
missed forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Express, a credit card company and a Dow
component, posted a lower quarterly profit, hurt by weakness
in card member spending, record credit losses, restructuring
charges and repayment of government funds. [ID:nN23305169 ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the bell, American Express shares slid nearly 5

$69.43 and contributed the most to the Dow's gain after the

2009. [ID:nN22327347]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blue-chip ATT's stock gained 2.6 percent to $25.48 after

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted a steeper-than-expected 17 percent drop in quarterly revenue and said its business continued to be hurt by the weak global PC and server markets, sending its shares down 8 percent and hurting broader stock futures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER MISEK, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The common theme on the technology reports, excluding Apple, was that revenues were either light or down double digits from last year and that companies were able to show really strong profits from cost cutting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Microsoft is showing you is that the revenue story, of weakness and consumers holding back, is consistent. I know everyone was surprised by how strong Intel's results were, us included, but Intel sells chips to any laptop, any PC maker, so whether it's a netbook or desktop they sell it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whereas for Microsoft, if it's a netbook they get a lower amount. They're getting hurt by the emergence of netbooks and the emergence from new competition from netbooks, Apple, Android on phones, Chrome and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors were and are playing this for a Windows 7 upgrade cycle. The problem is, we haven't seen that and this quarter isn't going to give us any indication of that. We won't be able to see that till Windows 7 launches in October, and the soonest point you would have a read on it would be in January."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YUN KIM, ANALYST, BROADPOINT AMTECH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nothing really showed much of an improvement from the last couple of quarters. The core focus here is really in the Windows business, and they definitely didn't see their business improve from the weakness in the overall PC market, despite some positive chatter from Intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was some hope that their business might show some improvement, but it didn't show that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The weakness came from obviously the Windows business and also on the enterprise side of the business. And also the Xbox, which is a huge revenue contributor but not a big margin contributor, there was definitely a big dropoff on Xbox consoles on the revenue side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The main story here is their operating expense guidance for next year. They guided for it to be up slightly. I think people were expecting that to be down. So that's what's really touching off the weakness right now. People would have looked past Q4 numbers if they simply guided op ex down for next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of people thought that Microsoft could basically manage their expense, their margins, very carefully, such that they'd be able to weather any kind of weakness or volatility in their revenue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEPHEN MASSOCCA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH MORGAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's revenue was really light, on the very bottom line. We expect an upgrade to come along, but things are very uncertain at this point. I think from now on, we are left with little room for disappointments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SID PARAKH, ANALYST, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly not to our expectations, it was very disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results from most of the electronics supply chain were really good, especially if you look at Intel. That would have implied that the results should have looked better, but it clearly did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The operating expenses was actually a little better than we were expecting. One of the things that was evident even in the results is that cost controls was pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big question is with revenues and what's happening. Clearly enterprise spending is still weak. If you compare numbers to our model, they're in line but they miss on the server side and the Microsoft business division."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAXMI PORURI, PARTNER, PRIMARY GLOBAL RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Spending has been sparse by businesses and we're not in full recovery mode yet. We're not in big-ticket mode, which is businesses purchasing a lot of equipment and a lot of software. They're doing small projects and that's going to hurt your margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of uncertainty. When you have a product and a recent history of an operating system that didn't work, which is Vista, and you have a new one coming up, you're not going to jump on the bandwagon straight away, especially in an environment when your spending is going to be scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So what we're going to see is a little lull in terms of people waiting to see if the first version (of Windows 7) has bugs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were really light on revenue. I hope they'll highlight that on the call, give more clarity. I would hope in the call they're going to tell us where the dollars are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to explain where the money went. If I was Nancy Drew this would be the case of the missing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Servers and tools were down $200 million year over year, that's not hugely surprising. Companies aren't exactly going out there and buying new servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That being said, I think the company's strong cost controls paid off for it. Microsoft hasn't really been known as somebody that has very tight cost controls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOAN TRAN, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looked like a pretty tough quarter for Microsoft. The topline was very weak, excluding the revenue deferral for Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The operating expense outlook was in line with our expectations. Microsoft is very much in touch with in-demand, meaning there's not a lot inventory of software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So the reports you saw from Intel benefiting from inventory replenishment in the supply chain, but Microsoft is still very much in touch with in-demand. It's not different from anything else we're seeing from other PC makers, in that demand remains weak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Yinka Adegoke, Edward Krudy and Angela Moon in New York and Alexei Oreskovic in San Francisco; Compiled by Edwin Chan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Research Equity Strategist, Dirk Van Dijk says that S 500 earnings are
continuing to show red ink. He tracks companies on the Zacks.com web site,
naming names, while forecasting trends for the months ahead. 

Key Points from Van Dijk's Latest Earnings Assessment

* Second Quarter total net income expected to be down 32.4% year/year 
* Early positive surprises lead disappointments by almost 5:1 margin 
* Early results much stronger than expected; the median surprise is 7.0% 
* Staples only sector expected to post positive growth in second quarter 
* 6 sectors expected to decline more than 25% 
* Financials expected to rebound after disastrous 2008 (but poor quality EPS) 
* Third quarter expected to be down 22.6% year/year 
* Estimate cuts and increases for 2009 nearly in balance 
* Bottom up estimate for S 500 now $59.82 in 2009 versus $59.72 last week. 
* S 500 now expected to earn $74.48 in 2010 versus $74.24 last week 
* Top down estimates $56.54 and $67.79, respectively

The Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2009

* Revisions ratio for S 500 up to 1.02, from 0.96 
* Been in near balance for about a month now 
* 5 sectors in positive territory; Consumer Sectors and Tech lead 
* Industrials, Utilities and Telecom continue to see estimates cut 
* Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates up to 0.96 from 0.90 
* Total number of revisions (4-week total) up to 2,060 from 1,567 (31.5%) 
* Increases up to 1,038 from 766 (35.5%); cuts up to 1,022 from 801 (27.5%) 
* Total revisions activity past the low for the quarter; will rise rapidly

Consumer Staples is being lead by General Mills (NYSE: GIS) in reaction to its
better than expected earnings. The revisions ratio for the sector is being held
back by Walgreen (NYSE: WAG), which was responsible for 45% of all estimate cuts
for the sector. If WAG is backed out, the revisions ratio for the sector would
be almost 3.0. Tech is being lead by some of the most prominent names in the
sector, such as Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL). 

Financials are a mixed bag, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) gathering lots of
upward revisions while the regional banks continue to see a preponderance of
estimate cuts. 

In Energy, the weakness is concentrated among the refiners like Tesoro (NYSE:
TSO).

(Nasdaq: HGSI) announced today that it will be selling 45,000 doses of
raxibacumab or ABthrax to the U.S. Government for the Strategic National
Stockpile. The delivery is to be made over a 36-month period, beginning the
final quarter of 2009. The company expects to receive approximately $151 million
from the completion of this order. 

The company had delivered 20,000 doses of the drug, for emergency use in the
treatment of inhalation anthrax, to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile in the
first quarter of this year and completed the delivery in the second quarter. It
recognized $153.8 million in ABthrax revenue in the first quarter. 

This order for additional doses of ABthrax comes on the heels of stupendous news
for the company whereby Human Genome and its partner GlaxoSmithKline Plc (NYSE:
GSK) announced positive results for its lupus drug Benlysta in a phase III study
(BLISS-52). Results from another late-stage study (BLISS-76) for the same
indication are expected this November.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`sAnalyst Blog: 

IBM Announces Company Agreements

In a recent press release, IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced agreements with Brocade
(Nasdaq: BRCD), Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) and Juniper (Nasdaq: JNPR) to enhance
networking technology, which will ultimately help companies to transfer enormous
amount of data through different networks. 

As per the agreement, IBM will be acting as a reseller and original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) for switches and routers that will help transfer data across
networks with greater speed and efficiency. The company expects the demand for
network equipments to increase 16x by 2020. 

In collaboration with Barcode, IBM has introduced IBM Converged Switch B32 and
10Gb Converged Network Adapter (CNA) for IBM System x. This is the company's
first Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) offerings. We believe this technical
collaboration will help them produce advanced quality products, which are
expected to create a niche market, in the networking arena. 

The company's collaboration with JNPR will allow IBM to rebrand and sell
selected Juniper EX and MX switches and routers. This combined product from IBM
and Juniper will be available late this year, and will help Juniper to market
its product with a new identity. 

IBM will enable Cisco's Systems &amp; Technology Group sellers and partners to
resell the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches. These are high-performance,
networking switches, used for data center networks, and supports Fiber Channel
connectivity over Ethernet (FCoE). We feel this collaboration will bring out
products with enhanced features and resolve the fiber optic connectivity issues
to a greater extent. 

McClatchy Profit Rises on Cost Cut

Amid the secular and cyclical slowdown in print advertising, McClatchy Company
(NYSE: MNI), the third largest newspaper company in the U.S. and the publisher
of 80 newspapers including the Miami Herald and Sacramento Bee, reported second
quarter 2009 results. 

The company is facing the same dramatic decline in advertising revenue, as the
rest of the newspaper industry, reflecting the deepening economic recession. To
combat the downturn, management undertook cost-cutting initiatives, focused on
building internet operations and reduced debt load. McClatchy lowered its
headcounts by 15%, or 1,600 employees, cut executive pay, suspended 401K
matching contribution and dividend. The company was able to lower its cash
expenses by 29.3% and operating expenses by 28.1%.

Bumpy Q2 for Regional Banks

Results for regional banks may be dreadful in the second quarter 2009, as
evidenced by the companies who have already reported their results. 

Regions Financial Corp. (NYSE: RF), Comerica Inc. (NYSE: CMA) and ZION
Bancorporation (Nasdaq: ZION) reported losses in the quarter primarily due to
continued strain in their loan portfolios, as the commercial sector continues to
droop in the prolonged recession. 

Along with continued losses in their residential mortgage, home equity and
consumer loan portfolios, these banks are also showing continued distress in
their residential and commercial development loans, as well as commercial real
estate loans. 

Large-cap center banks and brokerage firms like Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and
Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) were able to somewhat offset weak credit metrics by
strong results in their investment banking and mortgage refinancing divisions.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) fell 4.1 percent after the closing bell on Thursday after the company reported results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares were down at $24.50 after closing on the Nasdaq at $25.56.&lt;/p&gt;

FILED UNDER: </body></entry><entry author="Bill Rigby" date="2009-07-23T17:07:11+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE56M53O20090723"><headline>Microsoft deal talk, optimism overshadow results</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will likely report the first annual sales dip in its history as a public company, but investors are looking beyond that for upbeat comments on Windows 7, signs of a tech sector recovery, and even a deal with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) to challenge Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question for investors when the world's largest software company reports quarterly results on Thursday is whether it can present enough optimism to maintain the momentum that has pushed shares up 63 percent since early March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech heavyweights IBM (IBM.N) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) ratcheted up expectations last week by blowing through Wall Street forecasts and setting ambitious outlooks that suggest the worst may be over for the sagging computer business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose software drives more than 90 percent of the world's PCs, stands to benefit as it prepares to roll out its new Windows 7 operating system in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's been a sentiment shift," said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital management. "People are starting to get excited now about the visibility of Windows 7 -- it's got good reviews and they've got some pent-up demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've turned the corner in a lot of their businesses," said Lowenstein, a manager of HighMark's Value Momentum mutual fund, which holds about 530,000 Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from Windows 7 -- which should help erase bad memories of its poorly received predecessor Vista -- Microsoft has a new version of its huge-selling Office suite of applications in the works, and it is finally making headway against Google with its six-week old Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of intermittent negotiations, and an aborted takeover bid last year, Microsoft finally looks ready to strike an Internet search and online advertising deal with Yahoo, according to a source familiar with the situation. An announcement could come before the results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sooner these two decide to bring the best of what they both have together and then jointly go after the market, the more it will benefit both," said Lowenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC RECOVERY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader technology economy could be moving in Microsoft's direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last quarter's worldwide PC shipments fell about 3 percent from a year ago, a much smaller drop than expected in the depths of a U.S. recession. Analysts are now talking about growth in PC sales returning in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft's Windows 7 scheduled to launch in late October, that could bode well for the company's fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The new product pipeline, combined with even a modest rebound in IT spending growth, could have significant impact on Microsoft's top-line" in its new fiscal year, which started July 1, according to a Goldman Sachs analyst report last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman put Microsoft on its top stock picks list -- calling it a "conviction buy" last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the stock rises after earnings, it could trigger an "investor snowball effect", according to Goldman, whose analysts point out that fund managers in the "growth" sector -- looking for share price appreciation rather than undervalued stocks or high dividends -- are significantly underinvested in Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock was under-owned for a while -- it was in growth stock purgatory," said Lowenstein. "It hadn't delivered the higher expectations that some of the other software companies were producing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If growth fund managers rush to buy an outperforming Microsoft stock to rebalance their positions, that could push the share price even higher, said Lowenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after its recent surge, Microsoft stock is still reasonably priced relative to comparable investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Friday's closing price, Microsoft shares are trading at 13.3 times expected earnings per share for fiscal 2010, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares are trading at 23.4 times expected earnings for fiscal 2010, Google at 17.4 times and IBM at 11 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite rising hopes for Microsoft, some still sound a note of caution not to get ahead of a recovery that has not materialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would love to see higher revenues but I don't know if that's realistic," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think their customers are expanding and thus need systems and processes to grow that. I want to see new (technology) projects starting up and I don't see that anywhere." (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, July 23 (Reuters) - Germany's Evonik [EVON.UL]
[RAGED.UL], a chemicals, real estate and power production group,
said it is reconsidering its strategy with the help of
investment bank JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company wants to find out which of its businesses are
the most profitable ones and how it can best expand them, a
spokeswoman for the company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A report in German paper Financial Times Deutschland that
the company seeks to expand parts of the company while selling
others was "speculation", she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evonik posted a net loss in the first quarter but has to pay
a dividend of some 320 million euros ($455.2 million) for 2009
to its shareholders CVC [CVC.UL] and the foundation that is
managing Evonik's former mining business.

&lt;p&gt; July 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded AnnTaylor Stores
Corp (ANN.N) to "buy" from "neutral" citing the women's apparel
retailer's improved merchandise for Fall and tighter management
of inventory.

 New products at AnnTaylor are more "brand appropriate"
compared with a major merchandising miss last Fall, Goldman
Sachs analyst Michelle Tan said in a note dated July 22.

 Unlike last year, when efforts to modernize the assortments
were far too trendy and casual, the product for Fall 2009 is
"more on brand," Tan said.

 Tan also expects the retailer's conservative inventory plan
for the second half of 2009 to help it recover gross margin.
She also raised her price target on the stock to $13 from
$6.50.

 "Reversing last year's inventory glut and improving
merchandise flow should reduce markdowns and drive gross
margin," she said.

 The operator of the AnnTaylor and AnnTaylor LOFT chains has
seen sales at its stores dwindle as consumers reduced spending,
especially for women's clothes.

 Separately, the brokerage removed Aeropostale Inc (ARO.N)
from its Americas Buy List, saying the retailer's valuation was
in line with its six-month price target of $38.

 "We continue to believe that significant improvements in
product and process at Aeropostale will yield upside to
consensus expectations, but we see this as largely reflected in
the stock at current levels," Tan said.

 AnnTaylor shares closed at $8.58, while those of
Aeropostale closed at $37.91 Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Exclusive YouTube Video Features New Fashions Inspired by JONAS and Wizards of
Waverly Place &amp; Disney Channel and Disney XD star Interviews from the Red Carpet
GLENDALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney today unveiled all new tween fashion lines inspired by Disney Channel
smash hits JONAS and the Emmy-nominated Wizards of Waverly Place with the launch
of a virtual fashion show video on the official Disney Consumer Products YouTube
channel, Disney Living. With fashion, accessories, footwear, and more hitting
the runway for an audience of ecstatic tweens, this unique video is the first to
take Disney-inspired fashions directly to the online tween community. Tween
models wearing the latest back-to-school looks rocked the runway as they showed
off the hottest styles hitting retailers in July including JC Penney, Kmart,
Sears, Walmart, Target and DisneyStore.com. 

The red carpet event in Los Angeles was attended by "JONAS'" Nicole Anderson;
"Wizards of Waverly Place's" Maria Canals-Barrera; "Sonny With A Chance's"
Tiffany Thornton, Brandon Mychal Smith, Doug Brochu, Allisyn Ashley Arm;
"Princess Protection Program's" Samantha Droke; "Zeke and Luther's" Daniel
Curtis Lee and Ryan Newman; "Camp Rock's" Anna Maria Perez de Tagle; "The Game
Plan's" Madison Pettis and hosts Jennifer Stone ("Wizards of Waverly Place") and
Chelsea Staub ("JONAS"). In addition to never-before-seen footage of the runway
show, the video also features red carpet interviews and an exclusive interview
with Selena Gomez ("Wizards of Waverly Place") sharing some of her personal
fashion ideas. 

Showcasing new fashion lines inspired by the latest trends, the "JONAS"
collection has an academic angle for a preppy collegiate look that is
reminiscent of this superstar cast`s singular style. Skinny pants combined with
button down shirts and tailored vests create "Luxe Prep" outfits that take East
Coast sophistication and throws in a rocker twist. Tailored plaids and tweeds
styled in walking shorts mixed with polo tops in "Ivy League" hues and fun
accessories create an overall tween superstar look. The collection also features
an updated take on heraldic crests and badges that are incorporated into several
pieces, as well as fun accessories like colorful beaded wrap bracelets and faux
ties for an added touch of personality. 

The "Wizards of Waverly Place" collection takes Alex Russo`s bohemian style and
adds a twist for a "Boho Chic" look that is comfortable, casual and has just the
right amount of magic. Key looks are tunic length border print tops, updated
peasant blouses, distressed miniskirts, fitted skimmers and skinny denim. Prints
and graphics contrast with a gorgeous peacock feather motif playing a starring
role in the collection. Contemporary paisley`s with hints of gold and intricate
mosaic patterns with beading, crochet appliqu&#233;s and a touch of sparkle add just
the right detailing. The accessories collection mixes whimsical necklaces, and
bracelets to complete the relaxed `boho` look.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) -- Dutch bank ING Group (ING.AS) has hired JPMorgan (JPM.N) to advise on the sale of ING's private banking business in Europe and Asia, which could fetch more than $1 billion, sources told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sale is part of ING's move to raise cash after being hit badly by the global credit crisis, which forced it into a loss in 2008 and led to the Dutch government injecting 10 billion euros into the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal could be over a billion dollar," said a source with direct knowledge of the deal, adding JPMorgan is advising the firm. "But it's a bit early in the process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ING declined to comment and JPMorgan was not available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dutch bank has been working on a program to reduce risks, raise up to 8 billion euros from asset sales and exit from 10 of 48 countries where it operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it is a good sign that will give an extra buffer to ING. Secondly, in private banking, ING will never become a world leader. Strategically it makes sense (to sell)," Rabo Securities analyst Cor Kluis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kluis said he did not expect ING to sell its Dutch private banking business, which administered 20 billion euros in assets out of the total 62 billion euros the Dutch bank had under management at the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said a price of more than $1 billion for the operations, excluding the Dutch unit, was possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of ING's private bank unit, which was loss-making in the fourth quarter of 2008, may take a few months and could draw interest from global and Asian players, a second source with knowledge of the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe the Australians would be interested or large Euro commercial banks," said a Singapore-based private banker who is not involved in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources declined to be identified because the deal is not public yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ING Private Banking made a loss of 12 million euros in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to loan loss provisions at Private Banking Asia, the bank said in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ING announced in November the sale of its private banking operations in Curacao to Dutch private bank Van Lanschot (VLAN.AS) to focus its operations on Europe and Asia. The unit managed 500 million euros of assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ING shares were unchanged at 7.90 euros by 0858 GMT, in line with the rest of the DJ Stoxx European Insurance index .SXIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gilbert Kreijger in Amsterdam; Editing by Kevin Lim/Muralikumar Anantharaman/Marie Maitre)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney plans to offer a broad array of its content, including movies, TV shows and games, online to those willing to pay for it -- possibly at a single Web site that requires a subscription, president and CEO Robert Iger said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The notion of going online at some point as a subscribe-to, robust entertainment experience is pretty attractive to us," Iger said. "We are developing such an experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top Mouseketeer made the remarks Wednesday at Fortune magazine's Brainstorm: Tech conference. Pressed for details by Fortune editor-at-large Richard Siklos, Iger declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney already is bringing in revenue online. It has joined NBC Universal and News Corp. as a content provider and equity partner in Hulu, which sells advertising. Disney also sells content on iTunes and charges a subscription fee for its Club Penguin site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Iger said much more money can be extracted from Web surfers seeking quality content. He noted that consumers spend $5 an hour at theaters to see movies, 75 cents an hour to read books, newspapers and magazines and 50 cents an hour to watch cable and satellite TV, but only 25 cents an hour to surf the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's plenty of room for people to spend more money on things that they're doing online," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siklos noted that Iger is a pioneer in user-generated content, having put "America's Funniest Home Videos" on ABC 20 years ago. Iger said he kicks himself for not taking that concept online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, I didn't come up with YouTube," Iger said, noting that while that site might not be profitable, its creators sold it to Google for "a chunk of change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disney chief also said he is bullish on behavioral tracking, claiming that privacy concerns are overblown and generally associated with older consumers. He joked that he has learned more about his two adult daughters from their Facebook pages than from raising them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sheri Linden at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PASADENA, California (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co chief Robert Iger said on Wednesday advertising will rapidly grow more sophisticated as media firms begin tracking consumer preferences and selling the data on to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Iger warned that privacy concerns may come to the fore with the growing ability of Web ads to monitor individual preferences and target surfers with custom ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger has warned that fundamental changes now underway in the broadcast and cable industries may permanently cut TV advertising sales and prices, leaving traditional media companies looking for ways to make up that revenue when the economy recovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive told the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference that media companies can pump up online sales volumes by either selling consumer information or by marketing directly to consumers based on individual tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we know that you've gone online and looked at five different autos online, you are a great consumer for us to serve up a 30-second ad for a car," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we could sell your behavior to an advertiser -- I am actually pretty bullish about what technology is going to allow in terms of behavioral tracking. I think we are going to have information to sell to marketers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger conceded that consumer groups have raised privacy concerns about such practices, but argued that such complaints generally came from older consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kids don't care," Iger said, adding that when he talked to his adult children about their online privacy concerns "they can't figure out what I'm talking about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's experience as an early proponent of putting primetime TV shows and movies online, on Apple Inc's iTunes and on its own broadband player gave it "ample evidence that people are willing to pay for quality, choice content," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a significant amount of headroom in being able to charge for something on the Internet," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney estimates that people pay $5 per hour to see a movie in theater, 75 cents to read a book or magazine, 50 cents per hour for cable and 25 cents per hour for Internet content, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUBSCRIPTION PROMISING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger also predicted that media companies would use multiple methods to monetize content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reiterated Disney was developing a subscription service to sell premium content like TV shows and movies but did not indicate when such a service would be launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Subscription has the most promise because people will pay to subscribe to something that is really good. Our brand offers us some rich opportunities for subscription," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger, the first chief of a major media company to sell content through iTunes and to make its prime time TV shows available online in an ad-supported player, joked that while Disney was at the vanguard of user-generated content, he missed the boat by not foreseeing the development of video sharing phenomenon YouTube.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I kick myself for having put ("America's Funniest Home Videos" ) on TV 20 years ago, and when I became interested in what the Internet could do I didn't come up with YouTube," he said. "I could kick myself for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Laura Isensee and Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Valerie Lee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contribuyentes en EE.UU. obtienen rentabilidad del 23%
NUEVA YORK--(Business Wire)--
El grupo financiero The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) anunci&#243; hoy que ha
recomprado los warrants (opciones sobre acciones) en posesi&#243;n del gobierno de
los Estados Unidos por la inversi&#243;n realizada en el marco del Programa de Compra
de Capital del TARP. Goldman pag&#243; por ellos $1.100 millones de d&#243;lares, es
decir, el valor total determinado por el Departamento del Tesoro. 

Si bien hay distintas formas de determinar el valor de los warrants, entre ellas
una subasta p&#250;blica, creemos que en el contexto de las medidas extraordinarias
que tom&#243; el gobierno para estabilizar el sistema financiero, esta cotizaci&#243;n de
los warrants representa un valor total y justo. 

En junio, Goldman Sachs sald&#243; el pago de la inversi&#243;n que hizo el Tesoro de los
Estados Unidos por $10.000 millones de d&#243;lares y durante los ocho meses de la
inversi&#243;n, la firma pag&#243; $318 millones de d&#243;lares en dividendos sobre acciones
preferentes al gobierno. 

"Estamos satisfechos de que el pago de los dividendos y la recompra de los
warrants por un total de $1.418 millones de d&#243;lares, represente una rentabilidad
anualizada del 23 por ciento para los contribuyentes. Esta rentabilidad refleja
la ayuda del Gobierno, de la que se beneficiaron el sistema financiero, nuestra
firma y nuestros accionistas", coment&#243; el presidente y director ejecutivo de
Goldman, Lloyd C. Blankfein. "Agradecemos los esfuerzos del gobierno y nos
complace que pueda usar ese dinero adicional para revitalizar la econom&#237;a, una
prioridad en la que hemos invertido todos". 

Adem&#225;s, agreg&#243;: "Goldman Sachs asesora a la empresas para que puedan crecer y
genera capital para respaldar ese crecimiento, por eso para nosotros el entorno
operativo m&#225;s sostenible y el que m&#225;s nos favorece es aqu&#233;l en el que florecen
la confianza del consumidor y de las empresas, as&#237; como el crecimiento
econ&#243;mico. Nos dedicamos a asignar capital y suministrar liquidez a nuestros
clientes para estimular el crecimiento y generar puestos de trabajo".

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft sought on Friday to end a long-running dispute with EU antitrust regulators as it offered to let users choose their own browser and to provide more interoperability information to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, which polices competition in the 27-country European Union, has to date slapped fines totaling 1.68 billion euros ($2.39 billion) on the U.S. software giant for infringing EU antitrust rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest charge on January 15, the Commission accused Microsoft of seeking to thwart rivals by bundling the company's Web browser with its Windows PC operating system, thereby harming innovation and reducing consumer choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in January last year, the EU executive had launched a probe on a complaint by industry body ECIS alleging that Microsoft had refused to disclose information that would allow third parties to design programs compatible with its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After extensive talks, Microsoft has made two offers in a bid to settle the two antitrust cases, the Commission said, welcoming the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its proposals aimed to allay EU antitrust concerns and end a decade of legal issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that if ultimately accepted, this proposal will fully address the European competition law issues relating to the inclusion of Internet Explorer in Windows and interoperability with our high-volume products," Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This would mark a big step forward ... and would be good news for European consumers and our partners in the industry," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BALLOT SCREEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said Microsoft had proposed to install a "ballot screen" that would allow users to set up rival Web browsers on Windows 7 and disable Internet Explorer if they wanted, a remedy the Commission had suggested in its January 2009 charge sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest version of the Windows operating system will be launched in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proposal recognizes the principle that consumers should be given a free and effective choice of Web browser, and sets out a means -- the ballot screen -- by which Microsoft believes that can be achieved," the Commission said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had said last month it planned to sell Windows 7 in Europe with no browser at all, drawing a frosty response from the Commission, which said it wanted more -- not less -- choice for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU executive also said on Friday that the company planned to disclose more interoperability information related to Windows and Windows Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission will investigate both proposals before making a decision, it said, giving no timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INDUSTRY GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECIS, whose members include IBM, Nokia, Oracle Corp and Sun Microsystems, welcomed Microsoft's proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In principle this is a good solution. But the devil will be in the details," ECIS spokesman Thomas Vinje said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norwegian browser maker Opera, whose complaints triggered the Commission's case against Microsoft, called the proposals a significant development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think this could actually work out. It is important that users be given a genuine choice among browsers," Chief Technology Officer Hakon Wium Lie told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said the ballot box proposal could be a boon for competing browser makers such as Google, the Mozilla Foundation and Opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer is used for about 60 percent of global Internet traffic, Mozilla's Firefox about 30 percent, and Opera 4 percent, just ahead of Google and Apple Inc's Safari, according to Web analytics firm StatCounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dale Hudson and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.7043 euro)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) shares fell more than 9 percent on Friday, as the company's weaker-than-expected results contradicted Wall Street's belief that the worst is over for the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drop weighed on broader indexes, including the Nasdaq .IXIC, which declined about 1 percent. Microsoft was the biggest percentage loser in the Dow Jones Industrial average .DJI and the No. 2 loser in the SP 500 .SPX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Hilal, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, downgraded the stock to "market perform" from "outperform," citing sharp gains in Microsoft's stock price in recent months and concerns that technology spending may not bounce back this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although we believe that demand is stabilizing for both Microsoft and IT spending in general, we do not expect an improvement over the balance of this year," he said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its fiscal fourth quarter ended in June, Microsoft's total sales fell 17 percent to $13.1 billion, some $1 billion smaller than analysts' average estimate. It was also the first-ever decline in annual sales of the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, whose operating systems power the vast majority of personal computers, lost about $20 billion of its market value on Friday as its shares fell $2.31 to $23.25. The 9 percent drop was the biggest single-day fall for Microsoft since January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts' took a more optimistic view of the results. While they acknowledged the quarter was rough for the Redmond, Washington-based company and lowered their 2010 fiscal year revenue and earnings forecasts, they saw a silver lining in the upcoming launch of the new Windows 7 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffries  Co analyst Katherine Egbert said the company had "dismal revenue" and a "somber June," but still raised her price target to $29 from $28 and repeated her "buy" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft reported very weak revenue in all segments for June and an overall shift toward cost-conscious purchasing. But consumer PC and server sales flattened year-on-year, offering hope," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup analyst Brent Thill said he was also disappointed by Microsoft's weak forecast for gross margins in fiscal 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, in a client note titled "Keep Your Eye On The Prize," he repeated his "buy" rating, citing the potential for improvements in 2010 when corporate demand is expected to rebound and Windows 7 may help profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Thursday's close, Microsoft had risen 70 percent in the past four months on hopes that Windows 7 will be a hit once it is released on October 22, and a positive reaction to its new Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Franklin Paul; editing by Derek Caney and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) shares plunged 8 percent on Friday, as its weaker-than-expected results contradicted Wall Street's belief that the worst is over for the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drop shaved about $19 billion off Microsoft's market value and it was the world No. 1 software maker's biggest single-day fall since January 2009, when its quarterly results had also missed expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said they were concerned that Microsoft showed weakness across all its business units, and questioned whether the company's much-anticipated launch of a new Windows operating system could reignite growth later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While there are market indications that PCs and servers are beginning to stabilize, we do not anticipate a snapback in demand, despite the Windows 7 October launch, until 2010," said Barclays Capital analyst Israel Hernandez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In addition to cyclical exposures, we also believe that Microsoft faces longer-term challenges such as geographic mix issues, pricing pressures on Windows from netbooks, and heightened competitive pressures which are likely to continue to weigh on margins," he wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the sharp share drop, some investors were still optimistic about the longer term prospects of the Redmond, Washington-based company, whose operating systems power the vast majority of personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the economy stabilizes, there will be more money spent on IT and Microsoft will be a beneficiary," said Andy Rutlin, a Microsoft analyst for Thornburg Investment Management, which has built up its position in Microsoft in the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reason we own Microsoft is for the Windows 7 product upgrade cycle," said Rutlin, adding that Microsoft was hit by some people shying away from purchasing new PCs until the new operating system is released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rutlin doesn't plan on buying any more Microsoft because the stock is already among the top holdings in the Thornburg Core Growth Fund, but he suggested others "take an opportunity like today to increase positions in the shares."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WINDOWS ANNUAL SALES FALL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its fiscal fourth quarter ended in June, Microsoft's revenue fell 17 percent to $13.1 billion, some $1 billion smaller than analysts' average estimate. It was also the first-ever decline in annual sales of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock, which had risen 70 percent in the past four months, fell as much as 10.76 percent on Friday before closing at $23.45, down 8.26 percent, on Nasdaq. It was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI and Nasdaq composite index .IXIC, which halted a 12-day rally and ended down 0.39 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft trades at under 14 times forecast fiscal 2010 earnings, according to Reuters Estimates. In comparison, Oracle Corp ORCL.O trades at a multiple of 15 and IBM (IBM.N) at 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, said Microsoft is attractively priced for a business pick-up as companies start replacing PCs after holding off for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has a monopoly on the operating system. I don't think there is anything in at least the next three years that can replace that monopoly," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferies  Co analyst Katherine Egbert said the company had "dismal revenue" and a "somber June," but still raised her price target to $29 from $28 and repeated her "buy" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft reported very weak revenue in all segments for June and an overall shift toward cost-conscious purchasing.

Barclays Capital analyst Israel Hernandez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In addition to cyclical exposures, we also believe that
Microsoft faces longer-term challenges such as geographic mix
issues, pricing pressures on Windows from netbooks, and
heightened competitive pressures which are likely to continue
to weigh on margins," he wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the sharp share drop, some investors were still
optimistic about the longer term prospects of the Redmond,
Washington-based company, whose operating systems power the
vast majority of personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As the economy stabilizes, there will be more money spent
on IT and Microsoft will be a beneficiary," said Andy Rutlin, a
Microsoft analyst for Thornburg Investment Management, which
has built up its position in Microsoft in the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The reason we own Microsoft is for the Windows 7 product
upgrade cycle," said Rutlin, adding that Microsoft was hit by
some people shying away from purchasing new PCs until the new
operating system is released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rutlin doesn't plan on buying any more Microsoft because
the stock is already among the top holdings in the Thornburg
Core Growth Fund, but he suggested others "take an opportunity
like today to increase positions in the shares."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WINDOWS ANNUAL SALES FALL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its fiscal fourth quarter ended in June, Microsoft's
revenue fell 17 percent to $13.1 billion, some $1 billion
smaller than analysts' average estimate. It was also the
first-ever decline in annual sales of Windows. [ID:nN23403957]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock, which had risen 70 percent in the past four
months, fell as much as 10.76 percent on Friday before closing
at $23.45, down 8.26 percent, on Nasdaq. It was the biggest
drag on the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI and Nasdaq
composite index .IXIC, which halted a 12-day rally and ended
down 0.39 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft trades at under 14 times forecast fiscal 2010
earnings, according to Reuters Estimates. In comparison, Oracle
Corp ORCL.O trades at a multiple of 15 and IBM (IBM.N) at
11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group,
said Microsoft is attractively priced for a business pick-up as
companies start replacing PCs after holding off for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft has a monopoly on the operating system. I don't
think there is anything in at least the next three years that
can replace that monopoly," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferies  Co analyst Katherine Egbert said the company
had "dismal revenue" and a "somber June," but still raised her
price target to $29 from $28 and repeated her "buy" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft reported very weak revenue in all segments for
June and an overall shift towards cost-conscious purchasing.
But consumer PC and server sales flattened year-on-year,
offering hope," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup analyst Brent Thill said he was also disappointed
by Microsoft's weak forecast for gross margins in fiscal 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, in a client note titled "Keep Your Eye On The
Prize," he repeated his "buy" rating, citing the potential for
improvements in 2010 when corporate demand is expected to
rebound and Windows 7 may help profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Franklin Paul; Additional reporting by Jim

 (Adds Microsoft, ECIS, Opera comment, background, bylines)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Foo Yun Chee and Bate Felix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRUSSELS, July 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) sought on
Friday to end a long-running dispute with EU antitrust
regulators as it offered to let users choose their own browser
and to provide more interoperability information to third
parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Commission, which polices competition in the
27-country European Union, has to date slapped fines totalling
1.68 billion euros ($2.39 billion) on the U.S. software giant
for infringing EU antitrust rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its latest charge on Jan. 15, the Commission accused
Microsoft of seeking to thwart rivals by bundling the company's
Web browser with its Windows PC operating system, thereby
harming innovation and reducing consumer choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in January last year, the EU executive had launched a
probe on a complaint by industry body ECIS alleging that
Microsoft had refused to disclose information that would allow
third parties to design programmes compatible with its
products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After extensive talks, Microsoft has made two offers in a
bid to settle the two antitrust cases, the Commission said,
welcoming the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said its proposals aimed to allay EU antitrust
concerns and end a decade of legal issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that if ultimately accepted, this proposal will
fully address the European competition law issues relating to
the inclusion of Internet Explorer in Windows and
interoperability with our high-volume products," Microsoft
General Counsel Brad Smith said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This would mark a big step forward ... and would be good
news for European consumers and our partners in the industry,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BALLOT SCREEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission said Microsoft had proposed to install a
"ballot screen" that would allow users to set up rival Web
browsers on Windows 7 and disable Internet Explorer if they
wanted, a remedy the Commission had suggested in its January
2009 charge sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newest version of the Windows operating system will be
launched in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The proposal recognises the principle that consumers
should be given a free and effective choice of Web browser, and
sets out a means -- the ballot screen -- by which Microsoft
believes that can be achieved," the Commission said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft had said last month it planned to sell Windows 7
in Europe with no browser at all, drawing a frosty response
from the Commission, which said it wanted more -- not less --
choice for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU executive also said on Friday that the company
planned to disclose more interoperability information related
to Windows and Windows Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission will investigate both proposals before
making a decision, it said, giving no timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INDUSTRY GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ECIS, whose members include IBM (IBM.N), Nokia (NOK1V.HE),
Oracle Corp ORCL.O and Sun Microsystems JAVA.O, welcomed
Microsoft's proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In principle this is a good solution. But the devil will
be in the details," ECIS spokesman Thomas Vinje said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Norwegian browser maker Opera (OPERA.OL), whose complaints
triggered the Commission's case against Microsoft, called the
proposals a significant development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think this could actually work out. It is important
that users be given a genuine choice among browsers," Chief
Technology Officer Hakon Wium Lie told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have said the ballot box proposal could be a boon
for competing browser makers such as Google (GOOG.O), the
Mozilla Foundation and Opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Internet Explorer is used for about 60 percent of global
Internet traffic, Mozilla's Firefox about 30 percent, and Opera
4 percent, just ahead of Google and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O)
Safari, according to Web analytics firm StatCounter.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bankers and traders, no matter where they work, might have Goldman Sachs Group Inc to thank for heftier bonuses this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Goldman Sachs rakes in record earnings, it continues to give employees $1 for every $2 it takes in. So far this year, Goldman has set aside $11.3 billion for compensation, or 49 percent of its net revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By maintaining that ratio, Goldman is forcing the hand of some competitors, compelling them to set aside more for payouts, even as they report narrow profits or losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What they are doing is they are raising the bar and putting pressure on all of their competitors," said Brad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. "The competitors are facing a challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Colm Kelleher said during Wednesday's earnings conference call that "competitive pressures" are affecting the bank's pay levels. Morgan Stanley boosted its compensation pool even as it posted a wider-than-expected $1.26 billion loss during the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, everyone would like to have far more revenues to make the compensation issue easy," Kelleher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, Morgan Stanley has set aside $5.9 billion, or 71 percent of its net revenue, for compensation. The tab was driven up in part by expenses related to the completion of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture and it is not adjusted for improvements in debt valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first half of 2008, as Morgan Stanley reported profits, it set aside $6.9 billion, about 50 percent of net revenue, for compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is always difficult when you are a little bit of the laggard," said Alan Johnson, a compensation consultant with Johnson Associates in New York City. "When things are getting better you get squeezed. You don't have as much revenue to afford compensation, but your competitors are doing better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TARGET ON THEIR BACKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, major U.S. securities firms set aside 47.6 percent of net earnings for compensation this decade, according to a research note by Sanford C. Bernstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers have taken a special interest in Wall Street bonuses after last year rolling out the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, to aid banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some major firms, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase  Co, and Citigroup Inc, are changing the way they pay their employees, putting more emphasis on base salary and less emphasis on bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to stay competitive, Citigroup has gone so far as to guarantee mostly cash bonuses to new hires in London as it swiped talent from rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, JPMorgan Chase unveiled plans at a townhall meeting of investment bankers to boost base salaries of employees who earn a substantial part of their compensation in bonuses, a source familiar with the meeting said. The plan isn't designed to boost overall compensation but some see it as a bid by another major bank to be remain competitive on pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told analysts from Fox-Pitt, Kelton on Thursday that "competitors are increasingly coming after JPM's people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which last month repaid $10 billion in government bailouts, has outlined its pay principals, affirming the firm's belief in "pay-for-performance," but offered no sign that it will curb bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the widening bonus pool of Goldman, which this week completely severed its government ties by also buying back warrants it had issued to the U.S. Treasury, has made it a target for politicians, columnists and comedians alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The press hit them and the politicians hit them," Hintz said. "Fundamentally, they painted a target on their own backs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hintz said he believes Goldman could have reduced its compensation ratio and still paid handsome bonuses, but took a different, and "smart," path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was not out of greed, this was a strategic decision to pressure their competitors," Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy could pay off for Goldman, as it will keep its own people happy while attracting in the brightest and best from elsewhere -- all while putting new stress on the competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman has lost a lot of people in the last 24 months, like everyone else," said John Carter, a recruiter at New York's Hagan-Ricci Group Inc. "They had to cut deep into the bone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they  can provide a nice landing pad for their competitor's best bankers, now is a great time to do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

  (Updates to mid-afternoon, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq fell on Friday
following Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) disappointing quarterly
results, but gains in pharmaceutical and energy shares held the
Dow and the SP 500 near break-even.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares fell 9 percent to $23.28, a day after the
software maker posted quarterly revenue below Wall Street's
estimates. Web retailer Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) also missed
sales expectations, sending its stock down 8 percent to
$86.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results cast a cloud over what is largely shaping up to
be a stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even so, investors took Wall Street's initial drop on
Friday as an opportunity to scoop up shares in other sectors,
including energy and big pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft is going through a product transition and no
great visibility on the Windows franchise, but in general the
tone this quarter for a good many companies has been strong,"
said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of U.S. Equity Group at Deutsche
Bank Private Wealth Management in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are not probably going to see a major shift here in the
negative direction, so it's probably going to be overall
positive for earnings season."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 0.75 points,
or 0.01 percent, to 9,070.04. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX slipped 0.36 points, or 0.04 percent, to 975.93. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC shed 14.27 points, or 0.72
percent, to 1,959.33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft was the top drag on Nasdaq, followed by
Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But all indexes were on track for a second straight weekly
advance. Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N) , up 1.5 percent, was the
Dow's top boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp (CVX.N) climbed nearly 1 percent to $68.52 as
U.S. front-month crude oil CLc1 prices bounced 1.4 percent to
$68.12 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) warned that it didn't expect a
rebound in spending by its oil- and gas-producing customers
this year, but tool manufacturer Black and Decker Corp BDK.N
raised its full-year profit view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schlumberger's stock fell 2.3 percent to $56.46, while
Black  Decker shares climbed 9.3 percent to $36.87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Market gains were curbed by a report showing U.S. consumer
confidence waned in late July to its lowest reading since
April, according to the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys
of Consumers. [ID:nN24449821]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, the SP 500 closed at its highest level since
Election Day in November, while the Nasdaq marked a winning
streak of 12 straight days, its longest run since 1992.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/f59797/chile_food_and_dri) has
announced the addition of the "Chile Food and Drink Report Q3 2009" report to
their offering. 

The Chile Food and Drink Report provides industry professionals and strategists,
corporate analysts, food and drink associations, government departments and
regulatory bodies with independent forecasts and competitive intelligence on
Chile's food and drink industry. 

With the Latin American economy set to contract by 2.6% this year, Chile's sound
macro fundamentals and prudent policies are placing the country in a league of
its own to deal with global recessionary forces. Although large fiscal reserves
make Chile well-placed to cope with the global economic downturn, the country
has been hit by falling levels of trade in particular by falling demand for
copper, which is the country's most important export. Lower levels of trade have
also reduced foreign investment in the country. Indeed, the macroeconomic
headwinds facing Chile are hitting the economy hard and are presenting the most
challenging climate since the country's 1999 recession. Despite stalling
domestic demand, the report holds its existing forecast for the Chilean economy
to grow by 0.1% in 2009. Consumer retrenchment has already become evident during
the first quarter of this year, when private consumption contracted by 1.4%
year-on-year (y-o-y), a slightly smaller magnitude than in Q199, when private
consumption fell by 2.8%. 

Indeed, the indicators coming from the country's major food, drink and retail
players over the last quarter remain quite mixed. For example, at the start of
April, the chairman of Chile's largest supermarket operator D said that the
firm may not enter Peru this year as originally planned. This review may have
been driven by the global economic downturn or may reflect opposition to this
strategy from Wal-Mart, which has recently raised its stake in the business to
about 73%. Up to now, D has been able to piggyback on Chile's high economic
growth and has achieved buoyant sales growth over the last 10 years. However,
with the firm's domestic market showing signs of maturity, D has been looking
to increase its exposure to markets where the retail sector is less developed.
At the same time, Chile's largest brewer, Compa&#241;&#237;a Cervecer&#237;as Unidas (CCU),
announced plans to invest around US$70mn this year, half the level of 2008. The
company also reported in its first quarter results that in Chile, sales of beer,
soft drinks, bottled water and wine all declined. CCU's beer sales in Chile fell
by 4%, sales of soft drinks fell by 5.2%, sales of bottled water fell by 5.9%
and sales of wine fell by 2.9%. 

On the other side of the coin, Chile-based Coca-Cola affiliated bottler
Embotelladora Andina has announced plans to invest US$67mn in capital projects
in 2009, despite the global economic crisis. The company will invest US$26m in
Chile, US$28m in Brazil and US$13m in Argentina in 2009, primarily to revamp
production lines and logistics plants in each country. Equally, Chilean soft
drinks bottler Coca- Cola Embonor announced that the company is planning to
boost investment for expanding business operations in Chile and Bolivia by 22%
to US$33mn in 2009. 

Although Chile remains the Latin American country best placed to ride out the
recession, only developments in the second half of the year will confirm whether
the nation has indeed managed to stave off the problems seen by many of its
regional neighbours.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has offered to let users choose their own browser and provide more interoperability information to third parties in a bid to resolve two antitrust cases, EU regulators said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission charged the U.S. software company on January 15 with seeking to thwart rivals by bundling the company's Web browser with its Windows PC operating system, thus harming innovation and reducing consumer choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in January last year, the EU executive had launched a probe on a complaint by industry body ECIS alleging that Microsoft had refused to disclose information that would allow third parties to design programs compatible with its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission welcomed both proposals by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the browser offer was in line with proposals in its January 2009 charge sheet, the so-called statement of objections, and would be valid for Windows 7, due to be launched in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proposal recognizes the principle that consumers should be given a free and effective choice of Web browser, and sets out a means -- the ballot screen -- by which Microsoft believes that can be achieved," the Commission said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the company also planned to disclose more interoperability information related to Windows and Windows Server. The Commission said it would investigate both proposals before making a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been involved in a long-running dispute with the Commission and has been fined 1.68 billion euros to date for infringing EU antitrust rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Bate Felix; Editing by Dale Hudson)&lt;/p&gt;

  (Updates to midday, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ryan Vlastelica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday,
pressured by disappointing quarterly results in the tech
sector and weak consumer sentiment data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decline came a day after a rally took the Dow
industrials .DJI above the 9,000 level for the first time
since early January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tech stocks fell after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported
fourth-quarter revenue figures that missed expectations. The
stock, down 9 percent at $23.26, was the biggest drag on both
the Dow and the Nasdaq. The SP Information Technology sector
.GSPT, down 1.3 percent at 311.94, was the heaviest weight
on the SP 500.[ID:nN24450333]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN.O) pressured Internet
stocks after it reported second-quarter revenue that missed
expectations and gave a modest third-quarter outlook.
[ID:nN23417518] Amazon's stock dropped 8.5 percent to $85.92,
while Overstock.com (OSTK.O) slid 4.7 percent to $13.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft's and Amazon's results make me a little more
bearish on the rest of the earnings season," said Christopher
Zook, the chairman and investment chief of CAZ Investments in
Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After Intel (INTC.O) beat expectations, companies have
felt a lot of pressure to post good results or take a positive
tone in their earnings call. Microsoft isn't doing that and
it's getting killed," Zook added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slipped 24.87
points, or 0.27 percent, to 9,044.42. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX fell 3.87 points, or 0.40 percent, to 972.42.
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC lost 20.33 points, or 1.03
percent, to 1,953.27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market's mood also soured after a report showed U.S.
consumer confidence waned in late July to its lowest reading
since April, according to the Reuters/University of Michigan
Surveys of Consumers. [ID:nN24449821]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The sentiment data doesn't surprise me. People are still
concerned," Zook said. "There's a lot of unemployment and talk
of further unemployment with the new minimum wage laws. You
can't jack up pay and not see an effect from that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow component American Express (AXP.N) rose a modest 0.3
percent to $29.53 a day after it posted second-quarter profits
that met expectations, but were down sharply from a year ago.
[ID:nN23305169]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) warned that it didn't expect a
rebound in spending by its oil- and gas-producing customers
this year, but tool manufacturer Black and Decker BDK.N
raised its full-year profit view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schlumberger's stock fell 3.3 percent to $55.87, while
Black  Decker shares climbed 7.9 percent to $36.39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner testified that he
was willing to work with lawmakers on shaping an overhaul of
financial regulations, insisting that major changes were
necessary. [ID:nN24347905].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geithner, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair are
testifying before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee
on regulatory reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, the SP 500 closed at its highest level since
Election Day in November, while the Nasdaq marked a winning
streak of 12 straight days, its longest run since 1992.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, July 24 (Reuters) - European Union regulators
welcomed on Friday a proposal by U.S. software company Microsoft
(MSFT.O) that would let users choose their own browser in a bid
to resolve EU antitrust charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The proposal recognises the principle that consumers should
be given a free and effective choice of Web browser, and sets
out a means -- the ballot screen -- by which Microsoft believes
that can be achieved," the European Commission said in a
statement.
 The Commission, the European Union's executive arm, will
investigate whether the proposal is practical. It said
Microsoft's proposal was in line with what it had suggested in
January.

  (Updates to late morning)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday as
bellwether Microsoft (MSFT.O) declined on disappointing
results, a day after a rally took the Dow industrials .DJI
above the key 9,000 mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares extended losses after a gauge of consumer sentiment
fell in July, roughly in line with expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp shares tumbled 9 percent to $23.30 following
a steeper-than-expected 17 percent drop in quarterly revenue

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The tech sector's road to recovery just got a lot bumpier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp's billion-dollar-plus revenue shortfall in its fiscal fourth-quarter abruptly dampened hopes that demand for PCs was on the mend and sent a spate of tech stocks tumbling after-hours on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Wall Street has rallied on better-than-expected quarterly results from chipmakers Intel Corp and Texas Instruments Inc this month, Thursday's disappointing batch of earnings underscored the challenges still facing many technology businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is people have been running all stocks up, there's hasn't been any kind of differentiation at all," said Dan Niles, co-Chief Investment Officer of Alpha One Capital Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Niles, the financial results of Intel and TI are not a reliable indicator of demand since they were component vendors that sold into the supply chain rather than to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have overlooked negative news from companies like Dell Inc, which sells its wares directly to customers and which warned last week of profit margin contraction and weak demand from corporate buyers of PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was a "reality check" said Niles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell 7 percent to $23.75, after the software company reported its first ever annual decline in sales of the Windows operating system used in an overwhelming majority of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow bellwether Amazon.com Inc, the world's largest online retailer, delivered lackluster results on Thursday, sending its shares down more than 6 percent in after hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And chipmaker Broadcom Corp, which reported better-than-expected revenue quarterly revenue, shed 4.5 percent of its value in extended trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had a barrage of bad news. That will probably set the market back a bit," said Fred Hickey, editor of the High-Tech Strategist Newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT, ME WORRY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq has risen roughly 12 percent in the past two weeks and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 9,000 on Thursday for the first time since January, as earnings reports and encouraging signs in the housing market bolstered investor optimism that economic conditions are improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all market watchers are equally downbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer for Solaris Asset Management, thinks investors overreacted to the bad news from Microsoft after Thursday's market close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has been a really great earnings season for technology in general. That strength was not confirmed by Microsoft," said Ghriskey, whose firm manages $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's tough to find fault with the results delivered by Apple Inc on Tuesday. The Cupertino, California company bested analysts expectations as demand for the iPhone and Mac computers remained strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from Apple, Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek said the common theme among tech companies in the second quarter was revenue that was either light or down double-digits year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech firms had been able to show strong profit from cost-cutting, said Misek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If investors were buying tech stocks for current results then they made a mistake," said Misek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said if investors had been buying stocks in anticipation of improving macroeconomic and banking conditions, then the pullback following Thursday's disappointing earnings results might not be as pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston and Yinka Adegoke in New York; Editing by Edwin Chan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) fell more than 10 percent on Friday, a day after the software maker's results disappointed investors, including a first-ever decline in annual sales of the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of the world's largest software maker, whose operating systems power the vast majority of personal computers, fell $2.59 to $22.97, after it said business continued to be hurt by the weak global PC and server markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drop weighed on broader indices, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, and SP 500 .SPX, as well as the Nasdaq .IXIC, which declined 1.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Hilal, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, downgraded the stock to "market perform" from "outperform", citing sharp gains in Microsoft's stock price in recent months, and concerns that technology spending may not bounce back this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although we believe that demand is stabilizing for both Microsoft and IT spending in general, we do not expect an improvement over the balance of this year," he said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its fiscal fourth quarter ended in June, Microsoft's total sales fell 17 percent to $13.1 billion, some $1 billion smaller than analysts' average estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup analyst Brent Thill said he was also disappointed by Microsoft's weak forecast for gross margins in fiscal year 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, in a client note titled "Keep Your Eye On The Prize," he reiterated his "buy" rating, citing the potential for improvements in 2010 when corporate demand is expected to rebound and its forthcoming Windows 7 operating system may help profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Thursday's close, Microsoft had risen 70 percent in the past four months on hopes that Windows 7 will be a hit once it is released on October 22, and a positive reaction to its new Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Franklin Paul; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

percent, weighing the most on the broader index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Express Co and fellow credit card issuer Capital

reduced second-quarter earnings. [ID:nN23419883]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AmEx shares dropped 1.5 percent to $29.01, and the SP

excuse to correct," said Doug Roberts, chief investment
strategist at Channel Capital Research in Shrewsbury, New

excuse. It's combined with the earnings disappointment by
Microsoft and American Express last night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. consumer confidence waned in late July to its lowest
reading since April as tracked by the Reuters/University of
Michigan Surveys of Consumers, on growing pessimism about the
long-term economic outlook. [ID:nN24449821]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amazon.com (AMZN.O) shares fell 7.6 percent to $86.72 a day

Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) shares fell 3.1 percent to $55.98

expect any rebound in spending by its oil- and gas-producing
customers this year. [ID:nN24444747].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Friday he was

necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geithner, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair are testifying
before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on
regulatory reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 .SPX closed Thursday at its highest since the

 (Recasts, changes quote)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
pointed to a lower open on Friday as disappointing results from
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and American Express Co(AXP.N) curbed
sentiment a day after a rally took the Dow industrials .DJI
above the key 9,000 mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The nominal value of SP futures seesawed, but fair value
consistently edged lower, indicating a lack of conviction in
the market's direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Futures recovered after a steep drop late Thursday,
following results from Microsoft, American Express and
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) that failed to impress investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lower profit from American Express and a third straight
quarterly loss from Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) pointed
to weak consumer spending, according to Alan Lancz, president
of an investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The consumer is on the sidelines and discretionary income
is being saved, not spent," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Express and Capital One said rising customer
delinquencies reduced second-quarter earnings, and shares of
both credit card issuers fell before the opening bell.
[ID:nN23419883]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 fell 1.6 points and were below fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures shed 4.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 .SPX closed Thursday at its highest since the
Election Day last November. The Nasdaq .IXIC has risen for 12
straight days, its longest run since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Thursday's closing bell, Microsoft posted a
steeper-than-expected 17 percent drop in quarterly revenue.
[ID:nN23430280]. Its shares tumbled 7 percent to $23.75 in
premarket trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amazon.com (AMZN.O) fell more than 6 percent before the
opening bell after the Internet retailer reported on Thursday
revenues that missed analyst estimates. [ID:nN23417518].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winding down a week loaded with quarterly reports from
bellwethers in many sectors of the economy, Schlumberger Ltd
(SLB.N) shares rose 1 percent after the world's largest
oilfield services provider reported a 57 percent drop in
quarterly earnings, but beat expectations. [ID:nN24444747].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Economic data on tap includes the Reuters/University of

outlook than he was three months ago.

&lt;p&gt;  MEXICO CITY, Jul 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV: KOFL) (NYSE: KOF) ("Coca-Cola
FEMSA" or the "Company"), the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America

volume, announces results for the second quarter of
2009.


--  Total revenues reached Ps. 24,184 million in the second quarter of
    2009, an increase of 30.4% compared to the second quarter of 2008;
    increased revenues from acquisitions we made in 2008 and 2009 contributed
    approximately 20% of this growth.
--  Consolidated operating income grew 16.0% to Ps. 3,677 million for the
    second quarter of 2009, mainly driven by double-digit operating income
    growth recorded in our Latincentro and Mercosur divisions. Our operating
    margin was 15.2% in the second quarter of 2009.
--  Consolidated majority net income increased 17.2% to Ps. 2,161 million
    in the second quarter of 2009, mainly reflecting higher operating income,
    resulting in earnings per share of Ps. 1.17 in the second quarter of 2009.
    

    
"In the middle of a tough operating environment, our company
continued to achieve strong top- and bottom-line results for the quarter,
growing revenues, operating income, and EBITDA by 30%, 16%, and 16%,
respectively. Among other factors, we benefited from the growth of our
sparkling beverages category, particularly in Mexico; the consolidation
of our REMIL franchise territory in Brazil; and the strong performance of
the Jugos del Valle line of juice-based beverages throughout our
operations along with our ability to improve our pricing architecture.
Our portfolio of products continued to outperform macroeconomic
conditions across our territories, demonstrating its defensiveness. Also,
as of June 1st, 2009, we took over the sales and distribution functions
of the Brisa water business in Colombia. Furthermore, we believe our
company is in a very strong financial position as exemplified by the debt
maturities that we met during July -- US$265 million of a Yankee bond and
Certificados Bursatiles in the amount of MXN$500 million," said Carlos
Salazar Lomelin, Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

impressive, said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist

news, at least in the premarket session," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mendelsohn said breaking through a key technical resistance
level in the SP 500 on Thursday, as well as follow-through
from Asian and European equity markets are giving Wall Street
support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 were up 2.4 points but were below
fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into

points and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures shed 0.25 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 closed Thursday at its highest since the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted the first-ever drop in annual sales of Windows and its quarterly revenue fell a steeper-than-expected 17 percent as its business continued to be hurt by the weak global PC and server markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news sent Microsoft shares down 8 percent and took the shine off a big U.S. stock market rally earlier in the day that had driven the Dow Jones industrial average above 9,000 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker, whose operating systems power the vast majority of the world's personal computers, offered little hope for a turnaround in technology until next year, despite recent optimism from rival International Business Machines Corp and chip maker Intel Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still see conditions being challenging for the balance of this calendar year," Chief Financial Officer Christopher Liddell said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At least sequentially, we are seeing a little bit of growth. While things are not necessarily getting better, they may have bottomed out," said Liddell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIGHT ON REVENUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported fiscal fourth quarter net profit of $3.045 billion, or 34 cents per share, compared with $4.297 billion, or 46 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit excluding items was 36 cents per share for the quarter ended June 30, meeting analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 17 percent to $13.1 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $14.48 billion. Annual sales of the company's Windows operating system -- its first and most important business -- fell for the first time on record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were really light on revenue. They need to explain where the money went. If I was Nancy Drew this would be the case of the missing revenue," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, referring to the fictional detective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street highlighted the lack of big tech projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Spending has been sparse by businesses and we're not in full recovery mode yet," said Laxmi Poruri, partner at Primary Global Research. "We're not in big-ticket mode, which is businesses purchasing a lot of equipment and a lot of software. They're doing small projects and that's going to hurt your margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLASHING COSTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is preparing to bring out the latest version of its operating system, Windows 7, on October 22. Liddell said that release would not, on its own, spark a recovery in PC sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With sales under pressure, the Redmond, Washington-based company is focusing on controlling costs, announcing 5,000 job cuts in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fiscal year 2010, which started July 1, the company is targeting $26.6 billion to $26.9 billion in operating expenses, slightly cutting the lower end of its estimate from three months ago. Comparable expenses in the fiscal year just ended were $25.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares fell 8 percent to $23.44 in extended trading, after closing up 3 percent at $25.56 on Nasdaq, contributing to losses on stock futures across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Thursday's close, the stock had risen 70 percent since early March, on hopes that Windows 7 system will be a hit and a positive reaction to its new Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby and Tiffany Wu; Editing by Richard Chang, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based company said John "Hans" Morris will step down as president, but remain with Visa in a different capacity until year end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said it will also consolidate oversight of its sales, client service, marketing, product development and "innovation" functions under Chief Operating Officer John Partridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris joined Visa in 2007, when he was 48, and according to the company "played a central role" in its March 2008 initial public offering, when it raised about $19.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before joining Visa, Morris had worked at Citigroup Inc (C.N) and its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said the management changes will "heighten organizational effectiveness and increase the pace of Visa's global alignment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not give a reason for Morris' departure. Visa spokesman Paul Cohen declined to elaborate, citing a quiet period ahead of the company's expected reporting of fiscal third-quarter results on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Joseph Saunders also said Visa continues, "to meet or exceed all our current financial guidance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expect quarterly profit of 65 cents per share on revenue of $1.64 billion, Reuters Estimates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's main rival is MasterCard Inc (MA.N), which is scheduled to report quarterly results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa shares rose 25 cents to $68.44 in after-hours trading.

&lt;p&gt;         * Settled suit over 1996 trial of meningitis drug Trovan          * Kano state counsel says deal to be signed Thursday          * Source says Pfizer to pay $75 mln under proposed deal  (Adds details on settlement from additional source)          KANO, Nigeria, July 27 (Reuters) - Nigeria's Kano state and drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) have reached a final court settlement in a multi-billion dollar lawsuit over a 1996 drug trial, lawyers for both parties said on Monday.          The northern state of Kano sued the world's largest drugmaker in May 2007 for $2 billion in damages over testing of the meningitis drug Trovan, which state authorities said killed 11 children and left dozens disabled.          We have settled and we are signing an agreement on Thursday, said Aliyu Umar, counsel for Kano state.          The New York-based company has denied all charges and said meningitis, not Trovan, killed the children or damaged their health. It said Trovan saved lives and was as effective as a more established drug used for comparison in the study.          The lawyers would not describe the settlement, but a source close to the deal said it obliges Pfizer to pay $75 million.          As much as $35 million of the settlement is slated to go to a fund that would provide payments to eligible people who participated in the clinical study of Trovan, said the source, who asked not to be named.          The source said $30 million of the settlement would be set aside for healthcare initiatives chosen by the Kano State government, while $10 million of the settlement would be used to reimburse Kano State for legal costs associated with the lawsuit.          We are happy with what we got, said one of the victims on Monday without confirming the settlement amount.          Lawyers are expected to officially withdraw the case at a hearing on Aug. 6 in Kano.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/2300f7/brazil_food_and_dr) has
announced the addition of the "Brazil Food and Drink Report Q3 2009" report to
their offering. 

The Brazil Food and Drink Report provides industry professionals and
strategists, corporate analysts, food and drink associations, government
departments and regulatory bodies with independent forecasts and competitive
intelligence on Brazil's food and drink industry. 

The overall household consumption is expected to grow in Brazil to come in at
3.6%, down from a previous projection of 4.8% earlier this year, which could
impact on food consumption in the short term. The Brazilian economy is highly
reliant on strong consumer spending levels, which have been driven by a credit
boom. However, tighter credit and liquidity conditions amid the global financial
crisis are leading to consumer retrenchment, casting growing uncertainty over
the economy. Nonetheless, between 2008 and 2013, per-capita food consumption is
forecast to grow by 46.3% (nominal growth rate in local currency terms). With
the size of the Brazilian population forecast to increase by 6.3% over the same
period, total food consumption is expected to grow by 55.5%. Under the current
currency forecasts, total Brazilian food consumption in US dollar terms is
expected to increase by 75.2%, driven by consumers trading up to higher-value,
branded and premium products, and by lower-income consumers simply buying more.
In urban locations, there is also an ongoing trend towards value-added
convenience foods as consumers' working lifestyles increasingly come to mirror
those in the developed world. 

Certainly, over the last quarter there have been continuing announcements of
investments in the country's food and drink sector from multinational players.
At the start of April, Swiss business-to-business chocolate manufacturer Barry
Callebaut signed a distribution and cooperation agreement with Brazilian food
producer Bunge Alimentos a subsidiary of global agricultural giant Bunge
Limited. The deal will see Bunge distribute Barry Callebaut's food service
chocolate products. The two firms will also work together to develop chocolate
products that meet the specific needs of the Brazilian food service/bakery
market. As part of the push into this market, Barry Callebaut has announced the
construction of a chocolate factory in the south-east of Brazil. 

Meanwhile, in February, soft drinks giant Coca-Cola announced that it will
invest BRL1.75bn (US$804.4mn) in Brazil in 2009. This represents a 16.6%
increase on the amount invested in 2008 and part of the money will be used to
build two new bottling and manufacturing plants. The company further indicated
that the economic downturn had not affected its Brazilian unit and revealed that
the firm is 'very confident in [their] long-term planning and in the Brazilian
market'. Finally, France-based vegetable processor Bonduelle revealed that it is
looking to expand its operations in Brazil. The company is to invest EUR15mn
(US$19.6mn) to build a preserved and frozen vegetable facility in Brazil to
supply other markets in South America, including Argentina. 

With Brazil entering a recession and signs of liquidity conditions in the
country becoming tighter, a raft of annual results from the country's leading
food and drink players over the last quarter mirror the greater problems being
faced. At the end of March, Brazilian meat processor Sadia posted its first ever
annual loss due to large losses on currency derivatives during the last quarter
of 2008. Over 2008 as a whole, Sadia reported a net loss of BRL2.48bn
(US$1.14bn), compared to a net profit of BRL768.3mn (USD353.2mn) in the year
earlier period. Likewise, dairy and meat group Perdig&#227;o saw its net income for
FY08 slump 83% due to the real's devaluation against the US dollar and financial
charges. However, the company reported a 72% rise in net sales for 2008 to
BRL11.39bn (US$5.32bn), with export sales rising by 58% in total. Meanwhile,
meat processor JBS booked a net loss of BRL53.3mn (US$22.3mn) in the last three
months of 2008, although for the full year, the company filed net income of
BRL25.9mn (US$57.8mn), compared to a net loss of BRL165mn (US$75.8mn) in 2007.
Drinks giant AmBev reported that net income for the year rose by 8.6%, to more
than BRL3bn (US$1.37bn), despite a fourth quarter decline, relating to currency
charges. Beer volumes rose by 3% for the year, although were hit by a 0.9%
decline in the fourth quarter. At the same time the company confirmed that it is
to close a factory in the state of S&#227;o Paulo and shift production to its other
plants in the state.

&lt;p&gt;The northern state of Kano sued the world's largest drugmaker in May 2007 for $2 billion in damages over the testing of the meningitis drug Trovan, which the authorities say killed 11 children and left dozens disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have settled and we are signing an agreement on Thursday," said Aliyu Umar, counsel for Kano state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm has denied all charges and says meningitis, not Trovan, killed the children or damaged their health. It said Trovan saved lives and was as effective as a more established drug used for comparison in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawyers would not disclose how much was agreed to in the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources close to the negotiations told Reuters in April that the two sides were nearing a $75 million agreement, including the payment by Pfizer of $10 million legal fees, $30 million to Kano state and $35 million to victims and families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are happy with what we got," said one of the victims on Monday without confirming the settlement amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers are expected to officially withdraw the case at a hearing on August 6 in Kano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mike Oboh; Writing by Randy Fabi; Editing by Hans Peters)&lt;/p&gt;

BURLINGTON, Mass. and ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUAN), a leading provider of speech
solutions, and IBM (NYSE: IBM), a pioneer in speech technology, today announced
that the companies have entered into a comprehensive Joint Initiative Agreement
to further accelerate innovation and advanced speech recognition solutions for
enterprises, consumers and partners worldwide. This new partnership builds upon
the technology and IP collaboration between the companies announced earlier this
year. 

As part of the Joint Initiative Agreement, IBM has named Nuance its Preferred
Business Partner for speech technologies and related professional services to
complement IBM`s Industry Solutions portfolio. The companies will collaborate to
address and fulfill the needs of customers in ten industries: Automotive,
Banking, Electronics, Energy and Utilities, Healthcare and Life Sciences,
Insurance, Media and Entertainment, Retail, Telecommunications, and Travel and
Transportation. 

IBM and Nuance expect to expand the opportunity for deploying speech
technologies and make it easier than ever for enterprises and individuals to
engage in commerce, access information and collaborate in broad application
domains like customer care, unified messaging and mobile search. Specifically,
the companies will concentrate their efforts in three key areas:

* The companies will forge a tight, complementary relationship between Nuance`s
advanced speech technologies and related professional services, and IBM`s Global
Business Services organization and Web application server capabilities for
traditional and VoIP network infrastructures; 
* For each industry above, Nuance and IBM will collaborate to fulfill the
customer requirements for advanced, automated customer self-service and agent
optimization; and, 
* In automotive and telecommunications, the companies will collaborate to
address the needs of in-vehicle and on-device OEMs that seek to incorporate
next-generation technologies that focus on voice access to device control,
search and media management.

"As businesses and governments aim to operate more intelligently and
efficiently, the full impact of speech technology is just emerging. Working with
Nuance and its extensive array of complementary products and services, we are
accelerating the opportunity to deliver exciting innovations to clients in key
industries," said Frank Kern, IBM senior vice president, Global Business
Services. "Teaming with Nuance means great things for organizations and
manufacturers that rely on speech technology to advance their own business
objectives and provide exciting new services for their customers." 

"The potential innovations in speech technology that result from Nuance and
IBM`s combined efforts, expertise and resources are boundless," said Paul Ricci,
chairman and CEO, Nuance. "Together we can achieve new benchmarks in design,
usability and technical excellence by collaborating with IBM`s renowned speech
teams and by serving as IBM`s preferred partner for speech solutions. And, this
initiative enables us to deliver on our joint mission to proliferate the power
of speech across a vast number of applications and services."

&lt;p&gt;TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduras' coup leaders came under new pressure on Tuesday to allow ousted President Manuel Zelaya's return to power as the United States revoked visas for four members of the de facto government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington has refused to recognize the government led by Roberto Micheletti, who took over when Zelaya was toppled in a June 28 coup, and it already had cut $16.5 million in U.S. military aid to the Central American country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelaya had asked President Barack Obama to revoke U.S. visas for the coup leaders and he quickly welcomed the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are isolated, they are surrounded, they are alone," the deposed leftist said of the coup leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a coup that has been dead from the start, so they will have to abandon their position of intransigence in the coming hours," he said in Nicaragua, where he is camped out near the border with Honduras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micheletti's government, backed by the Supreme Court and Congress, has refused to bend to international condemnation of the coup. It insists that Zelaya cannot come back and serve his remaining six months in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelaya, an ally of Venezuela's socialist President Hugo Chavez, was ousted as he sought a referendum to change the constitution, a move the Supreme Court ruled illegal. Zelaya's critics say he was trying to extend presidential term limits so he could be re-elected, but he denies the claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costa Rican President Oscar Arias has mediated talks between both sides, but the negotiations so far have failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arias, who will host a regional heads of state meeting in northern Costa Rica on Wednesday, said he supported the U.S. move to strip some Micheletti officials of their visas as a way to pressure those holding power to reopen dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the pressure keeps rising with drastic measures, the de facto government in Honduras will possibly be more compelled to sit down at the table again," Arias told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said official diplomatic visas had been revoked for four individuals. "We don't recognize Roberto Micheletti as the president of Honduras, we recognize Manuel Zelaya," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly did not name those affected but said the diplomatic visas of others in government also were being reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representative Connie Mack, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives who visited Honduras over the weekend, told Reuters it was his understanding that two of the people who had their U.S. visas revoked were Tomas Arita Valle, the Supreme Court justice who signed the order for Zelaya's arrest, and Jose Alfredo Saavedra, president of the Honduran Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mack criticized the move as intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two others who confirmed they had their visas revoked were human rights ombudsman Ramon Custodio and Adolfo Lionel Sevilla, defense minister in the interim government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micheletti told reporters at the presidential palace on Tuesday that his U.S. visa had not been revoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosary in hand, Micheletti later appeared on state television to lead viewers in a "Day of Prayer" for peace.

The EU has suspended all budgetary support payments for Honduras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inter-American Development Bank and World Bank have frozen loans in a move the interim government says will cost $200 million in 2009, a blow to the coffee and textile exporter that already is one of Latin America's poorest countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelaya in recent days had questioned whether the U.S. government was doing enough to push for his return, and also called for a ban on the coup leaders' bank transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelaya said as many as 1,000 of his supporters have made the trek to join him in Nicaragua, dodging road blocks and a curfew in the border region of Honduras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sporting his trademark cream-colored cowboy hat, Zelaya briefly crossed the border into Honduras last Friday but stepped back from security forces waiting to arrest him, saying he wanted to avoid a massacre.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans blasted the Obama administration on Tuesday for revoking visas for members of the de facto government in Honduras, saying Washington was trying to force the restoration of its leftist government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has refused to recognize the government led by Roberto Micheletti, who took over the coffee and textile-producing Central American nation after President Manuel Zelaya was toppled in a June 28 coup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington already had cut $16.5 million in U.S. military to Honduras before it revoked on Tuesday diplomatic visas for four officials in Micheletti's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative Republicans in Congress attacked the move as an overly aggressive tactic aimed at bringing back Zelaya, who is an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a socialist and ardent foe of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulling the visas "looks like an attempt to intimidate and kind of manipulate the outcome" in Honduras, said Connie Mack, a Florida Republican in the House of Representatives, who met Micheletti on a fact-finding visit to Honduras last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micheletti's government, backed by Honduras' Supreme Court and Congress, has refused to bend amid widespread international condemnation of the coup, and it insists that Zelaya cannot come back and serve out his remaining six months in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says Zelaya was ousted as he sought a referendum vote to change the constitution, a move the Honduran Supreme Court ruled illegal.

&lt;p&gt; * Republican lawmakers slam revocation of visas * Rep. Connie Mack say it is attempt to intimidate * Protest votes cast against diplomatic nominees (Recasts with lawmakers' comments, Senate panel vote) By Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - Republicans blasted the Obama administration on Tuesday for revoking visas for members of the de facto government in Honduras, saying Washington was trying to force the restoration of its leftist government. The United States has refused to recognize the government led by Roberto Micheletti, who took over the coffee and textile-producing Central American nation after President Manuel Zelaya was toppled in a June 28 coup. Washington already had cut $16.5 million in U.S. military to Honduras before it revoked on Tuesday diplomatic visas for four officials in Micheletti's government. Conservative Republicans in Congress attacked the move as an overly aggressive tactic aimed at bringing back Zelaya, who is an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a socialist and ardent foe of the United States. Pulling the visas looks like an attempt to intimidate and kind of manipulate the outcome in Honduras, said Connie Mack, a Florida Republican in the House of Representatives, who met Micheletti on a fact-finding visit to Honduras last weekend. Micheletti's government, backed by Honduras' Supreme Court and Congress, has refused to bend amid widespread international condemnation of the coup, and it insists that Zelaya cannot come back and serve out his remaining six months in office. It says Zelaya was ousted as he sought a referendum vote to change the constitution, a move the Honduran Supreme Court ruled illegal. Zelaya's critics say he was trying to extend presidential term limits so he could be re-elected. The deposed leader denies the claims. Mack told Reuters it was his understanding that Tomas Arita Valle, a Supreme Court justice who signed Zelaya's arrest order last month, and Jose Saavedra, a leader of the Honduran Congress, were among those who had their visas revoked. Mack added that U.S. diplomats in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa had confirmed to him during his visit that the Supreme Court justice's visa would be revoked. Another Florida Republican, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, on Tuesday wrote to the U.S. ambassador to Honduras, Hugo Llorens, to express her deep concern about the decision to rescind the visas. Rather than upholding the principles of a true democracy, these actions appear to punish those who are working to preserve the idea of checks and balances in Honduras, the congresswoman wrote. SENATE PROTEST VOTE Explaining the decision to pull the visas, U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said we don't recognize Roberto Micheletti as the president of Honduras, we recognize Manuel Zelaya. Republicans in the U.S. Senate, where they are the minority, cast protest votes against two U.S. diplomatic nominees for Latin American posts on Tuesday in response to the government's stand on Honduras. The Senate Foreign Relations committee voted 15-4 to confirm Arturo Valenzuela as Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, the senior diplomat in charge of Latin America at the State Department. It also voted 14-4, with one abstention, to confirm Thomas Shannon, who currently holds the assistant secretary position, to be U.S. ambassador to Brazil. Conservative Republican Senator Jim DeMint, who led the opposition to the nominees, told reporters that revocation of the visas was inexplicable and played into the hands of anti-U.S. governments in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. It continues to defy reason, of why we won't listen to the real facts of this case, DeMint said.(Editing by Tim Gaynor and Paul Simao)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM plans to buy business analytics company SPSS Inc for $1.2 billion in cash to better compete with Oracle Corp and SAP AG in the growing field of business intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shareholders of SPSS, which provides software and services to help companies analyze and forecast trends in consumer behavior, would receive $50 a share, a 42 percent premium to Monday's closing price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed acquisition, announced on Tuesday, follows a spate of deals in recent years in the business intelligence sector, such as Oracle's purchase of Hyperion, SAP's acquisition of Business Objects and International Business Machines Corp's own deal for Cognos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other names in the arena include MicroStrategy Inc, Actuate Corp and Datawatch Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're in a period where consolidation seems to be a rule of the game," said Charles King, an analyst with Pund-IT Research.

The stock had already risen 30 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS analyst Maynard Um estimates that SPSS could add 3 cents a share to IBM's 2010 earnings, but said the greatest gain may lie in deeper penetration into the analytics market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe actual benefits may prove greater as the deal adds to IBM's business and predictive analytics portfolio, which will be an essential part of IBM's smarter business systems and which the company has identified as a significant growth opportunity over the next few years," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior IBM executive said he expects double-digit growth in its analytics business despite a weak economy that has forced many companies to cut back on spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're driving a plan for double-digit growth," Steve Mills, senior vice president and group executive of IBM's software group, told Reuters in an interview. "There is no lack of customer interest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said the deal would help expand its software portfolio and business analytics capabilities. Predictive analytics, combined with IBM's existing software and consulting skills, can help in preventing fraud or predicting the risks or patterns of a pandemic, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has been shifting its focus from hardware to more profitable software and services over the past decade, and Mills said the analytics business yields higher profit margins than the average IBM product or service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, Credit Suisse uses SPSS software to analyze information about its customers, then gives leads to its sales force. Police use these systems to mine data from incident reports to predict patterns of criminal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The environment today is focused on sense and respond: what's happening and what we should do about it," said Ambuj Goyal, IBM's general manager of information management software. The acquisition of SPSS, he said, would help it move to "predict and act."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM AND ACQUISITIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM already sells SPSS software through a sales partnership. An acquisition, Goyal said, would help IBM integrate SPSS software throughout its offerings and making it easier for their mutual customers to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has spent $20 billion buying more than 100 companies since 2000, paying prices that range from as little as $50 million to as much as $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal values SPSS at about 25 times analysts' estimated 2010 earnings per share, and the $50-per-share price tops the all-time high for the stock of $47.87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they paid a lot for it but it's not unreasonable," said Standard  Poor's technology analyst Tom Smith. "The predictable analytics area is a really hot area, and I would think that companies in that would trade at a premium to companies in other areas of technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, which includes a fee of $23.5 million that SPSS would have to pay should the merger fall through, is expected to close later in the second half of 2009, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, IBM said it has acquired closely held Ounce Labs Inc, whose software helps companies reduce the risks and costs associated with security and compliance concerns.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - A senior IBM (IBM.N)
executive said on Tuesday the company expects double-digit
growth in its analytics business, a combination of analytical
software and consulting services, despite a weak economy that
has forced many companies to cut back on spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We're driving a plan for double-digit growth," Steve
Mills, senior vice president and group executive of IBM's

such growth also means strong market share growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His comment come after IBM earlier announced plans to buy
business analytics company SPSS Inc SPSS.O for $1.2 billion
to better compete with Oracle Corp ORCL.O and SAP AG
(SAPG.DE) in the growing field of business intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPSS provides software and services to help companies
forecast trends and spot shifts in consumer patterns, which IBM
said would fit well with its existing analytics offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mills said IBM did not plan to cut costs at SPSS, but
rather intended to add resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would expect to add to existing sales," he said, adding
that more IBM sales staff would also be trained to sell SPSS
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mills also said demand for analytics was substantially
higher than other services that have seen a cutback in customer
spending amid the economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is no lack of customer interest," he said.

&lt;p&gt;  SUNNYVALE, CA, Jul 28 (MARKET WIRE) --

its recognition in JPF's Self-Help category.

    "I use a combination of psychotherapy and clinical hypnosis in my private
practice in Los Angeles -- with great results. The 'Ultimate Weight Loss'
CD benefits from both approaches, which is why it is so effective," says
Dr. Walton, Ph.D., who, besides weight loss, has counseled on marriage
and relationships, career transitions, stress, grief, and anger, among
other issues, for more than 20 years.

    "Ultimate Weight Loss," aimed at enabling listeners to "never overeat or

my compulsive eating habits and I can't thank you enough. I have lost 8
lbs in two weeks and I'm blown away."  Jody Yordan

    "This CD is an effective way to lose weight. I lost about 10 pounds in a
month (something I have been trying to do for years). 'Ultimate Weight
Loss' really helps me push away from the table without wishing for more
food." Charles Buell

four people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

the two companies were in talks on possibly integrating their
operation, which include production of soft drinks, wine and
food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The merger would put Kirin and unlisted Suntory on par in
revenue terms with U.S.-based Kraft Foods KFT.N and Pepsico Inc
(PEP.N), and give the two more pricing power in Japan's mature
market.

&lt;p&gt;GAYAM, Indonesia (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) Cepu find in this poor rice-growing area of Java was meant to revive Indonesia's flagging oil output, but nearly a decade later there has been barely a trickle of oil from the huge field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has the world's 10th largest natural gas reserves and 25th biggest oil reserves, while it ranks in the top ten for copper, gold, nickel and tin, but a poor investment climate has deterred new foreign interest to develop its rich resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snail's pace of pumping oil at Cepu, which ranks among the U.S. major's top 10 projects worldwide, illustrates the multiple barriers foreign resource firms often face developing projects in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who was re-elected in July, failed in his first term to lift flagging oil output or attract major new foreign investment in mining to boost output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reverse this legacy, analysts say he needs to move swiftly to cut red tape, clarify oil and mining regulations and curb excessive resource nationalism to attract more investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari Soemarno, former head of state oil firm Pertamina who successfully concluded negotiations with Exxon Mobil on Cepu after the project was delayed for years, told Reuters the government needed a firmer stance to ensure projects were not held up by political squabbles or policy flip flops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They should make a breakthrough in terms of mindset," said Soemarno, who is now involved in businesses that include energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field, which straddles both East and Central Java, is due to eventually produce 165,000 barrels per day (bpd) when it hits full output, or nearly a fifth of Indonesia's current production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon used advanced 3-D seismic technology to find oil in Cepu in 2001 after other firms had given up the hunt, but then spent five years wrangling with Pertamina over control and the share of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yudhoyono, who urgently wants to stop a slide in oil output as other fields age, eventually ended the deadlock by firing Pertamina's board, resulting in the two firms agreeing in 2006 to jointly develop Cepu with Exxon as operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICS THREATENS PROJECTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, which also hosts top global energy firms such as Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and BP Plc (BP.L), has been offering new exploration rights and financial incentives for oil fields but has struggled to get more production on stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country lacks the billions of dollars needed to exploit new fields -- now often offshore and difficult to access in deep waters -- but the involvement of foreign investors, who bring capital and technology, is a sensitive political issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Cepu may be the only major investment to add to oil production in the next five years, while gas projects in the pipeline also face uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future of a Sulawesi liquefied natural gas (LNG) project involving Pertamina, PT Medco Energi International (MEDC.JK) and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. (8058.T) looks in doubt after mixed government signals on whether LNG could be exported or only used domestically meant the project may be uneconomic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is also still involved in a dispute with the government over the operating rights of the huge Natuna D-Alpha gas project estimated to require about $40 billion investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor uncertainty has also been increased by a government move to revise a cost recovery scheme reimbursing oil firms for exploration and production costs under pressure from parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yudhoyono said in May he still supported gas exports and vowed legal certainty for investors, while also seeking to resolve tax issues which currently deter oil and gas investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Pertamina head Soemarno said authorities also needed to phase out budget-straining fuel subsidies, particularly now that Indonesia has become a net crude importer and has quit OPEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The era of easy oil is over for Indonesia," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RED TAPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is similar uncertainty in the mining sector. Resource nationalism has often been prevalent, while a dragged-out process passing a new mining law has also put off investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is currently drafting regulations on the law, which was passed last year and replaced one dating from 1967.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new law, miners will be put on shorter-term permits rather than longer-term contracts, while they will also have to process minerals in Indonesia and set aside coal for the domestic market. Foreign investors will also have to divest some of their shares in a mining project after a period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some foreign mining firms have shelved investment plans since last year. BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) scrapped a study to develop a nickel project in eastern Indonesia and also opted not to go ahead with a coal mine in Central Kalminantan. Chinese firm Tsingshan Mineral Company Ltd scrapped a $500 million nickel project in North Maluku in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tortuous red tape tied to land ownership issues also frequently holds up resource and infrastructure projects in Indonesia, particularly in densely populated islands like Java.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest challenge right now is land acquisition. We could use all the help we could get," said Deddy Afidick, a spokesman for Mobil Cepu Ltd, a unit of Exxon Mobil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil has a team in Cepu currently negotiating with 3,000 owners to purchase 4,000 plots of land in an area where the average size of a plot is only a hectare, Afidick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the complexities of land ownership on the ground, the involvement of local governments in an era of decentralization is now also a bigger issue for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said in a May interview that Cepu faced delays because of a dispute with the Tuban district over a pipeline and despite reports of a resolution a source close to the project said a permit has yet to be issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six wells have been drilled for early production on Cepu's main Banyu Urip field, which is estimated to have reserves of 350 million barrels, including two to re-inject gas and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a recent visit to the site, a pipeline from Well Pad "A" was being laid so that oil can flow oil to a nearby Gas Oil Separation Plant (GOSP), which is also under construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some test production started in December and early production of up to 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) could begin in August, before cranking up to its peak by 2012, when more infrastructure including an on-site central processing facility is in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Grieder of IHS Global Insight said the re-election of the market-friendly Yudhoyono should be positive for Indonesia's oil and gas sector, noting it must attract foreign investment to boost supply and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This more than anything else will force the government to gradually improve investment terms for the oil and gas sector and start reducing fuel subsidies as the alternatives are shrinking state finances, rampant inefficiency and, ultimately, an oil and gas supply crisis," said Asia energy analyst Grieder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Muklis Ali; Editing by Michael Urquhart)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (For related story click on [ID:nJAK475254])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) huge Cepu
oil field in Indonesia is expected to start initial production
in August nearly a decade after it was discovered and following
a sharp slide in crude output in Southeast Asia's biggest
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cepu, which ranks among the U.S. major's top 10 projects
worldwide and is Southeast Asia's biggest new field, has faced
multiple obstacles, from land issues to the path of pipelines
and the share of revenue and control with state oil firm
Pertamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are some details of the $2.6 billion Cepu project in
an area straddling Central and East Java.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROJECT DETAILS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Exxon Mobil used advanced 3-D seismic technology to find
oil in Cepu in 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Five years of wrangling with state oil firm Pertamina
over control and share of revenue then followed before an
agreement was reached in 2006 to jointly develop Cepu with
Exxon unit Mobil Cepu Ltd as operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Exxon and Pertamina hold 45 percent stakes, with the
remaining 10 percent held by four local governments in East and
Central Java. The revenue share is 85 percent for the
government and 15 percent for contractors when the oil price is
above $45 per barrel. If oil prices are lower then the
investors get a bigger share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EARLY PRODUCTION PHASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Some test production started in December and early output
of 15,000-16,000 barrels per day (bpd) could begin in August,
rising to 20,000 bpd by year end, energy watchdog BPMIGAS said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Six wells have been drilled for early production on
Cepu's main Banyu Urip field, which is estimated to have
reserves of 350 million barrels, including two to re-inject gas
and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Crude will be piped through a 2.5 km pipeline to a gas
oil separation plant. From the plant around 6,000 bpd is due to
go to a small refinery being built by private firm PT Tri
Wahana Universal (TWU), while up to 14,000 bpd will be piped to
storage facilities operated by Pertamina and Petrochina, which
already has operations in the area, in Mudi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Oil from the storage area will then flow in a pipeline
parallel to an existing pipeline to a floating storage facility
in the Java Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MAIN PRODUCTION PHASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Cepu is expected to reach maximum output of 165,000
barrels per day (bpd) of crude in 2012, or about a fifth of
Indonesia's current crude output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - A central processing facility will be built on 100
hectares (247 acres) near the main oil wells to handle maximum
output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - A new 76 km pipeline will also be built to directly
transport maximum output to a new floating storage facility for
shipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Cepu's total oil reserves are estimated at 600 million
barrels and the company will start new exploratory drilling in
other areas at the end of the year. The block includes seven
other fields such as Alas Dara/Kemuning, Jambaran and Cendana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  - The field is also estimated to have 1.3 trillion cubic

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc have launched a 10-year Web search deal to challenge market leader Google but stopped short of combining other advertising businesses or suggesting any deeper ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-expected deal means Microsoft's new Bing search engine will be combined with Yahoo's experience attracting advertisers in the first serious threat to Google Inc -- if the companies get regulatory approval and can make the partnership work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares fell 12 percent as some investors were disappointed by the limited scope of the deal, which did not include up-front payments for Yahoo. Some investors had expected up to $3 billion up-front, according to a Bernstein report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would have preferred more money," said Ryan Jacob, chief investment officer of Jacob Asset Management, pointing to the lack of an upfront payment, as well as revenue-sharing and cost-savings terms that were not as high as he expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are risks on both sides. Big deals like this tend not to work out. It's a long-term deal that's going to take a long time to implement," said Jacob, whose $40 million fund holds some Yahoo shares. "It's better than no deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares closed up 1.4 percent, while Google shares fell 0.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo estimated the deal would boost its annual operating income by about $500 million and yield capital expenditure savings of $200 million. Yahoo also expects the deal to boost annual operating cash flow by about $275 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANTITRUST OBSTACLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal announced on Wednesday, Microsoft's Bing search engine will power search queries on Yahoo's sites. Yahoo's sales force will be responsible for selling premium search ads to big buyers for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership poses only a theoretical challenge to Google at present. It could take two-and-a-half years to get approval and be fully implemented, according to Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz, which would mean the partnership would not be fully effective until early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo still face antitrust and privacy issues. Google dropped a planned search partnership with Yahoo last year under pressure from the U.S. Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts said the deal would likely get the go-ahead after examination by Obama administration antitrust officials since it would create a stronger rival to market leader Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said only that it was "interested" in the deal, while the chairman of the U.S. Senate antitrust panel said it warrants "careful scrutiny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo expected the deal to be "closely reviewed" by regulators, but they were "hopeful" it could close in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal concludes a lengthy, and at times contentious, dance between the two companies. They have been in on-again, off-again talks since Yahoo rebuffed Microsoft's $47.5 billion takeover bid last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer clashed last year with former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, who was strongly opposed to an all-out acquisition. Relations between the two companies improved under new Yahoo CEO Bartz, who took the reins in January and started to shake up Yahoo's management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer and Bartz met "three or four times" over the past six months as they hammered out a deal, according to Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW THE DEAL WORKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Bartz had previously said any deal would require a partner with "boatloads of money," she said on Wednesday the agreement provided "boatloads of value," adding the revenue- share agreement in the Microsoft deal was more valuable to Yahoo than a one-time payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having a big up-front cash payment doesn't really help us from an operating standpoint," Bartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's AdCenter technology will serve the standard sponsored links that appear alongside search results. Microsoft will pay Yahoo an initial rate of 88 percent of search revenue generated on Yahoo sites in the first five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means Yahoo can concentrate on selling ads on its websites, while still generating revenue from search ads without the expense of maintaining its own search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz said the deal will result in "redundancies" in Yahoo's staff, although she declined to be specific. She stressed any changes would not occur until after full implementation of the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to comScore, Google has a 65 percent share of the U.S. search market, compared with Yahoo's 19.6 percent and Microsoft's 8.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft will be able to report a greater share in terms of search ... And Yahoo doesn't have to spend any more money on search," said Barry Diller, CEO of IAC/InterActiveCorp, which owns rival search engine Ask.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares closed down $2.08 at $15.14 on Nasdaq, while Microsoft closed up 33 cents at $23.80 and Google shares closed down $3.61 at $436.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tiffany Wu, Paul Thomasch, Robert MacMillan and Diane Bartz; editing by Derek Caney and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It took Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc several years to find common ground on the best way to team up in the Internet search market. Now comes the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partnership announced on Wednesday seeks to challenge the dominance of Google Inc, but executives at Yahoo and Microsoft acknowledge that building a search powerhouse will be a multi-year effort -- in a business where staying ahead of the competition, not playing catch-up, is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unlike previous discussions which involved an outright acquisition of Yahoo by Microsoft, this deal will create a number of uncertainties for both companies as they fuse disparate technologies, cultures and business priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankee analyst Carl Howe said integrating two separate search engines is an inherently thorny process that requires merging vast and often incompatible indices of Web data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the ways they could have made this simple was to say 'We're throwing away Yahoo's search engine and going with (Microsoft's) Bing,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ask any two banks that have ever been through a merger," Howe said. "The announcement of a merger is easy, it's combining the back end that takes years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the 10-year deal, search on Yahoo's websites will be generated by Microsoft's new Bing search engine. Microsoft will license Yahoo's search technology, allowing it to integrate certain aspects of it into Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's advertising search product, AdCenter, will also replace Yahoo's equivalent product, Panama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies together would hold roughly 30 percent of the U.S. search market, which makes their combined audience a more attractive place for marketers to spend their dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pieces are all there. Microsoft has a great product already developed. Yahoo has a massive audience," said Bob Davis, a partner at Highland Capital Partners and the former CEO of search engine Lycos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But integration will be a lengthy and potentially distracting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft projected the complete, worldwide transition will take up to 24 months after the deal's closing and clearance by government regulators expected in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENGINEERS RELOCATE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Yahoo search engineers will be asked to take jobs at Microsoft, whose Redmond, Washington headquarters is far removed from Yahoo's California homebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft representative would not say where the company's search efforts were based, but noted that the search team is located in various offices including Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It ties them together but in a complicated way with no long-term certainty and limited control," said Ryan Jacob, chief investment officer of Jacob Asset Management, which owns Yahoo shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was in the camp that thought Microsoft should have just bought them. As a Yahoo shareholder, that would have been the best outcome. From Microsoft's standpoint, what happens if Yahoo decides to go somewhere else?" he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any hiccups or technical glitches that affect search results or ad placements while the new technology is being rolled out might not sit well among advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo said the deal will allow it to save $200 million in capital expenditure and boost annual operating income by $500 million. Those cost savings could be crucial to a company that has seen revenue growth stall and profit margins shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits to innovation are less clear though, said Boston University Professor N. Venkat Venktatraman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What they should watch out for is Google coming into it with new innovations that these two companies independently do not know how to respond to, and collectively may not have gotten their processes for innovation in tune," said Venkat Venktatraman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz said handing off search technology to Microsoft will free Yahoo to invest in its websites, display advertising products and mobile products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an increasingly vital ingredient in developing such products is the data that's gleaned from search queries, which can be used to create more targeted experiences for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said determining how search data is shared between them was the most complex part of the negotiations. But the specific details are vague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are they giving up the rights to use the search data that powers display advertising? That's still not clear," said Brigantine Advisors analyst Colin Gillis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic, editing by Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday, as the world's largest credit card network cut expenses and credit-strapped consumers used their debit cards more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also forecast revenue would grow more than expected in the fourth quarter helped by a recovery in the number of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 73 percent to $729 million, or 97 cents per diluted class A share, for the third quarter ended June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an adjusted basis, reflecting a normalized tax rate, restructuring and purchase amortizations, quarterly net income rose to $744 million, or 98 cents per diluted class A share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding the impact from the sale of the company's stake in VisaNet do Brasil, adjusted quarterly net income was $507 million, or 67 cents per share. On that basis, analysts expected earnings of 64 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net operating revenue rose 2 percent to $1.6 billion, but adjusted operating expenses fell 9 percent to $804 million as the company cut advertising and marketing costs by 15 percent, and personnel expenses by 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Revenue was basically in line with what everybody was looking for, but they beat expectations because of better expenses, and a big chunk of that was that advertising costs were lower than expected," said Robert Dodd, an analyst at Morgan, Keegan  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fourth-quarter looks pretty good, but that is because of cost cutting initiatives rather than a recovery," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total processed transactions -- which represent transactions processed by VisaNet -- increased 8 percent to 10.3 billion, but payments volume fell 5 percent for the quarter ended March 31, which translates to revenue in the following quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa is partially insulated from the credit crisis because it processes transactions rather than lends funds. However, the company has seen a slowdown in the growth of revenue and transaction volumes as consumers used their credit cards less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the payment volume declined 10.4 percent in credit cards, it grew 3.6 percent in debit cards, especially boosted by the United States, where Visa is promoting aggressively the use of debit programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of our transactional increases are being driven by our debit volume. Not our credit volume," Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said in a conference call with analysts. "None of our projections suggest that (credit volume) is going to come back, come roaring back in any way, shape, or form."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHY SIGNS OF STABILIZATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said cross-border volumes, which declined 8 percent in the fiscal third quarter, showed a contraction of 7 percent in July, while processed transactions accelerated their growth rates to 9 percent from 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we still see no signs of a true inflection point, these friends are encouraging," Pollitt said in a conference call with analysts. "The velocity of the downturn has slowed, which is encouraging, but it is still too early to call an inflection point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following those comments, Visa raised its revenue growth outlook for the fourth quarter to mid-single digits from low single digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm adjusted its estimate of capital expenses for 2009 to around $300 million from a range of $300 million to $350 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa reiterated its forecast of annual net revenue growth of high single digits in 2009 and at the lower end of the 11 to 15 percent range in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also affirmed its annual adjusted diluted class A common stock earnings per share will grow over 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa also announced it created a joint venture with U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) called Syncada to provide network services to corporations and governments to process and track invoices, and make and receive payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credit card network made an unspecified capital investment in Syncada, while U.S. Bancorp contributed with the technology platform and personnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's shares were down 1.2 percent at $65.86 in after-hours trade. The stock is up 30 percent in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio; Editing by Leslie Gevirtz, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Advertising executives gave the thumbs up to the pairing of Yahoo Inc and Microsoft Corp in the search market, hoping it will provide marketers with more bang against Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said the partnership would create more efficiencies in reaching and tracking online audiences in the roughly $30 billion global search advertising market, by essentially merging the No. 2 and No. 3 search players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is extremely encouraging and introduces more balance into the search and display markets," said Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of British advertising group WPP. "It is good for our clients and our agencies and for regulators."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal announced on Wednesday, Microsoft will provide the search technology for Yahoo's sites and have a 10-year license to integrate Yahoo's technologies, aiming to be a more powerful No. 2 to market leader Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically today, an ad agency working for say, Toyota Motor Corp, may go to Google, Yahoo or Microsoft to bid on text ads that appear alongside the results of search keywords like "hybrid vehicle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad executives said the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo will give advertisers a stronger alternative to Google that provides scale with the benefit of a combined platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to comScore, Google has a 65 percent share of the U.S. search market, compared with Yahoo's 19.6 percent and Microsoft's 8.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You go from a three-party race to a two-party race," according to Randy Schwartz, national search director at Carat USA, who said the deal could level the playing field in some advertising categories if clients see they are now reaching audiences more effectively through Microsoft and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are sectors that might see comparable value and see as much traffic from a Yahoo search as a Google search," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUZZ FOR BING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Microsoft/Yahoo partnership proves effective in boosting advertisers' return on their ads, it could eventually eat into Google's market share or expand the overall market, advertising experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the word gets out that Bing has plenty of volume and is performing at a high rate, whether through better return on investment or click rates, that's when advertisers will decide whether or not to shift more budget to Bing," said Rob Garner, search strategy director for agency iCrossing. Bing is Microsoft's new search engine, introduced in late May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garner said if more advertisers are drawn to a particular category as a result of the deal, ad prices could potentially increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's say there's more buzz around a particular campaign, then you might see 10 advertisers rather than two competing on that one spot. Typically, when you get more advertisers into the mix, prices go up," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Garner and other ad executives warned that many other factors, such as the economy, could also affect pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad executives believe the deal, expected to be reviewed closely by regulators and pegged to close in 2010, would render better efficiencies and eliminate hassles formerly involved in preparing three separate campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Stylman, chief executive of advertising agency Reprise Media, which counts Microsoft among its clients, believes there should be cost savings for marketers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our hope is that there will be savings in terms of efficiencies. The search category is a highly technology-leverage business in terms of planning, trafficking, tracking and optimizing campaigns," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not having to manage certain systems due to this combination should shrink the cost structure of managing advertising campaigns. What this means is there is one less set of pipes we need to accommodate over times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should get more Bing for the buck," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But others are convinced Google will continue to reign supreme. "Bing's platform for search advertisers is vastly inferior to that of Yahoo, so consolidating Bing and Yahoo on a single platform will reinforce the inferior experience compared to Google and could, in the long term, severely damage future revenues," said Martin McNulty, director, search marketing specialist Trafficbroker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kate Holton in London; editing by Tiffany Wu and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said the partnership would create more efficiencies in reaching and tracking online audiences in the roughly $30 billion global search advertising market, by essentially merging the No. 2 and No. 3 search players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is extremely encouraging and introduces more balance into the search and display markets," said Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of British advertising group WPP. "It is good for our clients and our agencies and for regulators."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal announced on Wednesday, Microsoft will provide the search technology for Yahoo's sites and have a 10-year license to integrate Yahoo's technologies, aiming to be a more powerful No. 2 to market leader Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically today, an ad agency working for say, Toyota Motor Corp, may go to Google, Yahoo or Microsoft to bid on text ads that appear alongside the results of search keywords like "hybrid vehicle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad executives said the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo will give advertisers a stronger alternative to Google that provides scale with the benefit of a combined platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to comScore, Google has a 65 percent share of the U.S. search market, compared with Yahoo's 19.6 percent and Microsoft's 8.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You go from a three-party race to a two-party race," according to Randy Schwartz, national search director at Carat USA, who said the deal could level the playing field in some advertising categories if clients see they are now reaching audiences more effectively through Microsoft and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are sectors that might see comparable value and see as much traffic from a Yahoo search as a Google search," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUZZ FOR BING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Microsoft/Yahoo partnership proves effective in boosting advertisers' return on their ads, it could eventually eat into Google's market share or expand the overall market, advertising experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the word gets out that Bing has plenty of volume and is performing at a high rate, whether through better return on investment or click rates, that's when advertisers will decide whether or not to shift more budget to Bing," said Rob Garner, search strategy director for agency iCrossing. Bing is Microsoft's new search engine, introduced in late May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garner said if more advertisers are drawn to a particular category as a result of the deal, ad prices could potentially increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's say there's more buzz around a particular campaign, then you might see 10 advertisers rather than two competing on that one spot. Typically, when you get more advertisers into the mix, prices go up," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Garner and other ad executives warned that many other factors, such as the economy, could also affect pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad executives believe the deal, expected to be reviewed closely by regulators and pegged to close in 2010, would render better efficiencies and eliminate hassles formerly involved in preparing three separate campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Stylman, chief executive of advertising agency Reprise Media, which counts Microsoft among its clients, believes there should be cost savings for marketers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our hope is that there will be savings in terms of efficiencies. The search category is a highly technology-leverage business in terms of planning, trafficking, tracking and optimizing campaigns," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not having to manage certain systems due to this combination should shrink the cost structure of managing advertising campaigns. What this means is there is one less set of pipes we need to accommodate over times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should get more Bing for the buck," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But others are convinced Google will continue to reign supreme. "Bing's platform for search advertisers is vastly inferior to that of Yahoo, so consolidating Bing and Yahoo on a single platform will reinforce the inferior experience compared to Google and could, in the long term, severely damage future revenues," said Martin McNulty, director, search marketing specialist Trafficbroker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kate Holton in London; editing by Tiffany Wu and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft's (MSFT.O) 10-year Internet search deal with Yahoo (YHOO.O) will get a hard look from Obama administration antitrust enforcers but will probably squeak through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the partnership knocks the number of competing search engines down to two, from three, antitrust experts said this might have happened anyway. The partners say they will join to create a stronger competitor to Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question is: is it OK? Is two enough?" said antitrust attorney John Briggs of Axinn, Veltrop and Harkrider LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this deal would be really easy to get through in the Bush administration. They wouldn't even look twice at it," said Briggs. "This administration is going to look twice at it, and probably in the end let it through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Bing search engine will power search queries on Yahoo's sites. The companies said they expected the deal to be "closely reviewed" by regulators, but were hopeful it would close in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has 65 percent of the search market, versus Yahoo, with 29.6 percent, and Microsoft's 8.4 percent, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without this deal, I think it would be really unlikely that you'd have a market with three robust search providers in 10 years," said Beau Buffier, an attorney with Shearman  Sterling LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Herb Kohl, whose subcommittee oversees the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said the panel was concerned that advertisers would face higher rates and that there might be less innovation because of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal between Yahoo and Microsoft -- industry giants and direct competitors in Internet advertising and search markets -- warrants our careful scrutiny," he said in a statement. "The implications of this proposed joint agreement will be closely reviewed by my subcommittee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Evan Stewart, an antitrust expert with Zuckerman Spaeder, said the deal creates a stronger competitor to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is good for the competitive marketplace," said Stewart. "It will be easier to get access to this advertising space at presumably more competitive rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The length of the deal means that regulators will likely view it almost as a merger, said Richard Brosnick of law firm Butzel Long. "In Internet time, that might as well be 100 years. A 10-year exclusive license might as well be an acquisition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is expected to be watching the deal closely. It dropped its own advertising deal with Yahoo last year under pressure from the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and advertisers had lobbied the department hard to stop Google from gaining further market power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, so far, is saying little publicly about the Microsoft-Yahoo deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There has traditionally been a lot of competition online, and our experience is that competition brings about great things for users," said Google spokesman Adam Kovacevich in an emailed statement. "We're interested to learn more about the deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-Yahoo deal was inevitable following Yahoo's rejection of a Microsoft takeover, the collapse of the Google-Yahoo deal and upheaval in Yahoo's executive suites, said Stewart, the attorney with Zuckerman Spaeder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that the new management is up and running, she (Carol Bartz) is revisiting the basic strategic wisdom of entering into a strategic partnership with Microsoft," he said. "This is like the directors cut. This is a similar movie but with different scenes added or changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Her platinum white hair is long gone, replaced by silky smooth, dark brown locks. Yet that doesn't stop young girls from recognizing "High School Musical" star Ashley Tisdale at restaurants and asking for autographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tisdale's role as Sharpay Evans, an over-the-top teenager who will stop at nothing to get what she wants in Disney's "High School Musical," has given her a huge following and altered Tisdale's life forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the 24-year-old actress is expanding her career in new projects, including her role in movie "Aliens in the Attic," which debuts in U.S. theaters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tisdale continues to work in TV where "HSM" was a huge hit on the Disney Channel before becoming a movie, and she is even producing. Her singing has landed the actress a chart-topping recording career, and her second studio album, "Guilty Pleasures," comes out this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, her growing popularity has meant Tisdale has a constant trail of paparazzi following her around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't have a private life anymore; that's gone out the door," said Tisdale, but she has not let that stop her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In "Aliens in the Attic," Tisdale sheds her Sharpay image to portray a teen named Bethany, who joins other kids to battle aliens that land on the roof of her family's summer home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tisdale calls Bethany a "typical 17-year-old teen," whereas Sharpay tended toward being "very dramatic and very much a caricature." And Tisdale said getting away from "HSM" helps show her versatility as an actress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People know me as Sharpay, so playing a different character like Bethany is a great departure, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEXT GENERATION WITHERSPOON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Tisdale's past is one reason "Aliens in the Attic" producer, Barry Josephson, wanted her onboard. "She brings the female audience to the movie," he said. "The other advantage is that she's really, really funny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josephson, whose credits include the movie "Enchanted" and the TV show "Bones," calls Tisdale a "new generation Reese Witherspoon or Jennifer Aniston" because of her instinct for comedy. Yet he feels she can go beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Tisdale is making further inroads in TV as the voice of the character Candace on Disney Channel's animated "Phineas  Ferb," and she will appear in an upcoming episode of ABC's "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition," helping host Ty Pennington build a home for a needy family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tisdale and her company, Blondie Girl Productions, are developing several TV projects, including a dating reality show she says the E! Network has considered launching. A pilot episode was already shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't say much about it because it's not yet put together for the channel, but I can say that it's not in my age range. It's older - a little bit of 'Sex and the City.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tisdale said she is looking for follow-up movie projects to "Aliens in the Attic," and she would "love to do more comedies or even romantic comedies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josephson noted that her other talent, singing, will likely come in very handy in the future, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ashley can do a biopic like Jennifer Lopez did with 'Selena' or take on a Streisand-type role. With her music and acting abilities, Ashley is very unique."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bob Tourtellotte and Alex Dobuzinskis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as investors worried that China might be ready to hit the brakes on lending, a move that could curb demand and hinder the global economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about China hurt commodity prices and hit shares in the energy and raw materials sectors, while a steep drop in U.S. durable goods orders in June fed fears of more economic weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil futures fell $3.88, or 5.8 percent, to settle at $63.35 per barrel after U.S. government data showed a surprisingly large increase in crude inventories last week. Shares of energy companies also slid, with Chevron Corp (CVX.N) down 1.8 percent at $67.12. The SP energy index .GSPE dropped 2.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China has been a big driver of part of the global recovery. Their stimulus is direct and quick," said Bobby Harrington, managing director of trading for UBS in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slower growth in China's economy "could limit upside and create downward momentum" in the U.S. stock market, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's two biggest state-owned commercial banks have put a lid on their 2009 lending targets, according to domestic media reports, a move that will significantly slow overall Chinese credit growth in the year's second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC sank 5 percent on Wednesday -- its biggest daily decline in eight months, but it is still up about 80 percent for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further weighing down stocks, yields of shorter-dated U.S. Treasuries briefly hit five-week highs after the week's second poor auction, increasing concern of a possible spike in borrowing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 26 points, or 0.29 percent, to close at 9,070.72. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell 4.47 points, or 0.46 percent, to 975.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC lost 7.75 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,967.76.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the three major U.S. stock indexes gained 11 percent in the previous two weeks as upbeat corporate earnings gave a second wind to a rally that drove the SP 500 up 40 percent from a 12-year closing low hit in early March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VISA FALLS LATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the closing bell, Visa Inc (V.N) reported&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;better-than-expected quarterly earnings after the closing bell. But its stock fell 1.2 percent, or 78 cents, to $66. During the regular session, Visa's stock rose 48 cents, or 0.7 percent, to close at $66.78 on the New York Stock Exchange ahead of the earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wednesday's regular session, the SP 500's only positive sectors were telecommunication services, healthcare and consumer staples, the ones seen as able to better weather economic downturns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After the big run-up, people get a bit more defensive," UBS's Harrington said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commerce Department said June U.S. durable goods orders fell 2.5 percent, the largest drop since January, after rising by a downwardly revised 1.3 percent in May. Durable goods are manufactured goods such as washing machines, refrigerators and cars, intended to last three years or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CATERPILLAR SLIPS, YAHOO SINKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural resources stocks tracked commodity prices down, with miner Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc (FCX.N) down 5.2 percent at $55.51. The SP materials index .GSPM fell 2.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), a maker of bulldozers and excavators, shed 2.5 percent to $41.83 and was a top drag on the Dow industrials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the Nasdaq's major decliners, Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) shares tumbled after the Internet media company announced an advertising deal with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's stock plunged 12.1 percent to $15.14 as some investors were disappointed by the deal's scope. In contrast, Microsoft shares rose 1.4 percent to $23.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Google Inc (GOOG.O), a direct competitor of the new partnership, fell 0.8 percent to $436.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In earnings-related news, shares of Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N) sank 11.8 percent to $4.05 after the No. 3 U.S. cellphone service posted a wider quarterly loss than it did a year ago and revenue fell 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume was light on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 1.25 billion shares changed hands, less than last year's estimated daily average of 1.49 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 2.11 billion shares traded, less than last year's daily average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a ratio of about 3 to 2. On the Nasdaq, eight stocks fell for every five that rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

(CVX.N) down 1.8 percent at $67.12. The SP energy index
.GSPE dropped 2.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "China has been a big driver of part of the global
recovery. Their stimulus is direct and quick," said Bobby
Harrington, managing director of trading for UBS in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slower growth in China's economy "could limit upside and
create downward momentum" in the U.S. stock market, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's two biggest state-owned commercial banks have put
a lid on their 2009 lending targets, according to domestic
media reports, a move that will significantly slow overall
Chinese credit growth in the year's second half.
[ID:nPEK278491].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC sank 5 percent on
Wednesday -- its biggest daily decline in eight months, but it
is still up about 80 percent for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further weighing down stocks, yields of shorter-dated U.S.
Treasuries briefly hit five-week highs after the week's second
poor auction, increasing concern of a possible spike in
borrowing costs. [ID:nN29275145].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 26 points,
or 0.29 percent, to close at 9,070.72. The Standard  Poor's

The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC lost 7.75 points, or 0.39
percent, to 1,967.76.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each of the three major U.S. stock indexes gained 11
percent in the previous two weeks as upbeat corporate earnings
gave a second wind to a rally that drove the SP 500 up 40
percent from a 12-year closing low hit in early March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VISA FALLS LATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the closing bell, Visa Inc (V.N) reported
 better-than-expected quarterly earnings after the closing
bell. But its stock fell 1.2 percent, or 78 cents, to $66.
During the regular session, Visa's stock rose 48 cents, or 0.7
percent, to close at $66.78 on the New York Stock Exchange
ahead of the earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Wednesday's regular session, the SP 500's only
positive sectors were telecommunication services, healthcare
and consumer staples, the ones seen as able to better weather
economic downturns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After the big run-up, people get a bit more defensive,"
UBS's Harrington said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commerce Department said June U.S. durable goods
orders fell 2.5 percent, the largest drop since January, after
rising by a downwardly revised 1.3 percent in May.

with miner Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc (FCX.N) down 5.2
percent at $55.51. The SP materials index .GSPM fell 2.1
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), a maker of bulldozers and
excavators, shed 2.5 percent to $41.83 and was a top drag on
the Dow industrials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the Nasdaq's major decliners, Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O)
shares tumbled after the Internet media company announced an
advertising deal with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo's stock plunged 12.1 percent to $15.14 as some
investors were disappointed by the deal's scope.
[ID:nN29216653] In contrast, Microsoft shares rose 1.4 percent
to $23.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Google Inc (GOOG.O), a direct competitor of the
new partnership, fell 0.8 percent to $436.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In earnings-related news, shares of Sprint Nextel Corp
(S.N) sank 11.8 percent to $4.05 after the No. 3 U.S.
cellphone service posted a wider quarterly loss than it did a
year ago and revenue fell 10 percent. [ID:nN29312040]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volume was light on the New York Stock Exchange, where
about 1.25 billion shares changed hands, less than last year's
estimated daily average of 1.49 billion. On the Nasdaq, about
2.11 billion shares traded, less than last year's daily
average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a ratio of
about 3 to 2. On the Nasdaq, eight stocks fell for every five
that rose.

&lt;p&gt;Adobe stepped forward yesterday to acknowledge that it's the first major third-party vendor to have used Microsoft's flawed development code in its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to multiple security advisories posted to its site on Tuesday, the Windows versions of Adobe's Flash Player and Shockwave Player harbor vulnerabilities because Adobe used a buggy Microsoft code "library" during their development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no surprise that Flash Player is vulnerable to attack. Three weeks ago a pair of German researchers reported finding numerous third-party applications that contain the flawed library code, and named Flash as an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe patched Shockwave Player yesterday, and will follow that tomorrow with a previously-scheduled update for the far-more-popular Flash Player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We evaluated the impact of the vulnerable versions of the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) on the Adobe product portfolio [and] determined that Flash Player and Shockwave Player are the two products that leverage vulnerable versions of ATL," said Wendy Poland, of Adobe's security team in an company blog entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Microsoft confirmed that the Active Template Library (ATL), a code library included with Visual Studio, contained multiple vulnerabilities, at least one harking back to early 2008. Although Microsoft patched Visual Studio to eliminate the bugs in ATL, those updates don't automatically fix software developed using the flawed library. Instead, vendors, including Microsoft, must use the patched Visual Studio to recompile their code, then distribute the new, secure software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what Adobe did yesterday for Shockwave. In a security bulletin issued Tuesday, Adobe updated Shockwave Player to Version 11.5.1.601, noting that the patch fixed a critical vulnerability that could be used to hijack a Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flash Player will get the same treatment Thursday, Adobe promised. "Adobe Flash Player 9.0.159.0 and 10.0.22.87, and earlier 9.x and 10.x versions installed on Windows operating systems for use with Internet Explorer leverage a vulnerable version of ATL," read an advisory posted yesterday. "We are in the process of developing a fix for the issue, and expect to provide an update for Flash Player v9 and v10 for Windows by July 30, 2009," Adobe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Adobe promised to patch Flash Player by tomorrow to address another bug that has been exploited in large numbers by criminals. According to Danish bug tracking firm Secunia, more than 92% of all Windows users are vulnerable to the current Flash Player attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Adobe software, including the popular Reader PDF viewer -- which will also be updated to close the same hole that has led to large-scale attacks -- does not contain the flawed ATL code, Poland said. The Adobe Reader plug-in for Internet Explorer is ATL-bug-free, she said, and although the flaws are baked into the Flash Player browser plug-in, only IE users are vulnerable. "People using Flash Player within the Firefox browser -- as well as all other Windows-based browsers that aren't Internet Explorer -- are not vulnerable," she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the three bugs in ATL is rooted in a simple programming mistake: According to both Microsoft and outside researchers, the ATL function called "ATL::CComVariant::ReadFromStream" contains a single extraneous "" character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until a patch for Flash is available, Adobe urged customers to "consider" installing Microsoft's MS09-034 update, which that company delivered Tuesday via Windows Update. Included in that IE update are new defensive measures that are supposed to detect and block ActiveX controls, like Flash Player and Shockwave Player, that were created using the buggy ATL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe will post links to the patched Flash Player on its security site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

 (Adds fund manager quote, other details, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexei Oreskovic and Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE, July 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) have launched a 10-year Web
search deal to challenge market leader Google but stopped short
of combining other advertising businesses or suggesting any
deeper ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The long-expected deal means Microsoft's new Bing search
engine will be combined with Yahoo's experience attracting
advertisers in the first serious threat to Google Inc  (GOOG.O)
 -- if the companies get regulatory approval and can make the
partnership work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares fell 12 percent as some investors were
disappointed by the limited scope of the deal, which did not
include up-front payments for Yahoo. Some investors had
expected up to $3 billion up-front, according to a Bernstein
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would have preferred more money," said Ryan Jacob, chief
investment officer of Jacob Asset Management, pointing to the
lack of an upfront payment, as well as revenue-sharing and
cost-savings terms that were not as high as he expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are risks on both sides. Big deals like this tend
not to work out. It's a long-term deal that's going to take a
long time to implement," said Jacob, whose $40 million fund
holds some Yahoo shares. "It's better than no deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares closed up 1.4 percent, while Google shares
fell 0.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo estimated the deal would boost its annual operating
income by about $500 million and yield capital expenditure
savings of $200 million. Yahoo also expects the deal to boost
annual operating cash flow by about $275 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANTITRUST OBSTACLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the deal announced on Wednesday, Microsoft's Bing
search engine will power search queries on Yahoo's sites.
Yahoo's sales force will be responsible for selling premium
search ads to big buyers for both companies [ID:nN29285812].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The partnership poses only a theoretical challenge to
Google at present. It could take two-and-a-half years to get
approval and be fully implemented, according to Yahoo Chief
Executive Carol Bartz, which would mean the partnership would
not be fully effective until early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and Yahoo still face antitrust and privacy
issues. Google dropped a planned search partnership with Yahoo
last year under pressure from the U.S. Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But experts said the deal would likely get the go-ahead
after examination by Obama administration antitrust officials
since it would create a stronger rival to market leader Google
[ID:nN29273592].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google said only that it was "interested" in the deal
[ID:nN29525532], while the chairman of the U.S. Senate
antitrust panel said it warrants "careful scrutiny."
[ID:nN29263494]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and Yahoo expected the deal to be "closely
reviewed" by regulators, but they were "hopeful" it could close
in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal concludes a lengthy, and at times contentious,
dance between the two companies. They have been in on-again,
off-again talks since Yahoo rebuffed Microsoft's $47.5 billion
takeover bid last year [ID:nN29273917].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer clashed last year with former
Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, who was strongly opposed to an all-out
acquisition. Relations between the two companies improved under
new Yahoo CEO Bartz, who took the reins in January and started
to shake up Yahoo's management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer and Bartz met "three or four times" over the past
six months as they hammered out a deal, according to Ballmer
[ID:nN29262353].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW THE DEAL WORKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Bartz had previously said any deal would require a
partner with "boatloads of money," she said on Wednesday the
agreement provided "boatloads of value," adding the revenue-
share agreement in the Microsoft deal was more valuable to
Yahoo than a one-time payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Having a big up-front cash payment doesn't really help us
from an operating standpoint," Bartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's AdCenter technology will serve the standard
sponsored links that appear alongside search results. Microsoft
will pay Yahoo an initial rate of 88 percent of search revenue
generated on Yahoo sites in the first five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That means Yahoo can concentrate on selling ads on its
websites, while still generating revenue from search ads
without the expense of maintaining its own search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bartz said the deal will result in "redundancies" in
Yahoo's staff, although she declined to be specific. She
stressed any changes would not occur until after full
implementation of the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to comScore, Google has a 65 percent share of the
U.S. search market, compared with Yahoo's 19.6 percent and
Microsoft's 8.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft will be able to report a greater share in terms
of search ... And Yahoo doesn't have to spend any more money on
search," said Barry Diller, CEO of IAC/InterActiveCorp
(IACI.O), which owns rival search engine Ask.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares closed down $2.08 at $15.14 on Nasdaq, while
Microsoft closed up 33 cents at $23.80 and Google shares closed
down $3.61 at $436.24.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. futures market regulator would strip liquidity needed to make the market run efficiently if it failed to allow certain traders to exceed position limits, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe that eliminating or limiting swap dealer hedge exemptions not only will not address the 'swap loophole' but actually will have several negative consequences," said Donald Casturo, managing director, said in prepared remarks before the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swaps are private, usually one on one, counter-party transactions tailored to the need of the buyer and seller. They have grown in popularity as a way to avoid big ticket margin calls on futures exchanges while still obtaining a hedge for bank financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Swap dealers play an important role in providing liquidity, price discovery and customized risk management products to end-users on favorable credit terms," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, a major swaps dealer, was among those who will deliver remarks on the second day of CFTC hearings into whether to set position limits in energy markets and if it should allow some traders to exceed those limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC has vowed to clampdown on excessive speculation in energy and commodity trading, especially in oil which soared to $147 a year ago. Oil and other commodity prices, while volatile, have largely climbed down from last year's highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hearing "seems to me to be a euphemism for what we can do to make sure that crude doesn't trade over $140 again," said Henry Jarecki, chairman of Gresham Investment Management. "Oil prices were indeed remarkably high last year. But, such high prices were also found in steel, coal, and cobalt, and they don't trade on the futures markets at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminating exemptions for swap dealers could drive more traders to outside futures exchanges and cause the market to splinter, spreading exposure among more swap dealers and other financial intermediaries, Casturo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead the CFTC should be careful to impose position limits that are "low enough to prevent excessive speculation while still being high enough so as not to restrict the level of speculation that is necessary to ensure a balance between commercial and speculative interests," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect against market manipulation, the CFTC sets limits on the amount of contracts each investor can hold in some agricultural commodities. But the futures exchanges set limits for energy products such as oil futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first day of hearings on Tuesday, CFTC chairman Gary Gensler said 70 parties exceeded accountability levels on the four major energy contracts during the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to toughen oversight marks a turnaround for the CFTC, whose hands-off approach toward regulation drew criticism last year when commodity prices rocketed. With a number of anti-speculation bills pending in Congress, the CFTC's actions have been praised by some lawmakers, especially Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Russell Blinch)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds financial details, CEO comment, outlook, byline, and
updates stock price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Juan Lagorio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) reported
better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday, as the
world's largest credit card network cut expenses and
credit-strapped consumers used their debit cards more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income rose 73 percent to $729 million, or 97 cents per
diluted class A share, for the third quarter ended June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On an adjusted basis, reflecting a normalized tax rate,
restructuring and purchase amortizations, quarterly net income
rose percent to $744 million, or 98 cents per diluted class A
common share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding the impact from the sale of the company's stake
in VisaNet do Brasil, adjusted quarterly net income was $507
million, or 67 cents per share. On that basis, analysts
expected earnings of 64 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net operating revenue rose 2 percent to $1.6 billion, while
adjusted operating expenses fell 9 percent to $804 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total processed transactions -- which represent
transactions processed by VisaNet -- increased 8 percent to
10.3 billion, but payments volume fell 5 percent for the
quarter ended March 31, which translates to revenue in the
following quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As we look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2009
year and beyond, we will remain focused on leveraging our
inherent operating scale, maintaining strong financial
performance and expense control," Chief Executive Joseph
Saunders said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company adjusted its estimate of capital expenses for
2009 to around $300 million from a range of $300 million to
$350 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa is partially insulated from the credit crisis because
it processes transactions rather than lends funds. However, the
company has seen a slowdown in the growth of revenue and
transaction volumes as battered consumers used their credit
cards less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa also said it created a joint venture with U.S. Bancorp
(USB.N) called Syncada to provide network services to
corporations and governments to process and track invoices, and
make and receive payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The credit card network made an unspecified capital
investment in Syncada, while U.S. Bancorp contributed with the
technology platform and personnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa reiterated its forecast of annual net revenue growth
of high single digits in 2009 and at the lower end of the 11 to
15 percent range in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also affirmed its annual adjusted diluted class
A common stock earnings per share will grow over 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's shares were down 1.4 percent at $65.85 in
after-hours trade. The stock is up 30 percent in 2009.

&lt;p&gt; * Had increased dividend in 2nd quarter for past 4 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Crude oil prices have improved in past quarter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, July 29 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
increased its dividend by 3 cents per share to 68 cents for the
third quarter -- three months after its shareholders had come
to expect an increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, the U.S. oil company left its second-quarter
dividend unchanged, after making its annual payout in that
quarter for the previous four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company did not indicate why the increase came in the

dividend policy and its quarterly decision is based on factors
that include "balancing cash flow, investment needs and the
future financial strength of the corporation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy prices could have played some part in the decision,
since crude oil futures were trading around $50 per barrel for
much of April, having been in the $30 range in February, but
have since traded above $60 for much of the past two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet due to a sharp drop in crude futures and the sector on
Wednesday, Chevron shares fell 1.8 percent to $67.12, even
though the dividend increase gave the stock a small nudge
higher before the close of trading.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Lilly`s MS Candidate Disappoints

Results from the MAESTRO-I study, that was conducted in patients with secondary
progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), showed that Eli Lilly`s (NYSE: LLY)
dirucotide failed to show any statistically significant difference on the
secondary endpoints. Dirucotide was found to be generally well tolerated with no
unexpected safety or tolerability issues. Results from this study will be
presented later this year at a medical conference. 

Following the announcement of these disappointing results, Lilly and BioMS
announced that they will be discontinuing other studies which were being
conducted with dirucotide. Data from these studies will be reviewed by the
companies before moving on to the next stage of development. 

We note that earlier this year, dirucotide failed to meet its primary endpoint
in a phase II study that was being conducted in relapsing remitting multiple
sclerosis (RRMS). 

Ongoing studies which will be discontinued include MAESTRO-02, an open-label
follow-on study to MAESTRO-01, and MAESTRO-03, a phase III trial that was being
conducted in the U.S. to evaluate the efficacy of dirucotide for the treatment
of SPMS. 

Multiple sclerosis is chronic, progressive, often disabling disease in which the
body's immune response attacks a person's central nervous system (brain and
spinal cord), leading to demyelination. The companies estimate that MS affects
as many as 2.5 million people worldwide, including approximately 400,000 in the
U.S. Approximately 30-40% of all MS patients have the secondary progressive form
of the disease. 

Current treatments include Biogen Idec (Nasdaq: BIIB)/Elan`s (NYSE: ELN)
Tysabri, Biogen`s Avonex, Teva`s (Nasdaq: TEVA) Copaxone, and Pfizer (NYSE:
PFE)/Serono`s Rebif.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO &amp; MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and U.S. Bank, the lead bank of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB),
today announced the creation of Syncada - a joint venture that provides a
business-to-business (B2B) network for corporations and governments to process
and track invoices, make and receive payments around the world, and have
payables or receivables financed through local and global financial
institutions. 

Syncada is unlike any other network in that it combines Visa`s proven experience
in delivering commercial payment services to financial institutions and managing
a multi-bank network, with U.S. Bank`s PowerTrack, an automated B2B e-invoicing,
payment processing and trade finance network. The venture allows financial
institutions of all sizes to offer their commercial clients standardized B2B
invoice processing, financing and payment services across a variety of payment
types and local currencies. Financial institutions can also build transaction
and credit-based treasury management business by offering the network`s services
to buyer and supplier clients. 

Syncada extends the vision of both Visa and U.S. Bank to provide companies and
governments a more efficient way to pay and be paid by replacing inefficient,
paper-based B2B processes with an integrated, fully electronic financial supply
chain platform. 

Participants in Syncada`s network of buyers and suppliers can benefit from:

* Lower costs from the elimination of expensive paper processes 
* Reduced billing and payment errors 
* A more accurate accounting of spending by category 
* Improved management of working capital and global cash needs 
* Access to financing through a global network of financial institutions as new
bank participants join 
* Seamless integration with a proven network using patented technology

Syncada has begun operations and initially serves U.S. Bank and its legacy
client base from the PowerTrack network, which serves hundreds of customers,
interacts with thousands of suppliers, and processed over $18 billion in
invoices in 2008. U.S. Bank will continue to work with its customers
uninterrupted through the Syncada network. 

"Syncada complements Visa`s core payments business by expanding our capabilities
in B2B supply chain management," said Joseph W. Saunders, Chairman and CEO of
Visa Inc. "By investing in this leading platform, we can offer Visa`s financial
institution clients around the world access to Syncada`s services, backed by a
comprehensive sales and support infrastructure that will help extend the reach
and capabilities of Visa`s commercial product suite." 

"U.S. Bank`s stature in the payments business was built by decades of investment
to create a powerful and efficient payment service for corporations and
government institutions. PowerTrack has been key to our success in payments, and
in attracting new commercial banking clients," said Richard K. Davis, Chairman,
President and CEO of U.S. Bancorp. "Taking what we built in PowerTrack,
combining it with Visa`s deep experience in building a multi-bank network and
transforming it into Syncada will enable the network to grow by expanding the
offering to new partners around the globe. We`re proud to be an investor in
Syncada, to be its first customer, and to continue to serve our U.S. Bank
clients through the new entity." 

As part of the joint venture, Visa has made a capital investment in Syncada and
will provide its experience in building and managing a multi-bank network, as
well as marketing, sales and risk management support. U.S. Bank contributed
assets - including its technology platform and certain personnel - and will
provide expertise in automating general payables/receivables spend, in addition
to focused expertise in multiple spend categories, including freight, utility,
telecom and global trade payments. 

Syncada will be headquartered in Minneapolis with operations in Chicago,
Memphis, Toronto, Mumbai and Brussels. Syncada`s day-to-day operations are led
by its independent management team.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft's 10-year Internet search deal with Yahoo will get a hard look from Obama administration antitrust enforcers but will probably squeak through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the partnership knocks the number of competing search engines down to two, from three, antitrust experts said this might have happened anyway. The partners say they will join to create a stronger competitor to Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question is: is it OK? Is two enough?" said antitrust attorney John Briggs of Axinn, Veltrop and Harkrider LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this deal would be really easy to get through in the Bush administration. They wouldn't even look twice at it," said Briggs. "This administration is going to look twice at it, and probably in the end let it through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Bing search engine will power search queries on Yahoo's sites. The companies said they expected the deal to be "closely reviewed" by regulators, but were hopeful it would close in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has 65 percent of the search market, versus Yahoo, with 29.6 percent, and Microsoft's 8.4 percent, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without this deal, I think it would be really unlikely that you'd have a market with three robust search providers in 10 years," said Beau Buffier, an attorney with Shearman  Sterling LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Herb Kohl, whose subcommittee oversees the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said the panel was concerned that advertisers would face higher rates and that there might be less innovation because of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal between Yahoo and Microsoft -- industry giants and direct competitors in Internet advertising and search markets -- warrants our careful scrutiny," he said in a statement. "The implications of this proposed joint agreement will be closely reviewed by my subcommittee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Evan Stewart, an antitrust expert with Zuckerman Spaeder, said the deal creates a stronger competitor to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is good for the competitive marketplace," said Stewart. "It will be easier to get access to this advertising space at presumably more competitive rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The length of the deal means that regulators will likely view it almost as a merger, said Richard Brosnick of law firm Butzel Long. "In Internet time, that might as well be 100 years. A 10-year exclusive license might as well be an acquisition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is expected to be watching the deal closely. It dropped its own advertising deal with Yahoo last year under pressure from the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and advertisers had lobbied the department hard to stop Google from gaining further market power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, so far, is saying little publicly about the Microsoft-Yahoo deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There has traditionally been a lot of competition online, and our experience is that competition brings about great things for users," said Google spokesman Adam Kovacevich in an emailed statement. "We're interested to learn more about the deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-Yahoo deal was inevitable following Yahoo's rejection of a Microsoft takeover, the collapse of the Google-Yahoo deal and upheaval in Yahoo's executive suites, said Stewart, the attorney with Zuckerman Spaeder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that the new management is up and running, she (Carol Bartz) is revisiting the basic strategic wisdom of entering into a strategic partnership with Microsoft," he said. "This is like the directors cut. This is a similar movie but with different scenes added or changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) inked a 10-year Web search deal to challenge market leader Google Inc (GOOG.O) but stopped short of combining their display advertising businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-expected deal effectively means Microsoft's new Bing search engine will be combined with Yahoo's experience attracting advertisers to pose the first serious threat to Google, if the companies get regulatory approval and can make the partnership work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares fell 11 percent as some investors were disappointed by the limited scope of the deal, which did not include upfront payments for Yahoo, which could have been $1.5 billion or more, according to a Sanford Bernstein research report last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft will be able to report a greater share in terms of search... And Yahoo doesn't have to spend any more money on search," said Barry Diller, chief executive of IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI.O), which owns rival search engine Ask.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft were flat, while Google shares fell 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo still face antitrust and privacy issues and likely opposition from Google, which dropped its plans for an advertising partnership with Yahoo last year under pressure from the U.S. Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies said they expect the deal to be "closely reviewed" by regulators, but were "hopeful" it can close in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said on Wednesday only that it was "interested" in the Microsoft/Yahoo partnership, while the chairman of the U.S. Senate antitrust panel said the deal warrants "careful scrutiny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal culminates a lengthy, and at times contentious, dance between the two companies. They have been in on-and-off-again talks on a search partnership since Yahoo rebuffed Microsoft's $47.5 billion takeover bid last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer clashed last year with former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, who was strongly opposed to an all-out acquisition. Relations between the two companies improved under new Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz, who took the reins in January and started to shake up Yahoo's top management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer and Bartz met "three or four times" over the past six months as they hammered out a deal, according to Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW THE DEAL WORKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal announced on Wednesday, Microsoft's Bing search engine will power search queries on Yahoo's sites. Yahoo's sales force will be responsible for selling premium advertising based on search terms for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's AdCenter technology will serve the standard sponsored links that appear alongside search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Yahoo CEO Bartz had previously said that any deal would require a partner with "boatloads of money," she said on Wednesday that the agreement provided "boatloads of value", saying the revenue share agreement in the Microsoft deal was more valuable to Yahoo than a one-time payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having a big up-front cash payment doesn't really help us from an operating standpoint," Bartz said in a conference call with Microsoft CEO Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will compensate Yahoo through a revenue-sharing agreement that pays Yahoo at an initial rate of 88 percent of search revenue generated on Yahoo sites in the first five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each company will maintain its own separate display advertising business and sales force, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said it will be tough for the two companies to make a significant dent in Google's dominance in search, but it was a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to comScore, Google has a 65 percent share of the U.S. search market, compared to Yahoo's 19.6 percent and Microsoft's 8.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, it's a big positive for two companies that have been struggling to keep up with Google. This consolidates their resources and allows them to make a more concerted push as the No. 2 entity," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross Sandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo estimated the deal will boost its annual operating income by about $500 million and yield capital expenditure savings of $200 million. Yahoo also expects the deal to boost annual operating cash flow by about $275 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo reported income from operations of $13 million in 2008, hurt by $487.5 million in goodwill impairment charge and $107 million in restructuring charges. In 2007, operating income was $695 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's Bartz said that the deal will result in "redundancies" in Yahoo's staff, though she declined to be specific. She stressed that any changes would not occur until after approval by antitrust authorities in the U.S. and Europe and full implementation of the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo were down $1.89 at $15.33 on Nasdaq, while shares of Microsoft were flat at $23.47. Google shares were down $5.13 at $434.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tiffany Wu, Paul Thomasch, Robert MacMillan and Diane Bartz; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) has been a popular punching bag among put players
today, after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock and removed it from its Americas
Buy list. At midday, the financial issue has seen more than 36,000 puts change
hands, nearly six times its average intraday volume of fewer than 6,400
contracts. 

Roughly half of that activity has come courtesy of long-term traders, as the
stock's January 2011 17.50 put has seen 17,500 contracts traded on open interest
of fewer than 2,500 contracts. Elsewhere, the security's August 30 put has seen
roughly 9,100 contracts cross the tape, while the August 26 put has seen
intraday volume of almost 4,700 contracts. The at-the-money 26 strike is already
home to peak put open interest in the front-month series, with about 16,400
contracts in residence.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Three former JPMorgan Chase 
Co (JPM.N) bankers have launched a restructuring firm, CoveView
Advisors, to help troubled companies as bankruptcies soar amid
the global recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The trio, with more than 20 years experience each, said
that CoveView will advise distressed companies in a smaller,
more focused setting than a bank where restructuring services
are a minor business. CoveView also plans to advise creditor
groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Stamford, Connecticut-based firm's three managing
partners are joined by six senior professionals. The group has
experience across complex finance, private equity, principal
investing and restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We all have restructuring experience but we have all come
at it from a slightly different perspective," said Douglas
Traver, a managing partner who was most recently co-head of
JPMorgan's syndicated and leveraged finance group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CoveView plans to limit its project load to focus closely
on each situation, the managing partners explained in an
interview on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other two managing partners are Daniel Tredwell, who
left JPMorgan 10 years ago to found leveraged buyout firm
Heartland Industrial Partners, and Thomas Canning, previously a
managing director in the restructuring group at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CoveView joins a growing trend of start-up advisory groups
launching restructuring businesses as the global recession
takes a toll on U.S. companies' balance sheets and earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bankruptcy and restructuring activity has soared in the
first half of 2009. Information exchange company IntraLinks
said on Monday it saw overall bankruptcy and restructuring
activity increase 329 percent in the first half of 2009
compared to the same period a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Richard Chang)

On Tuesday, July 28, Fine Arts Chamber Players and Tulane University student
Tobin Fulton were honored during an awards ceremony and dinner to mark the
conclusion of the 19th year of the ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program.
Along with receiving their awards for Agency of the Year and Intern of the Year,

their accomplishments. 

"It is always a pleasure to honor the deserving recipients of the Agency of the
Year and Intern of the Year awards. Fine Arts Chamber Players and Tobin Fulton
represent the culmination of a summer of hard work and passion, and we are proud

experience.

organization and had gone above and beyond his internship duties, leaving a

this fall.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The following is a timeline of key events in Microsoft Corp's pursuit of Yahoo Inc, stretching back more than two years, after the Web pioneer's financial results began weakening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early 2006 - Yahoo begins to report a string of weak quarterly results, reflecting competitive missteps by the company, market share gains by rival Google Inc, changes in the online advertising landscape and weakening spending in some ad segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late 2006/early 2007 - Microsoft and Yahoo begin preliminary talks on various partnerships, including a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February - Yahoo, under the leadership of CEO Terry Semel, tells Microsoft it is not the right time to discuss a takeover, as the Yahoo board sees great potential in its new advertising technology and by making internal organizational changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 12 - A strong minority of Yahoo shareholders challenges the company's direction, as Semel comes under fire. Nearly a third of votes cast at the company's annual shareholders' meeting oppose some of Yahoo's directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 18 - Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang takes over as chief executive as Semel steps aside. Semel remains Yahoo chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 31 - Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer makes a $44.6 billion, $31-per-share, cash-and-stock takeover offer to Yahoo's board. Semel resigns as chairman and is replaced by Roy Bostock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 1 - Microsoft makes the offer public. Its shares fall 6.6 percent to $30.45; Yahoo shares rise 48 percent to $28.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 11 - Yahoo rejects the Microsoft offer as too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 3 - After several earlier meetings, Yang meets Ballmer in Seattle. Microsoft verbally raises its offer to $33 a share, or $47.5 billion. Yahoo wants $37 per share, or about $5 billion more. Late in the day, Ballmer calls off the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 15 - Carl Icahn proposes a full dissident board slate for election at Yahoo's annual shareholder meeting in July. Icahn says he now holds a 4.3 percent stake in Yahoo, including 9.9 million shares and 49 million call options. Bostock replies to Icahn that "none of the alternatives we are considering would preclude us from entering into a transaction with Microsoft or any other party."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 12 - Yahoo announces search advertising deal with Google for up to 10 years, and says talks with Microsoft have ended. Yahoo forecast an $800 million annual revenue opportunity from the Google deal, and a $250 million to $450 million boost to cash flow in the first 12 months.

 SAN FRANCISCO, July 29 (Reuters) - The following is a
timeline of key events in Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) pursuit of
Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), stretching back more than two years, after
the Web pioneer's financial results began weakening.

 Early 2006 - Yahoo begins to report a string of weak
quarterly results, reflecting competitive missteps by the
company, market share gains by rival Google Inc (GOOG.O),
changes in the online advertising landscape and weakening
spending in some ad segments.

 Late 2006/early 2007 - Microsoft and Yahoo begin
preliminary talks on various partnerships, including a merger.

 2007

 February - Yahoo, under the leadership of CEO Terry Semel,
tells Microsoft it is not the right time to discuss a takeover,
as the Yahoo board sees great potential in its new advertising
technology and by making internal organizational changes.

 June 12 - A strong minority of Yahoo shareholders
challenges the company's direction, as Semel comes under fire.
Nearly a third of votes cast at the company's annual
shareholders' meeting oppose some of Yahoo's directors.

 June 18 - Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang takes over as chief
executive as Semel steps aside. Semel remains Yahoo chairman.

 2008

 Jan. 31 - Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer makes a $44.6
billion, $31-per-share, cash-and-stock takeover offer to
Yahoo's board. Semel resigns as chairman and is replaced by Roy
Bostock.

 Feb. 1 - Microsoft makes the offer public. Its shares fall
6.6 percent to $30.45; Yahoo shares rise 48 percent to $28.38.

 Feb. 11 - Yahoo rejects the Microsoft offer as too low.

 May 3 - After several earlier meetings, Yang meets Ballmer
in Seattle. Microsoft verbally raises its offer to $33 a share,
or $47.5 billion. Yahoo wants $37 per share, or about $5
billion more. Late in the day, Ballmer calls off the talks.

 May 15 - Carl Icahn proposes a full dissident board slate
for election at Yahoo's annual shareholder meeting in July.
Icahn says he now holds a 4.3 percent stake in Yahoo, including
9.9 million shares and 49 million call options. Bostock replies
to Icahn that "none of the alternatives we are considering
would preclude us from entering into a transaction with
Microsoft or any other party."

 June 12 - Yahoo announces search advertising deal with
Google for up to 10 years, and says talks with Microsoft have
ended. Yahoo forecast an $800 million annual revenue
opportunity from the Google deal, and a $250 million to $450
million boost to cash flow in the first 12 months. U.S.
lawmakers are expected to scrutinize the deal on antitrust
concerns.

 July 14 - Yahoo rejects a "search only" deal jointly
proposed by Microsoft and Icahn that would have entailed $1
billion in upfront fees for Microsoft to take over Yahoo's
search assets, as well as $2.3 billion a year in guaranteed
revenue for five years. Among other reasons for rejecting the
deal, Yahoo disputes the $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion in annual
cost savings projected for Yahoo in the proposal.

 July 21 - Yahoo settles proxy contest with Icahn ahead of
annual shareholder meeting. Icahn and two nominees from his
alternative slate of director nominees will get seats on an
expanded Yahoo board of directors.

 Nov. 5 - Google pulls out of search deal with Yahoo, citing
regulatory objections.

 Nov. 17 - Yahoo says Yang will step down as CEO and return
to Chief Yahoo role once the search for a new chief executive
is completed.

 2009

 Jan. 13 - Yahoo announces that Carol Bartz, the former CEO
of Autodesk Inc ADSK.O , is the new CEO. In her first earnings
conference call with investors two weeks later, Bartz says she
did not join Yahoo to sell the company, but also says
"everything is on the table."

 Feb. 25 - Ballmer tell an analysts' meeting that he hopes
to discuss a possible search partnership with Bartz, comments
he will repeatedly make over the next few months.

 May 27 - Bartz acknowledges that Yahoo has had discussions
with Microsoft about a search partnership, but she says any
deal will require a partner with "boatloads of money."

 May 28 - Microsoft introduces Bing, a revamped version of
its search engine backed by a massive marketing campaign. In
the first month, Microsoft's U.S. search share increases to 8.4
percent from 8 percent, while Yahoo's share falls to 19.6
percent from 20.1 percent. Google's share stays at 65 percent.

 July 29 - Microsoft and Yahoo announce a 10-year search
partnership. [ID:nN29216653] Microsoft technology will power
search on Yahoo sites, as well as the paid search ads that
appear alongside search results. Microsoft will pay Yahoo 88
percent of the revenue generated by search ads on Yahoo sites
for the first five years.

 Yahoo's sales force to sell premium search ads for both
companies, but Yahoo and Microsoft will keep their own sales
teams for online display ads.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The 10-year search deal between Yahoo and Microsoft warrants "careful scrutiny," the chairman of the U.S. Senate antitrust panel said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There has traditionally been a lot of competition online, and our experience is that competition brings about great things for users," said Google spokesman Adam Kovakovich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're interested to learn more about the deal," he said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google made a search ad deal with Yahoo in June 2008 but scrapped it because of objections from the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advertisers had hotly opposed it, fearing Google and Yahoo's dominance of the market could mean higher prices.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc's top executives had been talking about a search advertising partnership for months but only knew they had a deal on Monday, the CEOs of both companies said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies finally announced a 10-year ad partnership to take on Google Inc early on Wednesday, apparently ending a saga that started with Microsoft's failed attempt to buy Yahoo outright, launched in January of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'd been working in earnest at what I would call a second layer of details for at least a month now, but it was Monday before we had a deal," Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer and Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz met face to face "three or four times" over the last six months, said Ballmer, and helped out negotiating teams several times more on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final deal agreement runs to over 100 pages, said Ballmer, the culmination of months of work. Wednesday was the first time either company has discussed the deal openly, after leaving investors and media guessing on the state of talks for several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the partnership, Microsoft's Bing search engine will power search queries on Yahoo's sites while Yahoo's sales force will be responsible for selling premium advertising based on search terms for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's Bartz insisted that did not mean her company was no longer a player in web search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not out of the search business," said Bartz. "But yes, the technology that Yahoo has is being licensed to Microsoft so they can power the search for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz acknowledged there will be redundancies as Microsoft takes control of the search technology side of the business, but said layoffs were too early to quantify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Implementation could well be two-and-a-half years out, depending how long regulatory (approval) takes, so it's much too early to be talking about who is redundant and who they are," said Bartz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nothing can happen between the two companies until we get through regulatory (approval), and then we have to get through the whole implementation process," Bartz added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc have agreed to a 10-year online search and advertising partnership, in an attempt to rival Google Inc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares extended losses in pre-market trade, dropping 6.1 percent to $16.17 after the announcement. Microsoft shares slipped 0.1 percent to $23.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal will boost Yahoo's annual operating income by about $500 million and capital expenditure savings of $200 million, the company said in a joint statement on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARC PADO, U.S. MARKET STRATEGIST, CANTOR FITZGERALD  CO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The major question has been whether Microsoft will buy them (Yahoo) out completely. It has been arbitraged in the market, or priced-in. Those that were looking forward to a takeout, the deal today was rather disappointing. The 10-year pact, it's not a bad thing, it's not as good as what investors expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST WITH RBC CAPITAL MARKETS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Looks like it is a good deal. There are a bunch of different pieces here: There's an 88 percent revenue share in years one through five, that's a positive; There's guaranteeing Yahoo owned and operated revenue per search for the first 18 months, that's a positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The one slight disappointment was there was some expectation of an upfront cash payment, which isn't happening here. But, overall, it's a big positive for two companies that have been struggling to keep up with Google. This consolidates their resources and allows them to make a more concerted push as the No. 2 entity, which is definitely going to be a positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added the Yahoo stock slide is "a knee-jerk reaction" probably based on initial disappointment over the lack of upfront payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, AVALAN PARTNERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(The microsoft-yahoo deal) is probably already priced in the market. I don't see it having a major impact on the averages. We were expecting to point toward a lower opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JEFF LINDSAY, ANALYST, SANFORD BERNSTEIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Looks like a real positive. Looks like it's twice as big as the original Google deal, it's 10 years and probably about double EBITDA the original Google deal. At first estimates, looks like it's about $5 a share for Yahoo. Short term, it looks like it's really in Yahoo's favor. Longer term, it benefits both companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIM BEYERS, SENIOR ANALYST, THE MOTLEY FOOL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You feel like this is something they had to do. ... I mean, independently, they're bit players. Together, they might offer a combination that might be appealing to an advertiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"10 years? wow! ... So Yahoo becomes part of Bing? Yah-Bing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's the necessary deal. My sense of it is, just looking at these bullet points, this isn't something either company really loves because we know Microsoft wanted to buy Yahoo outright. I think Carol Bartz is far too smart for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They both win. Microsoft had to do this. If it wanted to get competitive with Google in search advertising, it had to get scale, and the easiest way to get scale is to get Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I'm reading this directly, Yahoo keeps a large amount of independence. I think it did this deal on its terms. That is something I don't think we would have said about Yahoo a few months ago, so kudos to Carol Bartz. She's making Yahoo a much better player than it was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Angela Moon, Paul Thomasch, Robert MacMillan; Compiled by Edward Tobin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * R. Hewitt Pate worked for U.S. Justice Department&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron faces big political and legal fight in Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 29 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has
hired a new general counsel with extensive Washington D.C.
experience as the U.S. oil company gears up for a politically
charged legal fight over a potential $27 billion liability in
Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said on Wednesday that R. Hewitt Pate, 47, would
serve as vice president and general counsel and report to
Charles James, the current general counsel who became an
executive vice president earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James, who worked with Pate at the U.S. Department of
Justice's antitrust division before joining Chevron in 2002,
said his replacement as Chevron general counsel had a "proven
track record of handling complex legal and policy issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pate has run the global competition practice at Hunton 
Williams in the U.S. capital since 2005, before which he served
as assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's
antitrust division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust,
responsible for energy, transportation and other regulatory
matters from 2001 to 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was in 2001 that Chevron completed its acquisition of
Texaco, which has been sued by 30,000 Ecuadorean plaintiffs who
say the company polluted the jungle where they lived by dumping
billions of gallons of contaminated water over more than two
decades before the company left in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A ruling in the case in Ecuadorean court, which is weighing
a claim for $27 billion in compensation for the environmental
damage, is expected some time this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Political pressure over the case has steadily risen, with
four U.S. senators writing the U.S. trade representative last
month to criticize Chevron's push to cut Ecuador's trade
benefits because of what the company sees as political
interference in the case by Ecuador's President Rafael Correa.
[ID:nN26351269]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pate, who will serve on Chevron's executive committee, will
take up his position at the San Ramon, California-based company
on Aug. 3.

&lt;p&gt;    * Ballmer, Bartz say deal finalized Monday &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * CEOs met 3-4 times over past 6 months - Ballmer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * To early to quantify Yahoo layoffs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Bill Rigby and Alexei Oreskovic &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO, July 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) top executives had been talking about a search advertising partnership for months but only knew they had a deal on Monday, the CEOs of both companies said on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The two companies finally announced a 10-year ad partnership to take on Google Inc (GOOG.O) early on Wednesday, apparently ending a saga that started with Microsoft's failed attempt to buy Yahoo outright, launched in January of last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We'd been working in earnest at what I would call a second layer of details for at least a month now, but it was Monday before we had a deal," Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Ballmer and Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz met face to face "three or four times" over the last six months, said Ballmer, and helped out negotiating teams several times more on the phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The final deal agreement runs to over 100 pages, said Ballmer, the culmination of months of work. Wednesday was the first time either company has discussed the deal openly, after leaving investors and media guessing on the state of talks for several months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Under the partnership, Microsoft's Bing search engine will power search queries on Yahoo's sites while Yahoo's sales force will be responsible for selling premium advertising based on search terms for both companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Yahoo's Bartz insisted that did not mean her company was no longer a player in web search. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We're not out of the search business," said Bartz. "But yes, the technology that Yahoo has is being licensed to Microsoft so they can power the search for us." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bartz acknowledged there will be redundancies as Microsoft takes control of the search technology side of the business, but said layoffs were too early to quantify. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Implementation could well be two-and-a-half years out, depending how long regulatory (approval) takes, so it's much too early to be talking about who is redundant and who they are," said Bartz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Nothing can happen between the two companies until we get through regulatory (approval), and then we have to get through the whole implementation process," Bartz added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;Global Deal Creates Better Choice for Consumers and Advertisers


SUNNYVALE, Calif. &amp; REDMOND, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Yahoo! and Microsoft announced an agreement that will improve the Web search
experience for users and advertisers, and deliver sustained innovation to the
industry. In simple terms, Microsoft will now power Yahoo! search while Yahoo!
will become the exclusive worldwide relationship sales force for both companies`
premium search advertisers. 

For Web users and advertisers, this deal will accelerate the pace and breadth of
innovation by combining both companies` complementary strengths and search
platforms into a market competitor with the scale to fuel sustained development
in search and search advertising. Users will find what they care about faster
and with more personal relevance. Microsoft`s competitive search platforms will
lead to more value for advertisers, better results for Web publishers, and
increased innovation and efficiency across the Internet. 

Under this agreement, Yahoo! will focus on its core business of providing
consumers with great experiences with the world`s favorite online destinations
and Web products. 

"This agreement comes with boatloads of value for Yahoo!, our users, and the
industry, and I believe it establishes the foundation for a new era of Internet
innovation and development," said Yahoo! Chief Executive Officer Carol Bartz.
"Users will continue to experience search as a vital part of their Yahoo!
experiences and will enjoy increased innovation thanks to the scale and
resources this deal provides. Advertisers will also benefit from scale and enjoy
greater ease of use and efficiencies working with a single platform and sales
team for premium advertisers. Finally, this deal will help us increase our
investments in priority areas in winning audience properties, display
advertising capabilities and mobile experiences." 

Providing a viable alternative to advertisers, this deal will combine Yahoo! and
Microsoft search marketplaces so that advertisers no longer have to rely on one
company that dominates more than 70 percent of all search. With the addition of
Yahoo!`s search volume, Microsoft will achieve the size and scale required to
unleash competition and innovation in the market, for consumers as well as
advertisers. 

Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said the agreement will provide
Microsoft`s search engine, Bing, the scale necessary to more effectively
compete, attracting more users and advertisers, which in turn will lead to more
relevant ads and search results. 

"Through this agreement with Yahoo!, we will create more innovation in search,
better value for advertisers and real consumer choice in a market currently
dominated by a single company," said Ballmer. "Success in search requires both
innovation and scale. With our new Bing search platform, we`ve created
breakthrough innovation and features. This agreement with Yahoo! will provide
the scale we need to deliver even more rapid advances in relevancy and
usefulness. Microsoft and Yahoo! know there`s so much more that search could be.
This agreement gives us the scale and resources to create the future of search."


"This deal fits the long-term strategic direction of Yahoo! to remain the
world`s leading online media company and Carol Bartz has the full and unanimous
support of the Yahoo! Board behind this deal," said Roy Bostock, chairman,
Yahoo! Inc. "This is a significant opportunity for us. Microsoft is an industry
innovator in search and it is a great opportunity for us to focus our
investments in other areas critical to our future." 

The key terms of the agreement are as follows:

* The term of the agreement is 10 years; 
* Microsoft will acquire an exclusive 10 year license to Yahoo!`s core search
technologies, and Microsoft will have the ability to integrate Yahoo! search
technologies into its existing Web search platforms; 
* Microsoft`s Bing will be the exclusive algorithmic search and paid search
platform for Yahoo! sites. Yahoo! will continue to use its technology and data
in other areas of its business such as enhancing display advertising technology;

* Yahoo! will become the exclusive worldwide relationship sales force for both
companies` premium search advertisers. Self-serve advertising for both companies
will be fulfilled by Microsoft`s AdCenter platform, and prices for all search
ads will continue to be set by AdCenter`s automated auction process; 
* Each company will maintain its own separate display advertising business and
sales force; 
* Yahoo! will innovate and "own" the user experience on Yahoo! properties,
including the user experience for search, even though it will be powered by
Microsoft technology; 
* Microsoft will compensate Yahoo! through a revenue sharing agreement on
traffic generated on Yahoo!`s network of both owned and operated (O) and
affiliate sites;

* Microsoft will pay traffic acquisition costs (TAC) to Yahoo! at an initial
rate of 88 percent of search revenue generated on Yahoo!`s O sites during the
first five years of the agreement; and 
* Yahoo! will continue to syndicate its existing search affiliate partnerships.

* Microsoft will guarantee Yahoo!`s O revenue per search (RPS) in each country
for the first 18 months following initial implementation in that country; 
* At full implementation (expected to occur within 24 months following
regulatory approval), Yahoo! estimates, based on current levels of revenue and
current operating expenses, that this agreement will provide a benefit to annual
GAAP operating income of approximately $500 million and capital expenditure
savings of approximately $200 million. Yahoo! also estimates that this agreement
will provide a benefit to annual operating cash flow of approximately $275
million; and 
* The agreement protects consumer privacy by limiting the data shared between
the companies to the minimum necessary to operate and improve the combined
search platform, and restricts the use of search data shared between the
companies. The agreement maintains the industry-leading privacy practices that
each company follows today.

The agreement does not cover each company`s Web properties and products, email,
instant messaging, display advertising, or any other aspect of the companies`
businesses. In those areas, the companies will continue to compete vigorously. 

The transaction will be subject to regulatory review. The agreement entered into
today anticipates that the parties will enter into more detailed definitive
agreements prior to closing. Microsoft and Yahoo! expect the agreement to be
closely reviewed by the industry and government regulators, and welcome
questions. The companies are hopeful that closing can occur in early 2010. 

The companies have established a website at http://www.choicevalueinnovation.com
to provide consumers, advertisers and publishers with additional information
about the benefits of the agreement.

1Gross profit impact consists of increased revenue net of Microsoft`s share of
Yahoo!`s search revenue. The increased revenue is attributable to the scale
resulting from the combination of the Yahoo! and Microsoft search marketplaces. 

2Operating expenses impact represents savings from reductions in spending on
Yahoo!`s search technology. 

Note: All estimates represent the projected annual financial impact of the
agreement following its full implementation, which is expected to occur within
24 months of regulatory approval, and are based on Yahoo!`s current levels of
revenues and operating expenses. In addition, all projections exclude
anticipated reinvestment by Yahoo! in its non-search business. The projections
are necessarily based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions which may not
be realized and are inherently subject, in addition to the risks identified in
the forward-looking statement disclaimer, to business, economic, competitive,
industry, regulatory, market and financial uncertainties, many of which are
beyond Yahoo!`s control. There can be no assurance that the assumptions made in
preparing the projected financial impact will prove accurate. Accordingly,
actual results may differ materially from the projected financial impact.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer today announced a partnership with Fudan University to establish a
graduate program in Clinical Data Management and Statistical Programming. This
three year Masters Degree program, a first of its kind in China, is designed to
develop qualified professionals to support clinical research which is rapidly
increasing in China. 

"Pfizer is committed to creating and expanding our partnerships in China," said
Jeff Kindler, chief executive officer of Pfizer. "We believe that making a
commitment to both research and training is the most effective way to foster
development in China`s pharmaceutical industry. The ultimate goal of these
efforts is to improve the lives of Chinese citizens by increasing access to new
and effective medicines." 

The first group of students, who will begin classes in September this year, will
study data management and statistical programming. Future students will also be
trained in biostatistics, clinical sciences, clinical project management and
pharmacovigilence (the monitoring and reporting of adverse effects of
medicines.) 

"This novel industry-academic collaboration features a faculty that includes
Fudan professors and experts from Pfizer`s Global Research and Development
network and offers students the opportunity to work on real live projects from
Pfizer`s drug development portfolio," said Dr Lingshi Tan, general manager of
Pfizer (China) Research and Development Center. "This program will have a major
impact on the life sciences sector in China and demonstrate Pfizer's long-term
and high-quality commitments to the development of China's pharmaceutical
industry, in line with the Chinese government`s drug innovation initiatives." 

This partnership is the latest in a series of initiatives Pfizer has been
undertaking to enhance collaboration in the biotechnology area in China. The
ceremony was attended by representatives from the Ministry of Education, Pudong
New Area of Shanghai Municipality, Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and
Fudan University. 

"This is the beginning of a long term Pfizer-Fudan University joint education
plan to establish a `Pfizer-Fudan Drug Research and Development Education
Center` at Fudan University," said Professor Shaode Qin, Chancellor of Fudan
University. 

Al Gabor, Regional President for Pfizer`s North Asia, India, Pakistan, and
Thailand region said, "This partnership program extends Pfizer`s commitment to
improving health care for Chinese citizens by increasing the capabilities of
China`s health care professionals. Furthermore, the tremendous growth in
biomedical knowledge in Asia over the past few years and the increasingly
sophisticated science infrastructure throughout the region make these programs a
critical part of Pfizer`s R strategy in Asia.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs economists cut
their U.S. federal deficit estimates, concluding that
lower-than-predicted federal deficits will reduce the U.S.
Treasury's financing needs in fiscal 2009 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We have cut our estimates for the federal deficit to
$1.725 trillion for fiscal year 2009 and to $1.4 trillion for
FY 2010," the economists wrote in a research note. Fiscal 2009
began on Oct. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In late March we put these figures at $1.86 trillion and
$1.5 trillion, respectively," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said the main reason for the change was that
federal assistance to the financial markets had been much
smaller than expected, though trends in other outlays and in
revenues were "a bit worse" than anticipated four months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman Sachs economists said because federal
assistance to the financial markets has a dollar-for-dollar
effect on federal borrowing, but only a partial effect on the
budget balance, the impact of the smaller-than-expected federal
assistance to the financial markets on Treasury financing needs
is much larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We now estimate net issuance of marketable debt at $1.9
trillion for FY 2009, down from $2.7 trillion as of late March,
and at $1 trillion for FY 2010, down from about $1.35 trillion
in late March," the Goldman Sachs economists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The current run rate for gross issuance of coupon
securities - more than $2 trillion per year - should provide
more than enough funding of these needs, allowing a net paydown
in bills," the economists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman Sachs economists observed, however, that while
smaller than they previously thought, the size of the expected
federal deficits "are still the largest since World War II by a
wide margin, at an estimated 12.2 percent of GDP this year and
9.7 percent next year."

&lt;p&gt;World`s Premier Pharmaceutical Company Makes its Newest Investment in
Fundamental Research with Shanghai Science Institute
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer today announced a joint initiative with the Shanghai Institutes for
Biological Sciences (SIBS) to support fundamental research in China. As part of
the initiative, Pfizer China will provide US$500,000 each year over three years
to fund health-related fundamental research projects at SIBS and its application
to drug discovery and development programs in the country. This is the latest in
a series of Pfizer initiatives aimed at supporting China as it becomes one of
the leading contributors to healthcare innovation worldwide. 

"This collaboration represents a major commitment by Pfizer to fundamental
research and development in China," said Jeff Kindler, Pfizer`s chief executive
officer. "Our investment is an example of our dedication to leading healthcare
innovation, not only in the last mile of drug development, but from much earlier
stages of exploration into basic healthcare principles. Innovation in these
areas has the potential to truly alter the way we look at healthcare over the
next 20 years." 

Fundamental research, also known as basic research, is generally defined as pure
scientific investigation to gain knowledge and understanding about the physical
world. While this type of research does not necessarily lead to immediate
commercial gain, it has the potential to lead to important new discoveries that
ultimately improve healthcare and help save lives. 

"Our choice of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences as a research partner
demonstrates our high regard for the scientific expertise and capabilities of
SIBS," said Martin Mackay, President, Pfizer Global Research and Development.
"China is increasingly seen as a source for innovative healthcare research, and
we are proud of our ongoing investment in the outstanding science and people
here." Research projects will be selected and developed jointly by Pfizer and
SIBS scientists. 

"Today marks a new milestone in the collaboration between SIBS and Pfizer," said
Jiarui Wu, Vice President of SIBS, "The agreement injects momentum into the
innovation activities at SIBS and Pfizer, and this collaboration will definitely
accelerate the development of new healthcare solutions." 

Pfizer`s China Research and Development Center, a state-of-the-art facility that
provides global drug development support capabilities, research collaborations,
and strategic alliance opportunities to China and the Asian region, is based in
Shanghai. It employs more than 330 staff and is the largest R center for a
multinational pharmaceutical company in China. 

"Strategic alliances such as this one are needed to increase the opportunities
to produce the science, technology and product candidates that lead to new
medicines," said Al Gabor, regional president for Pfizer`s North Asia, India,
Pakistan, and Thailand region. "This collaboration with SIBS is a testament to
Pfizer`s continued commitment to the city of Shanghai, and to China as a whole."

&lt;p&gt;CoveView Advisors Established to Provide Corporate Finance and Restructuring
Advice to Companies in Special Situations
STAMFORD, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Three finance professionals and former J.P. Morgan bankers - Daniel P. Tredwell,
Douglas V. Traver and Thomas M. Canning - announced that they have formed
CoveView Advisors LLC, a new "special situations" advisory firm established to
provide corporate finance and restructuring advice to companies dealing with
operational and financial difficulties. CoveView also intends to advise creditor
groups. 

After taking over leadership of Heartland Industrial Partners, Dan Tredwell
engineered the restructuring of Heartland`s portfolio companies. With 23 years
of private equity and capital markets experience, he has executed over 30
acquisitions, divestitures, and recapitalizations and currently sits on the
boards of four companies in three continents. 

Doug Traver brings 27 years of experience with J.P. Morgan and its predecessor
firms. Most recently, he was Co-Head of J.P. Morgan`s Syndicated and Leveraged
Finance Group where he focused on originating, structuring and underwriting
loans and high yield securities. Before that he was Co-Chairman of the Financial
Sponsor Group, responsible for senior investment banking coverage of large and
mid-size private equity firms. 

Also a 27-year J.P. Morgan veteran, Tom Canning served as a Managing Director in
the Restructuring Group and, before that, Co-Head of European Credit Risk
Management and has extensive experience in capital markets transactions,
including DIP financings, for stressed, distressed and Chapter 11 clients. 

These three CoveView executives will apply their complementary skills in complex
finance, private equity, principal investing and restructuring to advise
CoveView`s clients and help them evaluate and optimize assets, access capital
markets and navigate through all stages of restructuring if needed. 

"It`s great to once again team up with Doug and Tom who each bring complementary
and important skill sets to CoveView," said Dan Tredwell. "The entire team we
have put together have hard-won experience that enables us to expertly address
the issues facing both public and private companies in this challenging
environment. We have the unique ability to provide management expertise,
strategic guidance, and capital markets and restructuring advice to help
companies capitalize on evolving market dynamics and deliver greater returns to
stakeholders." 

"We will deliver our broad experience in capital markets and our complex
situation skill set to clients," said Doug Traver. "We have a team of
professionals that can understand a company`s situation from each stakeholder`s
perspective and can tailor an appropriate solution." 

"We like to get involved early so that we can develop an out-of-court solution
for a client," added Tom Canning. "If bankruptcy is the only answer, we have
vast experience in guiding clients through that process as well." 

CoveView Advisors LLC is headquartered in Stamford, CT. For additional

&lt;p&gt;Continuous Support Offering Provides Certified IT Services Support Experts at a
Fraction of the Cost
SUMMIT, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
In an effort to address the rising demand among businesses for a more
comprehensive, cost-effective IT services support solution, TheAdmins, a
value-added reseller (VAR) providing virtualization, application delivery, data
security, network infrastructure and storage/business continuity services, today
announced the introduction of its Continuous Support Offering (CSO). TheAdmins
CSO is a service level agreement (SLA)-based support service designed to
supplement IT services staff in resolving technology-critical issues with select
Citrix&#174;, Microsoft&#174;, VMware&#174; and Cisco&#174; products. 

Traditionally, companies have purchased IT services support agreements directly
from manufacturers to serve as a lifeline in the event of an emergency. However,
the reality is that many of these agreements serve as a mere insurance policy,
and if unused, result in lost fees - only to be renewed again the following
year. Also, manufacturer support is typically limited to the manufacturing
company`s product line only - resulting in very specific and restricted support.


"More and more these days, we`re hearing first-hand about the challenges our
clients are facing in performing the seemingly thankless task of accomplishing
more with less resources - a particularly strong sentiment among the IT
organizations responsible for supporting their infrastructure and technology
investments," said John Muscara, vice president, sales, product development and
partner relationships for TheAdmins. "Many of our clients are also expressing a
need for telephone and on-site support 24x7x365. With our Continuous Support
Offering, we`re providing clients with a service level agreement that exceeds
the requirements of the business and reduces operating expenses - available to
them anytime." 

Products currently supported through TheAdmins CSO include:

* All Citrix products 
* Microsoft (Active Directory&#174;, Messaging and Windows Server&#174;) 
* VMware Virtual Infrastructure 3 (VI4 support coming soon) 
* Cisco (routing and switching)

Service level agreement response time is as follows:

* One-hour for telephone support 
* Four-hour for on-site coverage for New Jersey, New York City and Philadelphia

Continuous Support Offering Availability and Pricing

TheAdmins CSO is available now to new and existing TheAdmins customers. The cost
of the service is $6,250 annually for 25 support hours, which can be used for
telephone or on-site support seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Upon depletion
of the purchased hours, replenishment options are available. Any time remaining
at the end of 12 months may be used for other TheAdmins IT services, such as
projects, staff supplementation, system management and troubleshooting. 

"If you think about it, direct manufacturer support for per incident-based
agreements is typically $20,000 or more annually and does not normally include
on-site support," said Muscara. "With TheAdmins CSO, clients are gaining access
to our certified experts for technology support across a wide range of products
at a fraction of the cost." 

For additional information on TheAdmins CSO, please contact Michelle Clemente,
TheAdmins, at (908) 665-2270.

&lt;p&gt;Global Deal Creates Better Choice for Consumers and Advertisers


SUNNYVALE, Calif. &amp; REDMOND, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Yahoo! and Microsoft announced an agreement that will improve the Web search
experience for users and advertisers, and deliver sustained innovation to the
industry. In simple terms, Microsoft will now power Yahoo! search while Yahoo!
will become the exclusive worldwide relationship sales force for both companies`
premium search advertisers. 

For Web users and advertisers, this deal will accelerate the pace and breadth of
innovation by combining both companies` complementary strengths and search
platforms into a market competitor with the scale to fuel sustained development
in search and search advertising. Users will find what they care about faster
and with more personal relevance. Microsoft`s competitive search platforms will
lead to more value for advertisers, better results for Web publishers, and
increased innovation and efficiency across the Internet. 

Under this agreement, Yahoo! will focus on its core business of providing
consumers with great experiences with the world`s favorite online destinations
and Web products. 

"This agreement comes with boatloads of value for Yahoo!, our users, and the
industry, and I believe it establishes the foundation for a new era of Internet
innovation and development," said Yahoo! Chief Executive Officer Carol Bartz.
"Users will continue to experience search as a vital part of their Yahoo!
experiences and will enjoy increased innovation thanks to the scale and
resources this deal provides. Advertisers will also benefit from scale and enjoy
greater ease of use and efficiencies working with a single platform and sales
team for premium advertisers. Finally, this deal will help us increase our
investments in priority areas in winning audience properties, display
advertising capabilities and mobile experiences." 

Providing a viable alternative to advertisers, this deal will combine Yahoo! and
Microsoft search marketplaces so that advertisers no longer have to rely on one
company that dominates more than 70 percent of all search. With the addition of
Yahoo!`s search volume, Microsoft will achieve the size and scale required to
unleash competition and innovation in the market, for consumers as well as
advertisers. 

Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said the agreement will provide
Microsoft`s search engine, Bing, the scale necessary to more effectively
compete, attracting more users and advertisers, which in turn will lead to more
relevant ads and search results. 

"Through this agreement with Yahoo!, we will create more innovation in search,
better value for advertisers and real consumer choice in a market currently
dominated by a single company," said Ballmer. "Success in search requires both
innovation and scale. With our new Bing search platform, we`ve created
breakthrough innovation and features. This agreement with Yahoo! will provide
the scale we need to deliver even more rapid advances in relevancy and
usefulness. Microsoft and Yahoo! know there`s so much more that search could be.
This agreement gives us the scale and resources to create the future of search."


"This deal fits the long-term strategic direction of Yahoo! to remain the
world`s leading online media company and Carol Bartz has the full and unanimous
support of the Yahoo! Board behind this deal," said Roy Bostock, chairman,
Yahoo! Inc. "This is a significant opportunity for us. Microsoft is an industry
innovator in search and it is a great opportunity for us to focus our
investments in other areas critical to our future." 

The key terms of the agreement are as follows:

* The term of the agreement is 10 years; 
* Microsoft will acquire an exclusive 10 year license to Yahoo!`s core search
technologies, and Microsoft will have the ability to integrate Yahoo! search
technologies into its existing Web search platforms; 
* Microsoft`s Bing will be the exclusive algorithmic search and paid search
platform for Yahoo! sites. Yahoo! will continue to use its technology and data
in other areas of its business such as enhancing display advertising technology;

* Yahoo! will become the exclusive worldwide relationship sales force for both
companies` premium search advertisers. Self-serve advertising for both companies
will be fulfilled by Microsoft`s AdCenter platform, and prices for all search
ads will continue to be set by AdCenter`s automated auction process; 
* Each company will maintain its own separate display advertising business and
sales force; 
* Yahoo! will innovate and "own" the user experience on Yahoo! properties,
including the user experience for search, even though it will be powered by
Microsoft technology; 
* Microsoft will compensate Yahoo! through a revenue sharing agreement on
traffic generated on Yahoo!`s network of both owned and operated (O) and
affiliate sites;

* Microsoft will pay traffic acquisition costs (TAC) to Yahoo! at an initial
rate of 88 percent of search revenue generated on Yahoo!`s O sites during the
first five years of the agreement; and 
* Yahoo! will continue to syndicate its existing search affiliate partnerships.

* Microsoft will guarantee Yahoo!`s O revenue per search (RPS) in each country
for the first 18 months following initial implementation in that country; 
* At full implementation (expected to occur within 24 months following
regulatory approval), Yahoo! estimates, based on current levels of revenue and
current operating expenses, that this agreement will provide a benefit to annual
GAAP operating income of approximately $500 million and capital expenditure
savings of approximately $200 million. Yahoo! also estimates that this agreement
will provide a benefit to annual operating cash flow of approximately $275
million; and 
* The agreement protects consumer privacy by limiting the data shared between
the companies to the minimum necessary to operate and improve the combined
search platform, and restricts the use of search data shared between the
companies. The agreement maintains the industry-leading privacy practices that
each company follows today.

The agreement does not cover each company`s Web properties and products, email,
instant messaging, display advertising, or any other aspect of the companies`
businesses. In those areas, the companies will continue to compete vigorously. 

The transaction will be subject to regulatory review. The agreement entered into
today anticipates that the parties will enter into more detailed definitive
agreements prior to closing. Microsoft and Yahoo! expect the agreement to be
closely reviewed by the industry and government regulators, and welcome
questions. The companies are hopeful that closing can occur in early 2010. 

The companies have established a website at http://www.choicevalueinnovation.com
to provide consumers, advertisers and publishers with additional information
about the benefits of the agreement.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This release refers to operating cash flow (operating income before
depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation
expense, or OCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable
GAAP measure is income from operations. The estimated annual OCF benefit of $275

from operations of $500 million less approximately $225 million of estimated
annual savings in depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation
expense.

&lt;p&gt;PERTH (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's proposed Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project needs to meet more stringent environmental conditions before it can obtain final approval from the Australian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western Australia environment ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that Chevron needs better protection of the high-value corals adjacent to the project and the flatback turtle population on Barrow Island, a class A nature reserve where Chevron is planning to build its LNG facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the tightened environmental terms are not expected to cause major delays to Chevron and its partners reaching a final investment decision, as Chevron is not required to submit a fresh proposal, said an official from the environment ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the determination complete, we are now looking forward to timely environmental approvals by the state and federal governments," Chevron said in an emailed statement, adding that it expects to make a final investment decision in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environment ministry will now need agreement on the extra terms with other ministers before  final state approval can be granted. The approval of the Federal Environment Minister will also be required, but that is largely considered a formality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been recent media reports Chevron may approve the development of Gorgon by mid-September once it gets all the necessary environmental approvals, while JP Morgan said in a recent report Chevron may sanction the project by late August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amongst the new terms are for Chevron to monitor fauna on the island, to minimize noise and artificial light emissions, as well as to have a turtle conservation plan for the lifetime of the project, instead of the previously proposed 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the value of Barrow Island as a habitat for flatback turtles, I strongly endorse this condition with the object of minimizing light emissions," Environment Minister Donna Faragher said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This commitment is to enhance the turtle population through such means as establishing hatcheries should the island's turtle numbers show decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry was responding to appeals raised against a conditional approval given by the Environmental Protection Agency of Western Australia in April on Chevron's proposal to expand the project to 15 million tons per annum (mtpa), after having received state approval for a 10 mtpa project in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project was originally expected to cost A$11 billion, but the Western Australian state government has estimated the scaled-up project to cost A$50 billion ($41 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron holds a 50 percent stake and is the operator of the project, while Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp each hold 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Releads, adds comment from environment ministry)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Fayen Wong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PERTH, July 29 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) proposed
Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project needs to meet more
stringent environmental conditions before it can obtain final

cause major delays to Chevron and its partners reaching a final
investment decision, as Chevron is not required to submit a
fresh proposal, said an official from the environment ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With the determination complete, we are now looking forward
to timely environmental approvals by the state and federal
governments," Chevron said in an emailed statement, adding that
it expects to make a final investment decision in the coming

the island, to minimise noise and artificial light emissions, as
well as to have a turtle conservation plan for the lifetime of
the project, instead of the previously proposed 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the value of Barrow Island as a habitat for flatback
turtles, I strongly endorse this condition with the object of
minimising light emissions," Environment Minister Donna Faragher
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This commitment is to enhance the turtle population through
such means as establishing hatcheries should the island's turtle
numbers show decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ministry was responding to appeals raised against a
conditional approval given by the Environmental Protection
Agency of Western Australia in April on Chevron's proposal to
expand the project to 15 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), after
having received state approval for a 10 mtpa project in 2007.

Second quarter operating results reflect the benefits of price and package
initiatives in North America, volume and pricing growth in Europe, and
efficiency and effectiveness initiatives. In the quarter, total revenues
declined &#189; percent. Excluding a negative currency impact of 6&#189; percent, total
revenues increased 6 percent. Consolidated comparable second quarter operating
income grew 12 percent. In North America, operating income grew $43 million or
13 percent, and in Europe, operating income grew $20 million, or 7 percent,
including a negative currency impact of approximately $57 million. Comparable
EPS results include a negative currency impact of approximately 8 cents. 

"We have responded to macroeconomic conditions with solid brand and marketplace
initiatives, including enhancements to our price/package architecture, and
successful execution of efficiency and effectiveness programs," said John F.
Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. 

"Our continued success will demand diligence in our revenue and brand building
efforts, even stronger execution, and an absolute commitment to cost control,"
Mr. Brock said. "We continue to work closely with The Coca-Cola Company to
enhance the synergy of our system and achieve consistent, balanced growth." 

For the quarter, consolidated results include a comparable physical case bottle
and can volume decline of 1 percent, net pricing per case increase of 8 percent,
and 6 percent increase in cost of sales per case. Both pricing and cost of sales
results exclude the effects of currency translations. Pages 11 through 15 of
this release provide a reconciliation of reported and comparable operating
results. 

The company also announced an increase of 4 cents per share in its annual
dividend and declared a regular quarterly dividend of 8 cents per common share.
The quarterly dividend rate is equivalent to an annual dividend of 32 cents per
common share. The dividend is payable September 24, 2009 to shareowners of
record on September 11, 2009. 

"The board`s decision to increase our dividend reflects an improving, but
cautious, outlook for the future, as well as the strengthening of our balance
sheet," said Mr. Brock. "We are pleased to increase returns to shareowners as we
continue to generate strong free cash flow and reduce debt." 

NORTH AMERICAN RESULTS

In North America, operating results reflect the benefits of price/package
architecture initiatives, operating expense controls, and higher cost of sales.
Second quarter volume declined 3&#189; percent. This reflects slightly improved
sparkling category trends, including solid growth for Coca-Cola Zero with volume
up more than 15 percent, and growth in energy drinks of more than 25 percent
with the addition of Monster brands. Pricing per case grew 8&#189; percent and cost
of sales per case increased 7 percent. 

"We continue to face important challenges in restoring consistent growth to our
operations despite improvement in North American financial results," said Mr.
Brock. "Stronger revenue management capabilities, cost control, and greater
efficiency are essential in providing the resources to strengthen our brands and
seize opportunities for balanced long-term growth." 

EUROPEAN RESULTS

Second quarter European volume grew 6&#189; percent, driven by Coca-Cola trademark
growth of 8&#189; percent, including growth of over 20 percent for Coca-Cola Zero and
strong growth for brand Coca-Cola. With the continued development of Coca-Cola
Zero, the brand now represents more than 5 percent of total European volume.
European net pricing per case was up 4 percent, and cost of sales per case
increased 1&#189; percent. 

"Our second quarter results demonstrate the health of our core Coca-Cola
trademark brands and our executional capabilities," Mr. Brock said. "These
second quarter results in Europe are encouraging, but economic conditions remain
challenging and will demand continued execution excellence." 

FULL-YEAR 2009 OUTLOOK

Management now expects full-year comparable 2009 earnings per diluted common
share to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.49. This range includes an expected
negative currency impact of approximately 15 cents per share and excludes
nonrecurring items. The company also expects strong free cash flow of
approximately $650 million and capital expenditures of approximately $900
million. Free cash flow will continue to be used primarily for debt reduction.
The effective tax rate for 2009 is expected to be 26 percent to 27 percent. 

In North America, the company expects full-year 2009 revenue to increase in a
low to mid single-digit range. Volume will decline and cost of goods per case is
expected to increase in a mid to high single-digit range, driven principally by
the mix impact of increased sales of purchased finished goods and increased
commodities cost. North American operating income will increase approximately 10
percent. 

European revenue will grow in a mid single-digit range. Volume will grow in a
low single-digit range and cost of goods per case is expected to increase in a
low single-digit range, reflecting a continued moderate commodity cost
environment. Operating income will grow approximately 10 percent. 

Guidance for both North America and Europe are given on a comparable, currency
neutral basis.

 (a)The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Net Pricing per Case" is used to more clearly evaluate bottle and can pricing trends in the marketplace. The measure excludes the impact of fountain gallon volume and other items that are not directly associated with bottle and can pricing in the retail environment. Our bottle and can sales accounted for approximately 91 percent of our net revenue during the second quarter and first six months of 2009. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (b)The non-GAAP financial measures "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Net Pricing per Case" and "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Cost of Sales per Case" are used to separate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our operations. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (c)The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Cost of Sales per Case" is used to more clearly evaluate cost trends for bottle and can products. The measure excludes the impact of fountain ingredient costs as well as marketing credits and Jumpstart funding, and allows investors to gain an understanding of the change in bottle and can ingredient and packaging costs. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (d)"Comparable Bottle and Can Volume" excludes the impact of changes in the number of selling days between periods. The measure is used to analyze the performance of our business on a constant period basis. There were the same number of selling days in the second quarter of 2009 versus the second quarter of 2008. There were three additional selling days in the first six months of 2009 versus the first six months of 2008. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (e)The non-GAAP measure "Free Cash Flow" is provided to focus management and investors on the cash available for debt reduction, dividend distributions, share repurchase, and acquisition opportunities.                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (f)The non-GAAP measure "Net Debt" is used to more clearly evaluate our capital structure and leverage.

&lt;p&gt; * Ad deal to be announced in 24 hours - source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft won't pay Yahoo an upfront fee - source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Deal focuses on revenue sharing - source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Yahoo, Microsoft shares higher after hours
 (Adds details on expected deal, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, July 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and
Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) have agreed to an online search and
advertising partnership, in an attempt to rival Google Inc,
(GOOG.O) that will be announced within 24 hours, a source
familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft will not pay an upfront fee to Yahoo, and the
focus of the deal is on sharing revenue between the two
companies, said the source, who did not want to be identified
because a formal announcement has not been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news and details of the expected deal were first
reported by the AllThingsDigital blog and Advertising Age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and Yahoo declined comment. The two companies
have talked for months about cooperating in the online
advertising market, dominated by Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft tried to buy Yahoo last year but its $47.5
billion bid was rebuffed and Yahoo's attempt to seal a search
advertising deal with Google Inc (GOOG.O) fell apart under
regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the expected deal, Microsoft's new Bing search engine
will power Yahoo's searches, according to Advertising Age,
while Yahoo will handle the advertising sales, using Microsoft
technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal should give Bing a giant boost in competing with
Google's search engine. Google's search engine dominates the
marketplace with 65 percent of U.S. Internet searches,
according to figures provided by research firm ComScore. Last
month, Microsoft had only 8.4 percent of the market and Yahoo
19.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is a chance a deal combining the powers of the second
and third-ranked search engine companies would be blocked by
antitrust regulators. Google and Yahoo dropped plans for an
advertising partnership last year under opposition from the
U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders of both Microsoft and Yahoo have been urging
the two to strike a deal for some time. Earlier this month,
activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 5 percent of Yahoo
and is a director on its board, spoke out in favor of a search
deal, as talks between the two companies appeared to regain
momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Yahoo traded at $17.39 in after-hours trading
after closing at $17.22, while shares of Microsoft rose to
$23.51 in after-hours trading from their close of $23.47.

&lt;p&gt;GAYAM, Indonesia (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) Cepu find in this poor rice-growing area of Java was meant to revive Indonesia's flagging oil output, but nearly a decade later there has been barely a trickle of oil from the huge field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has the world's 10th largest natural gas reserves and 25th biggest oil reserves, while it ranks in the top ten for copper, gold, nickel and tin, but a poor investment climate has deterred new foreign interest to develop its rich resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snail's pace of pumping oil at Cepu, which ranks among the U.S. major's top 10 projects worldwide, illustrates the multiple barriers foreign resource firms often face developing projects in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who was re-elected in July, failed in his first term to lift flagging oil output or attract major new foreign investment in mining to boost output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reverse this legacy, analysts say he needs to move swiftly to cut red tape, clarify oil and mining regulations and curb excessive resource nationalism to attract more investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari Soemarno, former head of state oil firm Pertamina who successfully concluded negotiations with Exxon Mobil on Cepu after the project was delayed for years, told Reuters the government needed a firmer stance to ensure projects were not held up by political squabbles or policy flip flops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They should make a breakthrough in terms of mindset," said Soemarno, who is now involved in businesses that include energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field, which straddles both East and Central Java, is due to eventually produce 165,000 barrels per day (bpd) when it hits full output, or nearly a fifth of Indonesia's current production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon used advanced 3-D seismic technology to find oil in Cepu in 2001 after other firms had given up the hunt, but then spent five years wrangling with Pertamina over control and the share of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yudhoyono, who urgently wants to stop a slide in oil output as other fields age, eventually ended the deadlock by firing Pertamina's board, resulting in the two firms agreeing in 2006 to jointly develop Cepu with Exxon as operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICS THREATENS PROJECTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, which also hosts top global energy firms such as Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and BP Plc (BP.L), has been offering new exploration rights and financial incentives for oil fields but has struggled to get more production on stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country lacks the billions of dollars needed to exploit new fields -- now often offshore and difficult to access in deep waters -- but the involvement of foreign investors, who bring capital and technology, is a sensitive political issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Cepu may be the only major investment to add to oil production in the next five years, while gas projects in the pipeline also face uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future of a Sulawesi liquefied natural gas (LNG) project involving Pertamina, PT Medco Energi International (MEDC.JK) and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. (8058.T) looks in doubt after mixed government signals on whether LNG could be exported or only used domestically meant the project may be uneconomic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is also still involved in a dispute with the government over the operating rights of the huge Natuna D-Alpha gas project estimated to require about $40 billion investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor uncertainty has also been increased by a government move to revise a cost recovery scheme reimbursing oil firms for exploration and production costs under pressure from parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yudhoyono said in May he still supported gas exports and vowed legal certainty for investors, while also seeking to resolve tax issues which currently deter oil and gas investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Pertamina head Soemarno said authorities also needed to phase out budget-straining fuel subsidies, particularly now that Indonesia has become a net crude importer and has quit OPEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The era of easy oil is over for Indonesia," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RED TAPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is similar uncertainty in the mining sector. Resource nationalism has often been prevalent, while a dragged-out process passing a new mining law has also put off investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is currently drafting regulations on the law, which was passed last year and replaced one dating from 1967.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new law, miners will be put on shorter-term permits rather than longer-term contracts, while they will also have to process minerals in Indonesia and set aside coal for the domestic market. Foreign investors will also have to divest some of their shares in a mining project after a period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some foreign mining firms have shelved investment plans since last year. BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) scrapped a study to develop a nickel project in eastern Indonesia and also opted not to go ahead with a coal mine in Central Kalminantan. Chinese firm Tsingshan Mineral Company Ltd scrapped a $500 million nickel project in North Maluku in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tortuous red tape tied to land ownership issues also frequently holds up resource and infrastructure projects in Indonesia, particularly in densely populated islands like Java.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest challenge right now is land acquisition. We could use all the help we could get," said Deddy Afidick, a spokesman for Mobil Cepu Ltd, a unit of Exxon Mobil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil has a team in Cepu currently negotiating with 3,000 owners to purchase 4,000 plots of land in an area where the average size of a plot is only a hectare, Afidick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the complexities of land ownership on the ground, the involvement of local governments in an era of decentralization is now also a bigger issue for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said in a May interview that Cepu faced delays because of a dispute with the Tuban district over a pipeline and despite reports of a resolution a source close to the project said a permit has yet to be issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six wells have been drilled for early production on Cepu's main Banyu Urip field, which is estimated to have reserves of 350 million barrels, including two to re-inject gas and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a recent visit to the site, a pipeline from Well Pad "A" was being laid so that oil can flow oil to a nearby Gas Oil Separation Plant (GOSP), which is also under construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some test production started in December and early production of up to 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) could begin in August, before cranking up to its peak by 2012, when more infrastructure including an on-site central processing facility is in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Grieder of IHS Global Insight said the re-election of the market-friendly Yudhoyono should be positive for Indonesia's oil and gas sector, noting it must attract foreign investment to boost supply and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This more than anything else will force the government to gradually improve investment terms for the oil and gas sector and start reducing fuel subsidies as the alternatives are shrinking state finances, rampant inefficiency and, ultimately, an oil and gas supply crisis," said Asia energy analyst Grieder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Muklis Ali; Editing by Michael Urquhart)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) huge Cepu
oil field in Indonesia is expected to start initial production
in August nearly a decade after it was discovered and following
a sharp slide in crude output in Southeast Asia's biggest
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cepu, which ranks among the U.S. major's top 10 projects
worldwide and is Southeast Asia's biggest new field, has faced
multiple obstacles, from land issues to the path of pipelines
and the share of revenue and control with state oil firm
Pertamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are some details of the $2.6 billion Cepu project in
an area straddling Central and East Java.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROJECT DETAILS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Exxon Mobil used advanced 3-D seismic technology to find
oil in Cepu in 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Five years of wrangling with state oil firm Pertamina
over control and share of revenue then followed before an
agreement was reached in 2006 to jointly develop Cepu with
Exxon unit Mobil Cepu Ltd as operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Exxon and Pertamina hold 45 percent stakes, with the
remaining 10 percent held by four local governments in East and
Central Java. The revenue share is 85 percent for the
government and 15 percent for contractors when the oil price is
above $45 per barrel. If oil prices are lower then the
investors get a bigger share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EARLY PRODUCTION PHASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Some test production started in December and early output
of 15,000-16,000 barrels per day (bpd) could begin in August,
rising to 20,000 bpd by year end, energy watchdog BPMIGAS said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Six wells have been drilled for early production on
Cepu's main Banyu Urip field, which is estimated to have
reserves of 350 million barrels, including two to re-inject gas
and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Crude will be piped through a 2.5 km pipeline to a gas
oil separation plant. From the plant around 6,000 bpd is due to
go to a small refinery being built by private firm PT Tri
Wahana Universal (TWU), while up to 14,000 bpd will be piped to
storage facilities operated by Pertamina and Petrochina, which
already has operations in the area, in Mudi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Oil from the storage area will then flow in a pipeline
parallel to an existing pipeline to a floating storage facility
in the Java Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MAIN PRODUCTION PHASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Cepu is expected to reach maximum output of 165,000
barrels per day (bpd) of crude in 2012, or about a fifth of
Indonesia's current crude output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - A central processing facility will be built on 100
hectares (247 acres) near the main oil wells to handle maximum
output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - A new 76 km pipeline will also be built to directly
transport maximum output to a new floating storage facility for
shipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Cepu's total oil reserves are estimated at 600 million
barrels and the company will start new exploratory drilling in
other areas at the end of the year. The block includes seven
other fields such as Alas Dara/Kemuning, Jambaran and Cendana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  - The field is also estimated to have 1.3 trillion cubic
feet of gas reserves which may be exploited later

&lt;p&gt;KHABAROVSK, Russia, July 31 (Reuters) - Russian gas giant
Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said on Friday it needed to work hard on U.S.
energy major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) to obtain gas from the
Sakhalin-1 project for a new Far Eastern gas pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Prime Minister Vladimir Putin inaugurated the pipeline, due
to come onstream in the third quarter of 2011, but there is no
deal yet between Gazprom and the Exxon-led Sakhalin-1
consortium on gas supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will need to work hard on Exxon to obtain these 8 to 10
billion cubic meters of gas from Sakhalin-1," Gazprom's Deputy
CEO Alexander Ananenkov told Putin after the inauguration
ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pipeline will link offshore fields around Sakhalin
island with the Pacific port of Vladivostok where Gazprom plans
to build an LNG plant which will ultimately liquefy gas from
for export to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government also wants to supply Sakhalin-1 gas for
domestic consumers in the Far East at regulated prices expected
to be 2.5-3 times lower than export prices in 2012 even after
annual hikes. Exxon eyes exports to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would like to stress that domestic market will be a
priority for the gas from East Siberia and the Far East," Putin
said in a speech at the pipeline inauguration ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon signed its Sakhalin-1 deal with Russia in the early
1990s under a production sharing agreement that guarantees
stable returns regardless of changes in legislation and exempts
the U.S. firm from Gazprom's (GAZP.MM) export monopoly on gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect Russia to step up pressure on the
consortium which also includes Russia's Rosneft (ROSN.MM),
Japan's Itochu (8001.T), Marubeni (8002.T) and India's ONGC
(ONGC.BO), to sell cheap gas. They say the consortium has
little choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sakhalin-1 project has been producing around 200,000
barrels per day of oil after starting a few years ago, but its
plans to supply gas to China have been on hold despite earlier
contracts with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom is holding talks with Exxon about buying all of its
gas output from Sakhalin and industry sources say the company
offers prices equal to Russia's domestic gas prices. Exxon said
it is studying all option to sell gas from Sakhalin-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom, which has faced demand destruction for its
pipeline gas in Europe since the start of 2009, says it wants
to expand in the gas liquefaction business to tap new markets
and gain flexibility in supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sakhalin, it already controls Sakhalin-2, an oil and LNG
project previously led by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which
ceded control after months of pressure from Russian ecological
agencies, which threatened to impose huge fines on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok pipeline will run 1,350
kilometres and carry six billion cubic metres of gas per year.
Ananenkov said the first phase will cost 210 billion roubles
($6.69 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pipeline project comes as part of a bigger plan to
revive Russia's Far Eastern economy ahead of a summit of
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders in 2012 on
Russky island near Vladivostok.

(MSFT.O) chief executive is optimistic about the next 12
months, but declined to issue any firm financial forecasts to

financial forecast since last year due to economic uncertainty,
and is not about to issue any new outlook, Microsoft CEO Steve
Ballmer told a meeting of analysts at its headquarters near
Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had a more inspired salesforce coming out of our sales
meeting last week than in years and it's the middle of a down
economy," said Ballmer. "But I'm not going to sit here and give
you a one-year optimistic guidance, I'm just not going to do
it. But it's not that I'm not optimistic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said he was excited about the upcoming release of
the new Windows 7 operating system in October and other new
products due over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But profit margins could take a hit in the near term as
customers move to longer or enterprise-wide contracts, the
company's chief financial officer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Over time that's going to drive margin growth at some
stage, but in the short term, it could force us to accept lower
margins in individual businesses," said CFO Christopher
Liddell.

&lt;p&gt;Disney shares slid by as much as 3.5 percent before changing direction to recover all their losses in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors dumped shares after the No. 1 U.S. entertainment company missed revenue expectations and met its earnings target mainly through cost-cutting, Caris  Co analyst David Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like it was a cost-driven quarter," Miller added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts on a conference call that the company sees, "signs of economic stabilization, but the pace and strength of the recovery remain uncertain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's two profit powerhouses, its cable networks and theme parks, seemed to have stopped a free-fall in sales for a second quarter, but have not yet turned a corner to return to growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income in the fiscal third quarter, ended June 27, was $954 million, or 51 cents per share, compared with $1.3 billion, or 66 cents a share, in the year-ago third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding certain items, Disney had a profit of 52 cents a share compared with analysts' average expectation of 51 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter revenue fell 7 percent to $8.59 billion from a year ago and lagged the $8.84 billion expected on average by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were not a lot of surprises. Nothing stands out of the ordinary or anything that people would not be braced for," Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of cable networks, they're doing pretty good and we expected them to do a little better than some of the others (media companies). The broadcasting was, not surprisingly, more difficult," Diedrich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A TURN IN THE STOCK MARKET"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating profit slid 13 percent at Media Networks, with a stronger performance by sports network ESPN and other cable networks masking weaker ad sales and ratings, coupled with higher programing costs, at the ABC broadcast network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deferral of affiliate revenue, fewer National Basketball League games and continued weakness in several major ad categories hit ESPN's revenue and profit in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly ad revenues at ESPN, adjusted for the missing games, were down about 10 percent compared with last year's third quarter, Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs said Disney was still in the midst of upfront advertising sales and was "comfortable" with the prices ABC was commanding. The network expects to sell less upfront inventory this year, as some major ad buyers are sitting on the sidelines, but believes it is well positioned for spot sales later in the quarter, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller said Staggs assessment was "pretty universal so far in terms of what we heard from peer media companies in this earnings period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a turn in the stock market, but no change in core business yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep hotel and ticket discounts at Disney's domestic theme parks pulled in visitors, raising attendance by 3 percent, but sliced revenue by 9 percent and profits by 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth quarter bookings were running 7 percent behind last year when an extra week in the fiscal quarter was excluded, Staggs said. The Disney executives declined to say whether the discounts would be discontinued, as planned, this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Studios turned to a loss and saw revenue drop by 12 percent on weak DVD sales and TV distribution and on a less popular release slate, including "Bedtime Stories," "Tales of A Shopaholic" and "Bolt," compared with 2008's "National Treasure 2" and "Enchanted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dismal retail environment and the loss of royalties from Disney Stores North America, which Disney reacquired last year, coupled with lower licensing royalties drove down Consumer Products revenue by 10 percent and profits by 37 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's Interactive Media Segment cut its prior year quarterly loss on lower costs, but weaker sales of its games cut revenues by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entertainment and media conglomerate's shares were flat in after-hours trading after closing at $26.22 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating; editing by Gary Hill and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, July 30 (Reuters) - Startup of Tahiti oil
production continues uninterrupted despite the shutdown of
Eugene Island pipeline through which Tahiti oil has been
flowing, a Chevron Corp (CVX.N) spokeswoman said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The spokeswoman would not elaborate except to say the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Thursday as solid corporate profit reports and a drop in the number of Americans on jobless benefits gave investors reasons to buy equities following the SP 500's two days of losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market's rally pushed the benchmark SP 500 index earlier in the session to its highest intraday level in almost nine months, putting it less than 4 points away from the psychologically important 1,000 level. The Nasdaq briefly rose above 2,000 for the first time since October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shares lost ground at the close and finished off the day's highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market's advance was underpinned by strong demand for the Treasury Department's auction of a record $28 billion of 7-year notes. Strong bids on U.S. debt diminish the chance of a rise in borrowing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gains were broad-based, but a surge in commodity prices gave an extra boost to raw materials shares. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index .CRB, a gauge of 19 commodities' prices, rose 3.9 percent, its biggest daily percentage gain since mid-March. The SP materials index .GSPM jumped 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies reporting better-than-expected results on Thursday included MasterCard Inc (MA.N), up 3 percent at $194.11, and industrial conglomerate Tyco International Ltd (TYC.N), up 2.9 percent at $29.64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Motorola Inc MOT.N shot up 9.4 percent to $7.19 as the world's No. 3 cellphone maker behind Nokia and Samsung cut costs and shipped more phones than expected, and beat analysts' expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are now in a market where the momentum is so strong that people typically say (it) is overbought," said Steve Goldman, market strategist at Weeden  Co in Greenwich, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In actuality, it's the type of strength that leads to further gains, and pullbacks tend to be shallow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI added 83.74 points, or 0.92 percent, to close at 9,154.46.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was surprised that Wall Street reacted negatively to Yahoo's plan to hand over its Internet search and advertising reins to Microsoft, he said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Nobody gets it," he said about the deal, unveiled Wednesday after more than a year in the making. Under terms of the 10-year deal, Microsoft's Bing search engine and adCenter platform will power Yahoo's search-based advertising business, while Yahoo's sales team will handle both companies' premium search customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to a group of financial analysts at their annual meeting at Microsoft, Ballmer attempted to explain why the deal will benefit both companies and to perhaps repair some of the damage to Yahoo's stock price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft's stock went up after the deal was announced, Yahoo's plummeted. As of early Thursday afternoon, it was trading at US$14.28, down 16 percent from where it was before the deal and half the price Microsoft originally offered to pay for each share of Yahoo when it made its $44.6 billion unsolicited bid last February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street had expected Yahoo to come away from the deal with a sizeable cash payment from Microsoft up front for its search assets, but that wasn't the case, which largely explains why investors reacted negatively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer acknowledged that since there was no exchange of money in the deal, investors and analysts are clearly puzzled. "Economics is where people get even more confused," he said. "What happened? Nothing got bought. Nothing got sold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Ballmer said he's not sure why Wall Street would be sour on a deal in which Yahoo will generate about $500 million in operating income and a savings of about $200 million in capital expenditures once it closes. "That's one that stuns me," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Yahoo, the big boon of the deal is it's taking significant operating and RD costs out of its business while retaining 88 percent of the search revenue it is already getting, because Microsoft will pay Yahoo traffic acquisition costs at an initial rate of 88 percent during the first five years of the agreement, Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies will get scale out of the deal, allowing them to reach a larger network of advertisers and users. This will lead to improvement of the search product, but not financial improvement as far as revenue growth right away, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ballmer said that revenue will come with the product improvement that follows once their search and advertising platforms are combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more queries you can see, the more you can tune your product," he said. "The more advertisers advertise on your system and the more relevant they make their ads for your users. The advertising is part of the actual user experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as he defended the deal, Ballmer on Thursday seemed conscious of the fact that Microsoft blundered in search by not investing early enough, and suggested that the company has learned a lesson from the long time it took to close the Yahoo deal -- time in which Google continued to grow its already sizeable market share in search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our business in this industry, probably the greatest source of economic value creation is choosing to be in the right businesses early enough," he said. "When you don't choose to be in early enough you have a problem. When you choose to stay out of a business that is economic value creation, you won't grow with the market. If you are picking the right things that's a very important call."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Nancy Gohring in Seattle contributed to this report.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Companhia de Bebidas das Americas or AmBev
(NYSE: ABV) as the Bull of the Day and First Advantage Corporation (Nasdaq:
FADV) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis
on Unisys (NYSE: UIS), IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Computer Sciences Corporation (NYSE:
CSC). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We are maintaining our Buy recommendation on Companhia de Bebidas das Americas
or AmBev (NYSE: ABV). The company posted good results for the first quarter of
2009 with excellent results in the key Brazilian market. 

InBev's acquisition of Anheuser-Busch was positive for the company as it creates
huge synergies. Despite the difficult economic environment throughout the world
due to the global credit crunch, the company, which is focusing on low cost,
daily use products, is not tied directly to the international economic cycle. 

Also, a more relaxed monetary policy in Brazil is very positive for the company.
Our target price is $79.50 per share. 

Bear of the Day: 

We maintain our Sell rating on shares of First Advantage Corporation (Nasdaq:
FADV) following the release of Q2 results. Our $15.00 target price for FADV is
reflects the current acquisition offer by First American, based on First
American's current price. 

Should the deal not be finalized, we would expect downside risk for FADV. As
such, we reiterate our Sell rating on the shares. 

First Advantage is a provider of risk mitigation solutions. In the first quarter
of 2009, FADV consolidated and realigned its business segments. The realigned
business segments are as follows: credit services, data services, employer
services, multifamily services, and investigative and litigation support
services. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Unisys Surprises the Street

The new CEO at Unisys (NYSE: UIS) is determined to make the organization lean
and highly efficient with a clearly differentiated value proposition that
customers recognize. Meanwhile, management is still engaged in a multi pronged
strategy of reducing the cost structure of the company and focusing its
resources on high growth areas in the IT market. 

The company expects that it would now derive tangible results from its ongoing
restructuring, after several execution missteps in the past. It remains to be
seen how the new CEO turns around the company. IT spending by industry is
expected to remain lackluster in the near future. 

Unisys generated $5.2 billion in revenues in 2008 compared to $104 billion and
$17 billion generated by its competitors IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Computer Sciences
Corporation (NYSE: CSC) respectively. Expanding the top-line amid such
recessionary conditions will be an uphill task.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co posted a 26 percent lower profit on Thursday as the global economic woes pulled down operating profits by double digits at its powerhouse media networks and theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third-quarter profit result was in line with Wall Street expectations, but revenue missed, and Disney's share price dropped 3.5 percent in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the 19 percent decline in park profits compared favorably with last quarter's 50 percent decline, and cable networks were pushed lower by a shift in revenue recognition at ESPN, rather than pure weakness in the advertising market, Disney officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income was $954 million, or 51 cents per share, for the quarter ended June 27, compared with $1.3 billion, or 66 cents a share, in the year-ago third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 7 percent to $8.59 billion from $9.24 billion a year ago. That was below analysts' average forecast of revenue of $8.84 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney dropped to $25.30 after closing at $26.22 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares rose 31 percent in its third fiscal quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) today reported earnings for its third fiscal
quarter and nine months ended June 27, 2009. Diluted earnings per share (EPS)
for the third quarter were $0.51, compared to $0.66 in the prior-year quarter.
EPS for the current quarter included $0.01 of restructuring and impairment
charges while the prior-year quarter included an accounting gain related to the
acquisition of the Disney Stores North America, a gain on the sale of
movies.com, and the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters which
collectively benefited EPS by $0.04. Excluding these items, EPS decreased 16% to
$0.52 from $0.62 in the prior-year quarter. 

For the nine-month period, diluted EPS was $1.29 compared to $1.87 in the
prior-year period. EPS for the current nine months included a gain on the sale
of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America and
restructuring and impairment charges which together had a net $0.07 adverse
impact on EPS. EPS for the prior-year period included the gains and tax benefits
discussed above. Excluding these items, EPS for the nine-month period was $1.36
compared to $1.83 in the prior-year nine months. 

"While a tough global economy impacted our performance in the quarter, we remain
encouraged by the relative strength of our business," said president and CEO
Robert A. Iger. "That strength is the result of Disney`s combination of strong
brands, consistent business strategy and the steps we`ve taken to make our
businesses more efficient without sacrificing quality."

Cable Networks

Operating income at Cable Networks decreased 8% to $1.1 billion for the quarter
driven by a decrease in revenue recognized related to annual programming
commitments and lower advertising revenue at ESPN, partially offset by the
benefit of contractual rate increases and subscriber growth on affiliate
revenue. The decrease in revenue recognized related to annual programming
commitments was due to the timing of sports programming. During the quarter, we
had a net deferral of $37 million of revenue compared to the prior-year quarter
when we recognized $79 million of previously deferred revenue. The Company
expects that the balance of deferred revenue as of the end of the quarter will
be recognized in the fourth quarter. The decrease in advertising revenues was
due to a decrease in units sold, partially offset by higher rates. 

Broadcasting

Operating income at Broadcasting decreased 34% to $204 million for the quarter
primarily due to higher costs for primetime programming and lower advertising
sales at the owned television stations and at the ABC Television Network,
partially offset by increased international sales of ABC Studios productions,
led by Grey`s Anatomy and Criminal Minds. Higher programming costs were driven
by increased pilot costs as pick-up decisions this year generally occurred in
the current quarter compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year as the
Writers Guild of America work stoppage led to delays in pick-up decisions. Lower
advertising revenues at the ABC Television Network were primarily due to
decreases in news, daytime and primetime. The decrease in primetime was due to
lower ratings. 

Parks and Resorts

Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter decreased 9% to $2.8 billion and
segment operating income decreased 19% to $521 million. Lower operating income
was due to decreases at the Walt Disney World Resort, Disney Vacation Club, and
Disneyland Paris. Operating income comparisons reflected the shift of the Easter
holiday from the second quarter in fiscal 2008 to the third quarter in fiscal
2009. 

Domestic Operations

Lower operating income at the Walt Disney World Resort was primarily due to
decreased guest spending and lower corporate alliance income recognition,
partially offset by lower costs. Decreased guest spending was driven by lower
average daily hotel room rates and lower average ticket prices, which included
the impact of promotional programs such as our Buy 4, Get 3 Free program. Lower
costs reflected savings from cost mitigation activities and lower volume,
partially offset by labor and other cost inflation. Lower operating income at
Disney Vacation Club was primarily due to higher per unit cost of sales. 

International Operations

Lower operating income at Disneyland Paris reflected decreased guest spending
and hotel occupancy. The decrease in guest spending was due to lower average
ticket prices as well as decreased food, beverage and merchandise spending. 

Studio Entertainment

Studio Entertainment revenues for the quarter decreased 12% to $1.3 billion and
segment operating income decreased $109 million to a loss of $12 million. Lower
segment operating results were driven by decreases in worldwide home
entertainment and worldwide television distribution, partially offset by an
increase in domestic theatrical distribution. 

The decrease in worldwide home entertainment was due to lower unit sales of
catalog titles and current releases. The Company also recognized lower net
effective revenue per unit. Significant current quarter titles included Bedtime
Stories, Confessions of a Shopaholic and Bolt while the prior-year quarter
included National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets and Enchanted. Lower results in
worldwide television distribution reflected more significant titles in the
prior-year quarter including Game Plan and Ratatouille in domestic pay
television markets and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The
Wardrobe in international markets. 

The increase in domestic theatrical distribution was primarily due to the strong
performance in the current year of UP and Hannah Montana: The Movie, partially
offset by higher film cost write-downs and marketing expenses for future quarter
releases. The prior-year quarter included The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince
Caspian and WALL-E, which was released at the end of the quarter. 

Consumer Products

Consumer Products revenues for the quarter decreased 10% to $510 million and
segment operating income decreased 37% to $96 million. 

Lower segment operating income was due to a decrease at our retail business
driven by the Disney Stores North America and lower earned royalty revenue
across multiple product categories at Merchandise Licensing due to the difficult
retail environment. The decrease at the Disney Stores North America reflected a
full period of operations in the current quarter whereas the prior-year quarter
included a partial period of operations and royalty revenue from the former
licensee. 

Interactive Media

Interactive Media revenues for the quarter decreased 20% to $113 million and
segment operating results improved from a loss of $91 million in the prior-year
quarter to a loss of $75 million in the current quarter. 

Lower segment operating loss reflected lower marketing and product development
costs at Disney Online and at Disney Interactive Studios. Lower costs at Disney
Interactive Studios were more than offset by a decline in unit sales of
self-published video games at Disney Interactive Studios reflecting the strong
performance of The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian in the prior-year
quarter. 

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

During the quarter the Company recorded $21 million of restructuring and
impairment charges which primarily consisted of severance costs. For the nine
months, restructuring and impairment charges totaled $326 million consisting of
$206 million of non-cash impairment charges and $120 million of severance and
other costs related to organizational and cost structure initiatives across our
businesses. 

Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses

Corporate and unallocated shared expense decreased from $124 million to $96
million for the quarter primarily due to the reduction and deferral of costs in
various corporate departments and an increase in allocation of costs to the
business segments. 

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense was as follows (in millions):

 Net interest expense                $    (75   )        $    (141  )    


The decrease in interest expense for the quarter was due to lower effective
interest rates. 

The increase in interest and investment income for the quarter was due to a gain
on the sale of an investment. 

Income taxes

The effective income tax rate for the quarter increased to 37.8% from 34.1% in
the prior-year quarter as the prior year included a benefit from the favorable
resolution of certain prior-year income tax matters.

 (1) Free cash flow is not a financial measure defined by GAAP. See the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows below. 


The decrease in free cash flow was driven by lower segment operating results,
higher contributions to our pension plans, higher net investment in film and
television productions and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset
by lower income tax payments and a decreased net investment in working capital.
The increase in capital expenditures reflected the expansion of Disney`s
California Adventure, a construction progress payment on two new cruise ships
and new broadcast and film production facilities.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding certain items, net
borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income, all of which
are important financial measures for the Company but are not financial measures
defined by GAAP. 

These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP
financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of earnings per
share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with
GAAP. Earnings per share excluding certain items, net borrowings, free cash
flow, and aggregate segment operating income as we have calculated them may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

Earnings per share excluding certain items - The Company uses earnings per share
excluding certain items to evaluate the performance of the Company`s operations
exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period
to period. In the current nine months, these items included a gain on the sale
of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America and
restructuring and impairment charges. In the prior-year nine months, these items
included an accounting gain related to the acquisition of the Disney Stores
North America, a gain on the sale of movies.com and the favorable resolution of
certain income tax matters. The Company believes that information about earnings
per share exclusive of these impacts is useful to investors, particularly where
the impact of the excluded items is significant in relation to reported
earnings, because the measure allows for comparability between periods of the
operating performance of the Company`s business and allows investors to evaluate
the impact of these items separately from the impact of the operations of the
business. The following table reconciles reported earnings per share to earnings
per share excluding certain items:

Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net borrowings
provides investors with a useful perspective on our financial condition. Net
borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total
borrowings. Since we earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a
portion of the interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be
used as a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness when
the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. However, we may not
immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the reduction of debt, nor do we
expect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repay
debt in the ordinary course of business. 

Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by operations
less investments in parks, resorts and other property), among other measures, to
evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for
purposes other than capital expenditures. Management believes that information
about free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the
cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and
pay dividends or repurchase shares. 

Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses
aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating
businesses separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that
information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by
allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company`s
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net
income, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other
factors that affect reported results. 

A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows (in
millions):

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) was upgraded to "buy" from "neutral" this
morning at Goldman Sachs. The brokerage firm cited comments from the U.S. House
Financial Services Committee Chairman, who indicated that new regulations might
not mandate the separation of GE Capital, for the upward revision. Goldman Sachs
also upped its price target to $15 per share from $13 per share. With such juicy
news hitting the wires this morning, options speculators have flooded GE with a
wave of call activity. 

According to our Intraday Volume Explosion List, more than 149,000 of these
bullishly oriented contracts have changed hands on GE so far, pushing call
volume to more than triple the equity's daily average. The most active strike
has been the August 14 call, which has seen more than 51,000 contracts change
hands on open interest of just 36,164 contracts.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa will add content from network Telemundo to its pay channels as it strengthens links with the U.S. No. 2 Spanish-language television company to boost viewership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott+Scott LLP Files Class Action Lawsuit Against J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. On
Behalf of Investors -- JPM

NEW YORK, July 30, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A class action complaint filed by
Scott+Scott LLP, alleging a registration statement and prospectus supplements
issued to investors who purchased or otherwise acquired certain Mortgage
Pass-Though Certificates ("Certificates") issued by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.
("J.P. Morgan" or the "Company") (NYSE:JPM) through its issuing trusts were
false and misleading, was removed from state court and is now pending in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Defendants
include J.P. Morgan, certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, the directors
at J.P. who signed the Registration Statement and the rating agencies that
facilitated the sale of the Certificates. This is a securities class action on
behalf of all persons who acquired the Certificates of JP Morgan Issuing Trusts
(defined, below) pursuant and/or traceable to the J.P. Morgan Acceptance
Corporation I ("J.P. Morgan Acceptance") Registration Statement No. 333-141607
and accompanying Prospectus (collectively, the "Registration Statements") and
Prospectus Supplements, for violations of the Securities Act of 1933.

The J.P. Morgan Issuing Trusts at issue in this action include:

 * JP Morgan Mortgage Trust 2007-S2
 * JP Morgan Mortgage Trust 2007-S3
 * JP Morgan Mortgage Trust 2007-A3
 * JP Morgan Mortgage Trust 2007-A4
 * JP Morgan Alternative Loan Trust 2007-S1
 * JP Morgan Alternative Loan Trust 2007-A2
 * JP Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Trust 2007-CH4
 * JP Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Trust 2007-CH5
 * JP Morgan Mortgage Trust 2007-A5
 * JP Morgan Mortgage Trust 2007-A6
 * JP Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Trust 2007-CH3
 * JP Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Trust 2007-CH6
If you purchased Certificates from one or more of these J.P. Morgan Issuing
Trusts, pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement, and wish to
serve as a lead plaintiff in the action, you must move the Court no later than
September 28, 2009, sixty (60) days from today. Any member of the investor class
may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of its choice, or
may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. If you wish to
discuss this action or have questions concerning this notice or your rights,
please contact Scott+Scott (scottlaw@scott-scott.com, (800) 404-7770, (860)
537-5537 or visit the Scott+Scott website, http://www.scott-scott.com) for more
information. There is no cost or fee to you.

The complaint alleges that on March 27, 2007, J.P. Morgan and the other
Defendants caused the Registration statements to be filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in connection with and for the purpose of
issuing hundreds of millions of dollars of Certificates through J.P. Morgan
Issuing Trusts listed above. The J.P. Morgan Issuing Trusts issued the
Certificates pursuant to the Registration Statements, which explained the
structure of the Issuing Trusts and provided an overview of the Certificates.
The Certificates were then sold to investors by underwriters pursuant to a
series of prospectus supplements that were also filed with the SEC and
incorporated by reference into the Registration Statements ("Prospectus
Supplements"). Each Prospectus Supplement included a detailed description of the
particular J.P. Morgan Issuing Trust and the Certificates it would issue. The
Registration Statements further represented that the mortgages underlying the
Certificates were investment-grade and were subject to specific loan
underwriting and appraisal standards were based on and met such standards.

The Certificates entitled investors to receive monthly distributions of interest
and principal on cash flows paid by the borrowers on the mortgages held by the
J.P. Morgan Issuing Trusts. As the underlying mortgage borrowers in each
issuance paid their mortgages, distributions were to be made to the investors of
the particular Certificate as disclosed in the Prospectus Supplement
disseminated with respect to that Certificate. If the underlying borrowers did
not pay their mortgages, losses passed to investors based on the seniority of
their Certificates. Consequently, the investment quality of the Certificates was
inextricably connected to the quality of the mortgage loan pools held by each
J.P. Morgan Issuing Trust.

However, as the complaint alleges, J.P. Morgan, and certain of its entities,
failed to disclose in the Registration Statements that the loan originators that
originated the mortgages to borrowers had ignored and/or never intended to
follow the stated underwriting and appraisal standards and guidelines, and that
loan purchasing guidelines were ignored. The underlying mortgages were also
loans on properties for which the collateral appraisals materially overstated
the value of the underlying properties. The Certificates that were sold to
investors as investment-grade instruments were later revealed to be below
investment-grade instruments. Additionally, as underlying mortgage borrowers
became delinquent, defaulted and suffered foreclosures, the purportedly
investment-grade Certificates were downgraded, cash flows were reduced and the
Certificates were significantly reduced in value. The complaint further alleges
that as a direct and proximate result of defendants' false and materially
misleading statements and material omissions, investors suffered damages when
the truth about the risk profile and value of the Certificates became known and
the price dropped.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, July 30 (Reuters) - Karl-Georg Altenburg, head of
JP Morgan's (JPM.N) German business, said he expects companies
to learn from the financial crisis and aim for a stronger
capital base in the longer term, according to a German paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We expect equity increases of 200-300 billion euros
($282-423 billion) in Europe this year," Altenburg told daily
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview published late on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said there was enough liquidity in the market. The volume
of U.S. money market funds had more than doubled, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That is money that barely earns any returns, meaning it
creates enormous pressure to invest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Germany, he said banks' business in restructuring of debt
capital was attractive, as were hedging transactions. MA
adivising was going well, but not outstanding.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Y MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) y U.S. Bank, el banco l&#237;der de U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB),
anunciaron hoy la creaci&#243;n de Syncada: una asociaci&#243;n conjunta que brinda una

medida que se unen nuevos participantes bancarios 
* Integraci&#243;n perfecta con una red comprobada a trav&#233;s de tecnolog&#237;a patentada

d&#233;cadas de inversiones para crear un servicio de pagos poderoso y eficiente para
corporaciones y entidades gubernamentales. PowerTrack ha sido clave para nuestro
&#233;xito en los pagos, y para atraer a nuevos clientes bancarios comerciales", dijo

&lt;p&gt; * Prime Minister Putin to inaugurate Pacific gas pipeline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon will face pressure to sell cheap gas, analysts say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * More gas needed to fill pipeline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Gazprom needs gas for domestic use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Anton Doroshev and Gleb Bryanski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOSCOW, July 30 (Reuters) - Russia will step up pressure on
U.S. major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) to sell cheap gas from Sakhalin,
analysts said on Thursday, a day before Moscow begins building a
new gas link to the Pacific before finding the gas to fill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will travel to the far eastern
city of Khabarovsk on Friday to inaugurate the start of the
pipeline to the Pacific port of Vladivostok, which will
ultimately liquefy gas from Sakhalin island for export to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think Exxon Mobil knows that they (Russia) will twist
their arm. It is pure pressure," Mikhail Krutikhin, an analyst
with RusEnergy, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon signed its Sakhalin-1 deal with Russia in the early
1990s under a production sharing agreement that guarantees
stable returns regardless of changes in legislation and exempts
the U.S. firm from Gazprom's (GAZP.MM) export monopoly on gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project has been producing around 200,000 barrels per
day of oil from the project after starting a few years ago, but
its plans to supply gas to China have been on hold despite
earlier contracts with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom says it needs gas for domestic use and is holding
talks with Exxon about buying all of its gas output from
Sakhalin, although industry sources say the company offers
prices equal to Russia's domestic gas prices, which are
state-capped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil is studying all options of selling gas from
Sakhalin-1," said the firm's spokesman, Konstantin von Eggert.
He declined further comment. [ID:nL8454097]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom, which has faced demand destruction for its pipeline
gas in Europe since the start of 2009, says it wants to expand
in the gas liquefaction business to tap new markets and gain
flexibility in supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sakhalin, it already controls Sakhalin-2, an oil and LNG
project previously led by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which
ceded control after months of pressure from Russian ecological
agencies, which threatened to impose huge fines on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valery Nesterov from Troika Dialog said that despite a
growing belief among investors that Russia's grip over resources
is easing after deals with Total (TOTF.PA) and Shell in recent
months, foreign firms will often remain under pressure.
[ID:nLR103555] [ID:nLO221477]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon does not have a free choice. Past experience shows
that if (Moscow) has a strong desire, the foreign partner has to
agree," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Khabarovsk-Vladivostok pipeline will run 1,460 km (913
miles) and Nesterov estimates its cost at $2.9-$4.4 billion.
Sakhalin is already connected to Khabarovsk with a gas link,
which is supplying local consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Krutikhin adds that, even if Exxon is forced to sell all its
gas from Sakhalin-1 to Gazprom, volumes won't exceed 7-8 billion
cubic metres per year, while Gazprom is eyeing a peak capacity
of up to 47 bcm a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "So to fill the pipeline, you need to discover new fields or
build a pipeline from Yakutia," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that the potentially idle and expensive pipeline
project comes as part of a bigger plan to revive Russia's Far
Eastern economy, including a summit of Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) leaders in 2012 on Russky island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The expensive Russky project is often criticised by analysts
as a waste of state money at a time when Russia needs to help
its economy withstand the first recession in a decade.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO &amp; PARIS &amp; LONDON--(Business Wire)--
The $1.2 billion acquisition of analytics and data mining vendor SPSS by IBM is
a move with positive repercussions for the rest of the industry, says KXEN
founder and CEO Roger Haddad. 

KXEN pioneered next-generation analytics and as a result of the IBM deal moves
up to rank second among the world`s independent vendors. 

Haddad says the IBM deal has placed the spotlight firmly on the sector, with
analysts, investors and user organizations now looking more closely at the
remarkable value data mining and analytics generates. "The price paid for SPSS
of four times revenues and 25 times earnings shows just how valuable this sector
really is," says Haddad. "But the deal has also created a tremendous opportunity
for the sector`s remaining independent vendors that KXEN is well placed to
capitalize on. 

"There is no For Sale sign hanging in our window," continues Haddad. "We
launched KXEN in 1998 to democratize the benefits of data mining and predictive
analytics, making them practical and affordable across the whole enterprise and
not just the exclusive preserve of a few specialists. It`s going to take up to
two years for the dust to settle following the IBM acquisition. 

"Former SPSS partners, systems integrators and distributors will face
uncertainty. We think it`s inevitable that many will be sidelined as IBM opts to
sell and support through its own global network while others will decide to
simply walk away because the deal compromises their own preferred choice of
hardware and software platforms. 

"KXEN is embarking on an aggressive drive to take market share, capitalizing
fully on the opportunity the acquisition has created and building on our growing
penetration of larger customer organizations," concluded Haddad.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Her platinum white hair is long gone, replaced by silky smooth, dark brown locks. Yet that doesn't stop young girls from recognizing "High School Musical" star Ashley Tisdale at restaurants and asking for autographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tisdale's role as Sharpay Evans, an over-the-top teenager who will stop at nothing to get what she wants in Disney's "High School Musical," has given her a huge following and altered Tisdale's life forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the 24-year-old actress is expanding her career in new projects, including her role in movie "Aliens in the Attic," which debuts in U.S. theaters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tisdale continues to work in TV where "HSM" was a huge hit on the Disney Channel before becoming a movie, and she is even producing. Her singing has landed the actress a chart-topping recording career, and her second studio album, "Guilty Pleasures," comes out this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, her growing popularity has meant Tisdale has a constant trail of paparazzi following her around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't have a private life anymore; that's gone out the door," said Tisdale, but she has not let that stop her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In "Aliens in the Attic," Tisdale sheds her Sharpay image to portray a teen named Bethany, who joins other kids to battle aliens that land on the roof of her family's summer home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tisdale calls Bethany a "typical 17-year-old teen," whereas Sharpay tended toward being "very dramatic and very much a caricature." And Tisdale said getting away from "HSM" helps show her versatility as an actress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People know me as Sharpay, so playing a different character like Bethany is a great departure, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEXT GENERATION WITHERSPOON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Tisdale's past is one reason "Aliens in the Attic" producer, Barry Josephson, wanted her onboard. "She brings the female audience to the movie," he said. "The other advantage is that she's really, really funny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josephson, whose credits include the movie "Enchanted" and the TV show "Bones," calls Tisdale a "new generation Reese Witherspoon or Jennifer Aniston" because of her instinct for comedy. Yet he feels she can go beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Tisdale is making further inroads in TV as the voice of the character Candace on Disney Channel's animated "Phineas  Ferb," and she will appear in an upcoming episode of ABC's "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition," helping host Ty Pennington build a home for a needy family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tisdale and her company, Blondie Girl Productions, are developing several TV projects, including a dating reality show she says the E! Network has considered launching. A pilot episode was already shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't say much about it because it's not yet put together for the channel, but I can say that it's not in my age range. It's older - a little bit of 'Sex and the City.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tisdale said she is looking for follow-up movie projects to "Aliens in the Attic," and she would "love to do more comedies or even romantic comedies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josephson noted that her other talent, singing, will likely come in very handy in the future, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ashley can do a biopic like Jennifer Lopez did with 'Selena' or take on a Streisand-type role. With her music and acting abilities, Ashley is very unique."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bob Tourtellotte and Alex Dobuzinskis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp reported a steeper-than-expected drop in quarterly profit as natural gas and crude oil prices slid from a year ago and the global recession hurt demand for fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares fell 1.6 percent in early trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which raked in record profits last year, has seen earnings wither as crude oil prices have fallen by more than half from a year ago. Refiners have also seen margins under pressure as weakness in industrial demand for fuels like diesel has caused a buildup in stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks disappointing," said Phil Weiss, an analyst at Argus Research. "They missed on margins and production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, said second-quarter net income was $3.95 billion, or 81 cents per share, down from $11.68 billion, or $2.22 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings excluding one-time items were $4.09 billion, or 84 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected $1.02 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 46 percent to $74.46 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Global economic conditions continue to impact the energy industry both in the volatility of commodity prices and reduced demand for products," Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter production fell 3 percent from a year earlier, the Irving, Texas, company said. Analysts had been looking for production to be flat or slightly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings in the company's exploration and production business fell 62 percent to $3.8 billion, while earnings in the refining unit fell 67 percent to $512 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first six months of the year, Exxon said it spent $12.3 billion, in line with its longer-term plan for capital spending of $125 billion over 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter Exxon repurchased 75 million shares of its stock at a gross cost of $5.2 billion. In the third quarter it expects to buy back $4 billion of stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon were down $1.16 to $70.27 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Driver in Houston; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Settlement Ends All State Cases Over 1996 Clinical Study
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc today announced it has reached agreement with the Kano State
government in Nigeria to settle Kano State`s claims arising from the 1996 Trovan
clinical study, which was conducted during Nigeria`s worst meningitis epidemic
in history. Under the terms of the settlement, Kano State will dismiss both the
civil and criminal Trovan-related cases it filed against the company and various
individuals, and Pfizer specifically denies any wrongdoing or liability in
connection with the 1996 study. The company has said all along that the 1996
study was conducted with the approval of the Nigerian government and the consent
of the participants` parents or guardians, and was consistent with Nigerian
laws. 

"We have been a partner with the people and governments of Nigeria for more than
50 years. The company believes that a mutually agreeable resolution to the
Trovan cases is the best way to continue that relationship and allow Pfizer and
the Nigerian governments to focus on what matters - improving healthcare for all
Nigerians," said Pfizer Senior Vice President and Associate General Counsel Brad
Lerman. 

Under the terms of the settlement with Kano State, Pfizer has agreed to: (1)
establish a Healthcare/Meningitis Fund from which study participants can receive
financial support; (2) underwrite several healthcare initiatives chosen by the
Kano State government that benefit the people of Kano State, totaling US$30
million over a period of two years; and (3) reimburse Kano State for US$10
million in legal costs associated with the litigation. The Healthcare/Meningitis
Fund will be available to all individuals who meet the qualification criteria
necessary to verify their participation in the 1996 Trovan clinical study. The
Fund will be administered by an independent six-member Board of Trustees, with
three members each chosen by Pfizer and the Kano State government. The Board
will make the final determinations on eligibility and levels of financial
support. The maximum amount that could be disbursed by the Fund is US$35
million, but the final amount will depend on the total number of valid claims
submitted. 

Kano State and Pfizer will name a separate six-member board to oversee the $30
million allocated to support health initiatives designated by Kano State. 

"We are especially pleased that the benefits of this settlement will be directed
first and foremost to those who contracted meningitis in 1996 and also
participated in the clinical study at that time," Mr. Lerman said. "With the
procedures in place for the Healthcare/Meningitis Fund, the people of Nigeria
will have confidence that the parties have taken strong steps to ensure that the
funds reach only those for whom they are intended." 

The settlement`s healthcare initiatives build on Pfizer`s work in Nigeria for
more than 50 years. In August 1957, Pfizer became the first U.S. pharmaceutical
company to establish operations in Nigeria. Since that time, the company has
contributed to the well-being of Nigerians by providing quality medicines,
creating jobs, developing local expertise, and bringing foreign investment and
innovative healthcare solutions to the country. Nigeria is a part of Pfizer`s
presence in Africa, and the company looks forward to its continued health
partnership with the governments and people of Nigeria. 

Today, the company participates in and supports several initiatives in
partnership with the government, the private health sector and nongovernmental
organizations that benefit the health of the Nigerian people and the country`s
healthcare system. For instance, Pfizer routinely conducts disease awareness
campaigns through public education programs. Pfizer also invests in developing
local health expertise through health education and good clinical practice
workshops. Lastly, Pfizer is working in partnership with the Nigerian National
Agency for Food and Drug Administration to prevent the entry of counterfeit
drugs in Nigeria by improving regulations and strengthening judicial
enforcement. 

The cerebrospinal meningitis epidemic that struck Nigeria in 1996 took at least
12,000 lives over a six-month period, and affected more than 100,000 people. The
results of Pfizer`s clinical study showed that Trovan helped save lives and was
at least as effective as the best treatment available at Kano`s Infectious
Disease Hospital.

Founded in 1849, Pfizer is the world's premier biopharmaceutical company taking
new approaches to better health. We discover, develop, manufacture and deliver

of the participants` parents or guardians, and was consistent with Nigerian
laws. 

"We have been a partner with the people and governments of Nigeria for more than
50 years. The company believes that a mutually agreeable resolution to the
Trovan cases is the best way to continue that relationship and allow Pfizer and
the Nigerian governments to focus on what matters - improving healthcare for all
Nigerians," said Pfizer Senior Vice President and Associate General Counsel Brad
Lerman. 

Under the terms of the settlement with Kano State, Pfizer has agreed to: (1)
establish a Healthcare/Meningitis Fund from which study participants can receive
financial support; (2) underwrite several healthcare initiatives chosen by the
Kano State government that benefit the people of Kano State, totaling US$30
million over a period of two years; and (3) reimburse Kano State for US$10
million in legal costs associated with the litigation. The Healthcare/Meningitis
Fund will be available to all individuals who meet the qualification criteria
necessary to verify their participation in the 1996 Trovan clinical study. The
Fund will be administered by an independent six-member Board of Trustees, with
three members each chosen by Pfizer and the Kano State government. The Board
will make the final determinations on eligibility and levels of financial
support. The maximum amount that could be disbursed by the Fund is US$35
million, but the final amount will depend on the total number of valid claims
submitted. 

Kano State and Pfizer will name a separate six-member board to oversee the $30
million allocated to support health initiatives designated by Kano State. 

"We are especially pleased that the benefits of this settlement will be directed
first and foremost to those who contracted meningitis in 1996 and also
participated in the clinical study at that time," Mr. Lerman said. "With the
procedures in place for the Healthcare/Meningitis Fund, the people of Nigeria
will have confidence that the parties have taken strong steps to ensure that the
funds reach only those for whom they are intended." 

The settlement`s healthcare initiatives build on Pfizer`s work in Nigeria for
more than 50 years. In August 1957, Pfizer became the first U.S. pharmaceutical
company to establish operations in Nigeria. Since that time, the company has
contributed to the well-being of Nigerians by providing quality medicines,
creating jobs, developing local expertise, and bringing foreign investment and
innovative healthcare solutions to the country. Nigeria is a part of Pfizer`s
presence in Africa, and the company looks forward to its continued health
partnership with the governments and people of Nigeria. 

Today, the company participates in and supports several initiatives in
partnership with the government, the private health sector and nongovernmental
organizations that benefit the health of the Nigerian people and the country`s
healthcare system. For instance, Pfizer routinely conducts disease awareness
campaigns through public education programs. Pfizer also invests in developing
local health expertise through health education and good clinical practice
workshops. Lastly, Pfizer is working in partnership with the Nigerian National
Agency for Food and Drug Administration to prevent the entry of counterfeit
drugs in Nigeria by improving regulations and strengthening judicial
enforcement. 

The cerebrospinal meningitis epidemic that struck Nigeria in 1996 took at least
12,000 lives over a six-month period, and affected more than 100,000 people. The
results of Pfizer`s clinical study showed that Trovan helped save lives and was
at least as effective as the best treatment available at Kano`s Infectious
Disease Hospital.

 (Recasts first paragraph, adds background, details, quote)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, July 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
reported a steeper-than-expected drop in quarterly profit as
natural gas and crude oil prices slid from a year ago and the
global recession hurt demand for fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon shares fell 1.6 percent in early trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, which raked in record profits last year, has seen
earnings wither as crude oil prices have fallen by more than
half from a year ago. Refiners have also seen margins under
pressure as weakness in industrial demand for fuels like diesel
has caused a buildup in stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It looks disappointing," said Phil Weiss, an analyst at
Argus Research. "They missed on margins and production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company,
said second-quarter net income was $3.95 billion, or 81 cents
per share, down from $11.68 billion, or $2.22 per share, a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings excluding one-time items were $4.09 billion, or 84
cents per share. Analysts on average had expected $1.02 per
share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue fell 46 percent to $74.46 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Global economic conditions continue to impact the energy
industry both in the volatility of commodity prices and reduced
demand for products," Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive,
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second-quarter production fell 3 percent from a year
earlier, the Irving, Texas, company said. Analysts had been
looking for production to be flat or slightly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings in the company's exploration and production
business fell 62 percent to $3.8 billion, while earnings in the
refining unit fell 67 percent to $512 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first six months of the year, Exxon said it spent
$12.3 billion, in line with its longer-term plan for capital
spending of $125 billion over 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the second quarter Exxon repurchased 75 million shares
of its stock at a gross cost of $5.2 billion. In the third
quarter it expects to buy back $4 billion of stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon were down $1.16 to $70.27 in early trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.

EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED: 

"Global economic conditions continue to impact the energy industry both in the
volatility of commodity prices and reduced demand for products.In spite of these
challenges, ExxonMobil achieved solid results.We continued our capital
investment program at near record levels while returning over $16 billion to our
shareholders during the first half of the year.

"ExxonMobil`s second quarter 2009 earnings excluding special items were $4.1
billion, down 66% from the second quarter of 2008.Earnings per share excluding
special items were down 63% reflecting lower earnings and the benefit of the
share purchase program.Earnings for the second quarter of 2009 were $4.0
billion, down 66% from last year, and included a special charge of $140 million
for interest related to the Valdez punitive damages award.Second quarter 2008
earnings included a charge of $290 million related to the Valdez punitive
damages award.

"First half earnings excluding special items decreased 62% compared to the first
half of 2008 reflecting lower crude oil and natural gas realizations.Earnings
for the first half of 2009 were also down 62% versus 2008.

"ExxonMobil continued its robust capital investment program.For the first half
of 2009, spending on capital and exploration projects was $12.3 billion, in line
with our longer term plan.

"The Corporation distributed a total of $7.0 billion to shareholders in the
second quarter, through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares
outstanding."

SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

* Earnings excluding special items were $4,090 million, a decrease of 66% or
$7,880 million from the second quarter of 2008. 
* Earnings per share excluding special items were $0.84, a decrease of 63%. 
* Earnings were down 66% from the second quarter of 2008. Earnings for the
second quarter of 2009 included a special charge of $140 million for interest
related to the Valdez punitive damages award. Earnings for the second quarter of
2008 included a charge of $290 million related to the Valdez punitive damages
award. 
* Capital and exploration expenditures were $6.6 billion, down 6% from the
second quarter of 2008, mainly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
* The effective income tax rate increased to 50% from 49%. 
* Oil-equivalent production decreased about 3% from the second quarter of 2008.
Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production was down about 2.5%. 
* Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately $3.0 billion,
including asset sales of $0.8 billion. 
* Share purchases of $5.0 billion reduced shares outstanding by 1.5%. 
* Qatargas 2 Train 4, the first of two LNG trains associated with this project,
commenced full scale production. With an annual output of 7.8 million tons per
year, it is the largest LNG production train in service in the world. 
* Start up of the Piceance Phase 1 project in western Colorado was achieved. The
new facilities have the capacity to process up to 200 million cubic feet of
natural gas per day. Production has ramped up to over 80 million cubic feet per
day and is expected to continue to increase in the second half of the year. 
* ExxonMobil`s joint venture in Fujian Province, China, announced the start up
of the 160-thousand-barrel-per-day crude and vacuum distillation units in the
new integrated refining and petrochemical complex.

Second Quarter 2009 vs. Second Quarter 2008

Upstream earnings were $3,812 million, down $6,200 million from the second
quarter of 2008. Lower crude oil and natural gas realizations accounted for the
decline, reducing earnings approximately $6.1 billion. 

On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased about 3% from the second
quarter of 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota
effects and divestments, production was down about 2.5%. 

Liquids production totaled 2,347 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 44 kbd
from the second quarter of 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes,
OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was flat, as field
decline was offset by increased production from projects in the United States
and west Africa, and lower maintenance activity. 

Second quarter natural gas production was 8,013 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per
day), down 476 mcfd from 2008. New production volumes from project additions in
Qatar, the United States and the North Sea were more than offset by field
decline and lower European demand. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $813 million, $1,221 million lower
than the second quarter of 2008. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $2,999 million,
down $4,979 million from last year. 

Downstream earnings of $512 million were down $1,046 million from the second
quarter of 2008. Lower margins drove the decline, reducing earnings
approximately $1.0 billion, as weaker refining margins more than offset stronger
marketing margins. Petroleum product sales of 6,487 kbd were 288 kbd lower than
last year's second quarter, mainly reflecting asset sales and lower demand. 

The U.S. Downstream recorded a loss of $15 million, down $308 million from the
second quarter of 2008. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $527 million were $738
million lower than last year. 

Chemical earnings of $367 million were $320 million lower than the second
quarter of 2008. Lower volumes reduced earnings approximately $150 million,
while weaker margins decreased earnings by about $100 million. Hurricane repair
costs and unfavorable foreign exchange effects also reduced earnings. Second
quarter prime product sales of 6,267 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 451 kt
lower than the prior year primarily due to weaker demand. 

Corporate and financing expenses excluding special items were $601 million, up
$314 million due mainly to lower interest income. 

During the second quarter of 2009, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 75 million
shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $5.2 billion.
These purchases included $5.0 billion to reduce the number of shares
outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with
the company's benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from
4,880 million at the end of the first quarter to 4,806 million at the end of the
second quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently
anticipated to equal $4.0 billion in the third quarter of 2009. Purchases may be
made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be
increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 

First Half 2009 vs. First Half 2008

Earnings of $8,500 million ($1.73 per share) decreased $14,070 million from
2008. Earnings for 2009 included a special charge of $140 million for interest
related to the Valdez punitive damages award. Earnings for 2008 included a
charge of $290 million related to the Valdez punitive damages award. Excluding
these impacts, 2009 earnings decreased by $14,220 million. 

FIRST HALF HIGHLIGHTS

* Earnings excluding special items were $8,640 million, down 62%. 
* Earnings per share excluding special items decreased 59% to $1.76, reflecting
lower earnings and the continued reduction in the number of shares outstanding. 
* Earnings were down 62% from 2008. Earnings for 2009 included a special charge
of $140 million for interest related to the Valdez punitive damages award.
Earnings for 2008 included a charge of $290 million related to the Valdez
punitive damages award. 
* Oil equivalent production decreased less than 2% from 2008. Excluding the
impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production
was flat. 
* Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately $12.0 billion,
including $0.9 billion from asset sales. 
* The Corporation distributed a total of $16.0 billion to shareholders in the
first half of 2009 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares
outstanding. 
* Dividends per share of $0.82 increased 9%. 
* Capital and exploration expenditures were $12.3 billion, down 1% versus 2008
due to the stronger U.S. dollar.

Upstream earnings were $7,315 million, down $11,482 million from 2008. Lower
crude oil and natural gas realizations decreased earnings approximately $11.0
billion while higher operating costs reduced earnings about $600 million. 

On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased less than 2% from last year.
Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production was flat. 

Liquids production of 2,411 kbd decreased 19 kbd from 2008. Excluding the
impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production
was up over 1%, as new volumes from project additions in west Africa and the
United States, and lower maintenance activity, were partly offset by field
decline. 

Natural gas production of 9,094 mcfd decreased 265 mcfd from 2008. Higher
volumes from Qatar and North Sea projects were more than offset by field decline
and lower European demand. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2009 were $1,173 million, a decrease
of $2,492 million. Earnings outside the U.S. were $6,142 million, $8,990 million
lower than last year. 

Downstream earnings of $1,645 million were $1,079 million lower than 2008.
Weaker margins reduced earnings approximately $300 million. Lower volumes and
refinery optimization associated with weaker demand reduced earnings about $500
million. Higher operating costs mainly associated with planned work activity
also reduced earnings. Petroleum product sales of 6,461 kbd decreased from 6,798
kbd in 2008, mainly reflecting asset sales and lower demand. 

U.S. Downstream earnings were $337 million, down $354 million. Non-U.S.
Downstream earnings were $1,308 million, $725 million lower than last year. 

Chemical earnings of $717 million decreased $998 million from 2008. Lower
volumes reduced earnings by approximately $450 million while lower margins
reduced earnings about $350 million. Unfavorable foreign exchange effects and
hurricane costs also decreased earnings. Prime product sales of 11,794 kt were
down 1,502 kt from 2008. 

Corporate and financing expenses excluding special items were $1,037 million, up
$661 million mainly due to lower interest income. 

Gross share purchases through the first half of 2009 were $13.1 billion,
reducing shares outstanding by 3.4%.

in long-term oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry; completion of repair projects as planned; unforeseen
technical difficulties; political events or disturbances; reservoir performance;
the outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and acts of terrorism or sabotage;
changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under
the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" on our website and in Item 1A of
ExxonMobil's 2008 Form 10-K.We assume no duty to update these statements as of
any future date.References to quantities of oil expected to be developed may
include amounts not yet classified as proved reserves but that we believe will
ultimately be produced.

Frequently used terms

Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both earnings
excluding special items and earnings per share excluding special items.Both are
non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of
base business performance across periods.A reconciliation to net income
attributable to ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.The release also includes
cash flow from operations and asset sales.Because of the regular nature of our
asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors
to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities
when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing
activities.A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is
shown in Attachment II.Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used

Accounting standards adopted in first quarter 2009

Effective January 1, 2009, ExxonMobil adopted the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's (FASB) Statement No. 160 (FAS 160), "Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements - an Amendment of ARB No. 51". FAS 160 changed
the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which were recharacterized
as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity.FAS 160
required retrospective adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements
for existing minority interests.All other requirements of FAS 160 will be
applied prospectively. The adoption of FAS 160 did not have a material impact on
the Corporation`s financial statements.

References to total corporate earnings mean net income attributable to
ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the income statement.Unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, special items, earnings excluding special items,
Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and
earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable
to noncontrolling interests.

Board's Staff Position (FSP) on the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.
03-6-1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
Transactions are Participating Securities".The FSP required that all unvested
share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends
should be included in the basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) calculation. Prior-year
EPS numbers have been adjusted retrospectively on a consistent basis with 2009
reporting. This standard did not affect the consolidated financial position or

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Donald Paul Brings Energy Industry Expertise to Algae-to-Fuel Innovator
SAN CARLOS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
LiveFuels, Inc., a developer of algae-based renewable fuel, today announced the
addition of Dr. Donald (Don) L. Paul to the company`s scientific advisory board.


Dr. Paul spent 33 years working with Chevron, ultimately retiring in 2008 as
vice president and chief technology officer (CTO) and currently directs the
Energy Institute at the University of Southern California (USC), helping to
shape the university`s larger efforts in the areas of energy systems and
technology. 

"We know today that biofuel technology can create renewable materials which
integrate into the petroleum processing system to produce transport fuels; what
we need are business models for producing them sustainably and at the much
larger scale needed to materially diversify our long-term liquid supply," said
Dr. Paul. "LiveFuels may be the only startup company that has thought about
algal biofuel production from start-to-finish in the context of the existing
fuel infrastructure." 

As CTO of Chevron, Dr. Paul led the global energy company`s multiple research
and technology subsidiaries, focusing on industrialization of technologies
ranging from exploration and processing solutions to competitive biofuel
systems. Dr. Paul oversaw Chevron`s efforts to build partnerships with U.S.
government agencies and national laboratories in energy research and
development, as well as alternative fuel infrastructure, high-performance
computing, and cyber-security. 

Along with his duties at Chevron, Dr. Paul put together the challenging 2007 and
2008 "Supply" sections of the National Petroleum Council`s publication Hard
Truths: Facing the Hard Truths about Energy. One of the essential findings of
that report was the world`s supply system must significantly expand the
production of liquids from "unconventional" sources, including
biologically-derived feedstock. 

"Don`s knowledge of the energy industry is awe-inspiring," said CEO Lissa
Morgenthaler-Jones. "Working with the current energy infrastructure will be
imperative for sustainable algae companies. Few people on earth understand
energy like Don Paul and we are fortunate he joined our team." 

About LiveFuels, Inc.

LiveFuels was founded in 2006 to develop an efficient and scalable algae-based
biofuel process. After a year of strategic planning with DOE national labs,
LiveFuels began pilot operations across the U.S. The company has generated
extensive intellectual property and is well on its way to producing an
economically feasible and sustainable algal fuel.

&lt;p&gt;Major Front-End Engineering and Design Contract Awarded for Two-Train Liquefied
Natural Gas Facility
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)today announced the award of a major front-end
engineering and design (FEED) contract for the first phase of the Wheatstone
natural gas development in northwest Australia. 

Chevron awarded the contract for the first phase of the project - which consists
of two liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing trains each with a capacity of
about 4.3 million tons per year and a domestic gas plant - to Bechtel Oil, Gas &amp;
Chemicals, Inc. The facility will be supplied initially from Chevron`s 100
percent interest in the Wheatstone Field and the Chevron-operated Iago Field. 

The facility will be located at Ashburton North on the mainland of Western
Australia. 

"Awarding the contract moves the Wheatstone project a step closer to
commercialization, assists in realizing our strategy of developing our large
natural-gas resource base in Australia and further enhances our position as a
leading supplier of LNG in the Asia-Pacific region and internationally," said
George Kirkland, executive vice president, Global Upstream and Gas, Chevron
Corporation. 

"We are committed to moving forward our two big Australian LNG projects -
Wheatstone and the Gorgon development," Kirkland said. 

Chevron expects to make a final investment decision on the Wheatstone project in
2011. 

Discovered in 2004, Chevron`s Wheatstone Field is located in the WA-253-P and
WA-17-R permit areas in water depths of around 650 feet (200 meters). The
adjacent Iago Field was discovered in 2000 and spans two retention permits,
WA-17-R, which is wholly owned by Chevron Australia, and WA-16-R, which Chevron
has a majority interest. Together, these fields hold enough natural gas to
supply a two-train LNG development. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

NEW YORK &amp; SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and Medivation, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDVN) today announced the
initiation of a Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug dimebon
(latrepirdine)* in patients with Huntington disease. The international safety
and efficacy trial, known as HORIZON, is designed to evaluate the potential
benefits of dimebon on cognition (thinking and memory) in patients with
Huntington disease. The companies also announced that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to dimebon for the
treatment of Huntington disease. 

"Based on the promising results of our Phase 2 trial of dimebon in Huntington
disease, we are pleased to advance dimebon into late-stage clinical
development," said Lynn Seely, M.D., chief medical officer for Medivation.
"Huntington disease is a fatal genetic disease for which no medications are
currently approved by the FDA to treat the cognitive impairment associated with
the condition." 

Orphan status is granted by the FDA to promote the development of products that
demonstrate promise for the treatment of rare diseases affecting fewer than
200,000 Americans annually, such as Huntington disease, which affects 30,000
individuals in the United States, with another 150,000 at risk. Orphan drug
designation entitles Pfizer and Medivation to a seven-year period of marketing
exclusivity in the United States for dimebon if it is approved by the FDA for
the treatment of Huntington disease. It also enables the companies to apply for
research funding, tax credits for certain research expenses, and a waiver from
the FDA's application user fee. 

*Latrepirdine is the proposed generic (nonproprietary) name for dimebon. 

Design of the HORIZON Study

The double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial will enroll approximately 350
patients with Huntington disease at approximately 50 sites in North America,
Europe and Australia. Patients will be randomized to receive either dimebon
(latrepirdine) 20 mg three times daily or placebo for six months. 

The primary endpoints of the trial are the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE),
which measures cognition, and the Clinician`s Interview-Based Impression of
Change, plus caregiver input (CIBIC-plus), which measures global function. The
trial will include only patients who have cognitive impairment, as subjectively
assessed by an investigator and objectively by MMSE score. 

Secondary endpoints include the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), which measures
behavior; the Alzheimer`s Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living
(ADCS-ADL), which measures self-care and daily function; and the Unified
Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS`99) Total Motor Score, which measures
motor impairment; and safety. 

The trial is being conducted in collaboration with the Huntington Study Group
(HSG) and the European Huntington`s Disease Network (EHDN). The HSG is a
non-profit group of experienced clinical trial investigators from medical
centers in the United States and abroad dedicated to clinical research of
Huntington disease. The EHDN is a non-profit network of professionals providing
an infrastructure for large scale Huntington disease clinical trials throughout
Europe.

About Dimebon

Dimebon (latrepirdine) is an investigational drug in Phase 3 development for the
treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington disease (HD). In
preclinical studies, dimebon has been shown to protect brain cells from damage
and enhance brain cell survival, potentially by stabilizing and improving
mitochondrial function. The dimebon mechanism is distinct from currently
available AD and HD medications. 

About Huntington Disease

Huntington disease is a rare, neurodegenerative disease that is caused by the
death of specific brain cells. The genetic disorder is characterized by the
gradual development of involuntary muscle movements, cognitive impairment and
severe behavioral disturbances. No medications are currently approved to treat
the cognitive impairment (thinking and memory) of Huntington disease. 

About the Pfizer/Medivation Dimebon Collaboration

Medivation and Pfizer have a global collaboration to develop and commercialize
dimebon for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington disease. Under
the terms of the agreement, the companies are working in partnership to seek FDA
approval for dimebon and bring it to market in the United States. In addition,
following FDA approval, Medivation will co-promote dimebon to specialty
physicians in the U.S. Pfizer has responsibility for development, regulatory and
commercialization outside of the U.S.

&lt;p&gt;  REDWOOD SHORES, CA, Jul 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL)

     News Facts

    Technology Integration Group (TIG), a premier computer systems integrator
and IT solutions consultant, chose Oracle over SAP, Microsoft and Infor
to support future growth, gain enterprise-wide access to information and
improve its service organization. After conducting a comprehensive
evaluation of multiple vendors, TIG found Oracle to be the best choice
because of the integrated business intelligence capabilities built into
Oracle's ERP applications, as well as Oracle's best-in-class CRM On
Demand offering. A midsize company, TIG will replace a 12-year old
character-based ERP system from Forte with the Oracle(R) E-Business Suite
Release 12.1. The company plans to deploy Oracle's customer relationship
management (CRM), financials, projects, channel revenue management and
supply chain management (SCM) applications as well as Oracle Business
Intelligence Enterprise Edition. The company will also retire an outdated
CRM system from Astea and deploy Oracle CRM On Demand.

     Modernized Systems Will Deliver More Complete Information and Improve
Service

    The Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12.1 will provide TIG with integrated
analytics from Oracle Business Intelligence Applications including Oracle
Financial Analytics, Oracle Procurement and Spend Analytics, Oracle
Project Analytics and Oracle Supply Chain and Order Management Analytics,
which are prebuilt intelligence solutions that deliver insight into key
business processes. As a result, the company will be able to make
proactive real-time decisions that will help improve customer service.
With TIG's legacy CRM solution, the company's sales reps managed and
maintained customer data using excel spreadsheets. With Oracle CRM On
Demand, customer and sales information will be centralized and pipeline
tools will help the sales team manage and track the progress of the sales
cycle. Using Oracle Field Service, TIG will be able to dispatch instant,
automated information to its field reps so that they can provide timely
information to customers and better manage timelines and customers'
expectations. Oracle Project Management will give TIG visibility and
control in order to plan projects effectively, allocate resources and
forecast to completion, while managing customer expectations. As a
reseller of most of the major hardware and software vendors, Oracle
Channel Revenue Management will be critical in helping TIG gain complete
fund management capabilities, enabling the sales force to view planned,
committed, earned and paid sales. Relying on Oracle Depot Repair, TIG
will be able to manage its efforts with Dell to provide K-12 schools and
school districts with refurbished laptops. Oracle Depot Repair will help
streamline and automate the entire in-house repair and service process
for TIG. 

     Supporting Quote

    "After evaluating vendors like SAP and Microsoft, Oracle stood out as the
right choice for this important IT transformation," said Erik Quade,
Chief Information Officer, Technology Integration Group. "The access to
real-time information that the Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12.1 can
provide will have a profound impact on our relationships with vendors,
customers and employees. We expect this implementation to make us more
efficient and productive while significantly impacting our bottom line."

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats story released July 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Advertisers see efficiencies from Yahoo/Microsoft deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Ad execs peg search market at $25 bln-$30 bln globally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Advertisers mixed on pricing impact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, July 29 (Reuters) - Advertising executives
gave the thumbs up to the pairing of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) in the search market, hoping it will
provide marketers with more bang against Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They said the partnership would create more efficiencies in
reaching and tracking online audiences in the roughly $30
billion global search advertising market, by essentially
merging the No. 2 and No. 3 search players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is extremely encouraging and introduces more balance
into the search and display markets," said Sir Martin Sorrell,
chief executive of British advertising group WPP (WPP.L). "It
is good for our clients and our agencies and for regulators."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the deal announced on Wednesday, Microsoft will
provide the search technology for Yahoo's sites and have a
10-year license to integrate Yahoo's technologies, aiming to be
a more powerful No. 2 to market leader Google.[ID:nN29216653].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Typically today, an ad agency working for say, Toyota Motor
Corp, may go to Google, Yahoo or Microsoft to bid on text ads
that appear alongside the results of search keywords like
"hybrid vehicle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ad executives said the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo
will give advertisers a stronger alternative to Google that
provides scale with the benefit of a combined platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to comScore, Google has a 65 percent share of the
U.S. search market, compared with Yahoo's 19.6 percent and
Microsoft's 8.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You go from a three-party race to a two-party race,"
according to Randy Schwartz, national search director at Carat
USA, who said the deal could level the playing field in some
advertising categories if clients see they are now reaching
audiences more effectively through Microsoft and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are sectors that might see comparable value and see
as much traffic from a Yahoo search as a Google search," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUZZ FOR BING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the Microsoft/Yahoo partnership proves effective in
boosting advertisers' return on their ads, it could eventually
eat into Google's market share or expand the overall market,
advertising experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If the word gets out that Bing has plenty of volume and is
performing at a high rate, whether through better return on
investment or click rates, that's when advertisers will decide
whether or not to shift more budget to Bing," said Rob Garner,
search strategy director for agency iCrossing. Bing is
Microsoft's new search engine, introduced in late May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garner said if more advertisers are drawn to a particular
category as a result of the deal, ad prices could potentially
increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Let's say there's more buzz around a particular campaign,
then you might see 10 advertisers rather than two competing on
that one spot. Typically, when you get more advertisers into
the mix, prices go up," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Garner and other ad executives warned that many other
factors, such as the economy, could also affect pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ad executives believe the deal, expected to be reviewed
closely by regulators and pegged to close in 2010, would render
better efficiencies and eliminate hassles formerly involved in
preparing three separate campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joshua Stylman, chief executive of advertising agency
Reprise Media, which counts Microsoft among its clients,
believes there should be cost savings for marketers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our hope is that there will be savings in terms of
efficiencies. The search category is a highly
technology-leverage business in terms of planning, trafficking,
tracking and optimizing campaigns," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Not having to manage certain systems due to this
combination should shrink the cost structure of managing
advertising campaigns. What this means is there is one less set
of pipes we need to accommodate over times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You should get more Bing for the buck," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  But others are convinced Google will continue to reign
supreme. "Bing's platform for search advertisers is vastly
inferior to that of Yahoo, so consolidating Bing and Yahoo on a
single platform will reinforce the inferior experience compared
to Google and could, in the long term, severely damage future
revenues," said  Martin McNulty, director, search marketing
specialist Trafficbroker.

&lt;p&gt;4,000 New Visa payWave Points of Acceptance Target Vending, Kiosk, Laundry and
Other Self-Serve Retail Markets
MALVERN, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
USA Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:USAT) announced today the signing of an amendment
to its existing agreement with Visa to expand the deployment of its ePort
cashless payment solution for vending machines by another 2,500 terminals, for a
total of up to 4,000 terminals, that are expected to be installed in markets
nationwide. 

The G8 ePort terminals were especially designed to accept Visa payWave, a new
payment feature that allows consumers to simply wave their Visa card in front of
the ePort terminal to pay for their vended purchase. A signature is not required
for purchases under $25, and consumers retain control of the card during the

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Deutsche Bank AG were issued subpoenas by a U.S. Senate panel looking for evidence of fraud in the 2008 mortgage-market meltdown, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper said the focus of the investigation is on whether internal communications show executives at the banks had private doubts on the soundness of the mortgage-related securities they were putting together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people told the paper Washington Mutual Inc, which is now mostly owned by JP Morgan Chase  Co, was also issued a subpoena by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper said several other financial institutions may also have received subpoenas from the sub-committee that is headed by Senator Carl Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment on the subpoena to the paper, while Deutsche Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment by the paper. Subcommittee investigators declined to comment to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subcommittee subpoena raises factual questions and asks for various company correspondence, the paper said, citing a person who reviewed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate and Goldman Sachs could not be reached for comment by Reuters after regular U.S. business hours, while a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman in Hong Kong declined immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ajay Kamalakaran in Bangalore; Editing by Anshuman Daga)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It took Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc several years to find common ground on the best way to team up in the Internet search market. Now comes the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partnership announced on Wednesday seeks to challenge the dominance of Google Inc, but executives at Yahoo and Microsoft acknowledge that building a search powerhouse will be a multi-year effort -- in a business where staying ahead of the competition, not playing catch-up, is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unlike previous discussions which involved an outright acquisition of Yahoo by Microsoft, this deal will create a number of uncertainties for both companies as they fuse disparate technologies, cultures and business priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankee analyst Carl Howe said integrating two separate search engines is an inherently thorny process that requires merging vast and often incompatible indices of Web data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the ways they could have made this simple was to say 'We're throwing away Yahoo's search engine and going with (Microsoft's) Bing,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ask any two banks that have ever been through a merger," Howe said. "The announcement of a merger is easy, it's combining the back end that takes years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the 10-year deal, search on Yahoo's websites will be generated by Microsoft's new Bing search engine. Microsoft will license Yahoo's search technology, allowing it to integrate certain aspects of it into Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's advertising search product, AdCenter, will also replace Yahoo's equivalent product, Panama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies together would hold roughly 30 percent of the U.S. search market, which makes their combined audience a more attractive place for marketers to spend their dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pieces are all there. Microsoft has a great product already developed. Yahoo has a massive audience," said Bob Davis, a partner at Highland Capital Partners and the former CEO of search engine Lycos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But integration will be a lengthy and potentially distracting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft projected the complete, worldwide transition will take up to 24 months after the deal's closing and clearance by government regulators expected in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENGINEERS RELOCATE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Yahoo search engineers will be asked to take jobs at Microsoft, whose Redmond, Washington headquarters is far removed from Yahoo's California homebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft representative would not say where the company's search efforts were based, but noted that the search team is located in various offices including Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It ties them together but in a complicated way with no long-term certainty and limited control," said Ryan Jacob, chief investment officer of Jacob Asset Management, which owns Yahoo shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was in the camp that thought Microsoft should have just bought them. As a Yahoo shareholder, that would have been the best outcome. From Microsoft's standpoint, what happens if Yahoo decides to go somewhere else?" he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any hiccups or technical glitches that affect search results or ad placements while the new technology is being rolled out might not sit well among advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo said the deal will allow it to save $200 million in capital expenditure and boost annual operating income by $500 million. Those cost savings could be crucial to a company that has seen revenue growth stall and profit margins shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits to innovation are less clear though, said Boston University Professor N. Venkat Venktatraman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What they should watch out for is Google coming into it with new innovations that these two companies independently do not know how to respond to, and collectively may not have gotten their processes for innovation in tune," said Venkat Venktatraman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz said handing off search technology to Microsoft will free Yahoo to invest in its websites, display advertising products and mobile products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an increasingly vital ingredient in developing such products is the data that's gleaned from search queries, which can be used to create more targeted experiences for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said determining how search data is shared between them was the most complex part of the negotiations. But the specific details are vague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are they giving up the rights to use the search data that powers display advertising? That's still not clear," said Brigantine Advisors analyst Colin Gillis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic, editing by Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft's 10-year Internet search deal with Yahoo will get a hard look from Obama administration antitrust enforcers but will probably squeak through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the partnership knocks the number of competing search engines down to two, from three, antitrust experts said this might have happened anyway. The partners say they will join to create a stronger competitor to Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question is: is it OK? Is two enough?" said antitrust attorney John Briggs of Axinn, Veltrop and Harkrider LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this deal would be really easy to get through in the Bush administration. They wouldn't even look twice at it," said Briggs. "This administration is going to look twice at it, and probably in the end let it through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Bing search engine will power search queries on Yahoo's sites. The companies said they expected the deal to be "closely reviewed" by regulators, but were hopeful it would close in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has 65 percent of the search market, versus Yahoo, with 29.6 percent, and Microsoft's 8.4 percent, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without this deal, I think it would be really unlikely that you'd have a market with three robust search providers in 10 years," said Beau Buffier, an attorney with Shearman  Sterling LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Herb Kohl, whose subcommittee oversees the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said the panel was concerned that advertisers would face higher rates and that there might be less innovation because of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal between Yahoo and Microsoft -- industry giants and direct competitors in Internet advertising and search markets -- warrants our careful scrutiny," he said in a statement. "The implications of this proposed joint agreement will be closely reviewed by my subcommittee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Evan Stewart, an antitrust expert with Zuckerman Spaeder, said the deal creates a stronger competitor to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is good for the competitive marketplace," said Stewart. "It will be easier to get access to this advertising space at presumably more competitive rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The length of the deal means that regulators will likely view it almost as a merger, said Richard Brosnick of law firm Butzel Long. "In Internet time, that might as well be 100 years. A 10-year exclusive license might as well be an acquisition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is expected to be watching the deal closely. It dropped its own advertising deal with Yahoo last year under pressure from the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and advertisers had lobbied the department hard to stop Google from gaining further market power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, so far, is saying little publicly about the Microsoft-Yahoo deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There has traditionally been a lot of competition online, and our experience is that competition brings about great things for users," said Google spokesman Adam Kovacevich in an emailed statement. "We're interested to learn more about the deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-Yahoo deal was inevitable following Yahoo's rejection of a Microsoft takeover, the collapse of the Google-Yahoo deal and upheaval in Yahoo's executive suites, said Stewart, the attorney with Zuckerman Spaeder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that the new management is up and running, she (Carol Bartz) is revisiting the basic strategic wisdom of entering into a strategic partnership with Microsoft," he said. "This is like the directors cut. This is a similar movie but with different scenes added or changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Advertising executives gave the thumbs up to the pairing of Yahoo Inc and Microsoft Corp in the search market, hoping it will provide marketers with more bang against Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said the partnership would create more efficiencies in reaching and tracking online audiences in the roughly $30 billion global search advertising market, by essentially merging the No. 2 and No. 3 search players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is extremely encouraging and introduces more balance into the search and display markets," said Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of British advertising group WPP. "It is good for our clients and our agencies and for regulators."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal announced on Wednesday, Microsoft will provide the search technology for Yahoo's sites and have a 10-year license to integrate Yahoo's technologies, aiming to be a more powerful No. 2 to market leader Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically today, an ad agency working for say, Toyota Motor Corp, may go to Google, Yahoo or Microsoft to bid on text ads that appear alongside the results of search keywords like "hybrid vehicle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad executives said the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo will give advertisers a stronger alternative to Google that provides scale with the benefit of a combined platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to comScore, Google has a 65 percent share of the U.S. search market, compared with Yahoo's 19.6 percent and Microsoft's 8.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You go from a three-party race to a two-party race," according to Randy Schwartz, national search director at Carat USA, who said the deal could level the playing field in some advertising categories if clients see they are now reaching audiences more effectively through Microsoft and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are sectors that might see comparable value and see as much traffic from a Yahoo search as a Google search," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUZZ FOR BING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Microsoft/Yahoo partnership proves effective in boosting advertisers' return on their ads, it could eventually eat into Google's market share or expand the overall market, advertising experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the word gets out that Bing has plenty of volume and is performing at a high rate, whether through better return on investment or click rates, that's when advertisers will decide whether or not to shift more budget to Bing," said Rob Garner, search strategy director for agency iCrossing. Bing is Microsoft's new search engine, introduced in late May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garner said if more advertisers are drawn to a particular category as a result of the deal, ad prices could potentially increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's say there's more buzz around a particular campaign, then you might see 10 advertisers rather than two competing on that one spot. Typically, when you get more advertisers into the mix, prices go up," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Garner and other ad executives warned that many other factors, such as the economy, could also affect pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad executives believe the deal, expected to be reviewed closely by regulators and pegged to close in 2010, would render better efficiencies and eliminate hassles formerly involved in preparing three separate campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Stylman, chief executive of advertising agency Reprise Media, which counts Microsoft among its clients, believes there should be cost savings for marketers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our hope is that there will be savings in terms of efficiencies. The search category is a highly technology-leverage business in terms of planning, trafficking, tracking and optimizing campaigns," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not having to manage certain systems due to this combination should shrink the cost structure of managing advertising campaigns. What this means is there is one less set of pipes we need to accommodate over times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should get more Bing for the buck," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But others are convinced Google will continue to reign supreme. "Bing's platform for search advertisers is vastly inferior to that of Yahoo, so consolidating Bing and Yahoo on a single platform will reinforce the inferior experience compared to Google and could, in the long term, severely damage future revenues," said Martin McNulty, director, search marketing specialist Trafficbroker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kate Holton in London; editing by Tiffany Wu and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc inked a 10-year Web search deal to challenge market leader Google Inc but stopped short of combining their display advertising businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-expected deal effectively means Microsoft's new Bing search engine will be combined with Yahoo's experience attracting advertisers to pose the first serious threat to Google, if the companies get regulatory approval and can make the partnership work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares fell 11 percent as some investors were disappointed by the limited scope of the deal, which did not include upfront payments for Yahoo, which could have been $1.5 billion or more, according to a Sanford Bernstein research report last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft will be able to report a greater share in terms of search... And Yahoo doesn't have to spend any more money on search," said Barry Diller, chief executive of IAC/InterActiveCorp, which owns rival search engine Ask.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft were flat, while Google shares fell 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo still face antitrust and privacy issues and likely opposition from Google, which dropped its plans for an advertising partnership with Yahoo last year under pressure from the U.S. Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies said they expect the deal to be "closely reviewed" by regulators, but were "hopeful" it can close in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said on Wednesday only that it was "interested" in the Microsoft/Yahoo partnership, while the chairman of the U.S. Senate antitrust panel said the deal warrants "careful scrutiny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal culminates a lengthy, and at times contentious, dance between the two companies. They have been in on-and-off-again talks on a search partnership since Yahoo rebuffed Microsoft's $47.5 billion takeover bid last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer clashed last year with former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, who was strongly opposed to an all-out acquisition. Relations between the two companies improved under new Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz, who took the reins in January and started to shake up Yahoo's top management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer and Bartz met "three or four times" over the past six months as they hammered out a deal, according to Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW THE DEAL WORKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal announced on Wednesday, Microsoft's Bing search engine will power search queries on Yahoo's sites. Yahoo's sales force will be responsible for selling premium advertising based on search terms for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's AdCenter technology will serve the standard sponsored links that appear alongside search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Yahoo CEO Bartz had previously said that any deal would require a partner with "boatloads of money," she said on Wednesday that the agreement provided "boatloads of value", saying the revenue share agreement in the Microsoft deal was more valuable to Yahoo than a one-time payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having a big up-front cash payment doesn't really help us from an operating standpoint," Bartz said in a conference call with Microsoft CEO Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will compensate Yahoo through a revenue-sharing agreement that pays Yahoo at an initial rate of 88 percent of search revenue generated on Yahoo sites in the first five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each company will maintain its own separate display advertising business and sales force, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said it will be tough for the two companies to make a significant dent in Google's dominance in search, but it was a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to comScore, Google has a 65 percent share of the U.S. search market, compared to Yahoo's 19.6 percent and Microsoft's 8.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, it's a big positive for two companies that have been struggling to keep up with Google. This consolidates their resources and allows them to make a more concerted push as the No. 2 entity," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross Sandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo estimated the deal will boost its annual operating income by about $500 million and yield capital expenditure savings of $200 million. Yahoo also expects the deal to boost annual operating cash flow by about $275 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo reported income from operations of $13 million in 2008, hurt by $487.5 million in goodwill impairment charge and $107 million in restructuring charges. In 2007, operating income was $695 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's Bartz said that the deal will result in "redundancies" in Yahoo's staff, though she declined to be specific. She stressed that any changes would not occur until after approval by antitrust authorities in the U.S. and Europe and full implementation of the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo were down $1.89 at $15.33 on Nasdaq, while shares of Microsoft were flat at $23.47. Google shares were down $5.13 at $434.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tiffany Wu, Paul Thomasch, Robert MacMillan and Diane Bartz; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Hanesbrands, Inc. (NYSE: HBI) as the Bull of
the Day and CEMEX, S.A. de C.V. (NYSE: CX) the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP),
ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Hanesbrands, Inc. (NYSE: HBI) management's business model requires only modest
sales growth to create substantial EPS growth. Earnings are being driven by
brand-building and cost-reduction initiatives. 

Since the spin-off in September 2006, the company has reduced debt by $511
million, lowering interest expense from the post spin-off financial structure.
However, management is reporting non-GAAP EPS, which excludes unusual actions,
which may be distorting perceived earnings. 

The Buy rating is maintained due to valuation. Currently, our six-month target
price is $20.50 per share. 

Bear of the Day: 

We are keeping our Sell rating on CEMEX, S.A. de C.V. (NYSE: CX). The company
posted weak results in the second quarter of 2009 with more than 50% decrease in
net income year over year. 

The continued weak cement volumes in Spain and the U.S. are problematic. The
short-term outlook for the company remains highly uncertain based on the
prolonged downturns in the residential sector and tight credit conditions
coupled with fall in the real estate prices throughout the world. 

Moreover, the continuous increase in net debt is extremely concerning. Our
six-month target is $8 per share. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Conoco Beats Despite Slump

ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) reported second-quarter earnings of $0.87 per share,
above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83 per share. 

However, earnings per share were well below from the year-earlier figure of
$3.50. This significant downfall was mainly due to significantly lower commodity
prices and a steep decline in worldwide marketing margins, which more than
offset production improvements and lower costs. 

While turnaround in crude oil prices is beneficial to the entire sector, we are
maintaining our Hold recommendation on ConocoPhillips shares given the company`s
competitive disadvantages relative to its super major peers. These disadvantages
include a high-cost OECD-centric asset base and heavy exposure to the relative
tentative outlook for U.S. natural gas (more than a third of total volumes) and
refining markets. Our preferred names in the integrated space remain ExxonMobil
(NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings of The Walt Disney Company
(Disney) and subsidiaries: 

The Walt Disney Company 

--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'; 

--Short-term IDR 'F1'; 

--Commercial paper 'F1'. 

ABC Inc. 

--IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'. 

Disney Enterprises, Inc. 

--IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

Disney's ratings continue to reflect the company's leading market positions in
core businesses, unique brand franchises, substantial cable network carriage
revenues, and strong credit metrics. In addition, the company continues to
benefit from leveraging its hit-driven brands across multiple platforms. Credit
concerns center on the cyclical volatility of its theme parks and resorts,
studio and broadcast networks businesses, as well as the maturation of the DVD
business. The Stable Outlook takes into account the company's current liquidity
as well as Fitch's expectations related to the overall long-term secular profile
of the company's businesses. 

Disney's four main business lines: Media Networks, Parks &amp; Resorts, Filmed
Entertainment, and Consumer Products are all exposed to the general cyclicality
related to the existing economic environment. This is in addition to the
hit-driven nature of some of these businesses that is common in the media &amp;
entertainment sector. Fitch's 'A' rating takes into account Fitch's expectations
that the remainder of 2009 and 2010 will likely produce results substantially
below the levels of the last few years when the company was at a cyclical peak
in all business lines. While gross leverage could approximate 2.0 times (x)
during this downturn, net metrics excluding non-recourse debt should continue to
be strong in the 'A' rating category. 

Fitch expects Disney's Media Networks segment (approximately 45% of total
revenue) to continue to face a difficult environment as weakness in the
advertising markets and increases in programming expenses should offset
increases in carriage revenues at the segments cable networks. Advertising will
likely continue to be down at least in the mid-to-high single digits at the
company's ABC Network and ESPN cable channel with significantly greater
decreases at the company's 10 local stations. While secular issues exist in this
segment, Fitch expects the majority of this pressure to be cyclical especially
at the company's cable networks. At nearly 20% of total revenue, the carriage
fees generated from ESPN, the Disney Channel and ABC Family are one of the most
important factors of existing ratings. While issues related to increased
competition and viewing habits continue to arise, Fitch believes Disney's cable
brands should continue to hold significant value. Cash flows from the company's
syndication business have been strong over the last few years and will likely
continue over the short term. However, issues exist over the intermediate term
related to online viewing monetization and a maturing pipeline of content. Fitch
does not expect the current weak upfront environment to impact existing ratings.


The company's Parks and Resorts segment makes up approximately 30% of total
revenue and should continue to be pressured from the existing macro-economic
environment. The company's focus on its lower cost value hotel packages, in
addition to structural changes made over the last several years, should continue
to offset some of the pressure. While the promotional 'Buy 4 Get 3 Free' offer
has resulted in material declines to hotel revenues, this represents only 20% of
segment revenues and has resulted in less severe downturns for a large portion
of the remaining 80% of segment revenue (admissions, food, beverage,
merchandise, etc.). Fitch is currently estimating per capita spend to continue
to be weak well into 2010 and therefore for results at the Parks and Resorts
segment to finish slightly better than 2002 and 2003 figures. 

As has been the case for several years, Disney's Filmed Entertainment segment
faces difficult comparisons from a theatrical and home entertainment standpoint.
Fitch expects the segments' revenues to continue to be down materially in 2009
generally because of its release schedule. Expected releases for 2010 and 2011
appear strong. As a long-term secular issue, Fitch does not expect this segment
to reach EBITDA levels of the past few years given trends with the home
entertainment market. However, Fitch believes cash flows from Disney's home
entertainment business may prove more resilient than the rest of the industry.
Industry DVD sales have matured and are currently experiencing declines that
Fitch believes are secular in nature, as Fitch expects a permanent downward
shift in consumer DVD purchases as well as increasing issues related to digital
piracy. Specifically related to Disney, Fitch believes the company may be able
to outperform the industry based on the expectation that family entertainment
DVD sales will continue to be a low-cost portion of household budgets, as well
as the expectation for less piracy issues in this genre. 

Despite the difficult environment, and the expectations for relatively weak
performance over the next 12-18 months, Fitch expects Disney's consolidated net
leverage ratio to remain below 2 times (x) through this downturn, and for its
net leverage ratio excluding net non-recourse debt and adjusting for equity and
minority dividends to remain below 1.5x. Stresses to the company's operations
required to impair financial flexibility are consistent with an 'A' rating, and
Fitch believes that even in the midst of a difficult economy, potential rating
pressure is less likely to be driven by operating performance than by
discretionary actions on the part of management. There is no room in the current
ratings for management to resume a material share repurchase program in this
environment. 

Disney's results of 2002 and 2003 provide a historical backdrop for how these
businesses operate when an economic downturn coincides with a cyclical decline
in hit programming. While there are new secular issues layered into the current
situation, Fitch believes various aspects of the company are better positioned
for this downturn. These include significant increases in stable carriage
revenues since the last downturn, a better infrastructure for leveraging its
content across all segments, better operations management at Parks and Resorts,
and no integration issues with acquisitions. That being said, Fitch does not
expect EBITDA for the company to return to 2008 levels over the foreseeable
future. 

Liquidity is strong and is supported by $3.1 billion of cash and over $4 billion
in revolver availability. The company's maturity schedule is material with
nearly $1 billion due each year through 2013, however, could be handled
organically if needed as Fitch expects the company to generate in excess of $1.5
billion in free cash flow at the cyclical trough. Debt maturities includes
non-government maturities of $100 million - $200 million per year at Euro Disney
which Fitch expects could have trouble funding through organic cash flow. The
company last reported its pension funded status at Sept. 30, 2009 when it was
94% funded. Fitch expects the funded status to have weakened materially since
then; however, we do not anticipate any issues with the company funding its PPA
obligations over the next seven years. The company's $4.5 billion in credit
facilities is comprised of two distinct $2.25 billion facilities that come due
in 2010 and 2011. A significant reduction in the capacity of these facilities
upon renewal would likely have no impact on existing ratings. 

Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of
any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats
the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the
absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney
Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch
does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'
category-investment grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial policies
and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney Company.
Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if we viewed there to be
heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade (where
Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp posted on Friday a 71 percent drop in profit on weaker energy prices and fuel demand due to the economic slump, but it raised estimated 2009 output and said cost cuts were on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The profit was short of analysts' estimates, but bad news from larger rivals a day before had prepared investors for disappointment, and shares of the second-largest U.S. oil company rose 1.6 percent to within sight of a six-week high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron made a net profit of $1.75 billion, or 87 cents per share, in the second quarter, down from $5.98 billion, or $2.90 a share, last year. Wall Street's average earnings forecast was 97 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 51 percent to $40 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said earnings from its oil and gas production arm fell 79 percent, though production rose by 133,000 barrels to 2.67 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Kirkland, the executive vice president for global upstream and gas, now expects average 2009 production of 2.66 million boed, up from a previous estimate of 2.63 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said the production drop from existing fields would be about 6 percent for 2009, versus a previous estimate of 7 percent, and he indicated further improvements in the decline rate were possible as many of Chevron's big projects ramp up to capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron believes it is close to getting approval to develop one of those, the Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in northwest Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nothing can happen until we get the environmental permit," Kirkland told analysts on a conference call, adding that it was also waiting on final financial approval from partners Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Exxon reported a steeper-than-expected drop in profit, and Shell's CEO said he saw no near-term respite from weak demand, excess capacity and high costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it was ahead of pace in its efforts to cut 2009 operating expenses by 10 percent, or $2.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Cuggino, chief executive of Pacific Heights Asset Management, said it was rare for major oil companies to deliver big surprises, even if their refining margins moved up and down from quarter to quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all know what oil prices are doing," said Cuggino, whose San Francisco-based group manages about $3.6 billion in investments, including shares of Chevron. "We're long-term investors, and we like the stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares rose 1.6 percent to $68.77. At Thursday's close, the stock was down 8 percent this year, compared with a 2 percent rise for the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of oil stocks. Companies with refining arms have been hit hardest. Exxon and Shell are both down 11 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, said its U.S. refining operations posted a loss of $95 million in the quarter, pulling global refining profits down to $161 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price of benchmark U.S. crude averaged just short of $60 per barrel in the second quarter, up from $43 in the first quarter but less than half of year-earlier levels. U.S. natural gas prices remain near seven-year lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily in New York and Braden Reddall in San Francisco; editing by John Wallace, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

upstream and gas, now expects average 2009 production of 2.66
million boed, up from a previous estimate of 2.63 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said the production drop from existing fields would
be about 6 percent for 2009, versus a previous estimate of 7
percent, and he indicated further improvements in the decline
rate were possible as many of Chevron's big projects ramp up to
capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron believes it is close to getting approval to develop
one of those, the Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in
northwest Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Nothing can happen until we get the environmental permit,"
Kirkland told analysts on a conference call, adding that it was
also waiting on final financial approval from partners Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, Exxon reported a steeper-than-expected drop in
profit, and Shell's CEO said he saw no near-term respite from
weak demand, excess capacity and high costs. [ID:nLU411549]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said it was ahead of pace in its efforts to cut
2009 operating expenses by 10 percent, or $2.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Cuggino, chief executive of Pacific Heights Asset
Management, said it was rare for major oil companies to deliver
big surprises, even if their refining margins moved up and down
from quarter to quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We all know what oil prices are doing," said Cuggino,
whose San Francisco-based group manages about $3.6 billion in
investments, including shares of Chevron. "We're long-term
investors, and we like the stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares rose 1.6 percent to $68.77. At Thursday's
close, the stock was down 8 percent this year, compared with a
2 percent rise for the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of
oil stocks .OIX. Companies with refining arms have been hit
hardest. Exxon and Shell are both down 11 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, said its U.S.
refining operations posted a loss of $95 million in the
quarter, pulling global refining profits down to $161 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price of benchmark U.S. crude averaged just short of
$60 per barrel in the second quarter, up from $43 in the first
quarter but less than half of year-earlier levels. U.S. natural
gas prices remain near seven-year lows.

&lt;p&gt;KHABAROVSK, Russia (Reuters) - Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom (GAZP.MM) hopes this year to agree with U.S. energy major ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) over gas supplies to a new far eastern pipeline, a senior Gazprom executive said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia needs gas from the ExxonMobil-led Sakhalin-1 project to feed industrial growth in its Far East, a point emphasized by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin at a ceremony to launch welding of a major trunk pipeline that will run to the port of Vladivostok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will hold negotiations (with ExxonMobil). We hope to conclude them this year," Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Alexander Ananenkov told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer, plans to start gas flows through the far eastern pipeline in the third quarter of 2011. But the company has yet to secure the gas from offshore deposits around the Pacific island of Sakhalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the inauguration ceremony, Putin asked Ananenkov to guarantee gas deliveries by 2012 for a new car assembly line being constructed by Russian firm Sollers (SVAV.MM), a project aimed at denting Japanese cars' dominance in Russia's Far East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananenkov responded by saying Gazprom did not have gas for Sollers because it cannot contract enough for the new pipeline from the operators of the Sakhalin-1 consortium. He asked for state help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATED PRICES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananenkov said Gazprom was offering market price, but added the Sakhalin-1 consortium should understand it will be selling gas domestically. Regulated prices are expected to be 2.5-3 times lower than export prices in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the key issue in negotiations," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both the buyer and the seller should understand it will be deliveries to the domestic market. The final price should take that into account."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil has said it is studying all options for selling gas from Sakhalin-1, which is owned by a consortium that also includes Russian oil firm Rosneft (ROSN.MM), Japan's Itochu (8001.T) and Marubeni (8002.T) and India's ONGC (ONGC.BO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sollers plans to build the assembly line in the port city of Vladivostok. Putin's conversation with Ananenkov could portend problems for the Sakhalin-1 consortium, which had hoped for more lucrative export deals with Asian buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said the consortium has no choice but to bow to Gazprom. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) lost control of the Sakhalin-2 to Gazprom after pressure from ecological agencies, which threatened to impose huge fines on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia makes no secret it dislikes the production sharing agreements struck in the 1990s during the period of low oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananenkov said the 1.6 billion cubic meters of gas Russia will get as royalties from Gazprom-led Sakhalin-2 project would not be enough to cover regional requirements, while gas from the Sakhalin-3 project is expected no earlier than 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said electricity generators in Vladivostok required 1.2 bcm, while Sakhalin's power station consumes up to 500 million cubic meters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am looking at Sakhalin-1 because other customers are already asking for gas," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Robin Paxton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adobe on Thursday patched 12 vulnerabilities in Flash Player, including three it inherited from faulty Microsoft development code and one that hackers have been exploiting for at least a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a security advisory published Thursday afternoon, Adobe briefly spelled out the dozen vulnerabilities, 10 that were pegged as potentially leading to hijacked systems or with hackers executing their own malware on a machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vulnerabilities affect the Windows, Mac and Linux versions of Flash Player. Still to patch: the Solaris edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Adobe had promised that it would patch Flash on July 30 after reports surfaced of attacks against both Flash and Adobe Reader, a popular PDF viewer. Hackers have been attacking users running Flash through drive-bys hosted on compromised Web sites, and targeting people running Reader via a bug in the Flash interpreter baked into that program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reader and Adobe Acrobat are slated for an update today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe also took care of three vulnerabilities within Flash that were the result of the company's developers using a buggy Microsoft code "library" when they built the program. On Wednesday, Adobe confirmed that it had used Microsoft's flawed development code -- specifically the Active Template Library (ATL), a code library included with Visual Studio -- to create both Flash Player and Shockwave Player. The latter was patched that same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Microsoft acknowledged that ATL contained multiple vulnerabilities, at least one harking back to early 2008. Although Microsoft patched Visual Studio to eliminate the bugs in ATL, those updates do not fix software developed using the flawed library. Instead, vendors must use the patched Visual Studio to recompile their code, then distribute the new, secure software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what Adobe did yesterday while working a tight schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Brad Arkin, Adobe's director for product security and privacy, Microsoft notified his company of the ATL vulnerabilities on July 10, just over two weeks before Microsoft announced the flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That timetable differed from what Microsoft hinted at Tuesday, when Mike Reavey, the director of the company's Security Response Center, said that his security team had been investigating the ATL flaws since early 2008, and had been coordinating with third-party vendors to examine their code for the past several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Microsoft] was moving very fast to pull resources together to help us do triage on our products," said Arkin, who added that Adobe spent considerable time and resources figuring out which of its products contained the buggy ATL code. With more than 200 products in its portfolio, Adobe was forced to prioritize, and so concentrated on its most widely-used software, such as Flash Player, Shockwave Player, Reader and Acrobat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two included the ATL vulnerabilities, while the second pair did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The hard part was determining what was vulnerable," said Arkin. "It's easy to rebuild a test version, but then we had to make sure [that] works and make sure we didn't break it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkin refused to criticize Microsoft for the ATL bugs, and instead praised Adobe's partner for sharing information in the run-up to Thursday's patches. But he acknowledged Microsoft's flaws had been trouble. "A bug in code that gets replicated across multiple products compounds the work necessary to triage. It was a lot of work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe intended to patch the ATL vulnerabilities in a Windows-only update to Flash Aug. 11, but when Microsoft moved up its own release, Adobe followed suit. "We were trying to be very careful that we didn't publish or release information before they were ready," Arkin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flash Player 9.0.246.0 and 10.0.32.18 for Windows, Mac and Linux can be downloaded from Adobe's Web site. Alternately, users can use Flash's built-in automatic update mechanism to grab the new versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Arizona Woman Chosen from More Than 147,000 Entries to Receive Home Valued at
$200,000
ANAHEIM, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Kristin Pierce`s first trip to the Disneyland Resort was a memorable one. The
Arizona wife and mother met Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, toured the
Innoventions Dream Home and received the keys to a free home. 

Pierce was named the winner of the Taylor Morrison Dream Home Giveaway in June
and visited the popular California resort on July 31 along with her husband,
Geoffrey, to receive the ceremonial key for her new home, which is currently
being built in a Phoenix suburb. 

Pierce was chosen from more than 147,000 entries to receive the new home, valued
at $200,000 by Taylor Morrison. The win was especially sweet for the Pierces,
who had spent more than a year looking for a foreclosed home they could afford
to purchase. 

"We must have toured at least 50 houses," Kristin said of her foreclosure
search. "We had finally found one that was in pretty good shape so we were
excited to start the process. Then this happened. It was unbelievable." 

After meeting Mickey and Minnie and receiving the key to her home, Pierce was
given a tour of the Innoventions Dream Home before embarking on her weekend
vacation at the resort. The Innoventions Dream Home was built by Taylor Morrison
in a partnership with Disneyland, Microsoft, HP and Life&#921;ware last year. 

When the Pierces return to Arizona, they can look forward to watching their new
home being built at Stratland Estates in Gilbert, Arizona. The couple chose a
four-bedroom model called the Vintage, a 2,200-square-foot home that should be
finished by the holidays. 

"It`s always great to hear of stories like these," said Taylor Morrison
President and CEO Sheryl Palmer. "It`s even better when you can take a role in
making someone`s dream come true."

 (Recast first paragraph, update prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks headed for a
lower open on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy
contracted for the fourth straight quarter and consumer
spending dropped sharply, fanned fears that a recovery would be
weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though the contraction was at a slower-than-expected
pace, second-quarter gross domestic product report, which
measures total goods and services produced within the U.S.
borders, revealed that consumers remained under strain.
[ID:nN30365410]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the report, consumer spending dipped at 1.2
percent rate after rising 0.6 percent in the previous quarter.
Consumer spending is a key driver of corporate profitability,
accounting for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think the market's selling off because of the consumer
element. That's 70 percent of GDP and that was a little softer
than we thought," said Burt White, chief investment officer at
LPL Financial in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The silver lining is we're continuing to see inventories
get drawn down. You can only do that for so long because that
just means that companies are finding their shelves are more
and more bare, and I think that bodes well for the second
half."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 were 2.20 points lower and below
fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 shed 16
points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures lost 3.75 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors have pushed stocks to 9-month highs over the past
month, emboldened by stronger-than-expected second-quarter
corporate profits and hopes of economic stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stocks to watch include Chevron Corp (CVX.N), whose
quarterly profit missed Wall Street estimates. The stock was
down 1.3 percent at $66.85 before the bell.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Jul 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Tensoft (http://www.tensoft.com), a leading end-to-end ERP and supply
chain solution provider for the semiconductor and high tech industries,
announced today that Tensoft executives attending the Microsoft Worldwide
Partner Conference, held recently in New Orleans, re-affirmed the
company's commitment to its vertical industry strategy and to its
partnership with Microsoft.

    Because of its status as a Microsoft Managed National ISV, the Tensoft
executives met with key Microsoft executives from several divisions to
discuss plans for FY10. Microsoft both promotes and supports vertical
industry strategy for its Microsoft Dynamics partners, which has been
Tensoft's key strategy since its inception in 1996.

    "Microsoft often refers to the functionality that vertical industry ISVs
like Tensoft offer as 'the last mile' of vertical-specific functionality,"
said Tensoft CEO Bob Scarborough. "Industry-specific capabilities offered
by Tensoft and other Managed National ISVs vastly extend the core
functionality of Microsoft Dynamics and fill the system requirements gap
for a specific vertical industry."

    "In the past, companies often filled that gap with custom solutions, but
these are both expensive to develop and support and often make upgrades
difficult or impractical," Scarborough continued. "Off-the-shelf vertical
solutions, like Tensoft's FSM, MNC and RCM products, are now the preferred
way to meet industry-specific needs, while providing built-in industry
best practices and repeatable processes. We're pleased to see that
Microsoft has renewed its vertical-industry focus with new levels of
emphasis and support."

    Doug Kennedy, Vice President, Microsoft Dynamics Partners, provided
further insight in a 7/13/09 feature story on Microsoft Presspass
(www.microsoft.com/presspass): "We've enhanced the Microsoft Dynamics
partner channel program to take full advantage of the steady growth in
demand for vertically specific enterprise resource planning (ERP) and
customer relationship management (CRM) solutions. Working closely with our
partners and customers over the past few years, we've seen this shift in
demand and the subsequent growth and higher level of profitability of
partners [like Tensoft] who provide more vertically focused solutions
based on Microsoft Dynamics."

    "These enhancements align with our ERP and CRM solutions strategy and are
a critical step toward helping our vertically oriented partners increase
their scale and productivity, and helping horizontally oriented partners
transition to be more specialized so they can take advantage of growth

&lt;p&gt; * Gazprom needs 8-10 bcm of gas for new pipeline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Putin says domestic market should take priority&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * ExxonMobil considering all options for Sakhalin-1 sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Gazprom sees deal with Exxon this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Energy minister says agreement possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds Gazprom deputy CEO, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gleb Bryanski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KHABAROVSK, Russia, July 31 (Reuters) - Russia will push
ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) hard to secure gas for a new pipeline in
the Far East after Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called on
Friday for domestic energy needs to take priority over exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom (GAZP.MM) has begun
welding a major trunk pipeline to link offshore gas fields
around the Pacific island of Sakhalin with the port of
Vladivostok. Gazprom needs gas from the ExxonMobil-led
Sakhalin-1 project to fill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would like to stress that the domestic market will be a
priority for the gas from East Siberia and the Far East," Putin
said at a ceremony to mark the launch of construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon signed its Sakhalin-1 deal with Russia in the early
1990s under a production sharing agreement that guarantees
stable returns regardless of changes in legislation and exempts
the U.S. energy major from Gazprom's export monopoly on gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 1,350 km (844 mile) first phase of the
Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok pipeline is due to come on
stream in the third quarter of 2011, but Gazprom and ExxonMobil
have yet to agree on gas supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will need to work intensively with Exxon to obtain these
8 to 10 billion cubic metres of gas from Sakhalin-1," Gazprom
Deputy Chief Executive Alexander Ananenkov told Putin after the
inauguration ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Putin questioned Ananenkov on whether Gazprom can guarantee
gas supplies for domestic consumers such as the new car assembly
line built by car maker Sollers (SVAV.MM), which has just
received a $158 million loan from state bank VEB.
 Ananenkov responded by saying Gazprom did not have gas for
Sollers because it could not contract enough for the new
pipeline from the operators of the Sakhalin-1 consortium. He
asked for state help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ananenkov later told Reuters in an interview that Gazprom
was hoping to conclude negotiations with Exxon this year.
[ID:nLV429681].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant
near the pipeline's southern terminus in Vladivostok, which
would produce gas for export by sea to Asia. It launched
Russia's first LNG plant this year, linked to the separate
Sakhalin-2 project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sakhalin-1 consortium's earlier plans to supply gas to
China have been put on hold, despite contracts with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect Russia to step up pressure on the
consortium, which also includes Russia's Rosneft (ROSN.MM),
Japan's Itochu (8001.T) and Marubeni (8002.T) and India's ONGC
(ONGC.BO), to sell cheap gas. [ID:nLU707235]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ENOUGH GAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko estimated the cost of
the entire far eastern pipeline project at $11 billion. He said
Gazprom's costs could be passed on to consumers by a nationwide
increase in tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pipeline will initially have capacity for 6 billion
cubic metres of gas per year, rising to about 30 bcm after
subsequent stages increase its length to 1,800 km (1,125 miles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This will satisfy the priority gas demands of a number of
far eastern Russian regions and create additional potential for
gas exports to the Asia-Pacific region," Gazprom said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shmatko, also at the inauguration ceremony in Khabarovsk,
said any potential supply problems related to the project would
be temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is gas there. There is the possibility of agreeing
with Exxon and receiving at least 8 billion cubic metres," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil spokesman Konstantin von Eggert said on Wednesday
the company was studying all options on sales from Sakhalin-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project has been producing around 200,000 barrels per
day of oil after starting a few years ago. But production
sharing agreements such as that signed by Exxon lost favour in
Russia during the economic revival from the 1998 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under such deals, foreign partners start paying Russian
taxes only after they have recouped their original investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Energy Ministry thinks that current projects, in
today's environment, are not particularly attractive for
Russia," Shmatko said. "We do not want to have more production
sharing agreements, and we will not have them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the Sakhalin-2 oil and LNG project, Royal Dutch Shell
(RDSa.L) ceded control after months of pressure from Russian
ecological agencies, which threatened to impose huge fines on
it. Gazprom now runs the project.

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today reported earnings of $1.75 billion ($0.87
per share - diluted) for the second quarter 2009, compared with $5.98 billion
($2.90 per share - diluted) in the 2008 second quarter. Foreign-currency effects
reduced earnings in the 2009 quarter by $453 million, compared with a benefit to
income of $126 million a year earlier. 

For the first half of 2009, earnings were $3.58 billion ($1.79 per share -
diluted), down 68 percent from $11.14 billion ($5.38 per share - diluted) in the
first six months of 2008. 

Sales and other operating revenues in the second quarter 2009 were $40 billion,
compared with $81 billion in the year-ago quarter. First-half 2009 revenues were
$75 billion, versus $146 billion in the corresponding 2008 period. The decline
in both comparative periods was primarily due to lower prices for refined
products, crude oil and natural gas.

"Operationally, we had another very successful quarter," said Chairman and CEO
Dave O`Reilly. "In our upstream business, we had major project start-ups at
Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico and Frade offshore Brazil, and our company`s net
oil-equivalent production increased 5 percent from a year ago. In our downstream
operations, refinery utilization was higher than in last year`s second quarter."


O`Reilly said a 79 percent drop in upstream quarterly earnings, which was driven
by lower prices for crude oil and natural gas, was offset only partially by
improved results in the downstream segment. "Although our downstream results
were better than a year ago, the demand for refined products remained generally
weak," O`Reilly added. "Sales margins in this year`s second quarter were narrow,
and our U.S. downstream business operated at a loss." On a companywide basis,
O`Reilly said aggressive cost-management efforts resulted in about a 15 percent
decrease in recurring operating, selling, general and administrative expenses
between periods. 

In additional comments on upstream activities, O`Reilly said another deepwater
project is expected to start up this year at 31 percent-owned Tombua-Landana in
Angola. Total maximum oil-equivalent production of approximately 100,000 barrels
per day is projected to be reached in 2011. Recent milestones for other upstream
projects were achieved in:

* United States - Start-up in the Gulf of Mexico of deepwater production at the
58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field, reaching maximum total
oil-equivalent production of 135,000 barrels per day during July. 
* Brazil - Start-up of deepwater production at the 52 percent-owned and operated
Frade Field, which is projected to attain maximum production of 90,000 barrels
per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2011. 
* Angola - Start-up of the 39 percent-owned and operated Mafumeira Norte
offshore project, which is expected to reach maximum total daily production of
30,000 barrels of crude oil and 30 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2011. 
* Republic of the Congo - Discovery of crude oil offshore at 31 percent-owned
Moho Nord Marine-4 in the area of the Moho-Bilondo project, which commenced
production in 2008. 
* Australia - Award of the front-end engineering and design (FEED) contract for
an LNG plant with two trains, each with a processing capacity of 4.3 million
metric tons per year, and a co-located domestic gas plant that would support
development of the company`s 100 percent-owned Wheatstone Field and other
natural gas resources off the northwest coast. 
* Australia - Recommendation by the Western Australian Environmental Protection
Authority (EPA) that the proposed revision and expansion of the 50 percent-owned
and operated Gorgon Project to add a third 5 million metric-ton-per-year LNG
train could meet the EPA`s environmental objectives, representing a necessary
step in Chevron`s process to make a final investment decision later this year.

UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

Worldwide oil-equivalent production was 2.67 million barrels per day in the
second quarter 2009, up 133,000 barrels per day, or about 5 percent, from 2.54
million in the 2008 second quarter. The increase was driven by project start-ups
since last year`s second quarter and the impact of lower prices on cost-recovery
and variable-royalty volumes in certain production contracts outside the United
States. Production quotas imposed by OPEC curtailed company crude-oil production
in the 2009 second quarter by about 35,000 barrels per day.

U.S. upstream earnings of $273 million in the second quarter of 2009 were down
$1.9 billion from a year earlier on sharply lower prices for crude oil and
natural gas. Operating expenses were lower between periods, but this benefit to
income was more than offset by higher depreciation expense, including charges of
approximately $100 million for asset impairments in this year`s second quarter. 

The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids was
approximately $50 in the 2009 quarter, compared with $109 a year ago. The
average sales price of natural gas was $3.27 per thousand cubic feet, down from
$9.84 in last year`s second quarter. 

Net oil-equivalent production of 700,000 barrels per day was down 2,000 from the
second quarter 2008. A production increase of approximately 60,000 barrels per
day between periods was associated with the late-2008 start-up of the Blind
Faith Field and the start-up in this year`s second quarter of the Tahiti Field,
both in the Gulf of Mexico. This impact was offset, however, by normal field
declines, production shut in as a result of last year`s hurricanes and asset
sales. The net liquids component of production was up about 7 percent to 467,000
barrels per day. Net natural-gas production of 1.40 billion cubic feet per day
in the 2009 quarter declined 12 percent between periods, with most of the
decrease associated with normal field declines, asset sales and the hurricane
effects.

International upstream earnings of $1.2 billion decreased $3.8 billion from the
second quarter 2008 due mainly to lower prices for crude oil and natural gas.
Foreign-currency effects decreased earnings by $476 million in the 2009 period,
compared with an increase of $80 million in last year`s second quarter.
Depreciation expenses were higher between periods, and the 2009 quarter included
charges of about $100 million for exploratory well write-offs. 

The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids in the
2009 quarter was $53, compared with $110 a year earlier. The average price of
natural gas was $3.73 per thousand cubic feet, down from $5.44 in last year`s
second quarter. 

Net oil-equivalent production of 1.97 million barrels per day in the second
quarter 2009 was up 7 percent, or 135,000 barrels per day, from a year ago.
Included in the increase was about 185,000 barrels per day of production
associated with the start-up since last year`s second quarter of two major
projects in Nigeria and Kazakhstan. Decreases to production between periods
resulted mainly from OPEC-related curtailments of 35,000 barrels per day, 30,000
barrels per day that were offline due to civil unrest in the onshore area of
Nigeria, about 25,000 barrels per day of lower oil-equivalent natural gas
production in Thailand and the effect of normal field declines. The impact of
lower prices on cost-recovery volumes and other contractual provisions affecting
Chevron`s share of production resulted in a net increase of about 85,000 barrels
per day between periods. The net liquids component of production increased about
11 percent from a year ago to 1.37 million barrels per day, while net natural
gas production declined about 1 percent to 3.59 billion cubic feet per day.

U.S. downstream operations incurred a loss of $95 million in the second quarter
2009, compared with a loss of $682 million a year earlier. Margins on the sales
of refined products were weak in both periods. Operating expenses declined from
last year`s second quarter, which included higher expenses associated with
planned shutdowns for refinery maintenance. Refinery crude-input of 923,000
barrels per day in the second quarter 2009 increased 13 percent, or 107,000
barrels per day, from the year-ago period. 

Refined-product sales volumes increased 4 percent from the second quarter of
2008 to 1.44 million barrels per day primarily due to higher gasoline sales.
Branded gasoline sales volumes were up 7 percent between quarters to 639,000
barrels per day.

International downstream operations earned $256 million in the second quarter
2009, compared with a loss of $52 million a year earlier. Margins on the sale of
refined products improved in most areas, due mainly to a decrease in crude-oil
feedstock costs. Operating expenses were lower between the quarterly periods.
Earnings in the second quarter 2009 included gains of approximately $140 million
associated with asset sales. Foreign-currency effects reduced earnings by $25
million in the 2009 quarter, compared with a $46 million benefit a year earlier.


Refinery crude-input was 970,000 barrels per day in the 2009 second quarter, up
18,000 from the year-ago period. Total refined-product sales volumes of 1.82
million barrels per day in the 2009 second quarter were 12 percent lower than a
year earlier, due mainly to asset sales since the second quarter of last year.
Excluding the impact of 2009 asset sales, sales volumes were down 5 percent
between periods primarily due to lower demand for jet fuel and fuel oil.

Chemical operations earned $108 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared
with $41 million in the year-ago quarter. Earnings of the 50-percent owned
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) and Chevron`s Oronite subsidiary
were both higher between periods. For CPChem, lower utility and manufacturing
costs were partially offset by lower margins on the sale of commodity chemicals.
For Oronite, higher margins on the sale of lubricant and fuel additives more
than offset the effect of lower volumes.

Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "targets,"
"projects," "believes, "seeks," "schedules," "estimates," "budgets" and similar
expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the company`s
control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may
differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking
statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. Unless

equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company`s joint-venture
partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the
potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future
crude-oil and natural-gas development projects; potential delays in the
development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential
disruption or interruption of the company`s net production or manufacturing
facilities or delivery/transportation networks due to war, accidents, political
events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude-oil production quotas that might
be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC); the
potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future
environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or product
changes under existing or future environmental statutes, regulations and
litigation; the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation;

&lt;p&gt;  CORAL GABLES, FL, Jul 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Securities Law Firm of Tramont Guerra &amp; Nunez, PA (TGN) makes an
announcement to all JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) auction rate securities
investors concerning the class action lawsuit (Case No. 09 CV 06199)
filed on July 10, 2009, in the United States District Court Southern
District of New York. The lawsuit filed on behalf of investors alleges
that JP Morgan Chase failed to disclose the level and frequency of their
intervention in auction rate securities (ARS) for which they were the
sole or lead auction dealer. The impact of the intervention through
placing "support bids" led investors to believe that the ARS were
"readily liquid investments" and that the auction market functioned
normally and that there was limited liquidity risk in the securities.
Prospective class members should consider whether an individual
securities arbitration claim filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, (FINRA) is more effective than a class action for recovery of
their investment losses.

    Auction rate securities are usually municipal, corporate or preferred
stocks issued with long term or no maturity dates which reset interest
rates at regular auction intervals. Investors benefited from higher
interest rates than were available from alternative investments. However,
investors did not understand the nature of the auction process and the
risks associated with an auction failure. Investors who are exposed to
these risks suffered damages. Recommendations of unsuitable investments
and/or failure to disclose material risks associated with an investment
are both causes of action that form the basis for individual securities
arbitration claims filed with FINRA.

    The Securities Law Firm of Tramont Guerra &amp; Nunez, PA, is a nationally
recognized, Martindale Hubbell "AV" rated securities law firm. To request
a confidential consultation from a TGN attorney to assist you in
determining whether you have a viable individual claim for investment
losses that exceed $100,000 from a full service brokerage account,

attorney, call (800) 578-0137 and ask for Benjamin Fernandez, Esquire.

edged higher on Friday as investors bet that key economic data
will show the economic slump is ebbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A string of stronger-than-expected second-quarter results
have helped reinforce some optimism about economic
stabilization. Companies posting solid results early Friday

product figures, a measure of all goods and services produced
within the U.S. borders, at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Reuters poll of economists showed a median forecast of a
1.5 percent contraction in the economy in the second quarter on
a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, compared with a more
dramatic 5.5 percent contraction in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 were 4 points higher and above fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 climbed
36 points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures rose 5.75 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "GDP is going to be negative, and everyone knows we're
going to get that second-half rebound. So in a sense it's old
news, but at least it provides a baseline for what the second
half of 2009 is going to be," said Peter Boockvar, equity
strategist at Miller Tabak  Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are rallying because everyone expects to see a pickup
in the second half of the year and it's just going to be a
matter of to what degree."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boockvar added that the market might also get a boost from
so-called window dressing -- when traders ditch laggards in
favor of winners to spruce up client portfolios at the end of
the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. President Barack Obama sought to prepare the country
for the second-quarter GDP figures Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I suspect that the GDP numbers will still show that the
economy contracted in the second quarter (and) that job loss is
still a huge problem," Obama told reporters in the Oval Office.

&lt;p&gt;KHABAROVSK, Russia (Reuters) - Russia will push ExxonMobil Corp hard to secure gas for a new pipeline in the Far East after Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called on Friday for domestic energy needs to take priority over exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom began welding a major trunk pipeline to link offshore gas fields around the Pacific island of Sakhalin with the port of Vladivostok. Gazprom needs gas from the ExxonMobil-led Sakhalin-1 project to fill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would like to stress that the domestic market will be a priority for the gas from East Siberia and the Far East," Putin said at a ceremony to mark the launch of construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon signed its Sakhalin-1 deal with Russia in the early 1990s under a production sharing agreement that guarantees stable returns regardless of changes in legislation and exempts the U.S. energy major from Gazprom's export monopoly on gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1,350 km (844 mile) first phase of the Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok pipeline is due to come on stream in the third quarter of 2011, but Gazprom and ExxonMobil have yet to agree on gas supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will need to work intensively with Exxon to obtain these 8 to 10 billion cubic meters of gas from Sakhalin-1," Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Alexander Ananenkov told Putin after the inauguration ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom, which has faced demand destruction for its pipeline gas in Europe since the start of 2009, says it wants to expand in the gas liquefaction business to tap new markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant near the pipeline's southern terminus in Vladivostok, which would produce gas for export by sea to Asia. It launched Russia's first LNG plant this year, linked to the separate Sakhalin-2 project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sakhalin-1 consortium's earlier plans to supply gas to China have been put on hold, despite contracts with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect Russia to step up pressure on the consortium, which also includes Russia's Rosneft, Japan's Itochu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and Marubeni and India's ONGC, to sell cheap gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENOUGH GAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko estimated the cost of the entire far eastern pipeline project at $11 billion. He said Gazprom's costs could be passed on to consumers by a nationwide increase in tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pipeline will initially have capacity for 6 billion cubic meters of gas per year, rising to about 30 bcm after subsequent stages increase its length to 1,800 km (1,125 miles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will satisfy the priority gas demands of a number of far eastern Russian regions and create additional potential for gas exports to the Asia-Pacific region," Gazprom said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shmatko, also at the inauguration ceremony in the city of Khabarovsk, said any potential supply problems related to the project would be temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is gas there. There is the possibility of agreeing with Exxon and receiving at least 8 billion cubic meters," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil spokesman Konstantin von Eggert said on Wednesday the company was studying all options on sales from Sakhalin-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project has been producing around 200,000 barrels per day of oil after starting a few years ago. But production sharing agreements such as that signed by Exxon lost favor in Russia during the economic revival from the 1998 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under such deals, foreign partners start paying Russian taxes only after they have recouped their original investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Energy Ministry thinks that current projects, in today's environment, are not particularly attractive for Russia," Shmatko said.

&lt;p&gt; * Economist Frank Gong becomes a top China banker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Gong is well known for his bullish China forecasts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Gong expected to seek more corporate clients in China
 (Adds comments from Frank Gong)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By George Chen and Simon Rabinovitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG/BEIJING, July 31 (Reuters) - Frank Gong, a
prominent JPMorgan economist who has been bullish on China's
yuan and economic prospects for years, has been promoted to
vice chairman of the firm's China investment banking division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gong, who made his reputation with a correct forecast of
China's landmark yuan appreciation policy move in 2005, will
also share a role as chairman of JPMorgan's China Diversified
Industry Clients division, the bank said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his new role, Gong, who has been JPMorgan's chief China
economist for five years, will report to Fang Fang, JPMorgan's
China chief executive, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We hope to provide valuable advice to help domestic
companies to grow and help to integrate the Chinese economy
further in the global economy," Gong told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And of course in the process help global companies to get
deeper, more access in the market," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gong was the first foreign investment bank economist to
predict the magnitude of China's economic stimulus package to
counter the global financial crisis in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank statement said he will focus on expanding
JPMorgan's corporate client business in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Domestically there are a lot of opportunities, a lot of
industries need to consolidate," he said, adding that helping
Chinese companies expand abroad through acquisitions will also
be part of his focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A retail giant in the United States with a reputation for
conservative risk-taking, JPMorgan has survived the financial
crisis and benefited from its acquisition of the troubled
investment bank Bear Stearns. [ID:nN236886]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first half of 2009, JPMorgan topped underwriters
globally in terms of fees, outpacing long-term rivals including
Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), according to
Thomson Reuters data and research. [ID:nN30451561]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHINA CONNECTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan helped to underwrite initial public offering of
shares for two Chinese companies -- Zhongwang Holdings Ltd
(1333.HK) ($1.27 billion) in May and BBMG Corp (2009.HK) ($884
million) in July. Zhongwang was ranked as the third largest IPO
worldwide so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gong, who was born in China and holds a Ph.D. in Financial
Economics from Wharton at the University of Pennsylvania,
joined JPMorgan from Bank of America (BAC.N) in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was not the first economist-turned investment banker in
Asia. In April 2007, Morgan Stanley surprisingly announced that
Stephen Roach, its high-profile chief economist known for his
pessimism on the U.S. economy and early foretelling of China's
rise, as its Asia chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Gong and Roach are based in Hong Kong but have been
frequent travelers to mainland China and have close ties with
top Chinese officials and regulators including its central bank
governor, Zhou Xiaochuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(China's) economy is on the path of accelerating recovery
and that process is more sustainable than people thought," said
Gong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Next year growth will be more powered by private
demand-driven factors, rather than simply state-driven
stimulus. Both in terms of quality and speed of growth, next
year will be better than this year," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early this year, Charles Li quit JPMorgan, where he served
as China chairman, to join Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing
(0388.HK) as chief executive of the bourse. [ID:nHKG271695]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A replacement for Li's former top job at JPMorgan has not
been made yet.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO &amp; MINNEAPOLIS (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) und die U.S. Bank, die gr&#246;&#223;te Bank im Besitz von U.S.
Bancorp (NYSE: USB), haben heute die Schaffung von Syncada bekannt gegeben -
einem Joint Venture, das Unternehmen und Regierungsbeh&#246;rden ein
Business-to-Business-Netz (B2B-Netz) bietet, durch das sie Rechnungen bearbeiten
und verfolgen, weltweit Zahlungen t&#228;tigen und empfangen sowie Verbindlichkeiten
und Forderungen von lokalen und globalen Finanzinstituten finanzieren lassen
k&#246;nnen. 

Bei Syncada handelt es sich um ein einzigartiges Netzwerk, das die bew&#228;hrte
Erfahrung von Visa in der Bereitstellung kommerzieller Zahlungsdienste f&#252;r
Finanzinstitute und den Betrieb eines Multibank-Netzwerks mit PowerTrack
kombiniert, dem automatisierten B2B-Netzwerk der U.S. Bank f&#252;r
Rechnungsstellung, Zahlungsabwicklung und Handelsfinanzierung. Mit dem Projekt
k&#246;nnen Finanzinstitute jeder Gr&#246;&#223;e ihren Firmenkunden standardisierte
B2B-Dienstleistungen in Bezug auf elektronische Rechnungsstellung,
Zahlungsabwicklung und Finanzierung mit verschiedensten Zahlungsarten und in
diversen W&#228;hrungen anbieten. Finanzinstitute k&#246;nnen auch ein
Finanzmitteldispositionsgesch&#228;ft auf der Grundlage von Transaktionen und
Krediten aufbauen, indem sie die Netzwerkdienstleistungen ihren Kreditoren und
Debitoren anbieten. 

Syncada erweitert die Vision von Visa und der U.S. Bank mit dem Angebot eines
effizienteren Zahlungssystems f&#252;r Unternehmen und Regierungsbeh&#246;rden, das
unpraktische B2B-Verfahren auf Papier mit einer integrierten, voll
elektronischen Plattform f&#252;r finanzielle Wertsch&#246;pfungsketten ersetzt.

Finanzinstituten, dem neue Banken beitreten

&#8222;Syncada erg&#228;nzt das Kerngesch&#228;ft von Visa im Zahlungsbereich, indem es unsere
F&#228;higkeiten im B2B-Wertsch&#246;pfungskettenmanagement erweitert", sagte Joseph W.

f&#252;r Firmenkunden auszudehnen." 

&#8222;Das Format der U.S. Bank im Zahlungsgesch&#228;ft wuchs durch jahrzehntelange
Investitionen in die Schaffung einer leistungsstarken und effizienten
Zahlungsdienstleistung f&#252;r Unternehmen und beh&#246;rdliche Institutionen. PowerTrack
war der Schl&#252;ssel zu unserem Erfolg im Zahlungsbereich und bei der Gewinnung
neuer Firmenkunden f&#252;r die Bank", sagte Richard K. Davis, Vorstandsvorsitzender,
Pr&#228;sident und CEO von U.S. Bancorp. &#8222;Was wir mit PowerTrack aufgebaut haben wird
durch die Kombination mit der gro&#223;en Erfahrung von Visa im Aufbau eines
Multibank-Netzwerks und die &#220;berf&#252;hrung in Syncada weiteres Wachstum
erm&#246;glichen, indem das Netzwerk neuen Partnern auf der ganzen Welt angeboten
wird. Wir sind stolz auf unsere Investition in Syncada und darauf, dass wir als

die fachlich kompetente Automatisierung von allgemeinen Ausgaben im Bereich
Verbindlichkeiten/Forderungen sowie f&#252;r mehrere Ausgabekategorien wie Fracht,
