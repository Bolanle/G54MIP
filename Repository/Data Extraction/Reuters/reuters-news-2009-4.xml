&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO, April 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is showing
the first signs in months that it could be getting ready to
crawl out of a long recession, the top economist at Goldman
Sachs  GS.N said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Jim O'Neill, Goldman's head of global economic research,
said among key leading indicators, the measure of "new orders
less inventories," derived from the Institute for Supply
Management March factory report was a bright light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That data point is included in Goldman's monthly "Global
Leading Indicators" index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At +9 in March, against -0.7 in February, it was "the best
sign for a few months that the severity of the U.S. recession
might be easing," O'Neill said while giving a presentation to
the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs' current forecast is for the U.S. economy to
shrink by 1.3 percent in 2009 before growing by 2.8 percent in
2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Neill said he looked for the Federal Reserve to keep up
its "aggressive" measures to turn around financial conditions
damaged by the credit crisis that started in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And I think if those things don't work, they will do
more," he said, quipping that the moves could include "hiring
the helicopters and dropping money from the sky."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China last month proposed a sweeping overhaul in the global
monetary system, suggesting the U.S. dollar could eventually be
replaced as the world's main reserve currency by the IMF's
Special Drawing Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Neill, acknowledged as one of the world's top currency
analysts, said such a "radical shift in the role of the dollar"
was not "close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's idea will be most interesting if it is paired with
more flexibility in the rate of its currency, the renminbi,
O'Neill said. "If it isn't, it's not of much use at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ros Krasny; Editing by Bernard Orr)

&lt;p&gt; (Fixes typographical error in paragraph 6 to surprise instead
of sunrise)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, April 1 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has
filed substantially fewer applications for specialty visas for
next year as the weak economy depletes its need for workers, a
top company official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking on the first day the federal government starts
taking applications for so-called H-1B visas, General Counsel
Brad Smith said he believes the industry will likely follow the
software giant's lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think we will see substantially fewer H-1B applications
filed this year. That is the case here at Microsoft," Smith
told reporters on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent years, U.S. immigration officials have been
overwhelmed by applications for H-1B visas, which let U.S.
companies employ foreign guest workers in highly specialized
jobs for three years. But worldwide recession and major layoffs
at companies such as Microsoft and International Business
Machines Corp (IBM.N) have changed the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith also said that, in contrast to last year, most
applications will be for current workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Fewer than half of our applications will be for new
hires," he said. "It won't surprise me if we see that as a
broader trend in the industry as a whole."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith would not comment directly on legislation likely to
be reintroduced soon aimed at ensuring U.S. workers are given
first priority over foreign workers in hiring decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The legislation, backed by Senators Charles Grassley, a
Republican, and Richard Durbin, a Democrat, will likely require
companies to pledge to make a good-faith effort to hire
Americans for a job before seeking a visa for it.

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Apr 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Simba Technologies Inc., industry's choice for standards-based relational
and multi-dimensional data connectivity, announced today the beta release
of its native Microsoft Excel 2007 connector to Oracle's (NASDAQ: ORCL)
Oracle 11g OLAP Option database. The solution, built using Simba's MDX
2005 Query Language technology, provides users with an unprecedented
level of access and functionality that is the same as native Excel
connectivity to Microsoft Analysis Services or SAP NetWeaver(R) BW.

    "Simba's MDX Provider for Oracle OLAP enables use of powerful, new Excel
2007 Pivot Table functionality to provide live Business Intelligence
analysis and presentation capabilities for users," said Amyn Rajan,
Simba's CEO. "Simba's MDX Provider will enable Oracle customers to
natively access their Oracle cube data, perform ad hoc query and analysis
and take full advantage of the latest OLAP and BI functionality within
Excel."

    With native connectivity, Oracle customers can easily and directly
connect Excel to Oracle data cubes to gain advanced analytics without the
expense and infrastructure servers required by other solutions.

    "Oracle Database OLAP Option has significant performance and functional
advantages over non-Oracle rivals," said Raymond Roccaforte, Oracle's
Vice President of Data Warehousing and Analytics. "Exposing Oracle OLAP
Option's strengths and capabilities to users through native Excel
connectivity makes sense because of Excel's prevalence in BI. Simba's
deep knowledge of the MDX query language and connectivity to Excel Pivot
Tables made them the clear choice to build this native connectivity."

    Simba's MDX 2005 technology, upon which the connectivity is based, is
compliant with the latest MDX enhancements from Microsoft. Simba's MDX
query language capabilities are key to providing interoperability with
the latest OLAP business intelligence and analytics applications like
Excel 2007.

    "The Oracle user community has been eagerly anticipating the release of
Simba's native MDX connector for Excel 2007 since the technology was
debuted at BIWA Summit 2008 this past December," said Dan Vlamis,
President of Vlamis Software and BIWA Summit 2008 Conference Chair. "We
have seen great interest for an Excel connector to provide easy, ad hoc
query and BI analysis to Oracle OLAP data. For some people, pivottable
access defines multi-dimensional access to data. Excel is on every
desktop, and Oracle's database is the leader. Simba's solution brings
them together."

    About the Beta Program and How to Get the Software

    The MDX Provider for Oracle OLAP Beta Program will run from April 1st to
April 30th, 2009. Beta participants will be able to download the MDX
Provider for Oracle OLAP from Simba's website upon completion of the Beta
Program enrollment form. Simba will offer technical support for the
duration of the Program. Participants must be running Oracle 11g OLAP
Option (r1.07 or later). Simba will be collecting product feedback. For

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Derivatives did not cause the financial crisis and the financial instruments remain a large business for JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimon was defending derivatives -- a broad term describing securities ranging from stock options to credit default swaps -- after the financial crisis spiraled in 2008 and the largely unregulated financial contracts contributed to losses at banks and other financial companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank has $133 billion in derivatives counterparty exposures, Dimon wrote in the letter published on the bank's Web site on Tuesday. "The company manages those exposures name by name -- like a hawk," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are regulatory gaps that need serious attention," Dimon went on to write, noting that a systemic risk regulator may have been able to prevent "a future AIG." The U.S. government has committed about $180 billion in bailout funds to prevent the collapse of American International Group Inc (AIG.N), which has struggled as a result of mounting losses on derivatives contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon called for a systemic risk regulator that would have a broader authority than the existing network of U.S. regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's in line with the regulatory blueprint outlined last week by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, which called for such a regulator to require firms whose collapse could pose a risk to the financial system to hold more capital than other financial companies and face tougher rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said also that some of the temporary measures that have been enacted to improve liquidity and help banks during the crisis could be in place on a permanent basis to prevent future crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan on Wednesday took advantage of one of these temporary measures to support banks by launching a $5.85 billion two-part debt issue, backed by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSUMER WORRIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's consumer businesses, particularly its large credit card unit, will face a tough 2009, Dimon wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the bank has largely avoided the losses and writedowns on complex debt securities and subprime mortgages that hurt other banks in 2008, JPMorgan is more heavily exposed to consumer credit. Rising unemployment will lead to higher losses for the bank's consumer lending businesses in 2009, Dimon warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing consumer borrowing was in part responsible for the financial crisis, he said, noting that hedge funds, private equity, and a range of other financial firms all played a part in driving up asset prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically, the whole world was at the party, high on leverage -- and enjoying it while it lasted," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in JPMorgan were up about 5 percent on Wednesday to $27.91. JPMorgan shares had fallen just under 13 percent so far this year, compared with a 36 percent slump in the KBW Banks Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, details, background) By Nick Tattersall LAGOS, April 1 (Reuters) - Nigeria is close to reaching a $75 million out-of-court settlement with Pfizer Inc over a 1996 drug trial it says killed 11 children and left dozens disabled, sources close to the negotiations said on Wednesday. Nigeria's federal government and its northern state of Kano sued the world's largest drugmaker in May 2007 for $8.5 billion in damages over the testing of the antibiotic Trovan in Kano during a meningitis epidemic which killed 12,000 children. The New York-based firm denies all charges and says meningitis, not Trovan, killed the children or damaged their health. It said Trovan saved lives and was as effective as a more established drug used for comparison in the study. Two sources close to the negotiations said Pfizer (PFE.N) was expected to respond within days to a proposal that it pay $10 million legal fees to Nigeria's federal government, $30 million to Kano state and $35 million to victims and families. The Pfizer lawyers have told us in principle that they have agreed to our proposal and we are waiting for the details, the chairman of the victims' forum, Mustapha Maisikeli, told Reuters in Kano. Maisikeli and a second source close to the talks both said Pfizer was expected to make an announcement by Friday. Pfizer said in February it continued to make serious efforts to reach an amicable resolution of the federal and Kano state cases. It had no further immediate comment on Wednesday. Kano state Attorney General Aliyu Umar said just over a month ago that his team had presented its final position to Pfizer and that an agreement was expected soon. Pfizer's lead counsel in the case, Anthony Idigbe, said then that a deal was weeks away. Pfizer has repeatedly said it hopes to reach an out-of-court settlement with Nigeria, but talks have been slowed by disagreements over liabilities and compensation. The civil and criminal cases launched by the Nigerian authorities have grown into a tangle of unresolved petitions and side issues, dragging from one adjournment to the next. Court sources said a year ago that Pfizer had proposed to pay $10 million in compensation, rehabilitate the hospital where the Trovan study took place, and upgrade Kano's state-owned drug manufacturing company. But Umar said at the time that the government wanted a better package for the victims.(For full Reuters Africa coverage and to have your say on the top issues, visit: af.reuters.com/ )   (Additional reporting by Mike Oboh in Kano, Ransdell Pierson in New York; Writing by Nick Tattersall, Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Wednesday launched a new range of server systems for small companies, scaling down its existing offerings to attack one of the fastest-growing segments of the business computing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is launching into the market for small companies as competitors introduce cheap, open-source alternatives to its relatively costly Windows-based servers, and the use of pirated Windows products proliferates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new product line, called Windows Server 2008 Foundation, can accommodate up to 15 users and will cost less than $1,000 for the hardware and software combined, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A server is essentially a powerful computer that provides services to other computers. A doctor's office, for example, might use a server to allow staff to share files, access the same systems or maintain a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts reckon the low-end server market for products costing less than $1,000 has grown four times faster than any other price range for comparable single processor servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new offering is a stripped down version of its Windows Server family of products, which tend to be beyond the price range of small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Windows Server 2008 Foundation software will be sold already installed on machines sold by computer makers such as Acer Inc, Dell Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and IBM Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computer makers will set the prices for their products, which may vary by country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Apr 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
VoiceCon 2009 -- Plantronics, Inc. (NYSE: PLT) announced today plans for
integration between IBM Lotus Sametime Unified Telephony and Plantronics'

interoperability and easy implementation within existing IT environments.

    As adoption of UC solutions for improving business collaboration
increases, Plantronics and IBM are working together to optimize the user
experience for Sametime Unified Telephony and Sametime-based telephony
and web conferencing. Customers using Sametime Unified Telephony with
Plantronics UC products, including the recently announced Savi(TM)
Series, are assured of plug-and-play simplicity, superior audio quality
and, with Savi Series, enhanced agility for managing calls routed by
Sametime Unified Telephony across multiple devices.

    "Plantronics and IBM realize that successful UC deployments require
addressing the needs of both the IT department and the business end-user,"
said Gunjan Bhow, vice president and general manager of unified
communications, Plantronics, Inc. "Our proven track record for reliability
and world class customer support will ease concerns for IT decision makers

&lt;p&gt;Teachers from Every State Applied for the Opportunity by Visiting
www.sendmyteacher.com
IRVING, TEXAS--(Business Wire)--
The Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy today announced that 200 third-
through fifth-grade teachers from across the country have been selected to
attend the national Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy to be held at the
Liberty Science Center in New Jersey. The selection of the teachers from
applications submitted at www.sendmyteacher.com marks the first time that the
five-year-old professional development program has chosen teachers from all 50
states. 

To kick off the announcement, PGA golfer Phil Mickelson surprised Houston
teacher Amanda Santana at The Rice School by announcing her selection at a
school assembly. 

"Having Phil Mickelson personally surprise me with this exciting news is an
experience that I will never forget," said Santana, a fifth-grade teacher at The
Rice School in Houston. "I`m thrilled to be attending the Mickelson ExxonMobil
Teachers Academy this summer and look forward to learning new ways to teach math
and science to my students." 

Teachers selected for the National Academy will participate in an intensive
one-week, all-expense paid professional development program designed to provide
them with innovative skills to teach math and science in the classroom The
teachers selected through applications submitted at sendmyteacher.com were
chosen by a panel of educators from the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics (NCTM) and the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) based on
their qualifications, dedication to inspiring students at an early age and
overall commitment to enhancing the teaching profession. 

"Given the overwhelming response from teachers seeking to enhance their
understanding in math and science education we are thrilled to be able to host a
truly National Academy," said Phil Mickelson, co-founder of the Mickelson
ExxonMobil Teachers Academy. "Working with ExxonMobil, we designed the Academy
to be an exciting learning experience that will provide more teachers with tools
to inspire students in these critical areas at such an important time in our
nation`s history." 

In 2005, ExxonMobil partnered with Phil and Amy Mickelson, the NSTA and Math
Solutions to launch the innovative, hands-on professional development program
designed to help teachers engage students in math and science at an early age.
Since its inception, the Academy has instructed more than 1,400 teachers from at
the three annual Academies impacting more than 30,000 students. In addition to
the National Academy, two additional Academies will also be held in Texas and
Louisiana. 

"As a company, we recognize that if our nation is to remain globally competitive
then we must equip students with a solid foundation in math and science at an
early age," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon
Mobil Corporation. "To meet this challenge it is vital that we provide teachers
with the innovative tools to develop the next generation of science savvy
citizens and that is where the Mickleson ExxonMobil Academy can play an
important role." 

In April 2008, the Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy launched an interactive
Web site to expand professional development opportunities to teachers
nationwide. Since its launch, more than 1,600 teachers from all 50 states logged
on to the site to apply for the opportunity. Students were also encouraged to
nominate their teacher to apply for the opportunity by sending an e-card or
printing a teacher appreciation certificate from the site. 

Based on the positive response the Send My Teacher site received from teachers,
the Academy will extend the opportunity to teachers again this year. The
Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy encourages teachers to apply to attend the
2010 Academy by visiting www.sendmyteacher.com.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, April 1 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on
Wednesday launched a new range of server systems for small
companies, scaling down its existing offerings to attack one of
the fastest-growing segments of the business computing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company is launching into the

servers, and the use of pirated Windows products proliferates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's new product line, called Windows Server 2008

might use a server to allow staff to share files, access the

costing less than $1,000 has grown four times faster than any
other price range for comparable single processor servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's new offering is a stripped down version of its

price range of small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said Windows Server 2008 Foundation software will
be sold already installed on machines sold by computer makers
such as Acer Inc (2353.TW), Dell Inc DELL.O, Hewlett-Packard
Co (HPQ.N) and IBM Corp (IBM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The computer makers will set the prices for their products,
which may vary by country.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM will sell a suite of Web-based collaboration software for businesses, including contact management, instant messaging and file sharing programs, the computing giant's biggest effort to date to sell software as a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move to be announced on Wednesday pits International Business Machines Corp against companies that are already established in the fledgling market for software as a service including: Microsoft, Google and privately held Zoho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM will charge companies $10 to $45 per user per month for its software suite, which it will host at its own data centers and deliver via the Web, a company executive said in an interview on Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/a2fe0e/nontraditional_co) has
announced the addition of the "Non-traditional Competitors in the Consumer
Telecoms Market: Microsoft" report to their offering. 

Increasingly seamless communication mobility, achieved through improved
interoperability, partnerships and aggregation, is creating network effects that
make communications more valuable to consumers. 

Scope: Ovum's research has, for over 20 years been focused at the junction of
the technical and commercial domains. Ovums market reports provide strategic
analysis of evolving trends in wholesale, enterprise, consumer, networking,
devices, and components markets. Our analysis drills down into market ecosystems
and segments, inflection points, competitive landscapes and trends, vendor
leadership and best practice. 

Highlights: One common theme among telcos is clear - they are all looking to
provide an efficient next-generation network on which they can offer
high-quality value-added services (VASs) to their customers. Telecoms operators
are faced with a string of challenges from defending their core fixed revenues
to generating growth from new wave services and international operations. 

Reasons to Purchase: Ovum's research helps vendors and service providers
accelerate delivery of profitable new revenue streams. Our findings help
businesses make more effective strategic and business decisions faster. For more
information about how this specific research report can help your business
please contact us. 

Key themes: 

Seamless mobility will expand network effects, potentially excluding telco
systems. Increasingly seamless communication mobility, achieved through improved
interoperability, partnerships and aggregation, is creating network effects that
make communications more valuable to consumers. This will lead to increased use
of rich instant messaging, file sharing and social networking applications.
Communication systems that don't offer the right rich communication experience
or connect themselves to massive networks will be used less and lose customers. 

Growth in video calling would drive users from fixed line towards VoIP
platforms. Because video and imaging require Internet protocol technology, this
means that fixed line providers will lose traffic to Internet services and
mobile networks through PCs, televisions, games consoles and mobile phones. 

MSN Mobile to grab bigger advertising share. Microsoft has acquired a range of
companies, leaping towards its goal of building a world-class Internet-wide
advertising platform. In the mobile sector, these acquisitions are geared
towards significant improvements in device penetration, choice of applications
and consumer experience. In the near term, Ovum expects to see MSN Mobile gain a
greater share of mobile advertising revenues at the expense of operator portal
advertising revenues. 

Category search is an opportunity for telcos. Microsoft is segmenting Search
into key verticals (e.g. shopping, travel, locational services) to offer both
advertisers and consumers more relevant and better-targeted results than Google.
Ovum believes that targeted and localised search facilities offer opportunities
for telcos to customise Search in their portals, thereby attracting specialised,
regional or local advertisers. Microsoft is to target APAC in the downturn.
Heavy reliance on the US region (60% of revenues) exposes Microsoft to risks
associated with adverse socio-political and economic changes. If the downturn
becomes more severe, Ovum expects the company to target APAC countries more
aggressively. 

Net neutrality is not a done deal. Ovum expects to see the debate on bandwidth
metering and throttling to return to centre stage, as networks continue to lose
out to webcos and software companies in the battle to monetise added-value
services.

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Apr 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
VoiceCon - Psytechnics, a leader in performance management solutions for
real time IP based communications, today announced that its Experience
Manager solution will now also support IBM Lotus Sametime Unified
Telephony users. Experience Manager will give Sametime Unified Telephony
operations and support the ability to proactively manage and monitor
voice call quality and deliver rapid, accurate diagnosis for any call
quality issues. This ensures successful pilot or trial deployments,
increased user confidence and adoption, as well as reduced operating
costs both during deployment and once deployed.

    Experience Manager's unique user experience based approach ensures that
performance management and reporting for IP based telephony, including
Sametime Unified Telephony in enterprise or managed service provider (MSP)
based deployments, accurately reflects the user's real time experience.
This increases user confidence with improved call quality reliability
through proactive monitoring, detection, and diagnostics for user
affecting issues. The Experience Manager solution delivers a reduction in
operational and support incident overheads throughout the deployment life
cycle by addressing common voice application problems including voice
distortion, echo, and incorrect volume levels, as well any network
induced problems across multi-vendor IP communications environments.
Detailed performance reporting, analysis, and root cause diagnosis enable
service levels to be maintained more effectively while reducing operating
costs.

    "Maintaining user confidence and effectiveness with IP based
communications is essential to realize full business value and ROI while
fostering a more successful collaborative environment," said Mike
Hollier, CTO of Psytechnics. "Our experience with more than 1 million
business IP telephony users clearly demonstrates the need for proactive
management of the users' call experience and reduced operational costs
for IP based communications from the pilot or trial through to mature
deployment. The required level of visibility and diagnosis for effective
support is just not available from traditional network or VoIP management
tools."

    "Voice quality can be affected by many different variables across the
network with IP telephony systems," said Akiba Saeedi, director of unified
communication and collaboration at IBM. "Using Experience Manager with
Sametime Unified Telephony helps monitor and manage overall voice quality
in real time helping to reduce frustration and improve effectiveness of
voice collaboration in business."

    Psytechnics is an IBM advanced business partner that has successfully
worked with IBM Global Services previously on customer projects. This
development is further evidence that the Psytechnics Experience Manager
solution provides significant added value to IP Telephony deployments and,
furthermore, the addition of video conferencing and mobility management
capabilities ensures increased overall effectiveness as organizations
further embrace a unified communications environment.

&lt;p&gt;Double-Take para Hyper V enriquece y completa la oferta de virtualizaci&#243;n de
Microsoft y adem&#225;s protege en tiempo real al hipervisor, ya sea en una red local
o a distancia.
MADRID--(Business Wire)--
Double-Take&#174; Software (NASDAQ: DBTK), proveedor l&#237;der de software para la
recuperaci&#243;n y r&#233;plica continua de datos anuncia hoy el lanzamiento de
Double-Take para Hyper-V, una nueva versi&#243;n de su producto central, dedicado a
la protecci&#243;n de Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V. 

Se trata de una de las primeras soluciones de replicaci&#243;n en tiempo real y de
failover para el hipervisor de Microsoft que act&#250;a a nivel del servidor, ya sea
en una red local o a distancia. 

Double-Take para Hyper-V se basa en la tecnolog&#237;a de replicaci&#243;n reconocida y
probada de Double-Take&#174;, la cual es capaz de replicar y balancear los servidores
y las aplicaciones en tiempo real y con una precisi&#243;n a nivel de byte. 

Gracias a su estrecha colaboraci&#243;n con Microsoft desde hace numerosos a&#241;os,
Double-Take&#174; ha logrado desarrollar una oferta espec&#237;fica y perfectamente
integrada a la de Microsoft, lo cual facilita su utilizaci&#243;n. 

Multiplica las posibilidades de Hyper-V

Seg&#250;n la agencia de an&#225;lisis Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), "Double-Take para
Hyper-V permite completar la soluci&#243;n de Microsoft en cuanto a alta
disponibilidad y continuidad de actividad, para hacer frente a la competencia". 

Todav&#237;a hay muchas empresas interesadas por el coste reducido y la sencillez de
Hyper-V que sin embargo siguen postergando sus proyectos por lagunas en la alta
disponibilidad, lo cual reduce la protecci&#243;n de los servidores de producci&#243;n
virtualizados y dificulta la puesta en marcha de planes de continuidad de
actividad. 

Double-Take para Hyper-V completa perfectamente la oferta de Microsoft. 

Puntos fuertes de Double-Take para Hyper-V

* A nivel de servidor. Double-Take para Hyper-V replica el hipervisor de
Double-Take&#174; en tiempo real y a nivel de servidor, no a nivel de archivo. 
* Despliegue ilimitado. Double-Take para Hyper-V admite una cantidad ilimitada
de m&#225;quinas virtuales (VMs) 
* Red local o ampliada. Double-Take para Hyper-V est&#225; concebido para su uso en
LAN o WAN.

Soluci&#243;n complementaria a Geocluster de Double-Take&#174;

"Las empresas tienen ahora una nueva opci&#243;n para proteger los entornos Windows,
incluso virtuales. Lo pueden hacer ya sea mediante Geocluster combinado con MCS
(Microsoft Cluster Service) y Microsoft Quick Migration, o bien mediante
Double-Take para Hyper-V", explica Pedro Herrera Iglesias, Country Manager
Espa&#241;a y Portugal. 

Double-Take para Hyper-V no deja de ser una soluci&#243;n complementaria sencilla y
econ&#243;mica a la oferta de cluster geogr&#225;fico de Geocluster, la cual refuerza la
protecci&#243;n de Microsoft Cluster Service (MCS) de Windows Server 2008 pero
resulta m&#225;s costosa y compleja, ya que requiere una red de almacenamiento SAN. 

Precio por licencia est&#225;ndar: 3 295&#8364;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT--(Business Wire)--
Double-Take Software, (NASDAQ: DBTK), f&#252;hrender Anbieter von Software f&#252;r die
Workload-Optimierung, liefert ab sofort Double-Take f&#252;r Hyper-V aus. Damit
bringt das Unternehmen als einer der ersten Anbieter ein Failover-Programm f&#252;r
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V auf den Markt.

Mit der neuen Version seines gleichnamigen Flaggschiff-Produkts erweitert
Double-Take die Microsoft Virtualisierungsplattform um eine speziell f&#252;r sie
entwickelte Echtzeit-Absicherung f&#252;r den Hypervisor in lokalen sowie
Wide-Area-Netzwerken. 

Double-Take f&#252;r Hyper-V basiert auf der bew&#228;hrten Replikations-Technologie von
Double-Take Software. Durch seine seit langem bestehende Partnerschaft mit
Microsoft konnte Double-Take gezielt eine asynchrone Replikations-Software
entwickeln, die sich nahtlos in die Microsoft-Umgebung einf&#252;gt und daher sehr
einfach zu installieren und einzusetzen ist. 

Funktionserweiterung f&#252;r Hyper-V

Laut Analysten der Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) f&#252;llt Double-Take f&#252;r Hyper-V
&#8222;die L&#252;cken, die das Microsoft-Produkt in punkto Disaster Recovery und
Hochverf&#252;gbarkeit im Vergleich zu den Mitbewerbern aufweist". 

Trotz der Einfachheit und der geringen Kosten von Hyper-V z&#246;gern immer noch
viele bei der Einf&#252;hrung. Denn die Microsoft-L&#246;sung bietet standardm&#228;&#223;ig keine
Hochverf&#252;gbarkeits-Features, um Produktiv-Server abzusichern oder einen
tragf&#228;higen Disaster-Recovery-Plan zu erm&#246;glichen. Daher ist Double-Take f&#252;r
Hyper-V die perfekte Erg&#228;nzung. 

Schl&#252;sselfunktionen von Double-Take f&#252;r Hyper-V

* Host-Replikation: Double-Take f&#252;r Hyper-V repliziert den Hyper-V-Hypervisor
auf der Host- und nicht auf der Datei-Ebene. 
* Uneingeschr&#228;nkte Verbreitung: Double-Take f&#252;r Hyper-V unterst&#252;tzt eine
beliebige Anzahl von Virtual Machines. 
* Unterst&#252;tzung von lokalen wie von Remote-Deployments: Double-Take f&#252;r Hyper-V
wurde so ausgelegt, dass es im WAN ebenso effektiv arbeitet wie im LAN.

Eine Erg&#228;nzung zu Double-Take GeoCluster

&#8222;Unternehmen haben nun eine weitere Option, wenn sie ihre Windows-Server
absichern wollen, egal ob es sich um klassische oder um virtuelle handelt", sagt
Olivier Cohen, Sales Director EMEA bei Double-Take Software. &#8222;Sie k&#246;nnen
GeoCluster zusammen mit dem Microsoft Cluster Service und Microsoft Quick
Migration einsetzen oder sich f&#252;r Double-Take f&#252;r Hyper-V entscheiden". 

Double-Take f&#252;r Hyper-V ist in der Tat eine ebenso einfach einzusetzende wie
preiswerte Alternative zu Double-Take GeoCluster. Sie bietet Clustering-Features
&#252;ber verschiedene geographische Standorte hinweg und erweitert so die
M&#246;glichkeiten des Microsoft Cluster Service (MCS). 

Die Standardlizenz von Double-Take f&#252;r Hyper-V ist f&#252;r 3295 Euro erh&#228;ltlich.

&lt;p&gt;La nouvelle version de son outil phare vient enrichir et compl&#233;ter l`offre de
virtualisation de Microsoft, en prot&#233;geant en temps r&#233;el l`hyperviseur, sur le

RUEIL-MALMAISON, France--(Business Wire)--
Double-Take Software (NASDAQ:DBTK) annonce aujourd`hui la disponibilit&#233; de
Double-Take for Hyper-V(TM), une nouvelle version de son outil phare Double-Take
for Windows, d&#233;di&#233;e &#224; la protection de Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V.

Il s`agit d`une des premi&#232;res solutions de r&#233;plication en temps r&#233;el et de
failover pour l`hyperviseur de Microsoft, au niveau de l`h&#244;te, que ce soit sur
le r&#233;seau local ou &#224; distance. 

Double-Take for Hyper-V est b&#226;tie sur la technologie de r&#233;plication reconnue et
&#233;prouv&#233;e de Double-Take&#174;, capable de r&#233;pliquer et basculer les serveurs et les
applications en temps r&#233;el et &#224; l`octet pr&#232;s. 

Gr&#226;ce &#224; son partenariat &#233;troit de longue date avec Microsoft, Double-Take&#174;a pu
d&#233;velopper une offre sp&#233;cifique et parfaitement int&#233;gr&#233;e &#224; celle de Microsoft,
facilitant ainsi son installation et utilisation. 

Etendre les possibilit&#233;s de Hyper-V

Selon le cabinet d`analyses Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), "Double-Take for
Hyper-V vient compl&#233;ter l`offre cluster MSC en mati&#232;re de haute disponibilit&#233; et
de reprise d`activit&#233;, face aux offres concurrentes &#187; 

Pourtant attir&#233;es par le co&#251;t r&#233;duit et la simplicit&#233; de Hyper-V, beaucoup
d`entreprises h&#233;sitent encore &#224; sa mise en place et retardent leurs projets par
manque de fonctionnalit&#233;s de haute disponibilit&#233;, n&#233;cessaires pour la protection
des serveurs de production virtualis&#233;s ou dans le cas des plans de reprise
d'activit&#233;. Double-Take pour Hyper-V compl&#232;te donc parfaitement l`offre de
Microsoft. 

Points forts de Double-Take for Hyper-V

* Au niveau de l`h&#244;te. Double-Take for Hyper-V r&#233;plique en temps r&#233;el Hyper-V au
niveau de l`h&#244;te, et non pas au niveau du fichier. 
* Illimit&#233;. Double-Take for Hyper-V supporte un nombre illimit&#233; de machines
virtuelles (VMs) 
* Local ou &#233;tendu. Double-Take for Hyper-V est con&#231;u pour fonctionner sur le LAN
ou sur le WAN.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Apr 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
At the O'Reilly Web 2.0 Conference today, IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced
LotusLive Engage, an integrated social networking and collaboration cloud
service designed for businesses of all sizes. LotusLive Engage will become
available on April 7, 2009.

    In a challenging economy, companies no longer have all the resources they
need. Finding ways to work with customers and partners in new ways is a
matter of survival. LotusLive Engage enables companies to communicate and
collaborate in new ways without increasing the resources in their IT
departments.

    LotusLive Engage gives any business the tools they need to work smarter
with clients, partners and suppliers. It helps businesses connect and work
with each other easily -- outside the firewall. Designed for business, the
easy to use, security-rich services of LotusLive Engage include profile
and contact management, online meetings, file sharing, instant messaging,
and lightweight project management capabilities. These capabilities are
tightly integrated to provide one of the richest communication and
collaboration experiences available in the market today.

    Integration between services is key to the design of LotusLive. The
services are built using open, Web-based standards and an open business
model. LotusLive services will enable "Click to Cloud" -- the seamless
integration of the LotusLive online services with existing on-premise
Lotus solutions. "Click to Cloud" will help customers extend the value of
their existing investments by making it easy to bridge solutions inside
the firewall to the cloud.

    "Due to the economy, we don't travel as much. But it doesn't mean we have
to stop business," said Leslie Moore, Colgate-Palmolive. "Using the
collaboration tools allows us to communicate quicker, more effectively,
and actually be more proficient working with our employees, and also
reaching out to our customers."

    Designed for business use, LotusLive Engage will be priced on a
subscription model, not an advertising model. Pricing will be comparable
with other offers in the market today. Businesses of every sector and
every major industry, from construction to communications, have already
formed their own business networks by connecting and working with clients,
partners and suppliers via LotusLive.

    "In a challenging economic environment, it's more valuable than ever for
companies to come together in the cloud quickly and easily, using powerful
communication and collaboration tools that integrate with their existing
applications," said Sean Poulley, Vice President, IBM Online Collaboration
&amp; Cloud Services.

    Using tools beyond simply email can help companies collaborating on a
project work more smoothly and efficiently. For example, a construction
company could use LotusLive Engage to work with various vendors. The
developer, job site managers, architects and others could use LotusLive
tools such as an online Meeting to review design changes; File Sharing to
store the design documents and updates to those designs; and an Activity
to keep track of various components of the project -- such as tasks
associated with electrical, plumbing and landscaping. All of this
information is easily accessible by anyone working on the project, at any
time.

    The opportunity for business partners to resell LotusLive services is
growing as the market opportunity for these services expands. Businesses
can join the thousands of companies already using LotusLive services by
visiting www.LotusLive.com to sign up.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Primary Insight, a former Bear Stearns business that serves institutional money
managers with advice from a global network of industry experts, announced today
that it has successfully completed a management buyout from J.P. Morgan.
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. 

Participants in the buyout of the newly formed entity, Primary Insight LLC, are
Co-Founders and Managing Partners David DeRose and Leighton Thomas, who will
continue in their current roles at the helm of the company. Additionally, The
Hidary Group made a majority investment, while J.P. Morgan retains a minority
interest and board seat. 

"Having built Primary Insight into a formidable player in the primary research
space these past four years, Leighton and I are looking forward to the next
phase of growth," said DeRose. "The expertise and success of the Hidary's along
with continued support from J.P.Morgan will enable us to continue providing the
advice and analysis that our clients have come to expect from us." 

The Hidary Group, run by brothers Jack and Murray Hidary, is teaming up with
DeRose and Thomas for the second time. The Hidarys worked with them as
executives at Vista Research, an expert analysis firm founded by The Hidary
Group, which was later sold to McGraw Hill/Standard &amp; Poors in 2005. Prior to
that, the Hidarys founded EarthWeb and successfully took the company public in
1998 with an IPO.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - Investment firm The Hidary
Group has acquired an independent research firm that JPMorgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N) inherited as part of the Bear Stearns Cos
takeover last year, the bank said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Named Primary Insight, the 15-person company will be led by
its co-founders, David DeRose and Leighton Thomas, who decided
to partner with Hidary to acquire the firm after cutbacks at
JPMorgan meant they could not hire more staff or make
improvements to the unit's technology as they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for the bank declined comment on the buyout and
research cuts, which DeRose put at 30 percent of JPMorgan's
research department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you stay under a research division that's being cut 30
percent, we can't get any headcount," said DeRose. "When we
went to JPMorgan and asked to spin this out, that deal made
sense to them because we're going to immediately grow our
staff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hidary Group financed the buyout and will have a
majority stake in the company, while JPMorgan will have a
minority stake. The terms of the deal, including the size of
the parties' respective stakes, were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Primary Insight is an alternative research group that sets
up conversations between institutional investors and experts
across industry sectors in return for a subscription charge
from the investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DeRose and Thomas declined to comment on Primary Insight's
revenue or the details of JPMorgan's investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jack Hidary, one of two brothers who runs the investment
firm, also declined to give details of his company's stake in
the venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hidary Group previously joined DeRose and Thomas in
2001 to found a similar firm called Vista Research, which was
sold to McGraw-Hill Cos Inc MHP.N in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DeRose and Thomas said they plan to improve the company's
technology and hire seven to eight people this year, which they
would not have been able to do within JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our intention with this business is to really pour a
significant amount of money into technology investment that's
... going to allow these guys to service clients better," said
Hidary. "I expect these guys to really take off now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks across Wall Street have been cutting spending on
traditional research since the Securities and Exchange
Commission, worried about conflicts of interest, in 2002 banned
firms from using banking fees to pay analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are now a handful of companies offering alternative
research and the sector is worth about $450 million to $500
million, DeRose said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gerson Lehrman Group is the largest such company, according
to DeRose and Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gerson Lehrman was launched in 1998 and has a network of
about 200,000 experts. The New York-based company posted
revenues of $284 million in 2008 and has about 700 staff
globally, a company spokesman said.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Apr 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Nortel(1) (TSX: NT)(OTCBB: NRTLQ) is teaming with IBM to integrate the
Nortel Agile Communication Environment (ACE) with IBM Lotus Sametime
Unified Telephony (SUT) to offer enterprise customers advanced
communications-enabled business applications. The two companies have been
collaborating on strategic initiatives such as unified communications
(UC), carrier-hosted, and small-to-midsize business solutions since 2005.
This latest collaboration serves as a logical extension of those ongoing
efforts.

    Nortel ACE is expected to be validated as a complementary option for the
telephony control component of a future release of SUT and will be
delivered primarily by IBM Global Technology Services with support from
Nortel. Customers will be able to communications-enable business
processes via a robust set of defined and/or customized applications that
drive greater accuracy, agility, and speed in day-to-day communications
with employees, partners, and customers. Nortel and IBM also expect to
align their integration efforts around a common Sametime user experience,
providing end users the value of a consistent and familiar interface.

    "In today's environment enterprises are seeking new ways to use
communication tools to automate, simplify and accelerate work-flow and
business processes," said Akiba Saeedi, director of unified communication
and collaboration, IBM. "Nortel and IBM are continuing to work together
using open standards and a SOA approach to deliver leading UC solutions
for our joint customers."

    With increasing alignment around a common Sametime user experience, and
in advance of the deeper integration with SUT, Nortel ACE and many of the
associated business applications are available today as independent
solutions. ACE leverages Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and web
service standards to openly, simply and rapidly communication-enable and
optimize the day-to-day operations of any business. These applications
can range from independent point solutions to full integration with
contact center or self service (IVR) solutions that adapt to the
customers choice in communications path and leverage existing
infrastructure investments.

    For example, Nortel ACE can integrate Global Positioning System (GPS) and
WiFi-based location services with voice and instant messaging (IM)
functionality to optimize the tracking and delivery of critical assets,
such as expensive heart monitors in hospitals or delivery trucks in
logistics companies. Deploying applications like Nortel's GPS logistics
and WiFi asset-tracking on ACE can help enterprises reduce operational
expenses up to 10 percent.

    Nortel ACE can also be used to integrate with healthcare portals and
other clinical support applications in hospital environments to improve
and advance the quality and safety of patient care. The result is
intelligent, real-time communications that helps ensure that clinicians
get the information they need, when they need it, sent to the appropriate
devices of choice (mobile, PC, PDA).

    Today, Nortel ACE offers customers the following:

    - Seamless user experience across IP phones, soft clients, TDM phones and
third-party and multi-vendor infrastructure and equipment including video;

    - Presence aggregation (IM, telephony, video) within IBM Sametime via web
service interfaces that provide access from any application, whether
wired or wireless; and

    - Personalization of the communications experience with whatever device a
user chooses, according to individual preferences, for enhanced employee
satisfaction and productivity.

    "Nortel ACE offers a solid return on investment to businesses by helping
them respond quickly to changes in their environment, lower costs, drive
productivity and expand revenue opportunities," said Lori McLean, general
manager, Nortel-IBM Alliance. "A solution combining the strengths of
Nortel ACE and SUT will amplify the value proposition to our joint
customers and highlights the continued strength and vision of the
Nortel-IBM Alliance."

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Apr 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Nortel(1) (TSX: NT)(OTCBB: NRTLQ) is teaming with IBM to integrate the
Nortel Agile Communication Environment (ACE) with IBM Lotus Sametime
Unified Telephony (SUT) to offer enterprise customers advanced
communications-enabled business applications. The two companies have been
collaborating on strategic initiatives such as unified communications
(UC), carrier-hosted, and small-to-midsize business solutions since 2005.
This latest collaboration serves as a logical extension of those ongoing
efforts.

    Nortel ACE is expected to be validated as a complementary option for the
telephony control component of a future release of SUT and will be
delivered primarily by IBM Global Technology Services with support from
Nortel. Customers will be able to communications-enable business
processes via a robust set of defined and/or customized applications that
drive greater accuracy, agility, and speed in day-to-day communications
with employees, partners, and customers. Nortel and IBM also expect to
align their integration efforts around a common Sametime user experience,
providing end users the value of a consistent and familiar interface.

    "In today's environment enterprises are seeking new ways to use
communication tools to automate, simplify and accelerate work-flow and
business processes," said Akiba Saeedi, director of unified communication
and collaboration, IBM. "Nortel and IBM are continuing to work together
using open standards and a SOA approach to deliver leading UC solutions
for our joint customers."

    With increasing alignment around a common Sametime user experience, and
in advance of the deeper integration with SUT, Nortel ACE and many of the
associated business applications are available today as independent
solutions. ACE leverages Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and web
service standards to openly, simply and rapidly communication-enable and
optimize the day-to-day operations of any business. These applications
can range from independent point solutions to full integration with
contact center or self service (IVR) solutions that adapt to the
customers choice in communications path and leverage existing
infrastructure investments.

    For example, Nortel ACE can integrate Global Positioning System (GPS) and
WiFi-based location services with voice and instant messaging (IM)
functionality to optimize the tracking and delivery of critical assets,
such as expensive heart monitors in hospitals or delivery trucks in
logistics companies. Deploying applications like Nortel's GPS logistics
and WiFi asset-tracking on ACE can help enterprises reduce operational
expenses up to 10 percent.

    Nortel ACE can also be used to integrate with healthcare portals and
other clinical support applications in hospital environments to improve
and advance the quality and safety of patient care. The result is
intelligent, real-time communications that helps ensure that clinicians
get the information they need, when they need it, sent to the appropriate
devices of choice (mobile, PC, PDA).

third-party and multi-vendor infrastructure and equipment including video;

&lt;p&gt;The New Release of Double-Take&#174;'s Flagship Product Enhances and Extends the
Microsoft Virtualisation Platform with Real-Time Protection for the Hypervisor
on Local and Wide-Area Networks.
RUEIL MALMAISON, France--(Business Wire)--
Double-Take Software (NASDAQ:DBTK), a leading provider of workload optimisation
software, announced today the availability of Double-Take&#174; for Hyper-V. This is
a new version Double-Take&#174; for Windows dedicated to protecting Microsoft Windows
Server 2008 Hyper-V. Double-Take&#174; for Hyper-V is the one of the first real-time
replication and failover solutions specifically designed for the Microsoft
hypervisor, supporting both LAN and WAN. 

Double-Take&#174; for Hyper-V is based on Double-Take&#174; Software's tried and tested
replication technology. A long term relationship with Microsoft has allowed
Double-Take&#174; Software to develop a targeted solution which integrates seamlessly
with the Microsoft environment, making it very easy to install and use. 

Extending the capabilities of Hyper-V

According to industry analysts Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), "Double-Take&#174;
for Hyper-V fills the gaps in terms of high availability and disaster recovery
in the Microsoft offering when compared with the competition." 

Despite the low cost and simplicity of the Hyper-V solution many businesses are
still hesitant about deploying it because it doesn't ensure the high
availability features for the protection of production servers or for robust
disaster recovery planning. Double-Take&#174; for Hyper-V perfectly complements the
Microsoft offering. 

Key Features of Double-Take&#174; for Hyper-V

* Host replication: Double-Take&#174; for Hyper-V replicates the Hyper-V hypervisor
at the level of the host rather than at file level. 
* Unlimited deployment: Double-Take&#174; for Hyper-V supports an unlimited number of
virtual machines (VMs). 
* Support of local and remote deployments: Double-Take&#174; for Hyper-V has been
designed to be equally effective in LAN and WAN environments.

A complementary product to Double-Take&#174; Software`s GeoCluster&#174;

"Businesses now have an additional option when it comes to protecting their
Windows server deployments, whether classical or virtualised" said Olivier
Cohen, Sales Director, Double-Take France. "They have the choice of using
GeoCluster in combination with Microsoft Cluster Service and Microsoft Quick
Migration, or they can opt for Double-Take&#174; for Hyper-V. 

Double-Take&#174; for Hyper-V is, in fact, an easy to use, cost-effective alternative
to GeoCluster&#174;, which delivers clustering features across distinct geographical
locations to extend the capabilities of Microsoft Cluster Service (MCS).

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS (Hollywood Reporter) - Walt Disney Studios will release Pixar Animation Studios' "Toy Story" and "Toy Story 2" as a digital 3-D double feature for a two-week engagement starting October 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday at ShoWest, the film exhibition industry's conference, the studio also presented a preview of "Up" -- which looks poised to be another big hit for Pixar on the heels of its Oscar for "WALL-E" -- and an enthusiastically received new 3-D conversion of 1991 classic "Beauty and the Beast," the only animated feature to receive an Academy Award nomination for best picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3-D "Toy Story" double feature will include an extra-dimensional trailer for the new "Toy Story 3," which opens June 18, 2010. The 1995 "Toy Story" -- the first computer-animated feature -- and its 1999 sequel have been remastered for the format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening May 29, "Up" is Pixar's 10th animated feature and the first to be released in 3-D. Director Pete Docter introduced a 47-minute preview of the film, which features elderly Carl Fredricksen, voiced by Ed Asner, who ties thousands of helium balloons to his house in order to lift it into the air and journey to South America for retirement. What he doesn't anticipate is that a young Wilderness Explorer named Russell ends up on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the presentation, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Group president Mark Zoradi revealed that Tim Burton's "Alice in Wonderland," starring Johnny Depp and Anne Hathaway, will be released in Imax 3-D, as well as standard digital 3-D, when it opens in March 2010. It's the third film from a previously announced five-picture deal between Disney and Imax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burton's retelling of the Disney classic will combine motion capture, live action and animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As has been widely reported, the economic crisis has stalled the exhibition industry's transition to digital cinema, which enables 3-D screenings. But Zoradi said that scenario has not altered his company's plans to produce movies in the format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are nearly at a critical mass," he said. "We hope we soon will be able to have a 3-D-only (wide) release."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sheri Linden at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

PASADENA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Central Desktop, a leading SaaS-based social technology platform for

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO/BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) cut its offer for Sun Microsystems JAVA.O to $9.55 a share after a thorough vetting and may soon unveil details of its largest- ever takeover, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal, said that price was not final, although IBM had decided Sun Micro was worth less than thought after a weeks- long due diligence process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A merger would create a server industry powerhouse with a commanding 65 percent of the $17 billion Unix server market, a dominance analysts say might trigger antitrust scrutiny and concerns from clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal at $9.55 would mark a 92 percent premium -- or almost double -- Sun's closing share price on March 17, the day before news of IBM's offer emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun agreed to a lower price in return for stronger commitments from IBM that it will complete the deal, even if it faces intense regulatory scrutiny, the Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun would hand IBM a clear lead at the high end of the $45 billion overall server market fought over with Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N). It would broaden IBM's software portfolio, add storage products that vie with EMC Corp (EMC.N) and Network Appliance Inc (NTAP.O) and provide an edge over Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), which some see as its biggest rival in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sun has many valuable assets that have not been adequately monetized," said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she added the challenge would be to integrate the two cultures and product lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that IBM was in the final stages of negotiations with Sun, but had reduced its offer from $10 to $11. Last month, the newspaper reported the deal was worth about $8 billion, including $1.4 billion in cash on Sun's balance sheet, if IBM were to pay $10 to $11 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with IBM and Sun, which now carries a market capitalization of about $6 billion, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts say IBM could have a hard time improving performance at Sun, which has been lackluster for years. IBM, which runs services, hardware and software businesses, has kept profits growing in the midst of the worst U.S. economic recession in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares of the Sun -- whose name was once synonymous with the Internet, but never recovered from a dive in sales after the dot.com bubble burst -- have lost 97 percent of their value since peaking at $260 in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SETTING SUN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, they jumped 2.6 percent in after-hours trading after rallying the same amount in the regular session. IBM shares held steady in extended trading after gaining more than 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun rose to prominence in the 1990s, but after the dot.com bubble burst earlier this decade, it failed to generate substantial profit from software products, including Java and Solaris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counteract a potential slide in margins after a deal is completed, IBM is likely to embark on a major reorganization that could produce more job losses at a company known for talented engineers and a heavy focus on research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has already cut thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek said the strategy was to make Sun's business profitable for IBM by reducing costs, while helping IBM enter new markets and giving it new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Makes a ton of sense if they can pull enough costs out," Misek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM led the business of selling high-end UNIX servers last year, claiming about 37 percent of sales. It was followed by Sun with 28 percent and HP with 27 percent, according to market researcher IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A merger of the two would have less impact on the low end, x86 server market, where profit margins are tight and there is less differentiation between products from competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales in that sector totaled some $28 billion last year.

Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly
about the deal, said that price was not final, although IBM had
decided Sun Micro was worth less than thought after a weeks-
long due diligence process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A merger would create a server industry powerhouse with a
commanding 65 percent of the $17 billion Unix server market, a
dominance analysts say might trigger antitrust scrutiny and

almost double -- Sun's closing share price on March 17, the day
before news of IBM's offer emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun agreed to a lower price in return for stronger
commitments from IBM that it will complete the deal, even if it
faces intense regulatory scrutiny, the Wall Street Journal
cited people familiar with the matter as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun would hand IBM a clear lead at the high end of the $45
billion overall server market fought over with Hewlett-Packard
Co (HPQ.N). It would broaden IBM's software portfolio, add
storage products that vie with EMC Corp (EMC.N) and Network
Appliance Inc (NTAP.O) and provide an edge over Cisco Systems

term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Sun has many valuable assets that have not been adequately
monetized," said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she added the challenge would be to integrate the two

development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has already cut thousands of jobs. [ID:nN25321805]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek said the strategy was
to make Sun's business profitable for IBM by reducing costs,
while helping IBM enter new markets and giving it new
technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Makes a ton of sense if they can pull enough costs out,"
Misek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM led the business of selling high-end UNIX servers last

&lt;p&gt;  NORFOLK, NE, Apr 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Supertel Hospitality, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPPR), a real estate investment trust
(REIT) which owns 122 hotels in 24 states, today announced that Kelly A.
Walters will join the company as president and chief executive officer,
effective April 14, 2009. Walters was a senior vice president at
Investors Real Estate Trust (NASDAQ: IRET). He will succeed Paul J.
Schulte, the current president and chief executive officer. Schulte, 75,
will continue as chairman of the board.

    "Kelly brings a wealth of commercial real estate expertise and a strong
relationship with the investment community, which will serve Supertel
shareholders well in this challenging economic climate," Schulte said. "He
is a proven leader who has consistently generated strong business results
throughout his career."

    "Supertel's experienced management team has produced an excellent track
record as limited-service hotel owners, and I am very confident with our
current business model within the hospitality sector," Walters said. "Our
biggest challenge remains the capital markets and our balance sheet. Over
the past year, the senior management team has worked diligently and
effectively on the company's plan to permanently strengthen the balance
sheet. Improving our financial position will remain our primary focus
through 2009 and into 2010. Then, on a very measured and selective basis,
we plan to pursue opportunities in other commercial real estate segments,
with the goal of obtaining accretive risk-adjusted returns that will add
balance to our hospitality portfolio and ultimately bring more value to
our shareholders."

    Walters, 48, is a former senior vice president for North Dakota-based
Investors Real Estate Trust (IRET), a self-advised equity real estate
investment trust with nearly 250 multi-family residential, office,
medical, industrial and retail commercial real estate assets. Previously,
he was senior vice president of Omaha-based Magnum Resources, Inc., a
privately held real estate investment and operating company. In 2006,
IRET acquired a portion of Magnum's portfolio in a UPREIT transaction
valued at $140 million, and Walters joined the company's senior
management team at the close of the transaction. At various times
throughout his 13-year tenure with the two companies, he was responsible
for investment strategy, acquisitions and dispositions, capital markets
activities, and asset management.

    Prior to joining Magnum Resources, Walters was a senior portfolio manager
at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Company in Chicago. He also held investment
positions with Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc. He holds a B.S./B.A. degree in
banking and finance from the University of Nebraska at Omaha and a MBA

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Bob Iger warned the cable TV industry not to alienate consumers by restricting cable programing on the Web to paying TV subscribers because it could provoke a consumer backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The consumer is king, not us the content provider and not you the distributor," he said on Thursday at an industry event, The Cable Show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cable executives are working on plans to extend popular cable programing to the Web to paying subscribers as a way to retain cable TV customers who might prefer to watch programs online at their convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cable operator Comcast Corp calls its plan Online On Demand; Time Warner Inc calls its plan TV Everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Iger sounded skeptical about the early plans and urged caution in execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Preventing people from watching any shows online, unless they subscribe to some multichannel service, could be viewed as both anti-consumer and anti-technology, and would be something we would find difficult to embrace," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges facing cable operators and programmers alike is how to verify and authenticate customers who have already paid for individual programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said solving the authentication problem will be key to extending the value of programing. Disney has been one of the early major programmers to make some of its programing and movies available on the Web with services such as Apple's iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week Disney announced a new relationship with YouTube, offering some elements of its programing from the ESPN and ABC cable networks. Such deals bypass existing ways of working with the cable TV industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another test for the program makers will be how to replicate the successful dual revenue model of affiliate fees paid by cable operators and advertising revenue. With the online video advertising still at a nascent stage, it is unlikely to be able to match the money generated by TV advertising in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a panel following Iger's speech, Michael Wilner, chief executive of cable operator Insight Communications said programmers who choose to give their content away over the Web would put at risk the economic incentive for creating such programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger agreed with cable industry concerns that in the absence of Web alternatives for consumers, piracy could develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is in all of our best interests to sustain a compelling model that drives legitimate purchases of content.

&lt;p&gt; * $9-$10 a share possible, not yet final-source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * IBM reduced its offer price for Sun-source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TORONTO/BOSTON, April 2 (Reuters) - International Business
Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O may
announce a takeover deal next week, a source with knowledge of
the matter said on Thursday, showing IBM may be completing a
lengthy review ahead of what would be its biggest acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about
the deal, said a final price was not set, but IBM may pay Sun
around $9 to $10 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal earlier reported IBM reduced its
offer to $9 to $10 per share from a previous $10-to-$11 range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM and Sun officials declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A takeover of Sun would give IBM a clear lead in the $45
billion server market against Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and
Dell Inc DELL.O. It would also broaden IBM's software
portfolio, add storage products that compete with EMC Corp
(EMC.N) and Network Appliance Inc (NTAP.O) and provide an edge
over Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), which some see as its biggest
rival in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A deal would have the most impact on IBM's high-end server
business, giving it 65 percent of a market worth some $17
billion, versus 27 percent for HP. It would also bolster IBM's
highly profitable software business and help ensure the
survival of much-smaller Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some analysts say Sun's lackluster performance could
hurt IBM. Sun rose to prominence in the 1990s, but never fully
recovered after the dot-com bubble burst earlier this decade,
and failed to make much profit from software products like Java
and Solaris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts also say the deal could spark antitrust
scrutiny as customers and suppliers raise concerns about
competition.

&lt;p&gt;  ROCHESTER, MN and ARMONK, NY, Apr 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Biomedical informatics researchers at Mayo Clinic and IBM (NYSE: IBM)
today launched a Web site for the newly founded Open Health Natural
Language Processing (NLP) Consortium. The consortium is establishing the
open-source space to promote past and current development efforts,
including participation in information extraction from electronic medical
records.

    As part of the launch, Mayo Clinic and IBM released their clinical NLP
technologies into the public domain. The site http://www.ohnlp.org will
allow the approximately 2,000 researchers and developers working on
clinical language systems worldwide to contribute code and further develop
the systems.

    "We are inviting our international colleagues to help continue development
of these valuable tools," says  Christopher Chute, M.D., Dr.P.H., Mayo
Clinic bioinformatics expert and senior consultant on the project. "By
making it an open-source initiative, we hope to enable wide use of these
NLP tools so medical advancements can happen faster and more efficiently."

    "The recently passed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act promises to
accelerate the adoption of electronic medical records," said Dan Pelino,
IBM's general manager, Global Healthcare &amp; Life. "Because the success of
such reform rides on delivering interconnected and intelligent information
to health care professionals everywhere, Mayo and IBM are tapping into the
collaborative power of the open-source community to speed the development
of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Adoption of this technology will
provide physicians with insights into each patient's condition, allowing
them to electronically retrieve the exact knowledge they seek from patient
health records rather than reading through every record provided, as they
must do today." Patient privacy is a main concern and consideration; all
current and any future required safeguards and regulations will be adhered
to strictly.

    NLP is a relatively new and specialized area within computer science
dealing with computational methods for understanding human language. In
medicine, clinical NLP systems process the vast repositories of text
generated by patient-clinician interactions. Such systems categorize and
structure it according to standard nomenclature -- in this case focusing
on terms used in a range of medical specialties -- that will ultimately
speed data searches for both diagnoses and medical research. These NLP
platforms or "pipelines" aid indexing and searching electronic medical
records within institutions to quickly find similar cases or conditions,
so physicians are not reliant solely on their own clinical experience in
analyzing a problem. Researchers may also use these tools to aid
retrospective epidemiological studies or do groundwork for new clinical
trials.

    "Large-scale information extraction from the clinical narrative is a vital
component in advancing translational research and patient care," adds
Guergana Savova, Ph.D., medical informatics specialist and Mayo's NLP lead
on the project. "It 'unlocks' the clinical textual data that resides in
huge repositories. Such technology would allow for large-scale data
aggregation, analyses and usage -- just imagine the power of data from
millions of patients."

    "There is a treasure trove of historical unstructured data that provides
essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment
effectiveness and long-term outcome which NLP systems make available to
clinicians and researchers," states Anni Coden Ph.D., IBM's NLP principal
on the project. "Such data can provide guidance for prospective studies
and furthermore facilitate the integration of data from multi-modal data
sources."

    As an increasing percentage of health care and academic medical centers
adopt electronic medical records, searching and extracting information
from them in an automated fashion becomes essential. Mayo Clinic and IBM
jointly developed a system for extracting information from more than 25
million free-text clinical notes based on IBM's open-source Unstructured
Information Management Architecture (UIMA). As part of the system,
developers build strings of "annotators" that become a pipeline, allowing
physicians to mine the text for references of specific conditions, drugs,
diseases, signs and symptoms; anatomical areas or organs; or treatment
procedures. IBM and Mayo Clinic also developed a system to extract cancer
disease characteristics from unstructured pathology reports to facilitate
"consistent retrieval and transmission of cancer cases." The system
extracts tumor characteristics, lymph node status and metastatic disease
information enabling the automatic computation of cancer stage, which is
critical to determine optimal treatment.

    The two clinical text solutions released open-source by Mayo Clinic and
IBM aim at processing two specific types of notes. Clinical notes describe
patient-physician encounters, while pathology reports center around tissue
findings. Both options are already adding value for Mayo and its patients:


--  Physicians can research past records to examine earlier cases of rare
conditions, thereby "conferring" with their colleagues across time to aid
diagnosis and treatment decisions.
--  Retrospective studies of tissue samples can propel new research
findings, as happened with a major breast cancer finding at Mayo in
2008.
--  Enhanced ability to mine data and determine potential study factors or
participants has already enabled individualized medicine treatments in
psychiatric care.

    
Mayo's open-source solution, clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge
Extraction System (cTAKES), focuses on processing the patient-centric
clinical notes. Its low level components, for example the software that
discovers sentence and word boundaries, assigns word part-of-speech tags
and forms phrases out of the words, are "trained" to understand clinical
language. The higher-level information extraction components, for example
the ones that determine which textual spans are highly relevant to the
clinical meaning of a note, are specifically designed for this domain.

    cTAKES has the functionality to recognize whether a clinical concept is
negated, relevant to the patient or to the patient's family, which are
attributes critical to understanding patient-centered medical language.

    IBM's medKAT systems (medical Knowledge Analysis Tool) is a UIMA-based,
modular and flexible system that uses advanced NLP techniques to extract
structured information from unstructured data sources, such as pathology
reports, clinical notes, discharge summaries and medical literature.
medKAT/P is a version customized for the pathology domain, based on a
representation of cancer, its characteristics and disease progression.
The system recognizes concepts such as primary tumor and its associated
attributes (e.g. histology, anatomical site, etc.) or lymph node status
and its associated attributes (e.g. number of positive and excised nodes)
by identifying mentions (e.g. histology or anatomical sites) and their
relations (including negation). medKAT can be viewed as a development
platform that is adaptable to user and domain requirements. It has been
designed to operate within institutional systems or databases of any size.

Processing Consortium can be found at http://www.ohnlp.org with links to
Source Forge downloads. The UIMA framework is available at
http://incubator.apache.org/uima/.

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS, April 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. deals market is in
the midst of a cyclical downturn, but it should continue its
general upward trend, a senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
investment banker said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The mergers and acquisitions market has grown at an average
annual clip of 8.5 percent since 1985 despite cyclical volatility
over the years, such as the slowdown now due to the financial
crisis, Timothy Ingrassia, Goldman's head of MA in Americas, said
at the 21st Tulane Corporate Law Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "MA is always going to be with us. It is a premier source of
chunky capital," Ingrassia said. "Having said that, it is a pretty
cyclical business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global deal volume fell 29.3 percent to $472.7 billion in the
first quarter, making it the slowest quarter since the
July-September period of 2004, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ingrassia indicated that he expected 2009 to be another down
year for MA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said that over the last 25 years, U.S. MA levels have
generally been about 8 percent of total market capitalization, but
in downturns it could drop as low as 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Using the centerpoint of this range -- 6 percent of total U.S.
market capitalization -- as a guidepost would put 2009 U.S. MA
levels at around $640 billion, around four times first quarter
levels, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would be down more than 35 percent from last year's U.S.
total of $991 billion and down nearly 60 percent from 2007 levels,
according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Ingrassia said mergers were one of the most important
ways to realize value from a business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "MA is a permanent component of the capital markets," he
said. "MA is a source of capital for companies. It raises a lot
of money in one place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial crisis, which has been marked by a lack of
credit, has made it necessary for dealmakers to come up with new
ways to get transactions done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The challenge of MA is that "big piles of money" have to show
up on the same day, Ingrassia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks, which traditionally helped carry the deal through from
signing to closing, have seen their market capitalizations drop
precipitously, hampering their ability to finance deals. So
advisors now have to be more creative in getting deals done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We used to be plumbers," Ingrassia said. "Now we have to be
alchemists."

Using IBM software, NMHG was able to reduce the time to retrieve and
manage documents, such as engineering drawings and legal contracts, from
30 days to 1 day, significantly improving the productivity of its global
teams with operations in 14 countries.

    Prior to the implementation, NMHG managers kept manual copies of all
documents and legal contracts in various locations and it was not uncommon
for an employee to spend hours searching for a specific document. With the
IBM enterprise content management (ECM) software, all manual work of
preparing microfilm cards was eliminated and company engineers were able
to access the drawings instantly on their desktop computers. NMHG now has
a central system in place, providing employees worldwide access to all
critical information and better control over its corporate records with
almost instant access.

    "In our work environment, we are constantly trying to reduce cycle times,
and we were able to reduce ours from 30 days to implementation the very
next day," said Gidu Sriram, director of IT applications, NMHG. "This was
a significant change that enabled us to respond more quickly to user
demands, gain control over our information and become more efficient with
our business processes."

    NMHG realized the initial investment made in the IBM solution had
potential well beyond the engineering application. The company is now
gaining greater efficiencies by adding compliance capabilities to the ECM
system.

    The IBM solution is helping NMHG to maintain its regulatory compliance
requirements by storing finished finance reports and supporting records
for proper retention in a central ECM repository. NMHG is now able to
easily access signed copies of important critical business documents,
such as contracts, and provide reminders to contract owners as expiration
dates approach.

    "Business users have become much more involved in directing and owning
their end applications and solutions, and our customers are working
closely with us and our business partners to maximize their IBM ECM
investments," said Ken Bisconti, vice president, products and strategy,
IBM Enterprise Content Management. "By applying the basic principles of
agile ECM, companies can leverage software in new, innovative ways that
help reduce costs and improve customer service, helping them to manage
their critical information in smarter ways."

    As clients continue to seek smarter use of their technology investments,
IBM ECM is helping customers realize the benefits of having open,
standards-based solutions built on a unified platform, which improves
efficiency and return on investment. IBM's ECM portfolio provides
flexibility in a services oriented, compliant environment to help empower
business users, shorten time to value and to respond to changing
requirements. Helping organizations achieve greater business agility, IBM
ECM delivers solutions to proactively solve increasingly complex business
problems, enabling them to build a solution in days versus months.

    IBM's ECM software addresses the demands of globally distributed
enterprises that demand scalable, extensible technologies and supports the
company's Smarter Planet initiative, which recognizes the need for
improved information access, quality and insight.

    NMHG is using IBM FileNet Content Manager, IBM FileNet Content Services,
IBM FileNet Records Crawler and IBM FileNet Records Manager.

&lt;p&gt;Phase 3 Clinical Trials Recently Started for the First JAK Inhibitor for
Rheumatoid Arthritis and Tanezumab for Pain

Company Achieves March 2008 Goal of Advancing 10 to 12 New Treatments to Phase 3
in One Year
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc today provided an update to its pipeline, highlighting the
progression of clinical programs in high-priority therapeutic areas, and
announced the start of Phase 3 clinical trials for two new molecular entities.
In total, the company initiated seven Phase 3 programs within the past six
months. 

Earlier this year, Pfizer started Phase 3 studies in a first-in-class JAK
inhibitor (CP-690,550), the first orally-administered, disease-modifying
antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for rheumatoid arthritis in 10 years, based on
promising Phase 2 efficacy and safety data. Rheumatoid arthritis impacts 1.3
million Americans and can be severe, debilitating, deforming and even shorten
life. Pfizer is also conducting Phase 3 trials with tanezumab, a fully-humanized
monoclonal antibody targeting nerve growth factor. Tanezumab significantly
reduced pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee in clinical studies to
date. 

"We are executing on our commitment to bring new and effective therapies to
patients around the world in areas where there is a significant unmet medical
need," said Ian Read, president, Worldwide Pharmaceutical Operations. 

The company has initiated 12 Phase 3 clinical programs since March 2008,
achieving its goal of advancing between 10 and 12 new molecular entities and new
indications into late-stage development by March 2009. Pfizer reaffirmed the
additional R objectives shared with investors in March 2008: 15-20 Phase 3
starts in 2008-2009, growing the Phase 3 pipeline to at least 24 and as many as
28 new molecular entities or new indications by December 2009 and 15-20
regulatory submissions from 2010 to 2012. 

The Pfizer pipeline now reflects a therapeutic-area focus, with 100 programs in
Phase 1 through Registration. In total, 21 programs advanced in the pipeline
since September 2008, 12 of them in the identified high-priority disease areas
of diabetes, oncology, inflammation/immunology, Alzheimer`s disease, psychoses
and pain. 

"We are continuing to better align our pipeline candidates with the identified
needs of patients and healthcare providers worldwide," said Mr. Read.
"Importantly, our new business unit structure will enable us to advance our
development programs with urgency and efficiency in support of achieving our
regulatory submission goal and providing high value therapies." 

Pfizer recently formed several smaller, customer-focused business units to
better anticipate and respond to customers` and patients` changing needs and to
ensure the alignment of research and development activities with these needs.
Each unit has responsibility for late-stage product development and
commercialization. This approach allows for rapid decision-making and a more
efficient use of resources to maximize the value of the company`s pipeline and,
as a result, will enhance Pfizer`s ability to invest in long-term opportunities.


Pfizer added two late-stage candidates to the pipeline as part of its continuing
effort to pursue the best external science through business development
opportunities and partnerships. Within the Primary Care Business Unit, Pfizer in
conjunction with Medivation is developing Dimebon, currently in Phase 3 for the
treatment of Alzheimer`s disease (AD). Dimebon`s mechanism is thought to be
distinct from currently available AD medications. It has successfully completed
Phase 2 studies for Huntington`s disease, a hereditary, degenerative brain
disorder for which there are limited treatment options. 

Pfizer`s Specialty Care Business Unit entered into a strategic alliance with
Auxilium Pharmaceuticals to develop XIAFLEX, a new medicine being studied for
Dupuytren`s contracture in Phase 3 and Peyronie`s Disease in Phase 2. 

"Last year, we refined our approach to research by refocusing our pipeline to
allow us to better select targets and molecules for development and move
high-priority projects forward with improved cycle times," said Martin Mackay,
PhD, president of Pfizer Global Research &amp; Development. "We will continue to
drive our strategies and make the operational improvements necessary to maximize
our investments, accelerate development, and advance medical science." 

Pfizer continues to prioritize its portfolio in order to direct resources to
projects in areas of unmet medical need and market opportunity. This approach
has resulted in the discontinuation of certain development programs that did not
meet its criteria regarding therapeutic area focus or measures of potential
clinical utility and customer value. As a result, 26 programs were discontinued
in the last six months, 15 as a result of strategic decisions made last year and
11 due to clinical attrition. 

The Company will seek to monetize some of the compounds that have been
discontinued through business development transactions, such as out-licensing or
partnering. 

Pfizer`s pipeline is posted at www.pfizer.com/pipeline.Accompanying information
includes compound name, target disease, phase of development and, for late-stage
programs, mechanism of action.

&lt;p&gt;  TOKYO, Apr 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Japanese sensor and control equipment maker OMRON Corporation (TSE: 6645)
(PINKSHEETS: OMRNY) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) are working together to provide
"smart" solutions that lower energy use, reduce carbon dioxide emissions
and increase efficiency in transportation operations.

    The solutions will help clients decide which types of shipping and
transportation to use and the best travel routes for reducing costs and
CO2 emissions in the delivery of packages, parts, supplies and finished
goods.

    The companies will combine OMRON's sensor capabilities and experience in
traffic control, vehicle weight measurement, and transportation distance
and loading ratios systems with the advanced mathematic calculation
technologies of IBM's Virtual Routing Planner and Modal-Shift
Transportation Planner offerings.

    The two companies will work together to assist clients in addressing
anticipated regulatory restrictions and penalties for CO2 emissions. The
collaboration is consistent with IBM's "smarter planet" initiative, which
envisions a world where everything is instrumented, interconnected and
intelligent. This can provide greater understanding that allows better
decision making, leading to increased efficiency, improved performance,
lower costs and reduced environmental impact.

    IBM and OMRON will provide these solutions initially for Japanese clients,
primarily in the manufacturing and transportation industries -- globally,
those industries account for more than half of all energy use and
corresponding CO2 emissions. The solutions could later be expanded for
additional countries and industries.

    IBM's Modal-Shift Transportation Planner analyzes timetables of various
shipping services, such as ship, air, train and truck, taking delivery
date of goods into consideration, to choose the best shipping method for
reducing costs and CO2 emissions.

    Virtual Routing Planner plans the best routes for trucks to use to
minimize CO2 emissions, based on digitalized road map information and
accounting for various conditions such as delivery, collection, time
frame and vehicle type.

    Both IBM solutions use high-performance optimization algorithms developed
by IBM's Tokyo Research Laboratory.

    Modal-Shift Transportation Planner and Virtual Routing Planner join a
growing portfolio of consulting services from IBM to help clients address
sustainability issues. Those offerings include: the CSR Assessment and
Benchmarking Utility, the Carbon Tradeoff Modeler, Green Sigma(TM),
Environmental Product Lifecycle Management, the Supply Chain Network
Optimization Workbench (or SNOW), Strategic Carbon Management, and the
Public Sector Energy and Environment Diagnostic.

    About OMRON

    Headquartered in Kyoto, Japan, OMRON Corporation is a global leader in the
field of automation. Established in 1933 and headed by President &amp; CEO
Hisao Sakuta, OMRON has over 35,000 employees in 38 countries working to
provide products and services to customers in a variety of fields,
including industrial automation, electronic components, social systems
(ticket gate machines, ticket vending machines, and traffic control), and

&lt;p&gt;  STUTTGART, GERMANY, Apr 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
When automotive manufacturer Continental AG acquired Siemens VDO, the new
combined organization selected IBM (NYSE: IBM) Lotus Notes and Domino
software as their common messaging platform.

    Over a four-month period, 40,000 Microsoft Outlook and Exchange software
users were moved to the IBM platform. Continental also decided to deploy
IBM Lotus Quickr and Sametime software as their collaboration and unified
communications platform. The reasons for choosing IBM over Microsoft
included lower licensing and operating costs as well as greater platform
independence.

    Continental's acquisition of Siemens VDO brought with it a big question.
In addition to its 37,000 IBM Lotus Domino and Notes software users, the
company now had 40,000 new Microsoft Exchange and Outlook users from the
company it acquired. The evaluation considered several migration
scenarios: immediately switching the entire group to the Lotus platform;
gradually switching to the Exchange platform; or migrating to third party
open source products or hosted services.

    "Our strategy is focused on minimizing software interdependencies and,
likewise, taking control over license related costs," says Dr. Bernhard
Thomas, head of IT Infrastructure Strategy at Continental AG. "We didn't
see major differences between Lotus Notes and Microsoft Outlook with
regard to client functionality, but the IBM software was more open and
flexible and it also had lower infrastructure costs. That's why we chose
it."

    Continental is also now planning to expand its use of Lotus Quickr and
Lotus Sametime unified communications and collaboration software. Lotus
Quickr will become the company's new default platform for all uses in
team and project collaboration. Lotus Quickr was chosen primarily because
it provided a simpler, more direct integration with Lotus Notes, access
to directories and calendars, integration with Lotus Sametime, which
Continental uses for conferencing and instant messaging, plus lower
infrastructure and licensing costs. Continental intends to use Lotus
Quickr and Lotus Sametime to further expand on-line and real time
collaboration within the company, as well as to employ new Enterprise 2.0
functions such as tagging and alerting.

    Paul Schwefer, Chief Information Officer at Continental added, "IBM Lotus
software fits in well within Continental's strategy of permanently
optimizing the flexibility, productivity and cost of our IT." Continental
is one of the world's leading automotive suppliers, with revenue of more
than EUR 24 billion in 2008. As a supplier of brake systems, power train
and chassis systems and components, instrumentation, "infotainment"
solutions, vehicle electronics, tires and engineering elastomers, the
company contributes to enhanced driving safety and global climate
protection. Continental is also a partner in networked automobile
communication. The company currently employs nearly 140,000 people at
around 190 locations in 35 countries.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc today announced the discontinuation of one of its Phase 3 studies
based on statistical assessment for futility: the SUN 1107 Phase 3 study of
Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate) in advanced breast cancer. SUN 1107 evaluated
single-agent sunitinib versus single-agent capecitabine for the treatment of a
broad range of patients with advanced breast cancer after failure of standard
treatment. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) found that even if the
trial had been allowed to continue, treatment with single-agent sunitinib would
be unable to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the primary
endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) compared to single-agent
capecitabine in the study population. Data from this trial are currently being
analyzed. 

"We are disappointed with these results given the previous findings that
suggested sunitinib may provide benefit for patients with this
difficult-to-treat cancer," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of
Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit.
"In ongoing studies, we remain committed to evaluating sunitinib in advanced
breast cancer and are continuing to study sunitinib in different populations and
with different regimens." 

Pfizer has notified clinical trial investigators involved in the study and
regulatory agencies of these findings. The Company encourages investigators to
determine the best course of action for their individual patients. 

The company is continuing to evaluate sunitinib as a single-agent and in
combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy in specific patient populations
with advanced breast cancer through three additional Phase 3 and two Phase 2
trials. 

Sunitinib is currently approved for both gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)
after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate, and advanced /
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on efficacy and safety data from
large, randomized Phase 3 clinical trials. Sunitinib has played an important
role in reshaping the treatment landscape for these two difficult-to-treat
cancers. To date, more than 58,000 patients globally have been treated with
sunitinib in the clinical setting and in clinical trials. 

Sunitinib Clinical Research Program

Pfizer Oncology is committed to helping to improve the lives of breast cancer
patients and is dedicated to further developing agents for the treatment of
patients in the advanced breast cancer setting - a patient population with
significant unmet medical needs. 

Pfizer is also continuing to study the role of sunitinib in the treatment of
various other solid tumors including advanced non-small cell lung cancer,
advanced colorectal cancer, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced
hormone-refractory prostate cancer, in Phase 3 trials. 

Healthcare professionals who are interested in learning more about sunitinib
trials that are open for enrollment can visit the SUN program web site at
www.suntrials.com. Patients with questions should contact their treating
physician. 

About Advanced Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related
death among women globally. Compared to early stage breast cancer, effective
therapy for advanced breast cancer, which includes inoperable locally advanced
and metastatic disease, remains a clinical challenge in the oncology community.
Additional treatment options are desperately needed to address this continuing
unmet medical need. 

About Sutent (sunitinib malate)

Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of GIST
after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate and advanced /
metastatic RCC. 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of childbearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in GIST and RCC clinical trials were fatigue,
asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal
pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration,
altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Apr 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
AltiGen Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATGN), a leading provider of VoIP
business phone systems and Unified Communications solutions, today
announced that its Microsoft-based Unified Communications platform has
been deployed by First State Bank, Nebraska. Founded in 1912, First State
Bank operates eleven branches throughout Nebraska. As part of a
systematic plan to integrate all voice &amp; data networks across their
branches, First State Bank evaluated VoIP telephony platforms from several
leading manufacturers. In deploying an integrated voice solution, the bank
sought to decrease carrier, equipment and administrative costs while
providing their managers with tools to measure and monitor customer
interactions; all within a seamless, scalable and centrally administered
architecture.

    "After evaluating multiple telecom solutions and providers, we selected
Kansas-based Network Innovations for their expertise in designing and
deploying converged communications solutions specifically tailored to the
needs of community and regional banks," noted Andrew Cooper, AVP of
Information Systems at First State Bank.

    "We worked with Andrew and his team to evaluate their existing environment
and establish objectives in deploying a converged solution," stated
Network Innovations President, Brian Gregory. "We then recommended the
AltiGen platform as the ideal solution to achieve First State's primary
objectives
to:


--  Utilize the bank's private data network to transmit VoIP telephone
    calls
--  Reduce hardware deployed via a centralized solution housed in bank's
    data center
--  Enable the IT staff to administer all moves, adds &amp; changes from a
    single application
--  Provide a software based solution to support flexibility and
    scalability for future growth"
    

    
Andrew Cooper added, "We could not be more pleased with the
performance of our AltiGen system. We immediately reduced our monthly
telecom expenses by over 60%. The system is feature rich and easy to
administer; delivering increased efficiencies and productivity throughout
our organization."

    Mike Plumer, Vice President of Sales for AltiGen, noted, "We are pleased
to be working with Network Innovations in bringing AltiGen's
Microsoft-based unified communications platform to First State Bank. Our
software centric architecture and strategic partnership with Fiserv
enable AltiGen to deliver comprehensive, yet cost effective VoIP and

&lt;p&gt;Tee Shirts Made from Recycled Water Bottles Make a Splash
PASADENA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Store North America unveiled its comprehensive lineup of Earth Day
activities and promotions designed to educate families about the impact they
make by recycling and provide everyone with the opportunity to engage in
replanting an endangered rainforest through The Nature Conservancy`s Plant a
Billion Trees Campaign. These initiatives build on The Walt Disney Company`s
recently announced long-term environmental goals to reduce emissions, waste,
electricity and fuel use, as well as the company`s impact on water and
ecosystems. 

To add to the Earth Day celebration, Disney Store will also introduce an
exclusive assortment of environmentally friendly tee shirts and tote bags made
from Sustainable Solutions Group`s RETHINK fabric, a new textile created from
recycled water bottles. 

"Disney Store`s Earth Day 2009 participation continues Disney`s long-term
commitment to protecting the environment," said Jim Fielding, President, Disney
Store Worldwide. "From merchandise made from recycled and organic materials to
projects to promote environmental awareness with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America
and The Nature Conservancy, Disney Store is proud to help bring attention to
preserving this magical place in which we live." 

Disney Store`s Earth Day 2009 celebration will include these exciting programs:

* Plant a Billion Trees Campaign: Disney Store and Disney Worldwide Conservation
Fund in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy have planted one tree to match
the number of earth friendly reusable tote bags that have been produced; these
bags are available for purchase at Disney Store locations nationwide. Disney
Store donated 96,000 trees (one for each tote bag) to help The Nature
Conservancy reach its goal of planting a billion trees by 2015 in Brazil`s
Atlantic Forest, one of the world`s most endangered rainforests. The tote bags
feature a special Earth Day design, are made from 100 percent recycled materials
and retail for an SRP of $2.50 each. Please visit www.disney.com/conservation to
learn more. Disney Store in the United Kingdom recently joined forces with local
charity the Woodland Trust to create "the Magical Wood," a 50 acre site which
will be replanted through in-store fundraising efforts, and Disney Store
locations throughout the continent of Europe will be planting trees locally,
making this a truly global campaign. 
* Recycling is Magic: Plastic Bottle Recycling Campaign (April 22, Earth Day):
According to the Web site Earth911.com, "In 2006, Americans drank about 167
bottles of water each but only recycled an average of 23 percent. That leaves 38
billion water bottles in landfills." On April 22, 2009, Disney Store locations
nationwide will host a plastic bottle recycling program called "Recycling is
Magic." To help educate children on the benefits of recycling, Disney Store is
inviting everyone to bring in empty plastic bottles and toss them into a unique
recycling bin. On April 22, while supplies last, guests can exchange three empty
bottles for a free commemorative Earth Day reusable water bottle, an approximate
value of $8.50. 
* Earth Friendly Products --Three Plastic Bottles Equal One Magical Tee Shirt:
Families will get a first-hand look at how recycling is a magical process when
they see Disney Store`s new earth friendly tees (SRP $12.50 for kids and SRP
$16.50 for adults) and totes (SRP $19.50) made from RETHINK fabric from
Sustainable Solutions Group. To make the fabric, plastic water bottles are
cleaned, smashed, recycled and combined with cotton or other materials, turning
what was once waste into something useful. The soft, wrinkle resistant shirts
and durable tote bag feature an exclusive Disney Store Mother Earth design. Each
shirt also features a label letting the consumer know exactly how many bottles
were used to manufacture it. Disney Store`s other earth friendly products
include adult and children`s tee shirts made from organic cotton (SRP $12.50 -
$16.50), stainless steel, reusable water bottles (SRP $12.50), organic cotton
gardening aprons for adult (SRP $39.50) and kids (SRP $29.50), and refillable
ceramic mugs (SRP $10.50).

* Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America Earth Day Murals: Beginning April 13, 2009,
special Earth Day murals designed by local children participating in Boys &amp;
Girls Clubs of America will be on display in Disney Store windows nationwide.
Disney Store donated all the art supplies, instructions and recycled paper to
Boys &amp; Girls Clubs across the country. With the help of Disney VoluntEARS, the
children will decorate squares of recycled paper that will be collected and
assembled in 4 by 6 foot murals in Disney Store windows. The artwork will
celebrate what Earth Day means to kids in their community.

&lt;p&gt;TEL AVIV, April 2 (Reuters) - Israeli holding company Koor
Industries KOR.TA said on Thursday it plans to pay back by May
15 a loan of 214 million Swiss francs it took last year from
Goldman Sachs to buy shares in Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Last month, Morgan Stanley doubled the size of the credit
line it extended to Koor to 330 million Swiss francs, for the
acquisition of Credit Suisse shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Koor bought and sold shares in Credit Suisse in 2008 and
currently owns 3.4 percent of the Swiss bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It financed part of a 1.2 billion franc purchase in October
with the loan from Goldman Sachs. It said at the time it did not
plan to borrow any more money from Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tova Cohen; editing by Simon Jessop)

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM--(Business Wire)--
Gemalto, the world leader in digital security, and Precise Biometrics, the
leading provider of fingerprint solutions for smart cards, today introduced
Gemalto .NET Bio. This innovative solution enables organizations to enhance
network security and protect online identities by replacing weak, static
passwords with strong authentication using Gemalto .NET smart cards and Precise
Match-on-Card fingerprint biometric technology. Gemalto .NET Bio is easy to
deploy and manage, and integrates seamlessly into Microsoft Windows
environments. 

Organizations employ Gemalto smart cards and tokens for strong user
authentication to their networks, as well as for data encryption and digital
signature services. Traditionally, smart cards are protected by a PIN to verify
the holder of the device is its legitimate owner. Gemalto .NET Bio implements
fingerprint verification on the smart card to provide three alternative
verification methods: using a fingerprint instead of a PIN; using a fingerprint
or a PIN; and using a fingerprint and a PIN for the highest level of security. 

Precise Match-on-Card technology stores and verifies users` fingerprint
information directly on the Gemalto .NET smart card. The fingerprint information
never leaves the card and is never stored in a database, thus protecting their
digital identities and privacy. With Gemalto .NET Bio, organizations benefit
from the convenience of fingerprint authentication and the portability and
security of smart card devices, all seamlessly integrated with Microsoft Windows
operating systems and applications. 

"Gemalto and Precise Biometrics have done a great job integrating smart cards
and biometrics within the security layer of Windows Operating systems." said
Dustin Ingalls, Director of Program Management: Windows Core Operating System
Division with Microsoft. 

Gemalto .NET Bio works with a wide range of applications for Windows and
provides a very familiar user experience. The solution has an intuitive
interface and users can set up their fingerprints on the cards themselves,
making it straightforward and cost-effective for both IT administrators and
employees. 

Demonstration at 2009 RSA Conference

The combined solution will be available for demonstration in Gemalto`s booth
(#1917) at the 2009 RSA Conference in San Francisco, California USA, 20 - 23
April 2009.

About Gemalto .NET Bio and Microsoft Compatibility

Gemalto and Precise Biometrics succeeded in making the solution work seamlessly
with the Microsoft product ecosystem. In addition, the Gemalto .NET smart card
minidriver is integrated with Microsoft`s Windows Smart Card Framework. It is
included in the box with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 and packaged as
part of Windows Update for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

recognition to prove people's identities. With top-of-the-line expertise in
fingerprint verification, Precise Biometrics offers fast, accurate and secure

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney boosted its ability to attract Internet-surfing parents of small children on Wednesday by purchasing the U.S. assets of Canadian company Kaboose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney paid about $18.4 million for several Web sites, including Kaboose.com, Babyzone.com, Amazing Moms.com, Funschool.com, Zeeks.com and ParentZone.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaboose sold the remainder of its assets to Barclays Private Equity for about $97 million. The separate deals caused Kaboose stock to surge 33 percent Wednesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaboose employs about 100 people in Toronto and New York, and Disney said it has made no decision as to the fate of the employees working at the sites it acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the deal closes in the coming weeks or months, those sites will become part of Disney Online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaboose is the latest in a string of acquisitions by the Disney Interactive Media Group, among them Kerpoof, iParenting Media and Club Penguin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, April 3 (Reuters) - Nigerians who sought to
blame Chevron Corp (CVX.N) for a violent clash on an oil
platform off their country's coast more than a decade ago have
appealed a verdict in the U.S. company's favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A federal jury in San Francisco cleared Chevron in December
of liability in the break-up by Nigerian forces of a 1998
occupation of its Parabe platform, where about 100 villagers
had been protesting environmental damage and demanding
compensation and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the jury's verdict was wrong and we look
forward to being vindicated on appeal," Cindy Cohn, a lawyer
for the plaintiffs, said of the case filed with the Ninth U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit has been watched closely by companies
extracting resources in often-dangerous regions because it was
brought under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which allows
foreigners to sue over human rights abuses committed by or on
behalf of U.S. organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) faces the start in the
coming weeks of a trial in New York on charges of human rights
violations in Nigeria brought on behalf of activist Ken
Saro-Wiwa, who was executed along with eight other people by
the Nigerian government in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil companies working in the Niger Delta, where villagers
complain that they see no benefit from the industry and suffer
from the resulting environmental damage, often face threats of
violence and hostage taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron case was brought by Larry Bowoto, a protester
injured when Nigerian forces landed on Parabe, nine miles (15
km) off the coast, to end the three-day occupation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The jury rejected claims that the San Ramon,
California-based company was liable for cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment, torture, assault, battery and negligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A jury unanimously found that Chevron was not liable for
any of the claims by Bowoto and the other plaintiffs," Chevron
said in a statement on Friday. "We believe the plaintiffs
appeal is without merit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiffs had argued Chevron was liable because it paid,
housed and fed the forces, which the company's lawyer said was
industry practice in a part of the world where the government
is the only security option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge Susan Illston, who heard the Bowoto case in the U.S.
court for the Northern District of California, had denied the
plaintiffs' request for a new trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cases in San Francisco's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals can
take up to two years to be heard.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - For IBM, buying Sun Microsystems Inc makes a lot of good business sense: It removes a competitor, strengthens IBM against rival Hewlett-Packard and picks up on the cheap the intellectual property of one of Silicon Valley's most respected companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may be tough to persuade regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to approve the deal, and melding easy-going Sun with more conservative Big Blue will be a challenge, many analysts believe IBM has a good chance of doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very difficult environment in which to gain market share. That's probably an easier way than putting more sales people on the ground," said Pat Becker Jr, chief investment officer for Becker Capital, which manages about $1.6 billion and holds a small number of shares in IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman Brothers analyst Shaw Wu said IBM (IBM.N) and HP (HPQ.N) have been trying to woo customers away from Sun JAVA.O for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sun's installed base is pretty good. While it is shrinking, it is fairly loyal. And what better way to get to that customer base than just buying the company," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there's International Business Machines Corp's track record. It has spent some $25 billion since 2003 to buy 80 companies, with only a few hiccups along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM offered to purchase Sun -- whose market value tops $6 billion -- for $9.55 per share after a thorough vetting, a person familiar with the situation said on Thursday. That source, who is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said a final agreement could be announced within days. Both companies have declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would add what was one of the world's hottest brands during the dot.com technology boom to IBM's arsenal of computer services, hardware and software products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sun is expected to post a loss this year as it undertakes a massive restructuring, laying off thousands of workers, buying the company would give a boost to IBM's lagging sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect the recession and currency headwinds to cause revenue to slip 6 percent this year to $98 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sun's sales are seen falling 11 percent to $12 billion in its current fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But IBM is well positioned to slash Sun's costs and boost the profitability of its businesses, analysts and investors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When IBM acquires a company, it slashes overhead and dramatically increases distribution using its own sales force, one of the world's largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying Sun would give IBM a clear lead at the high-end of the $45 billion overall server market that it fights over with Hewlett-Packard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would also broaden IBM's software portfolio and add storage products that vie with EMC Corp (EMC.N) and Network Appliance Inc (NTAP.O). It would also provide an edge over Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), which some see as IBM's biggest rival in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Caughey, an analyst with Fort Pitt Capital, which holds IBM shares, expects IBM to generate efficiencies through moving production of Sun's high-end computer chips to IBM's own plants and dropping Sun products with low margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun is best known for its high-end Unix servers favored by big financial services firms, telecommunications carriers and government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM led that $17 billion market last year with a 37.2 percent share of sales, followed by Sun with 28.1 percent and HP with 26.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Becker Jr of Becker Capital said Sun's Unix server sales may be poised to pick up as many customers are using machines purchased in the 1990s that are wearing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they do, IBM may be able to simultaneously sell them products in its broad portfolio, including storage equipment, software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While neither company has publicly commented on the talks, a person familiar with the negotiations told Reuters IBM reduced its original offer for Sun, from somewhere between $10 and $11 to $9.55 after completing a thorough due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Lys, a professor of accounting at  the Kellogg School of Management, said that may be because IBM discovered some weaknesses during its review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sun is struggling. They are getting a company that needs restructuring," Lys said. "The good news is that Sun's problems are known."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect IBM would likely cut thousands more jobs beyond what Sun has already announced. But they added it would be important for IBM to retain the most talented workers and a culture that has fostered innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's important that they do not break the Sun culture. If all they do is buy the Sun customer base and beat these guys into submission, then they lose half of what they've paid for," said Howard Anderson, a professor with MIT's Entrepreneurship Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando in New York; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

CompanionLink Software, a leader in synchronization solutions, offers a
two-way sync solution between Microsoft Outlook and Google. Palm has
separately announced their Palm Synergy technology will link the Palm Pre
phone to Google Contacts and Calendar services. While Palm has offered a
solution to link Microsoft Exchange with the Palm Pre, CompanionLink's
solution will guarantee that standalone Microsoft Outlook users also have
a two-way sync solution available.

    "While Palm has made few concrete announcements about Palm Synergy
capabilities, the recent demonstrations with the Palm Pre and Palm Synergy
show a viable Outlook solution of which CompanionLink is a part," says
Wayland Bruns, CEO of CompanionLink Software. "Tim Pettitt, Product
Manager for Palm Pre, at CTIA 2009 showed the Palm Pre Calendar
application and discussed sync capabilities to Google. Since
CompanionLink already supports Outlook to Google sync, it means
Synergy/Outlook users will have the ability to get their desktop contacts
and calendar information on their Palm Pre phones on the same day that
the Palm Pre launches."

    CompanionLink for Google allows Microsoft Outlook users to seamlessly sync
their contacts, calendar and tasks to Google. CompanionLink is well known
for their depth of data integrity and ability to handle worldwide time
zones, phone formats, and recurring appointments which are often scrambled
by competing sync solutions. Complete two-way sync ensures that any change
to data in either Outlook or Google is automatically updated.

    "We look forward to Palm announcing a Synergy SDK to allow CompanionLink
to synchronize Outlook, Lotus Notes, ACT! by Sage, Outlook Business
Contact Manager, and Novell GroupWise data directly to the Palm Pre.
Until that time, our currently available products will support the early
adopters of the Palm Pre. As we improve our products, Palm Pre users will
be able to upgrade without charge by downloading from our website," says
Bruns.

    CompanionLink for Google sells for $29.95 and comes with free technical
support. The software supports two-way sync with both personal Google
accounts and Google Apps accounts. A 14-day evaluation version of the
software is available at www.companionlink.com/google.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) today announced that it has received a request for additional
information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") with respect to its
previously announced proposed acquisition of Wyeth. The request for information
from the FTC, often referred to as a "second request," was anticipated as part
of the regulatory process under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976 ("HSR Act"). 

Pfizer intends to respond expeditiously to this request and continue to work
cooperatively with the FTC in connection with its review. Completion of the
transaction remains subject to the expiration of the waiting period under the
HSR Act, governmental and regulatory approvals in certain other jurisdictions,
approval by the stockholders of Wyeth, the satisfaction of certain conditions
related to the debt financing for the transaction, and other usual and customary
closing conditions. Pfizer and Wyeth continue to expect the transaction to close
at the end of the third quarter or during the fourth quarter of 2009.

Forward Looking Statements

This press release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, but are not limited to,
statements about the benefits of the proposed merger between Pfizer and Wyeth,
including future financial and operating results, the combined company's plans,
objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not
historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and
expectations of Pfizer's and Wyeth's management and are subject to significant
risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements. Neither Pfizer nor Wyeth undertake any obligation to
update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements. The following factors,
among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements: the possibility that the expected synergies from the
proposed merger of Pfizer and Wyeth will not be realized, or will not be
realized within the expected time period, due to, among other things, the impact
of pharmaceutical industry regulation and pending legislation that could affect
the pharmaceutical industry; the ability to obtain governmental and
self-regulatory organization approvals of the merger on the proposed terms and
schedule; the failure of Wyeth stockholders to approve the merger; the risk that
the businesses will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the merger
making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the
possibility that the merger does not close, including, but not limited to, due
to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions; Pfizer's and Wyeth's ability
to accurately predict future market conditions; dependence on the effectiveness
of Pfizer's and Wyeth's patents and other protections for innovative products;
the risk of new and changing regulation and health policies in the U.S. and
internationally and the exposure to litigation and/or regulatory actions.
Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Pfizer's 2008 Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") on February 27, 2009, Wyeth's 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
has sued Dutch businessman Louis Reijtenbagh, saying he failed
to pay back more than $23 million in loans and that he
unlawfully moved valuable artwork by Rembrandt, Picasso and
other artists out of the United States that had been put up as
collateral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The case is the second lawsuit in two weeks against the
62-year-old Reijtenbagh, a one-time medical doctor who is now
considered one of the wealthiest people in the Netherlands
after making a fortune through investing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reijtenbagh and his two sons  were sued last week by Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN.VX), which has gotten a temporary court
order freezing his assets. [ID:nnN31305455] Several investment
funds run by the Swiss bank accuse them of misusing more than
$340 million in loans that were to have been used to finance
the family's private equity investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Credit Suisse and JPMorgan cases were both filed in New
York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The JPMorgan lawsuit, filed on Wednesday, seeks the
repayment of loans that were backed by millions of dollars
worth of artwork held by Monte-Carlo Art SA, a British Virgin
Islands-based entity that JPMorgan says is controlled by
Reijtenbagh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jay Fialkoff, a lawyer representing Reijtenbagh and his
sons in the Credit Suisse case, told Reuters on Friday that he
was "not sure" if he was going to represent the investor in the
JPMorgan lawsuit and declined to comment on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A hearing in the JPMorgan case has been set for April 15,
according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Reijtenbaghs have been described in court papers as a
wealthy Dutch family with offices and residences in Brussels,
Monaco, Luxembourg and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said in its lawsuit that Reijtenbagh and his
companies "have experienced a material adverse change in his
business and his financial condition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said Reijtenbagh failed to pay back a substantial
part of a $50 million loan extended in July 2006. It said he
owes an outstanding principal balance of about $23.5 million
plus accrued interest of nearly $9,900 as of March 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reijtenbagh is one of the 50 richest people in the
Netherlands, according to the weekly publication Quote, which
estimated his assets last year at about 590 million euros ($793
million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The son of a Dutch farmer, he worked as a family doctor and
made his first fortune in the 1980s in stocks, according to
Dutch daily De Telegraaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan sued Reijtenbagh for breach of contract and other
claims. It contends the artwork backing the loan was supposed
to be safeguarded at an apartment in the Trump Tower
Condominium on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue that is owned by
Reijtenbagh's sons, Jacob and Edgar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, JPMorgan contends, the defendants moved the "art
collateral ... outside of the apartment and the United States"
without the bank's consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A list of the art includes works by Rembrandt, Picasso,
Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Pierre Bonnard, Rene Magritte and
others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the case,
saying the bank does not discuss pending litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said in its court papers that Reijtenbagh resides
in Monaco. Credit Suisse's lawsuit said his actual residence
"is currently the subject of an investigation by the Belgian
tax authorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fialkoff declined to comment on Reijtenbagh's whereabouts
or main place of residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is JPMorgan Chase Bank NA vs Louis Reijtenbagh

&lt;p&gt;Accreditation places Pfizer at Forefront of Highest Ethical and Safety Standards
in Clinical Research
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today that it has become the first pharmaceutical company
to be accredited by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research
Protection Programs (AAHRPP) for ensuring the protection of human subjects
taking part in early-stage clinical trials. 

The AAHRPP accreditation was awarded to Pfizer`s clinical research units (CRUs)
in New Haven, CT, Brussels, Belgium and Singapore, where the company conducts
most of its Phase I clinical research. To earn the accreditation, Pfizer
participated in a rigorous, 15-month examination of the clinical research
practices at these units. 

AAHRPP is an independent, non-profit accrediting body that promotes ethically
sound research of the highest quality. Organizations seeking accreditation must
provide tangible evidence - through policies, procedures, and practices - of
their commitment to ensure human rights protection in clinical research. 

"Pfizer is committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in all of our
clinical research activities," said Martin Mackay, PhD, president of Pfizer
Global Research &amp; Development. "AAHRPP accreditation is tangible evidence of our
continuing commitment to maintain the highest global standards for research by
protecting the human rights of the individuals who take part in our early-stage
clinical trials." 

CRUs and Phase I Research

Pfizer allowed AAHRPP to audit its three CRUs and demonstrated that these
facilities met the high quality and ethical standards set by AAHRPP including
requirements for research set by the International Conference on Harmonization
(ICH), as well as research regulations in the United States, European Union and
Singapore. The process included site visits, interviews and an application for
accreditation that exceeded 1,000 pages. 

Pfizer`s CRUs are staffed by doctors and other health professionals who maintain
close ties with nearby hospitals to advance scientific knowledge and share best
practices. 

Phase I trials are the first studies of an investigational drug in humans. In
these trials, small doses of an investigational medicine are administered under
close medical supervision to healthy volunteer subjects. This allows researchers
to measure responses to the investigational medicine, determine how it is
absorbed by the body and how long it remains in the bloodstream, and assess the
safety and tolerability of different doses. 

"Safety and scientific excellence are the constant themes of our work," said
Rachel Harrigan, MD, Pfizer`s senior vice president of Development Operations.
"This accreditation acknowledges the commitment of Pfizer`s physicians and other
staff to the well-being of our volunteers and to our efforts to conduct the
highest quality clinical trials at all stages." 

Pfizer voluntarily sought accreditation to demonstrate its commitment to
integrity in research and because it wanted to be among more than 150 of the
world`s best universities, hospitals, institutional review boards (IRBs)
contract research organizations (CROs), and other organizations that are
AAHRPP-accredited. 

Pfizer worked closely with IRBs and ethics committees in New Haven, Brussels and
Singapore, all of which invested considerable effort to evolve their standard
procedures and methods of review for Pfizer studies in order to meet AAHRP
standards. 

"We are very pleased that Pfizer took a leadership position by demonstrating its
commitment to human research protections by seeking and successfully achieving
AAHRPP Accreditation," said FelixKhin-Maung-Gyi, PharmD, chief executive officer
of Chesapeake Research Review, an AAHRPP-accredited independent IRB based in
Maryland. "I hope all others in the research enterprise, including fellow
independent IRBs, sponsors, research institutions and sites, and CROs will
follow Pfizer`s lead. 

"While many companies strive for excellence in this area, there is no substitute
for AAHRPP accreditation to cement the American public`s trust in our
partnership for conducting clinical trials," Dr. Khin-Maung-Gyi added. "It is
our shared responsibility to those who both participate in and rely upon results
from these trials to devote the necessary and appropriate resources for high
quality, ethical research." 

Integrity in Research

The AAHRPP accreditation is another step in Pfizer`s ongoing efforts to earn
public trust for integrity in research. Others include:

* Requiring that all Pfizer sponsored trials - regardless of where they are
conducted -- are carried out under the same international standards, including
the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 1996 Guidelines for Good
Clinical Practice and the global principles set forth in the Declaration of
Helsinki. 
* Beginning in November 2008, requiring that all Pfizer U.S. multi-center
clinical trials are reviewed only by central IRBs that are AAHRPP-accredited. 
* Registering clinical trials on the public database www.clinicaltrials.gov. As
of 2008, the company registers all clinical trials conducted on a Pfizer product
(Phase I and beyond), as well as non-interventional studies with prospective
data collection. To date, the company has registered more than 1,000 trials. 
* Posting the results of its clinical trials at www.clinicalstudyresults.org. As
of 2005, summary results of all patient studies conducted on a Pfizer product
(Phase I and beyond) are posted, and starting in 2008, the results of all
clinical studies, whether in patients or normal volunteers, are posted, as well
as the results of prospective observational studies. 
* Providing a regularly updated public website, describing compounds in its drug
development pipeline and detailing their progress 
* Building infrastructure of the developing world countries, where an increasing
number of clinical trials are taking place. This work is conducted in
partnership with local authorities and research institutions. 
* Conducting training programs in good clinical practice (GCP) standards around
the world in countries such as India, a top location for clinical research.

Pfizer is committed to conducting clinical trials globally according to the
highest ethical and scientific standards. 

Drug development is a worldwide effort and clinical trials are conducted in many
countries, providing experience with different patient populations and
reflecting the prevalence and incidence of the diseases for which Pfizer is
developing medicines. Pfizer posts key company policies related to human subject
protection at http://pfizer.com/sciencepolicy.

&lt;p&gt;  PARMA, ITALY and ARMONK, NY, Apr 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The city of Parma has entered into a strategic initiative with IBM (NYSE:
IBM) with the aim of creating a Smart City. IBM consultants will serve on
an Innovation Board to identify and design a new model for a sustainable
city through a range of digital solutions.

    Parma is a modern city, home to approximately 200,000 people, and famous
for its culture, art and food. The city's management is planning
citizen-focused innovations that will provide new "intelligence" for
existing infrastructure to optimize resources, reduce traffic congestion,
improve services to citizens and businesses and make the city smarter and
more efficient.

    Parma's strategy matches IBM's vision of a Smarter Planet, infusing
intelligence into the world's systems, processes and infrastructure and
providing a better quality of life for people living and working in a
smart city. This means a systemic and open approach, with new intelligence
through innovative IBM solutions designed with and for Parma.

    "This strategic initiative, signed with IBM, allows us to create an
Innovation Board," said Pietro Vignali, Parma Mayor. "This Board has the
mission of finding innovative citizen services solutions leveraging new
technologies: from info-mobility to security, to social services. We are
the first town in Italy to engage in this initiative with IBM and this
puts Parma in the network of Europe's most innovative capitals, like
Stockholm and London."

    Elsewhere, IBM is working with many other authorities on smarter systems.
The cities of Singapore, Brisbane and Stockholm are all working to reduce
both congestion and pollution through intelligent transport solutions.

    In Malta, a new smart grid utilities system is being created and
implemented by IBM to enable more efficient consumption of energy and
water and completely transform the relationship between Maltese consumers
and utilities suppliers.

    These solutions, and many more, are making a real impact today -- the
first step towards creating a true smart city.

    "It is vital for the future that we transform our cities into accessible,
dynamic, thriving communities," said Luciano Martucci, General Manager IBM
Italy. "In cities like Parma, technology can make the local systems and
infrastructure smarter and create benefits directly related toward
improving the quality of life for all its citizens, in a cost-effective
way."

    Initial projects in Parma include a virtual teller in several locations
around the city. Citizens will be able to interact with the municipality
as if there were a municipal official in front of them, delivering and
receiving documents and cheques, filling in and signing forms, and
requesting support.

    Parma is one of 6 Italian Cities which have agreed on a common protocol on
IT innovation, and is the first to initiate the project.

&lt;p&gt;* Nigeria's Kano state, Pfizer reach broad agreement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Details remain to be worked out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KANO, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigeria's Kano state and drugmaker Pfizer Inc have agreed the broad terms of an out-of-court settlement in a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit over a 1996 drug trial, lawyers for both parties said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The northern state of Kano sued the world's largest drugmaker in May 2007 for $2 billion in damages over the testing of the meningitis drug Trovan, which the authorities say killed 11 children and left dozens disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to report that broad and principal fundamental agreement has been reached between Kano state government and Pfizer," Pfizer's lead counsel in the case, Anthony Idigbe, told reporters after a court hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm has denied all charges and says meningitis, not Trovan, killed the children or damaged their health. It said Trovan saved lives and was as effective as a more established drug used for comparison in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which has repeatedly said it hoped to reach an out-of-court agreement, said on Wednesday that there was no final deal yet as there were still issues to be resolved, including on how to "prevent any misappropriation of funds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have agreed in broad principle for a settlement. We will work together on the details," Kano state Attorney General Aliyu Umar told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's federal government sued for an additional $6.5 billion in 2007 over the drug trial, although sources close to the negotiations have said it is expected to withdraw its case if Kano reaches a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For full Reuters Africa coverage and to have your say on the top issues, visit: af.reuters.com/ )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mike Oboh; Writing by Nick Tattersall; Editing by Erica Billingham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest touch innovations to be demonstrated in the Microsoft booth #1232 at
HIMSS
ADDISON, Texas--(Business Wire)--
MEDHOST, provider of the leading Emergency Department Information System (EDIS),
will demonstrate medical applications on the Microsoft Surface and Silverlight
platforms at HIMSS, April 5-8, 2009, in Chicago. Driven by the mission of
enhancing patient care and safety, MEDHOST is one of the first healthcare ISVs
to develop easy-to-use touch solutions designed to dramatically improve
communication, operations and processes, as well as revolutionize the way that
healthcare providers leverage computers to deliver care. 

As a Microsoft Partner since 1999 and a Gold Certified Partner since 2007,
MEDHOST has a strong relationship with Microsoft. Last year, the two companies
collaborated to create one of the first multi-touch business intelligence
dashboards for healthcare. MEDHOST is now expanding the prototype to include
rich Web-based features using Microsoft Silverlight. A visual prototype of
MEDHOST`s robust dashboard will be available for demonstration on Microsoft
Surface in Microsoft`s booth (#1232) at HIMSS. 

MEDHOST recently expanded the use of touch technology to patients with the
launch of a patient self-service touchscreen kiosk created with Microsoft`s .NET
Framework 3.5 and Windows Presentation Foundation. Upon arriving at the
emergency department (ED), patients can check in with the easy to use
touchscreen kiosk, called ED PASS. After patients check in, their information
instantly becomes visible in the MEDHOST EDIS, which gives clinicians a
real-time view of the waiting room and immediately alerts them to any high-risk
patients. Demonstrations of MEDHOST`s dashboard and ED PASS can be seen in the
MEDHOST booth (#4617) during the show. 

"At MEDHOST we are determined to produce innovative solutions that further
enrich the user experience and improve patient care and safety," said Eric Rock,
co-founder and CTO of MEDHOST. "The platforms that Microsoft provide are a
foundation for our software and play a part in our success of delivering such
robust and easy-to-use touch solutions. We`re honored to work so closely with
Microsoft to advance healthcare with cutting-edge technologies that will truly
make a difference in hospital operations and patient care." 

MEDHOST is a highly visual, easy-to-use process management technology designed
by clinicians to dramatically improve workflow, productivity and regulatory
compliance, while supporting clinical workflow and enhancing patient safety. It
provides real-time Patient Tracking, electronic Clinical Documentation with
automated charge capture, widely adopted Physician Order Entry and real-time
decision support for all levels of care providers. 

"Creating a dynamic clinician friendly experience is as critical as ever, as
healthcare is faced with rapid deployment of technologies to reduce errors,
provide decision support and improve health outcomes," said Chris Sullivan, U.S.
health providers industry solutions director, Microsoft Corp. "MEDHOST`s
interactive dashboard, built on Microsoft Surface and Silverlight, is a strong
step in this direction, as it improves communication between providers and
administrators, leading to safer and more efficient delivery of patient care." 

MEDHOST currently serves more than 160 facilities, including the Baylor
Healthcare System in Texas, Catholic Healthcare West in California, Catholic
Health System in New York and Tenet Healthcare Corporation. MEDHOST is the
preferred EDIS provider of VHA Inc., a national cooperative serving more than
2,400 not-for-profit healthcare organizations. MEDHOST easily integrates with
leading hospital information systems, including MEDITECH, Cerner, Siemens and
McKesson.

&lt;p&gt;But the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal, said that price was not final, although IBM had decided Sun Micro was worth less than thought after a weeks- long due diligence process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A merger would create a server industry powerhouse with a commanding 65 percent of the $17 billion Unix server market, a dominance analysts say might trigger antitrust scrutiny and concerns from clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal at $9.55 would mark a 92 percent premium -- or almost double -- Sun's closing share price on March 17, the day before news of IBM's offer emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun agreed to a lower price in return for stronger commitments from IBM that it will complete the deal, even if it faces intense regulatory scrutiny, the Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun would hand IBM a clear lead at the high end of the $45 billion overall server market fought over with Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N).

IBM shares held steady in extended trading after gaining more than 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun rose to prominence in the 1990s, but after the dot.com bubble burst earlier this decade, it failed to generate substantial profit from software products, including Java and Solaris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counteract a potential slide in margins after a deal is completed, IBM is likely to embark on a major reorganization that could produce more job losses at a company known for talented engineers and a heavy focus on research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has already cut thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek said the strategy was to make Sun's business profitable for IBM by reducing costs, while helping IBM enter new markets and giving it new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Makes a ton of sense if they can pull enough costs out," Misek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM led the business of selling high-end UNIX servers last year, claiming about 37 percent of sales. It was followed by Sun with 28 percent and HP with 27 percent, according to market researcher IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A merger of the two would have less impact on the low end, x86 server market, where profit margins are tight and there is less differentiation between products from competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales in that sector totaled some $28 billion last year.

&lt;p&gt;April 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added Intercontinental

said the company is well positioned to outperform its peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said pricing remained solid for ICE, adding
that it does not expect similar fee pressure that has been
accelerating in United States and European Union equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it sees a 15 percent upside to the shares of
the second-biggest U.S. derivatives exchange and raised its

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN--(Business Wire)--
This year's Localization World Conference will be held from June 8 to 10 in
Berlin, Germany, under the motto "Know-how for Global Success". It will convey
the knowledge needed for successful product marketing in the international
arena. The spectrum of topics will range from strategy development for entering
foreign markets to efficient localization of the corporate communication for the
respective target languages. In collaboration with renowned companies like
Expedia, HypoVereinsbank, Roland Berger, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the organizers
have composed a colorful program with specialized lectures and user examples.
Dr. Norbert Walter, Chief Economist of the Deutsche Bank Group, will open the
Localization World 2009 as keynote speaker. Based on topical studies, he will
analyze the current global economic situation and explain its effect on the
international business of enterprises.

The Localization World will feature comprehensive information on how enterprises
can push ahead their internationalization projects and optimize the processes
required for this. The three-day conference program with four parallel lecture
slots will facilitate an in-depth, target-group-specific consideration of the
individual topics. The mix of specialized lectures, user examples, and podium
discussions will present the areas from different perspectives. Additionally,
subject and industry-specific workshops will be held. 

Ulrich Henes, founder of the Localization Institute in the USA and organizer of
the Localization World, summarizes the state of affairs as follows:
"Internationalization primarily means making use of the opportunities offered by
the global market. Enterprises can strengthen their own strategic position,
thereby becoming more competitive. Our goal is to provide the participants of
the Localization World with the needed knowledge in a compact and understandable
form in order to enable them to successfully implement, expand, or optimize
their internationalization strategy." 

The Localization World will be held from June 8 to 10, 2009, at the Maritim
proArte hotel in Berlin, Germany. The fee for participation in the conference is
EUR 825. The fee for those who merely want to attend the Localization World on
one day is EUR 425.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - For IBM, buying Sun Microsystems Inc makes a lot of good business sense: It removes a competitor, strengthens IBM against rival Hewlett-Packard and picks up on the cheap the intellectual property of one of Silicon Valley's most respected companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may be tough to persuade regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to approve the deal, and melding easy-going Sun with more conservative Big Blue will be a challenge, many analysts believe IBM has a good chance of doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very difficult environment in which to gain market share. That's probably an easier way than putting more sales people on the ground," said Pat Becker Jr, chief investment officer for Becker Capital, which manages about $1.6 billion and holds a small number of shares in IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman Brothers analyst Shaw Wu said IBM (IBM.N) and HP (HPQ.N) have been trying to woo customers away from Sun JAVA.O for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sun's installed base is pretty good. While it is shrinking, it is fairly loyal. And what better way to get to that customer base than just buying the company," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there's International Business Machines Corp's track record. It has spent some $25 billion since 2003 to buy 80 companies, with only a few hiccups along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM offered to purchase Sun -- whose market value tops $6 billion -- for $9.55 per share after a thorough vetting, a person familiar with the situation said on Thursday. That source, who is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said a final agreement could be announced within days. Both companies have declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would add what was one of the world's hottest brands during the dot.com technology boom to IBM's arsenal of computer services, hardware and software products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sun is expected to post a loss this year as it undertakes a massive restructuring, laying off thousands of workers, buying the company would give a boost to IBM's lagging sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect the recession and currency headwinds to cause revenue to slip 6 percent this year to $98 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sun's sales are seen falling 11 percent to $12 billion in its current fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But IBM is well positioned to slash Sun's costs and boost the profitability of its businesses, analysts and investors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When IBM acquires a company, it slashes overhead and dramatically increases distribution using its own sales force, one of the world's largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying Sun would give IBM a clear lead at the high-end of the $45 billion overall server market that it fights over with Hewlett-Packard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would also broaden IBM's software portfolio and add storage products that vie with EMC Corp (EMC.N) and Network Appliance Inc (NTAP.O). It would also provide an edge over Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), which some see as IBM's biggest rival in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Caughey, an analyst with Fort Pitt Capital, which holds IBM shares, expects IBM to generate efficiencies through moving production of Sun's high-end computer chips to IBM's own plants and dropping Sun products with low margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun is best known for its high-end Unix servers favored by big financial services firms, telecommunications carriers and government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM led that $17 billion market last year with a 37.2 percent share of sales, followed by Sun with 28.1 percent and HP with 26.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Becker Jr of Becker Capital said Sun's Unix server sales may be poised to pick up as many customers are using machines purchased in the 1990s that are wearing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they do, IBM may be able to simultaneously sell them products in its broad portfolio, including storage equipment, software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While neither company has publicly commented on the talks, a person familiar with the negotiations told Reuters IBM reduced its original offer for Sun, from somewhere between $10 and $11 to $9.55 after completing a thorough due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Lys, a professor of accounting at  the Kellogg School of Management, said that may be because IBM discovered some weaknesses during its review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sun is struggling. They are getting a company that needs restructuring," Lys said. "The good news is that Sun's problems are known."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect IBM would likely cut thousands more jobs beyond what Sun has already announced. But they added it would be important for IBM to retain the most talented workers and a culture that has fostered innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's important that they do not break the Sun culture. If all they do is buy the Sun customer base and beat these guys into submission, then they lose half of what they've paid for," said Howard Anderson, a professor with MIT's Entrepreneurship Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando in New York; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Talks collapse over price&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * IBM's offer was $9.40 or lower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Unclear if talks will resume
 (Adds background on talks)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ritsuko Ando&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - IBM's (IBM.N) talks to
acquire smaller computer and software rival Sun Microsystems
Inc JAVA.O broke down on Sunday after Sun rejected IBM's $7
billion offer, a source with knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The collapse of negotiations, if final, is likely to hurt
Sun's shares as a buyout was seen as a means of survival for
the once-storied Silicon Valley company, which has been losing
market share. A deal would also have helped IBM compete more
effectively against rivals such as Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about
the matter, said Sun was unhappy with International Business
Machines Corp's offer of $9.40 per share or below, and that it
was unclear if talks would resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bid represented a premium of up to 89 percent on Sun's
shares before deal talks were first reported last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Sun is now sort of damaged goods," said Peter Falvey, a
technology banker at Revolution Partners. "If IBM got under the
covers and didn't like what they saw, then what does that mean
for other potential buyers?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An IBM spokesman declined to comment, while Sun officials
did not return calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources told Reuters last month that IBM was in exclusive
talks to buy Sun and had proceeded to the due diligence stage.
One source had said on Saturday that IBM lowered its offer
price for Sun to $9.50 a share from $9.55 a share and that a
deal may be announced this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun shares had risen to $8.49 on Friday, from $4.97 on
March 17, a day before talks between the two technology
companies were first reported. The Wall Street Journal had
previously said IBM's original bid was $10-$11 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DEAL FACTORED IN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The collapsed talks are expected to damage the smaller Sun
more than IBM, the world's largest technology services
provider, which has fared relatively well despite the global
economic slump thanks to its outsourcing business and its shift
from hardware to higher-margin software sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaufman Brothers analyst Shaw Wu said it was a mistake for
Sun to reject the bid, citing the leap in Sun shares since
reports of the deal talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The acquisition is already factored into the market's
thinking. To reject it over 50 cents a share, or whatever it
may be, doesn't seem like a very prudent move," Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun posted an 11 percent decline in quarterly revenue for
its fiscal quarter ended Dec. 28, while gross margins shrank to
41.9 percent from 48.5 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company rose to prominence selling high-end computer
servers in the 1990s but never fully recovered from the dotcom
bubble burst earlier this decade. Analysts also say it has
failed to fully capitalize on its software assets including
Solaris and Java.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts have thought from the start that a deal
between Sun and IBM could prove difficult, particularly due to
the likelihood of intense antitrust scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The merger would give the combined company 65 percent of
the $17 billion high-end Unix server market, according to
market researcher IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Failed negotiations with IBM could mean that Sun will need
to look for another buyer, and contend with a lower offer. But
no bidder other than IBM has emerged in the months that Sun has
been shopping itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal reported that Sun had demanded
assurances from IBM that it would proceed with the deal in the
face of regulatory challenges, fearing IBM's offer left too
much room for it to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEGOTIATION TACTIC?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While a deal was widely seen as more crucial for Sun than
for IBM, many analysts had also said it would help IBM if the
company is able to cut costs and make better use of Sun's
assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares have also risen 10 percent since the
negotiations were first reported, helped by an upswing in the
overall market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer for Solaris
Investment Management, which manages about $2 billion, said the
latest developments could be part of negotiating tactics and
that Sun is still likely to strike a deal at around $9.40 a
share and that IBM was still the most likely buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Like any acquisition candidate they are trying to force
the highest bid possible," Ghriskey said. "IBM doesn't
necessarily need these assets. But I think they could probably
benefit from them at a reasonable price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buying Sun would hand IBM a clear lead at the high end of
the $45 billion overall server market fought over with
Hewlett-Packard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would also broaden IBM's software portfolio, add storage
products that vie with EMC Corp (EMC.N) and Network Appliance
Inc (NTAP.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have said Sun's software could also help IBM
compete with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), as well as Cisco Systems
Inc (CSCO.O), which some see as IBM's biggest rival in the long
term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Cisco and IBM have been expanding beyond their
traditional products to new technologies like "cloud
computing," in which companies store data and computing power
in remote data centers accessed over the Internet, rather than
buy their own computer equipment.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes dateline from previous SAN FRANCISCO; adds quotes,
detail, future terminal operations, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Yereth Rosen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska, April 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
has suspended production from its Cook Inlet oil operations in
Alaska after eruptions at Mount Redoubt Volcano forced an
indefinite shutdown at a tank farm it uses for storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company normally produces about 7,500 barrels a day
from the 10 offshore platforms it operates in Cook Inlet, but
it suspended all production after Redoubt exploded for the 19th
time early Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That interrupted a tanker-loading operation at the Drift
River Oil Terminal that had been intended to free up some
storage capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Drift River terminal, on the western shore of Cook
Inlet, is operated by Cook Inlet Pipe Line Co, which is owned
by Chevron and Pacific Energy Resources PFE.TO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The terminal had been closed since March 22, when Redoubt
began erupting. Chevron, which operates the offshore Granite
Point, Trading Bay and McArthur River oil fields, has since
struggled with storage space. The company cut production at the
mature fields in response to the volcano problems, and a week
ago shut in two of its platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike Chevron, Pacific Energy Resources has not curtailed
Cook Inlet oil production because it has adequate alternative
storage, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company operates the Redoubt Shoal unit, which has
about two months of remaining storage capacity, said David
Hall, the company's Alaska production manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is considering ways to restart production without
using Drift River, spokeswoman Roxanne Sinz said. "At this
point, we're taking a look at some options," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Drift River terminal lies at the mouth of a river that
flows from the volcano. The Drift River valley is subject to
lahars -- mudslides and floods created when volcanic explosions
melt the snow and ice on the 10,197-foot peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Environmentalists see a risk of spills from the terminal's
oil-laden tankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far, the terminal's containment system has protected the
oil tanks, officials said at a news conference on Monday. "It's
held up quite well. It's taken two big punches from lahars, and
it continues to do its job," Gary Folley of the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the weekend, the terminal briefly reopened to allow a
Tesoro Corp. (TSO.N) tanker to load some of the 148,000 barrels
of crude oil that had been stranded since Redoubt started
erupting last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tanker loaded 87,603 barrels of crude oil -- about 60
percent of the amount stored at Drift River -- but Sunday's
explosion precluded plans to do anything more, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The risk to people at this point outweighs the benefit of
any additional effort" to bring more oil into the terminal from
the platforms, U.S. Coast Guard Captain Mark Hamilton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plans for future terminal operations are unclear, said Rod
Ficken, vice president of Cook Inlet Pipe Line. "We don't have
an idea exactly what will happen. We will wait for the volcano
to rest," Ficken said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil from the Drift River terminal is usually shipped by
tanker to Tesoro's refinery in nearby Kenai. The normal
schedule is for a Tesoro tanker to load up with crude at Drift
River about once a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Explosions at Redoubt, a volcano 106 miles southwest of
Anchorage, have sent ash clouds as high as 10 miles into the
sky, dusted cities and small communities and forced numerous
flight cancellations and a brief shutdown of Anchorage's
international airport.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Shares of Sun Microsystems Inc tumbled 23 percent after it rejected a $7 billion buyout bid from IBM, leaving the smaller server and software maker vulnerable to lawsuits from shareholders nervous about its viability as a stand-alone company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid expectation that the collapse of deal talks with IBM could put pressure on Sun Chief Executive Jonathan Schwartz, Sun said in an e-mailed statement on Monday that it would stand by its leadership team and growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some on Wall Street held out hopes for bargaining to resume, a source with knowledge of the matter said that talks broke down over the weekend after Sun turned down International Business Machines Corp's offer of up to $9.40 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun shares fell to $6.56 from their close last week at $8.49. But they remain above the $4.97 level before the talks with IBM were first reported on March 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts said a sale to IBM may have been the best move for Sun, which has been losing share to rivals like IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co, and the breakdown underscored Sun's significantly weaker position at the bargaining table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like they're in somewhat of a dilemma. Its operational history of the past four to eight quarters doesn't seem to be working well for them, nor have their efforts to sell assets," said Tom Smith, analyst at SP Equity Research. He downgraded Sun's shares to "sell" from "hold" and lowered its 12-month price target to $6 from $9.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street on average expects Sun to report a third straight quarter of losses, excluding special items, for the quarter ended in March, despite efforts to control costs, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banking sources say Sun has been shopping itself for the past several months, and it appears IBM was the only bidder that came forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failed negotiations with IBM could mean Sun would have to contend with an even lower offer, or worse, none at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said Sun could sell itself in parts to software companies which do not want, or cannot afford, the whole company. Many said such sales would likely bring in less than a sale of the whole company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit default swaps insuring Sun's debt jumped to around 143 basis points, or $143,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, from around 95 basis points on Friday, according to Markit Intraday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER YAHOO?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some predicted Sun could face anger from shareholders in the same way that Yahoo Inc co-founder and previous Chief Executive Officer Jerry Yang did after he rejected Microsoft Corp's $47.5 billion bid last year. Yang eventually stepped down under strong criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We sure hope that shareholders don't experience a Yahoo," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management, which owns both Sun and IBM shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun declined to confirm or comment on the latest developments, but said it would stand by its leadership team. Schwartz had replaced Scott McNealy as CEO in 2006. McNealy, one of the founders of the Silicon Valley start-up, stayed on as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a policy Sun does not comment on rumors or speculation. What we can say is that Sun is committed to its leadership team, growth strategy and building value for its shareholders," Sun said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While IBM had been negotiating the price downwards, according to a source, the last bid still represented a premium of up to 89 percent on Sun's shares before deal talks were first reported in mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the size of the premium and the fact that Sun's board has presided over a decline in the company's stock price over the last eight years from over $250 per share to less than $5, we believe that Sun is likely to face significant shareholder unrest, similar to what occurred when Yahoo declined Microsoft's offer," Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Donald Zakarin, chairman of litigation at law firm Pryor Cashman LLP in New York, said any shareholder lawsuit may face difficulty unless it can prove that Sun's board was opposed to any deal and that it did not reasonably consider an offer. Neither Sun nor IBM has issued any public statements on their talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would be hard to suggest in this case that Sun's board was not interested in selling," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRINKMANSHIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some said the breakdown of the talks might just be brinkmanship and the two sides could come back to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't think the final chapter of this conversation's been written," said Wirtz, adding that shareholders would likely demand an explanation if talks didn't resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there's no deal, all shareholders of Sun want to hear an articulation of why this company will work independently. A lot of people own the stock and you may see some noisy investors," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts said that further negotiations could prove lengthy and weigh on Sun's shares. Even if the two sides agreed to a deal soon, they would likely face intense regulatory scrutiny due to the strong position a combined company would have in the high-end server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many said IBM had less to lose either way, as the company has fared relatively well despite the current economic downtrend, helped by aggressive cost cuts and a shift from hardware to higher-margin technology services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said IBM could benefit from buying Sun by bolstering its market share in high end servers against competitors such as Hewlett-Packard Co. But they also said Sun's assets, such as its Java programing language and Solaris operating system, were "nice to have" for IBM, rather than crucial for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell 0.65 percent at $101.56 on Monday, but outperformed the Nasdaq's decline of 0.93 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Martha Graybow)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando and Jim Finkle, editing by Tiffany Wu, Gerald E.

McNealy, one of the founders of the Silicon Valley start-up, stayed on as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRINKMANSHIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some said the breakdown of the talks might just be brinkmanship and the two sides could come back to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't think the final chapter of this conversation's been written," said Wirtz, adding that shareholders would likely demand an explanation if talks didn't resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there's no deal, all shareholders of Sun want to hear an articulation of why this company will work independently. A lot of people own the stock and you may see some noisy investors," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts said that further negotiations could prove lengthy and weigh on Sun's shares. Even if the two sides agreed to a deal soon, they would likely face intense regulatory scrutiny due to the strong position a combined company would have in the high-end server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many said IBM had less to lose either way, as the company has fared relatively well despite the current economic downtrend, helped by aggressive cost cuts and a shift from hardware to higher-margin technology services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said IBM could benefit from buying Sun by bolstering its market share in high end servers against competitors such as Hewlett-Packard Co. But Sun's assets, such as its Java programing language and Solaris operating system, were "nice to have" to IBM, rather than crucial for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares were down 1.7 percent at $100.47 in afternoon trade on Monday, but outperformed the Nasdaq's decline of around 2.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando, editing by Tiffany Wu and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, April 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. oil company normally produces about 7,500 barrels

&lt;p&gt;New Data Topic of Audio Press Briefing
JUPITER, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Several of the nation`s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs,
Citibank, Wells Fargo, Sun Trust Bank, HSBC Bank USA, plus more than 1,800
regional and smaller institutions are at risk of failure despite government
bailouts, according to Martin D. Weiss, Ph.D., president of Weiss Research,
Inc., an independent research firm. 

The analysis is based on Fourth Quarter 2008 data from TheStreet.Com and the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Several large institutions received
significant ratings downgrades from the prior quarter, including Citibank,
downgraded from C- to D; Wells Fargo, downgraded from C- to D+; and SunTrust
Bank, downgraded from C- to D+. 

To discuss the new data and his analysis, Dr. Weiss will conduct an audio press
briefing tomorrow, as follows:

 Date and time:           Tuesday, April 7, 11 a.m., Eastern Time.   
 Phone # to call:         1-866-228-9900; Overseas +1-719-359-4032.  
 Conference name:         Weiss                                      
 Participant passcode:    721451                                     


In addition, Dr. Weiss will provide updated commentary of his white paper issued
on March 19. Titled "Dangerous Unintended Consequences: How Banking Bailouts,
Buyouts and Nationalizations Can Only Prolong America`s Second Great Depression
and Weaken Any Subsequent Recovery," the white paper names U.S. banks and
thrifts believed to be at risk of failure, using that data to demonstrate that
the U.S. government greatly underestimates the scope of the debt crisis, while
overestimating its ability to effectively save troubled institutions without
severe adverse consequences. 

The debt crisis is much greater than the government has reported, according to
the white paper. The FDIC`s "Problem List" of troubled banks includes 252
institutions with assets of $159 billion. The updated review by Weiss Research,
however, shows that 1,816 banks and thrifts are at risk of failure, with total
assets of $4.67 trillion, compared to 1,568 institutions, with $2.32 trillion in
total assets in prior quarter. 

Five large U.S. banks have credit exposure related to their derivatives trading
that exceeds their capital, with four in particular - JPMorgan Chase, Goldman
Sachs, HSBC Bank America and Citibank - taking especially large risks. 

At year end 2008, Bank of America`s total credit exposure to derivatives was 179
percent of its risk-based capital; Citibank`s was 278 percent; JPMorgan Chase`s,
382 percent; and HSBC America`s, 550 percent, according to the Comptroller of
the Currency (OCC). In addition, in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs began
reporting as a commercial bank, revealing an alarming total credit exposure of
1,056 percent, or more than ten times its capital. Although the banking
authorities have not defined how much exposure is considered excessive, Weiss
believes that, as a rule, bank exposure to any single risk category should be
limited to 25 percent of capital. Goldman Sachs has exceeded that limit by a
factor of 42 to 1. 

"Equally alarming," writes Dr. Weiss, "is the fourth quarter OCC data
demonstrating that record bank losses are spreading to interest-rate
derivatives. Until now, bank derivatives losses have been limited almost
exclusively to credit defaults swaps (CDS), which represent only 7.8 percent of
the notional value U.S. derivatives held by all U.S. banks. In the fourth
quarter, although the CDS losses continued at a near-record pace, we also
witnessed record losses in the interest-rate sector, which represents 82 percent
of the derivatives market: The nation`s banks lost $3.4 billion in interest-rate
derivatives, or more than seven times their worst previous quarterly loss in
this category." 

Dr. Weiss continues, "In the face of such enormous risks and losses it`s
entirely unreasonable to expect the U.S. Government to offset them without
unacceptable damage to its own credit, credibility and borrowing power." 

Dr. Weiss points to early signs that the credit of the U.S. Treasury may already
be suffering some damage in the wake of government bailout programs such as the
$700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the Federal Reserve`s recent
$1.15 trillion commitment to purchase bonds, and the $1 trillion Private-Public
Investment Program (PPIP). For example, the cost of credit default swaps traded
by international investors to insure against a future default by the U.S.
Treasury recently surged to 14 times its 2007 level; while, more recently, the
price of the 30-year Treasury bonds has fallen by 24 points. 

"The `too-big-to-fail` doctrine has failed," concludes Weiss. In its place, he
recommends the following steps to build a firmer foundation for a future
recovery:

* Abandon the unrealistic goal of saving all failing financial institutions,
focusing instead on the goal of rebuilding the economy`s foundation in
preparation for an eventual recovery. 
* Pro-actively downsize or shut down the weakest institutions no matter how
large they may be; provide opportunities for borderline institutions to
rehabilitate themselves under a strict regulatory regime; and give
well-capitalized, liquid and prudently-managed institutions better opportunities
to gain market share. 
* Seriously consider breaking up the weak megabanks, following the model of the
Ma Bell breakup in 1984. 
* Build confidence in the banking system with better disclosure and
transparency, including the public release of the confidential official ratings
on all banks called CAMELS (Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management,
Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to market risk). 
* Switch priorities from the battles we can`t win to the war we can`t afford to
lose, such as emergency assistance for the millions most severely victimized by
a depression.

Due to the nation`s solid infrastructure and knowledge base, Weiss is optimistic
the U.S. can survive a broader banking crisis and even a second great
depression, with good prospects for an eventual recovery, provided we make the
right choices. Toward that goal, immediately following the audio press briefing
tomorrow, Dr. Weiss will launch a national grassroots campaign with an online
video webinar for over 50,000 investors that have registered for the event. The
webinar takes place at 12 noon Eastern Time and the press is also invited to
attend by registering at http://images.moneyandmarkets.com/DSG-MED/.

&lt;p&gt; * Commission says Visa fees inflate cost for retailers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Visa says Commission charges include possibility of fines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Visa shares down 2.2 percent
 (Updates with Visa CEO comments, share prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRUSSELS, April 6 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust
regulators accused payment card company Visa Europe (V.N) on
Monday of restricting competition between banks with its fees
for cross-border transactions, and threatened it with fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The statement of objections outlines the Commission's
preliminary view that Visa's MIFs harm competition between
acquiring banks, inflate the cost of payment card acceptance for
merchants and ultimately increase consumer prices," the
Commission said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's chief executive, Peter Ayliffe, told reporters the
charges were related to the company's previous method of setting
its MIFs -- cross-border multilateral interchange fees -- and
not its new methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the new method, the company recently cut its
cross-border credit transaction charges to an average of 0.61
percent from 0.7 percent and for debit payments to an average of
18 euro cents from 28 euro cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's shares were 2.5 percent down to $58.56 by 1434 GMT
and MasterCard 2 percent lower at $170.60. The DJ industrial
average .DJI was 1.4 percent off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brussels is seeking to boost economic growth with cheaper
banking and card fees, making them more accessible to consumers
and businesses. Last week, it dropped its case against
MasterCard (MA.N) after the company pledged sharply lower fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission said Visa's new measures were not sufficient
to allay its concerns that its MIFs restricted competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We certainly feel we have to fight this point of
principle," Ayliffe said, referring to the company's dispute
with the Commission over the basis of comparison for its credit
fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the Commission's charge sheet mentioned possible
fines on the company for its infringements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's credit and debit cards account for about a third of
all payment cards issue in the European Economic Area, the
Commission said. Retailers say domestic and cross-border payment
card transaction fees in Europe amount to 12 billion euros
($16.24 billion) annually.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Shares of Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O tumbled 24 percent on Monday after the company  rejected rival computer and software maker International Business Machines Corp's (IBM.N) $7 billion offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sun shares fell to $6.44 in pre-market trading after Sun pulled the plug on the deal which might have spelled the end of an era for a networking company that was once synonymous with the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The buyout was seen as a means for survival for the once-storied Silicon Valley company, which has been losing market share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sun was unhappy with IBM's offer of $9.40 per share or below, and it was unclear if talks would resume, according to a source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The bid represented a premium of up to 89 percent on Sun's shares before deal talks were first reported last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sun shares had risen to $8.49 on Friday, from $4.97 on March 17, a day before talks between the two technology companies were first reported. The Wall Street Journal had previously said IBM's original bid was $10 to $11 a share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal may have helped IBM bolster its offering of computer servers, storage equipment and software as competition heats up with rivals like Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sun rose to prominence selling high-end computer servers in the 1990s but never fully recovered from the dot-com bubble burst earlier this decade. Analysts also say it failed to fully capitalize on its software assets including Solaris and Java. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Failed talks with IBM could mean that Sun will need to find another buyer, and contend with a lower offer. But no bidder other than IBM has emerged in the months that Sun has been shopping itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Franklin Paul) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Email: Franklin.Paul@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 223 6195; Reuters Messaging: Franklin.Paul.reuters.com@reuters.net)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (To read more about our Media news, visit out MediaFile blog online at blogs.reuters.com/mediafile ) Keywords: SUN/SHARES &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Revolution Money, an online payment firm backed by AOL co-founder Steve Case, said on Monday it has received funding of $42 million from a group that includes a Goldman Sachs (GS.N) affiliate and earlier investors Citigroup (C.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revolution Money, part of Washington-based Revolution LLC, competes with EBay Inc's (EBAY.O) PayPal service in peer to peer money transfers, and offers a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will use the money to beef up its technology and help retailers promote the credit card, with a view to reaching 3 million retailers by 2011 despite tumbling U.S. retail sales, chairman Ted Leonsis told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see more rapid adoption of our service as merchants fight in this economy for more margin from sales," said Leonsis, who owns the National Hockey League's Washington Capitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revolution Money estimated its RevolutionCard credit card is accepted at about 650,000 locations in the United States including those of bookseller Barnes  Noble Inc (BKS.N), upscale grocer Whole Foods Market Inc WFMI.O and department store chain Nordstrom (JWN.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leonsis said Revolution competes with PayPal by letting users transfer funds to one another for free and with major credit card issuers, such as Visa Inc (V.N) MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and American Express Co (AXP.N) by offering competitive interchange fees for merchants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interchange fees are paid by merchants to a credit card company when a customer makes a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new investment follows on a $50 million funding in 2007 from Citi, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Case and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite attracting these investments in a difficult capital market, Leonsis said Revolution Money would not consider an initial public offering or put itself up for sale before 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, we are focused on the build-out of the platform, but at some point to really scale the business, we would have to go public," Leonsis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Leonsis thinks the business will be large enough in two years to attract public investors or a possible acquirer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Phil Wahba; editing by Mohammad Zargham)&lt;/p&gt;

The Internet-based, proprietary RevolutionCard Network today supports the
following products:

* RevolutionCard - a general-use credit card that charges no interchange fees
and only a half-percent processing fee per transaction to accept - up to an 80
percent savings over other credit card offerings. Merchants turn some of these
savings into customer loyalty and cash-back programs. The PIN-based card also
offers the best identity theft available, as the card itself bears no personal
information about the cardholder. Today, RevolutionCard is accepted at more than
650,000 merchant locations and 85 percent of all ATMs throughout the U.S.
Consumers can apply for a RevolutionCard at www.RevolutionCard.com.

* Revolution MoneyExchange - With more than 400,000 current users, Revolution
MoneyExchange is a free online P2P payments service that enables users to
exchange money for free. Consumers can start transferring money to friends,
family, or merchants online by registering at www.RevolutionMoneyExchange.com.
Users can also access their online funds at all merchants and ATMs on the
RevolutionCard Network.

Many of the country`s favorite retailers and their customers are benefiting from
the RevolutionCard today. For example, cardholders can save 3 cents per gallon
at the nearly 1,000 Murphy USA and Murphy Express gas stations typically located
in the Wal-Mart Supercenter parking areas across 20 states. RevolutionCard today
is accepted by Barnes &amp; Noble, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Bloomingdale's, Buy.com, CVS,

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRANKFURT, April 6 (Reuters) - Shares of Sun Microsystems
Inc JAVA.O dropped on Monday after a source with knowledge of
the matter told Reuters that IBM's (IBM.N) talks to acquire its
smaller rival broke down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun Microsystems' Frankfurt-listed shares JAVA.F were down
23.9 percent at 4.74 euros by 0816 GMT, while IBM's stock there
(IBM.F) was down 0.4 percent at 75.50 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source had told Reuters on Sunday the talks had
collapsed after Sun rejected IBM's $7 billion offer.
[ID:nN05344764]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The buyout was seen as a means of survival for the Silicon
Valley company, which has been losing market share. A deal would
also have helped IBM compete more effectively against rivals
such as Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An IBM spokesman had declined to comment, while Sun
officials did not return calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources told Reuters in March that IBM was in exclusive
talks to buy Sun and had proceeded to the due diligence stage.
One source had said on Saturday that IBM lowered its offer price
for Sun to $9.50 a share from $9.55 a share and that a deal may
be announced this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun shares had risen to $8.49 on Friday, from $4.97 on March
17, a day before talks between the two technology companies were
first reported. The Wall Street Journal had previously said
IBM's original bid was $10 to $11 a share.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM's talks to acquire smaller computer and software rival Sun Microsystems Inc broke down on Sunday after Sun rejected IBM's $7 billion offer, a source with knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collapse of negotiations, if final, is likely to hurt Sun's shares as a buyout was seen as a means of survival for the once-storied Silicon Valley company, which has been losing market share. A deal would also have helped IBM compete more effectively against rivals such as Hewlett-Packard Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said Sun was unhappy with International Business Machines Corp's offer of $9.40 per share or below, and that it was unclear if talks would resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bid represented a premium of up to 89 percent on Sun's shares before deal talks were first reported last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sun is now sort of damaged goods," said Peter Falvey, a technology banker at Revolution Partners. "If IBM got under the covers and didn't like what they saw, then what does that mean for other potential buyers?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IBM spokesman declined to comment, while Sun officials did not return calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources told Reuters last month that IBM was in exclusive talks to buy Sun and had proceeded to the due diligence stage. One source had said on Saturday that IBM lowered its offer price for Sun to $9.50 a share from $9.55 a share and that a deal may be announced this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun shares had risen to $8.49 on Friday, from $4.97 on March 17, a day before talks between the two technology companies were first reported. The Wall Street Journal had previously said IBM's original bid was $10-$11 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEAL FACTORED IN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collapsed talks are expected to damage the smaller Sun more than IBM, the world's largest technology services provider, which has fared relatively well despite the global economic slump thanks to its outsourcing business and its shift from hardware to higher-margin software sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman Brothers analyst Shaw Wu said it was a mistake for Sun to reject the bid, citing the leap in Sun shares since reports of the deal talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The acquisition is already factored into the market's thinking. To reject it over 50 cents a share, or whatever it may be, doesn't seem like a very prudent move," Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun posted an 11 percent decline in quarterly revenue for its fiscal quarter ended December 28, while gross margins shrank to 41.9 percent from 48.5 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company rose to prominence selling high-end computer servers in the 1990s but never fully recovered from the dotcom bubble burst earlier this decade. Analysts also say it has failed to fully capitalize on its software assets including Solaris and Java.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have thought from the start that a deal between Sun and IBM could prove difficult, particularly due to the likelihood of intense antitrust scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The merger would give the combined company 65 percent of the $17 billion high-end Unix server market, according to market researcher IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failed negotiations with IBM could mean that Sun will need to look for another buyer, and contend with a lower offer. But no bidder other than IBM has emerged in the months that Sun has been shopping itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported that Sun had demanded assurances from IBM that it would proceed with the deal in the face of regulatory challenges, fearing IBM's offer left too much room for it to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEGOTIATION TACTIC?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a deal was widely seen as more crucial for Sun than for IBM, many analysts had also said it would help IBM if the company is able to cut costs and make better use of Sun's assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares have also risen 10 percent since the negotiations were first reported, helped by an upswing in the overall market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer for Solaris Investment Management, which manages about $2 billion, said the latest developments could be part of negotiating tactics and that Sun is still likely to strike a deal at around $9.40 a share and that IBM was still the most likely buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like any acquisition candidate they are trying to force the highest bid possible," Ghriskey said. "IBM doesn't necessarily need these assets. But I think they could probably benefit from them at a reasonable price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying Sun would hand IBM a clear lead at the high end of the $45 billion overall server market fought over with Hewlett-Packard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would also broaden IBM's software portfolio, add storage products that vie with EMC Corp and Network Appliance Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said Sun's software could also help IBM compete with Microsoft Corp, as well as Cisco Systems Inc, which some see as IBM's biggest rival in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Cisco and IBM have been expanding beyond their traditional products to new technologies like "cloud computing," in which companies store data and computing power in remote data centers accessed over the Internet, rather than buy their own computer equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston, and Anupreeta Das and Megan Davies in New York; Editing by Tiffany Wu, Martin Golan and Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) today announced that it has received a request for additional
information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") with respect to its
previously announced proposed acquisition of Wyeth. The request for information
from the FTC, often referred to as a "second request," was anticipated as part
of the regulatory process under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976 ("HSR Act"). 

Pfizer intends to respond expeditiously to this request and continue to work
cooperatively with the FTC in connection with its review. Completion of the
transaction remains subject to the expiration of the waiting period under the
HSR Act, governmental and regulatory approvals in certain other jurisdictions,
approval by the stockholders of Wyeth, the satisfaction of certain conditions
related to the debt financing for the transaction, and other usual and customary
closing conditions. Pfizer and Wyeth continue to expect the transaction to close
at the end of the third quarter or during the fourth quarter of 2009.

This press release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, but are not limited to,
statements about the benefits of the proposed merger between Pfizer and Wyeth,
including future financial and operating results, the combined company's plans,
objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not
historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and
expectations of Pfizer's and Wyeth's management and are subject to significant
risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements. Neither Pfizer nor Wyeth undertake any obligation to
update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements. The following factors,
among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements: the possibility that the expected synergies from the
proposed merger of Pfizer and Wyeth will not be realized, or will not be
realized within the expected time period, due to, among other things, the impact
of pharmaceutical industry regulation and pending legislation that could affect
the pharmaceutical industry; the ability to obtain governmental and
self-regulatory organization approvals of the merger on the proposed terms and
schedule; the failure of Wyeth stockholders to approve the merger; the risk that
the businesses will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the merger
making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the
possibility that the merger does not close, including, but not limited to, due
to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions; Pfizer's and Wyeth's ability
to accurately predict future market conditions; dependence on the effectiveness
of Pfizer's and Wyeth's patents and other protections for innovative products;
the risk of new and changing regulation and health policies in the U.S. and
internationally and the exposure to litigation and/or regulatory actions.
Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Pfizer's 2008 Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the

&lt;p&gt; * Revolution Money targets being in 3 mln stores by 2011&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * No IPO or putting itself up for sale before 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Phil Wahba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Revolution Money, an online
payment firm backed by AOL co-founder Steve Case, said on
Monday it has received funding of $42 million from a group that
includes a Goldman Sachs (GS.N) affiliate and earlier investors
Citigroup (C.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revolution Money, part of Washington-based Revolution LLC,
competes with EBay Inc's (EBAY.O) PayPal service in peer to
peer money transfers, and offers a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will use the money to beef up its technology
and help retailers promote the credit card, with a view to
reaching 3 million retailers by 2011 despite tumbling U.S.
retail sales, chairman Ted Leonsis told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see more rapid adoption of our service as merchants
fight in this economy for more margin from sales," said
Leonsis, who owns the National Hockey League's Washington
Capitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revolution Money estimated its RevolutionCard credit card
is accepted at about 650,000 locations in the United States
including those of bookseller Barnes  Noble Inc (BKS.N),
upscale grocer Whole Foods Market Inc WFMI.O and department
store chain Nordstrom (JWN.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leonsis said Revolution competes with PayPal by letting
users transfer funds to one another for free and with major
credit card issuers, such as Visa Inc (V.N) MasterCard Inc
(MA.N) and American Express Co (AXP.N) by offering competitive
interchange fees for merchants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interchange fees are paid by merchants to a credit card
company when a customer makes a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new investment follows on a $50 million funding in 2007
from Citi, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Case
and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite attracting these investments in a difficult capital
market, Leonsis said Revolution Money would not consider an
initial public offering or put itself up for sale before 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Right now, we are focused on the build-out of the
platform, but at some point to really scale the business, we
would have to go public," Leonsis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Leonsis thinks the business will be large enough in
two years to attract public investors or a possible acquirer.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of Goldman Sachs called on Tuesday for reforms to executive pay and a broadening of financial regulation in a contrite speech that was twice interrupted by protesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, whose firm has taken $10 billion in taxpayer funds, said the economic crisis had been "deeply humbling" for financial firms, and banks receiving taxpayer bailout money need to pay back the funds as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters waved a large pink poster saying "We Want Our $$$$ Back" and yelled that taxpayers wanted to know why they should bail out Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid audience boos directed at the protesters, Blankfein told the Council of Institutional Investors conference that their message was "nevertheless real and visceral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that reflects a prevailing view in the world," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said Wall Street firms got caught up in the pursuit of profits and ignored risks. He said they needed to dramatically change compensation practices to bring responsibility back to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Decisions on compensation and other actions taken and not taken, particularly at banks that rapidly lost a lot of shareholder value, look self-serving and greedy in hindsight," Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REFORMS TO PAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He laid out reforms to pay, including rewarding long-term performance, instead of short-term gains, through deferred compensation and "clawbacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual compensation should not be set without factoring in the performance of the business unit and overall firm, Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Employees should share in the upside when overall performance is strong and they should all share in the downside when overall performance is weak," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding regulation, Blankfein said financial institutions needed to accept more oversight, including hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He voiced support for a systemic risk regulator that can look at every firm, product or practice that may pose a danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this vein, all pools of capital that depend on the smooth functioning of the financial system, and are large enough to be a burden on it in a crisis, should be subject to some degree of regulation," Blankfein said. "Yes, that includes large hedge funds and private equity funds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank, received $10 billion from the government in October under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It plans to pay back the funds this year, as the money comes with strings attached, such as caps on executive compensation, dividend restrictions, and limits on share repurchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein told the protesters it was important for the public to understand the capital provided to banks was meant as a broader stimulus effort to get the financial system back on its feet, not a bailout of individual firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks should pay back the taxpayer money as soon as it is feasible, as the capital injections were "never intended to be permanent capital," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EARNING TRUST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it will take years for the financial industry to earned back public confidence. One way to shore up that confidence is through mark-to-market, or fair value, accounting, Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark-to-market, also known as fair value accounting, is aimed at giving investors an accurate view of financial companies' books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some banks and investors have blamed the rules for accelerating the financial crisis by triggering billions of dollars in writedowns, leading to reduced capital levels and less lending. Last week the Financial Accounting Standards Board approved guidance to ease the impact of fair value accounting in illiquid markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fair value accounting gives investors more clarity with respect to balance sheet risk," Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Karey Wutkowski in Washington; additional reporting by Joseph A.

their message was "nevertheless real and visceral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think that reflects a prevailing view in the world," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein said Wall Street firms got caught up in the
pursuit of profits and ignored risks. He said they needed to
dramatically change compensation practices to bring
responsibility back to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Decisions on compensation and other actions taken and not
taken, particularly at banks that rapidly lost a lot of
shareholder value, look self-serving and greedy in hindsight,"
Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REFORMS TO PAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He laid out reforms to pay, including rewarding long-term
performance, instead of short-term gains, through deferred
compensation and "clawbacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Individual compensation should not be set without factoring
in the performance of the business unit and overall firm,
Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Employees should share in the upside when overall
performance is strong and they should all share in the downside
when overall performance is weak," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regarding regulation, Blankfein said financial institutions
needed to accept more oversight, including hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He voiced support for a systemic risk regulator that can
look at every firm, product or practice that may pose a
danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In this vein, all pools of capital that depend on the
smooth functioning of the financial system, and are large
enough to be a burden on it in a crisis, should be subject to
some degree of regulation," Blankfein said. "Yes, that includes
large hedge funds and private equity funds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank, received $10
billion from the government in October under the Troubled Asset
Relief Program. It plans to pay back the funds this year, as
the money comes with strings attached, such as caps on
executive compensation, dividend restrictions, and limits on
share repurchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein told the protesters it was important for the
public to understand the capital provided to banks was meant as
a broader stimulus effort to get the financial system back on
its feet, not a bailout of individual firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks should pay back the taxpayer money as soon as it is
feasible, as the capital injections were "never intended to be
permanent capital," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EARNING TRUST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said it will take years for the financial industry to
earned back public confidence. One way to shore up that
confidence is through mark-to-market, or fair value,
accounting, Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark-to-market, also known as fair value accounting, is
aimed at giving investors an accurate view of financial
companies' books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some banks and investors have blamed the rules for
accelerating the financial crisis by triggering billions of
dollars in writedowns, leading to reduced capital levels and
less lending. Last week the Financial Accounting Standards
Board approved guidance to ease the impact of fair value
accounting in illiquid markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Fair value accounting gives investors more clarity with
respect to balance sheet risk," Blankfein said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Tuesday it will have two research chiefs -- one in charge of traditional medicines and one in charge of biotech drugs and vaccines -- when the drugmaker completes its planned purchase of smaller U.S. rival Wyeth WYE.N.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The new structure will allow us to move through the integration much more easily, because you know who the leadership is," Pfizer's current head of research Martin Mackay said in an interview. "The key to success is how well these divisions work together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it still aims to complete the acquisition, valued at $68 billion when the merger was announced in January, by the end of the third quarter or in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's biggest focus is "small molecule" drugs, meaning traditional oral medicines made from synthetic chemicals. Wyeth's strong suit is vaccines and biotech drugs -- injectable or intravenous drugs that are made in living cells and are adept at blocking or activating specific proteins linked to diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the merger, Mackay will give up his title as Pfizer's head of global research and development and instead lead a newly created PharmaTherapeutics Group focusing on discovery of small molecule drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate BioTherapeutics Research Group, focusing on vaccines and biotech medicines, will be led by Mikael Dolsten, Wyeth's current head of research, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mackay and Dolsten will serve as presidents of their respective groups and report to Pfizer Chief Executive Jeff Kindler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer became the world's biggest drugmaker over the past decade by buying two other smaller rivals -- Pharmacia and Warner-Lambert -- but its laboratories have produced few medicines over that period despite a $7 billion annual research budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mackay said an infusion of fresh blood and talent from Wyeth will help ensure a change of fortune for Pfizer's far-flung research centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wyeth will bring us this prowess in biotherapeutics and vaccines, and also a significant presence in disease areas that are important to us, like Alzheimer's disease and oncology," Mackay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're well poised to deliver a whole crop of new products," Mackay said, noting that Pfizer has an impressive number of experimental medicines in late-stage testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian Read, now president of global pharmaceutical operations at Pfizer, is slated to become group president of Pfizer BioPharmaceutical Businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other senior Wyeth researchers are also being reserved top posts at Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emilio Emini, a respected industry scientist who heads Wyeth vaccines and formerly ran Merck  Co's (MRK.N) vaccine unit, will become chief scientific officer of vaccine research at Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menelas Pangalos, Wyeth's current head of discovery who has spearheaded efforts to develop treatments for Alzheimer's disease, is slated to become Pfizer's chief scientific officer of neuroscience research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geno Germano, currently president of Wyeth's U.S. and Pharmaceuticals business units, will become president of Pfizer's Specialty Care and Vaccines business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavan Redmond, now head of Wyeth's consumer healthcare business, will become group president of Pfizer Diversified Businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it will have nine global healthcare businesses after the merger, including nutritionals and consumer units to be acquired from Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were down 1 percent at $13.58 in late-afternoon activity on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a moderate downturn for the drug sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Matthew Lewis and Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synergy of innovative technology and collaborative care approach achieve quality
scores above the 90th percentile nationally
BEVERLY &amp; WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Northeast Physician Hospital Organization, Inc. (NEPHO), a Management Service
Organization (MSO) serving New England Community Medical Group and Northeast
Health System, and MedVentive, the leading provider of integrated performance
management solutions for providers and health plans, today announced they have
been recognized as winners of the Microsoft HUG (Microsoft Health Users Group)
2009 Innovation Awards in the category of Interoperability/HIE.

NEPHO has built a collaborative care approach that gives physicians and other
caregivers up-to-date, accurate data on the health of their patients.In addition
to data integration, they use automated workflow tools that make it easy to
proactively identify and outreach to patients in need of preventive or chronic
care.Powered by MedVentive`s platform, NEPHO has achieved scores over the 90th
percentile nationally based on the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set
(HEDIS) measures for several care categories, including diabetes, adult
preventive care, pediatric preventive care, women`s health, and cardiovascular
disease.For example, today NEPHO physicians can tell you how many diabetic or
hypertensive patients they have within their practice, the most recent results
and medications, and what screenings are outstanding.Five years ago, physicians
had a difficult time managing chronic disease patients, because a system to
track them, much less integrated into their workflow, was not available.A
combination of NEPHO leadership, processes flows integrated into the practices
and MedVentive technology made it happen.

Todd Lowthers, Manager of Physician Services of NEPHO, said, "Our partnership
with MedVentive has been key to our success.With their robust analytics platform
and quality registry applications tools, we`ve been able to integrate disparate
data sets to create a powerful community care solution that is focused on
results, not just information sharing.We are proud of the levels of quality that
we deliver to our patients, and we are pleased to be recognized by Microsoft as
the winner for the Interoperability/HIE HUG Award."

Nancy Ham, President of MedVentive added, "Interoperability has been talked
about by many, but achieved by few - and many of the success stories to date
have been focused primarily on data sharing.The ultimate goal, which NEPHO has
achieved, is to leverage access to administrative and clinical data integrated
from many disparate sources to accomplish demonstrable improvements in patient
health.We are thrilled that Microsoft has selected them as the winner."

MedVentive`s advanced business and clinical intelligence platform provides the
intervention, workflow, and physician collaboration tools that power NEPHO`s
successful program.MedVentive`s platform is comprised of a secure data mart
(with normalized, linked and risk-adjusted data) and a rich analytics reporting
layer.Data is received from disparate sources (medical and pharmacy claims from
multiple payers, hospital and ambulatory lab results, physician-entered data,
and more).The reporting layer provides interactive dashboards, hundreds of
preconfigured reports with dynamic, drill-down to the physician, patient, and
claim-level detail, five pre-formatted cubes, and direct access to the data mart
for robust reporting and analysis.The intuitive, online interface provides
instant access for the entire staff - from physicians to care managers to power
analysts - to the information they need to improve the delivery of preventive
and chronic care across their entire patient population.Embedded disease
registries allow continual monitoring of patients at the group and individual
level based on a variety of care measures (HEDIS, EBM, payer-specific Pay for
Performance programs, etc.).Outreach tools automate communication with
out-of-compliance patients, their physician, or both. The ability for physicians
to provide direct feedback as to the appropriateness of the requested
intervention is fundamental to respecting their clinical judgment and creating a
truly collaborative platform. The MedVentive platform utilizes a spectrum of
Microsoft products as its foundation.

"In selecting the winner of the Interoperability/HIE Award, NEPHO and their
partner MedVentive exemplified what the Microsoft HUG Awards are meant to
recognize.NEPHO utilized MedVentive`s Microsoft-based technology platform in a
way that improved communications and interoperability between different
healthcare constituencies, resulting in improved clinical and business
performance.At the end of the day, both NEPHO and MedVentive are tangibly
reaching the goal we`re all trying to achieve - better quality of care for the
patient population," said Chris Sullivan, U.S. health provider health solutions
director, Microsoft Corp.

&lt;p&gt;   (Adds details on the Maritimes  Northeast Pipeline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said
Tuesday the production field at the Sable Offshore Energy
Project in Nova Scotia was shut-in after an "operational
incident," cutting off about 400 million cubic feet per day of
gas production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The field is shut-in now. We were doing some maintenance
and operating at less than normal in the last while. Work is
underway to restore expected levels as soon as possible, but I
can't speculate on when that will happen," said Exxon spokesman
Merle MacIsaac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the company's website, the Sable Project is
owned by Exxon, Shell (RDSa.L), Imperial Oil (IMO.TO),
Pengrowth Energy Trust (PGH.N) and Mosbacher Operating Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project produces between 400 and 500 million cubic feet
of natural gas and 20,000 barrels of natural gas liquids per
day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natural gas from the Sable Project flows to markets in
Atlantic Canada and New England on Spectra's (SE.N) Maritimes 
Northeast Pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 340-mile (550-km) U.S. and 330-mile Canadian line, with
the capacity to deliver 440 mmcf per day in the U.S. and 530
mmcf per day in Canada, is majority owned by Spectra Energy
Transmission with Emera, Inc (EMA.TO) and Exxon Mobil owning
minority stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maritimes Canada said in a website posting that due to the
decrease in supply from Sable, shippers should take immediate
steps to insure that scheduled deliveries commensurate with
receipts and that meter operators adhere to scheduled volumes
until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If shippers do not voluntarily address the situation,
Maritimes said it may issue operational flow orders or take
other actions to minimize pipeline imbalances.

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX, Apr 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Alliance for Gray Market and Counterfeit Abatement (AGMA), a
non-profit organization dedicated to addressing the gray marketing and
counterfeiting of technology products around the globe, today announced
that it has added a new member company to its roster. Juniper Networks,
the leader in high-performance networking, has joined AGMA.

    "Juniper Networks is very pleased to join AGMA in order to partner
collaboratively with other industry leading high technology companies in
combating the growing problem of counterfeiting and gray marketing of IT
products," noted Lorne Morris, director of worldwide compliance for
Juniper Networks. "The opportunity for Juniper to leverage the combined
knowledge and expertise of many of the foremost experts in the field is
of tremendous benefit to protect the brand equity of Juniper and our
partners. Our ability to gain access to best-in-class strategies,
programs and effective processes which address this growing threat makes
participation in AGMA essential for us."

    AGMA has appointed Cori Hartje, senior director Microsoft Genuine Software
Initiative as a new director. Along with overseeing various anti-piracy
efforts and product group integration programs focused towards Microsoft's
efforts at preventing counterfeit and other forms of software piracy,
Hartje is active with various industry groups and is a spokesman for
anti-piracy activities.

    AGMA's Asia Pacific Council meeting was held in Hong Kong on March 12, and
focused on the important elements to successful prosecution in China with
the highest priority on building relationships with regional government
officials, including law enforcement and customs. At the meeting, which
was hosted by international law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie, AGMA members
learned that solid and substantial case documentation as well as a
comprehensively documented investigation and evidence are critical
factors to successful intellectual property rights trials in China.

    According to AGMA president Ram Manchi, "Counterfeiting, gray market
fraud, service abuse, and IP theft are among the most challenging issues
facing the IT industry today. AGMA's member companies are some of the most
influential companies in the high technology arena, and together we are
able to help address, educate and create awareness for these issues. Our
member meetings give us an opportunity to work together to identify
solutions and potential issues on the horizon -- by sharing experiences,
insights and ideas, we can help make a difference."

    There are many benefits to becoming a member. AGMA provides an open forum
where intellectual property brand owners can discuss trends, issues and
approaches to gray market fraud and counterfeiting in the technology
sector. It also uses a variety of avenues to get its message out and
cultivate change in the marketplace, including event speaking, educational
initiatives, benchmark studies, whitepapers, industry guidelines, and, as
appropriate, public policy advocacy in areas like law enforcement and
customs.

&lt;p&gt;Innovative Approach to Research Supporting Nine Diverse Businesses: Primary
Care, Specialty Care &amp; Vaccines, Emerging Markets, Oncology, Established
Products, Animal Health, Capsugel, Consumer Health, Nutritional Health
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) today announced the planned leadership and organizational
structure for its research and commercial operations that will become effective
when the Wyeth acquisition closes. 

The company will establish a unique research model designed to advance the
strong scientific capabilities of both Pfizer and Wyeth (NYSE: WYE) and to
support the new company`s nine diverse health care businesses. At the
senior-most level of the organization, Pfizer will retain eight senior
executives from Wyeth who will join the company post-closing. 

CEOs Jeff Kindler and Bernard Poussot and senior leadership of both companies
continue to work closely together through the integration process. As planning
continues, additional appointments are expected that will enable Pfizer to begin
appreciating the benefits of the combined company with a new team and structure
in place immediately following the close of the acquisition. 

A New Approach for Research

To maximize new opportunities in biopharmaceutical research, Pfizer will form
two distinct research organizations. The PharmaTherapeutics Research Group will
focus on the discovery of small molecules and related modalities and will be led
by Martin Mackay, who now leads Pfizer Global Research &amp; Development (PGRD). The
BioTherapeutics Research Group will focus on large-molecule research, including
vaccines, and will be led by Mikael Dolsten, who currently serves as President
of Wyeth Research. Both Dr. Dolsten and Dr. Mackay will serve as presidents of
their respective organizations and members of Pfizer`s Executive Leadership
Team, and both will report to Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff
Kindler. 

The new BioTherapeutics Research Group will capitalize on Wyeth`s
industry-leading expertise in biologics and build on the momentum established by
both Pfizer`s Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation Center (BBC) and centers of
large-molecule research and pharmaceutical science excellence in PGRD, which
will be part of the new, larger group. This new group`s mandate will be to
create a broad and deep pipeline in vaccines, antibodies, proteins, peptides,
nucleic acids and other novel modalities. The PharmaTherapeutics Research Group
will continue to advance the strong legacy of both Pfizer and Wyeth in
small-molecule discovery. 

Within these two research groups, small, focused scientific teams - targeting
specific high-potential therapeutic areas and leading-edge innovative
technologies - will be led by world-class Chief Scientific Officers who will act
as single points of accountability for delivering medical advances on behalf of
the company. These teams will be responsible for creating a rich portfolio of
both small and large molecules from across both research organizations and, in
particular, with delivering positive proofs-of-concept for Pfizer`s business
units to develop. They will also aggressively pursue collaborations with top
academic, public-sector and private-sector institutions to accelerate research
and development of new medicines. 

The combined scientific teams and programs of the two companies will enable
Pfizer to make significant advances in vaccines and neuroscience, among many
other areas of unmet medical need. In that connection, Emilio Emini, who
currently heads Wyeth`s Vaccine Research; and Development, will join Pfizer as
Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research, and Menelas Pangalos, who currently
serves as Wyeth`s Head of Discovery, will join Pfizer as Chief Scientific
Officer, Neuroscience Research. Dr. Emini and Dr. Pangalos bring incomparable
scientific expertise and outstanding leadership to Pfizer, which are essential
to building the world`s premier biopharmaceutical research and development
organization. 

Additionally, Pfizer will form a team of top scientists from both companies who
will seek and evaluate new technologies, platforms and pre-proof-of-concept
small and large molecules from external sources. As this group identifies
promising early-stage candidates from outside the company, it will collaborate
with Pfizer`s business development team to pursue these opportunities. By
complementing Pfizer`s internal research efforts, these scientists will help
assure Pfizer has access to the broadest set of early stage compounds and
technologies available to find new medicines for patients. 

"Creating two distinct, but complementary, research organizations, led by the
top scientist from each company, will provide sharper focus, less bureaucracy
and clearer accountability in drug discovery," Mr. Kindler said. "This structure
powerfully states our commitment to becoming the industry leader in small
molecules, large molecules and vaccines. Our approach to research will fuel our
discovery efforts, inspire top talent and translate into high-impact new
medicines for patients. I am honored that world-class scientists like Drs.
Dolsten, Emini and Pangalos will be joining the outstanding scientists at Pfizer
and, as we continue our integration planning, I look forward to our welcoming
many more distinguished Wyeth scientists to our organization." 

Enhanced Commercial Operating Structure

The new Pfizer will consist of nine diverse global health care businesses. As is
the case at Pfizer today, the leader of each of the company`s biopharmaceutical
businesses will have clear accountability for results from initial product
development to providing access to patients and through to the end of the
product`s life cycle. The businesses will be led by world-class executives from
both Pfizer and Wyeth who will have the resources to pursue attractive growth
opportunities and to meet the needs of patients and customers around the world. 

Ian Read, currently President of Worldwide Pharmaceutical Operations for Pfizer,
will become Group President, Pfizer BioPharmaceutical Businesses, and remain a
member of the Executive Leadership Team reporting to Mr. Kindler. In that
capacity, he will lead a group that includes five leading biopharmaceutical
businesses:

* Primary Care, led by President Olivier Brandicourt, will be the world`s
leading primary care business, with strong positions in cardiovascular (#1),
infectious disease (#2), immunology (#4) and central nervous system diseases
(#2), and with unique research and development opportunities in areas like
Alzheimer`s disease and pain. 
* Specialty Care and Vaccines will be led by President Geno Germano, currently
President of Wyeth`s U.S. and Pharmaceuticals business units. It will be the
world`s second largest specialty care business, with prominent positions in
inflammation (#2), vaccines (#4) and immunology (#4); leading products such as
Enbrel, the world`s leading biologic and Prevnar, the world`s leading vaccine;
and a strong pipeline of small- and large-molecule compounds.

Jim Connolly, currently Wyeth`s Executive Vice President &amp; General Manager,
Vaccines, will join the Specialty Care and Vaccines Business Unit as President,
Vaccines, reporting to Mr. Germano. He will lead an integrated vaccine business
comprising marketing, sales and medical affairs, which will align closely with
the Vaccine Research group led by Dr. Emini. They will work together to bring
innovative new vaccines to patients around the globe.

* Emerging Markets will continue to be led by President Jean-Michel Halfon and
will have a significantly enhanced presence in high-growth, less-developed and
under-penetrated markets, including those in Latin America, the Middle East and
China. 
* Oncology will continue to be led by President Garry Nicholson and will
continue to bring patients important treatments like Sutent. It will also bring
to market one of the most robust oncology product pipelines in the
biopharmaceutical industry, one that includes compounds focusing on diverse
tumor types including lung, colorectal, liver, prostate and breast. 
* Established Products will continue to be led by President David Simmons and
will continue to be a strong global business in a marketplace that is expected
to see significant growth in the years ahead. Through portfolio enhancement and
expansion activities, including new partnerships, Established Products will
continue to extend Pfizer`s reach into this important market segment.

Cavan Redmond, currently President of Wyeth`s Consumer Healthcare business, will
become Group President, Pfizer Diversified Businesses, join Pfizer`s Executive
Leadership Team and report to Mr. Kindler. This group will include four unique
businesses, each meeting important customer needs and offering significant
growth:

* Animal Health will continue to be led by President Juan-Ram&#243;n Alaix and will
have an enhanced leading position in the industry, with important large animal
and companion animal products and a platform that includes vaccines,
parasiticides and anti-infectives. 
* Capsugel will continue to be led by President Guido Driesen and will continue
to be the world's pre-eminent manufacturer and developer of capsule products,
equipment and services for the pharmaceutical and associated health care
industries. 
* Consumer Health will be led by President Paul Sturman, currently President,
U.S. and Global Business Development, New Products for Wyeth Consumer
Healthcare. Consumer Health will remain a leader in analgesics,
cough/cold/allergy and vitamin/nutritional supplements, including brands such as
Advil, Caltrate, Centrum, ChapStick, Robitussin and ThermaCare. 
* Nutritional Health will be led by President Erica Mann, currently Managing
Director of Wyeth Australia and New Zealand. The Nutritional business at Wyeth
operates in more than 50 countries and has a portfolio that includes a full line
of nutritional products, including infant formulas, follow-on formulas,
growing-up milks, and prenatal and adult supplements.

Mr. Kindler stated: "By putting together these businesses and combining in one
team a number of strong and experienced Pfizer and Wyeth leaders, we are
creating the world`s premier biopharmaceutical company - one that is powerfully
positioned to provide substantial value for patients, customers, colleagues and
shareholders." 

Integration Progress

Added Chief Financial Officer Frank D`Amelio, who is leading the integration on
behalf of Pfizer: "With today`s announcement we have taken another significant
step in preparing for the combining of these two great companies. Having our
organizational structure in place is critical to the combined company being
operational on Day One, and the appointment of these leaders will accelerate our
ability to do so. 

"We have made substantial progress in a short period of time, particularly in
financing, as well as other requirements for closing. Our progress affirms how
well these two companies fit together, the value of this combination, and the
commitment of our companies to rapid and successful integration," Mr. D`Amelio
said. 

Mr. Kindler noted: "I want particularly to thank Wyeth Chief Executive Officer
Bernard Poussot for his strong and steady leadership and his partnership. He is
an instrumental part of our integration efforts and will continue to provide us
with critical counsel and support until the close of the acquisition. Bernard`s
commitment to Wyeth leaders and to the success of the combined company is
extraordinary. 

"We look forward to welcoming these new colleagues and I am confident Pfizer
will be strengthened by the addition of many other exceptional Wyeth scientists
and business leaders. They will join Pfizer colleagues with whom they share a
commitment to delivering the full potential of the Pfizer-Wyeth combination to
patients, customers and investors," Mr. Kindler concluded. 

The leadership team will begin working together immediately upon the completion
of the acquisition. Until the acquisition is complete, Pfizer and Wyeth
leadership will continue in their current roles. Pfizer announced on January 26,
2009, that it is acquiring Wyeth in a cash-and-stock transaction to create the
world`s premier biopharmaceutical company. The acquisition remains subject to
customary closing conditions, including approval by the stockholders of Wyeth,
and regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions. Pfizer and Wyeth continue to
expect the transaction to close at the end of the third quarter or during the
fourth quarter of 2009.

This press release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, but are not limited to,
statements about the benefits of the proposed merger between Pfizer and Wyeth,
including future financial and operating results, the combined company's plans,
objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not

&lt;p&gt;Innovative Approach to Research Supporting Nine Diverse Businesses: Primary
Care, Specialty Care &amp; Vaccines, Emerging Markets, Oncology, Established
Products, Animal Health, Capsugel, Consumer Health, Nutritional Health
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) today announced the planned leadership and organizational
structure for its research and commercial operations that will become effective
when the Wyeth acquisition closes. 

The company will establish a unique research model designed to advance the
strong scientific capabilities of both Pfizer and Wyeth (NYSE: WYE) and to
support the new company`s nine diverse health care businesses. At the
senior-most level of the organization, Pfizer will retain eight senior
executives from Wyeth who will join the company post-closing. 

CEOs Jeff Kindler and Bernard Poussot and senior leadership of both companies
continue to work closely together through the integration process. As planning
continues, additional appointments are expected that will enable Pfizer to begin
appreciating the benefits of the combined company with a new team and structure
in place immediately following the close of the acquisition. 

A New Approach for Research

To maximize new opportunities in biopharmaceutical research, Pfizer will form
two distinct research organizations. The PharmaTherapeutics Research Group will
focus on the discovery of small molecules and related modalities and will be led
by Martin Mackay, who now leads Pfizer Global Research &amp; Development (PGRD). The
BioTherapeutics Research Group will focus on large-molecule research, including
vaccines, and will be led by Mikael Dolsten, who currently serves as President
of Wyeth Research. Both Dr. Dolsten and Dr. Mackay will serve as presidents of
their respective organizations and members of Pfizer`s Executive Leadership
Team, and both will report to Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff
Kindler. 

The new BioTherapeutics Research Group will capitalize on Wyeth`s
industry-leading expertise in biologics and build on the momentum established by
both Pfizer`s Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation Center (BBC) and centers of
large-molecule research and pharmaceutical science excellence in PGRD, which
will be part of the new, larger group. This new group`s mandate will be to
create a broad and deep pipeline in vaccines, antibodies, proteins, peptides,
nucleic acids and other novel modalities. The PharmaTherapeutics Research Group
will continue to advance the strong legacy of both Pfizer and Wyeth in
small-molecule discovery. 

Within these two research groups, small, focused scientific teams - targeting
specific high-potential therapeutic areas and leading-edge innovative
technologies - will be led by world-class Chief Scientific Officers who will act
as single points of accountability for delivering medical advances on behalf of
the company. These teams will be responsible for creating a rich portfolio of
both small and large molecules from across both research organizations and, in
particular, with delivering positive proofs-of-concept for Pfizer`s business
units to develop. They will also aggressively pursue collaborations with top
academic, public-sector and private-sector institutions to accelerate research
and development of new medicines. 

The combined scientific teams and programs of the two companies will enable
Pfizer to make significant advances in vaccines and neuroscience, among many
other areas of unmet medical need. In that connection, Emilio Emini, who
currently heads Wyeth`s Vaccine Research; and Development, will join Pfizer as
Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research, and Menelas Pangalos, who currently
serves as Wyeth`s Head of Discovery, will join Pfizer as Chief Scientific
Officer, Neuroscience Research. Dr. Emini and Dr. Pangalos bring incomparable
scientific expertise and outstanding leadership to Pfizer, which are essential
to building the world`s premier biopharmaceutical research and development
organization. 

Additionally, Pfizer will form a team of top scientists from both companies who
will seek and evaluate new technologies, platforms and pre-proof-of-concept
small and large molecules from external sources. As this group identifies
promising early-stage candidates from outside the company, it will collaborate
with Pfizer`s business development team to pursue these opportunities. By
complementing Pfizer`s internal research efforts, these scientists will help
assure Pfizer has access to the broadest set of early stage compounds and
technologies available to find new medicines for patients. 

"Creating two distinct, but complementary, research organizations, led by the
top scientist from each company, will provide sharper focus, less bureaucracy
and clearer accountability in drug discovery," Mr. Kindler said. "This structure
powerfully states our commitment to becoming the industry leader in small
molecules, large molecules and vaccines. Our approach to research will fuel our
discovery efforts, inspire top talent and translate into high-impact new
medicines for patients. I am honored that world-class scientists like Drs.
Dolsten, Emini and Pangalos will be joining the outstanding scientists at Pfizer
and, as we continue our integration planning, I look forward to our welcoming
many more distinguished Wyeth scientists to our organization." 

Enhanced Commercial Operating Structure

The new Pfizer will consist of nine diverse global health care businesses. As is
the case at Pfizer today, the leader of each of the company`s biopharmaceutical
businesses will have clear accountability for results from initial product
development to providing access to patients and through to the end of the
product`s life cycle. The businesses will be led by world-class executives from
both Pfizer and Wyeth who will have the resources to pursue attractive growth
opportunities and to meet the needs of patients and customers around the world. 

Ian Read, currently President of Worldwide Pharmaceutical Operations for Pfizer,
will become Group President, Pfizer BioPharmaceutical Businesses, and remain a
member of the Executive Leadership Team reporting to Mr. Kindler. In that
capacity, he will lead a group that includes five leading biopharmaceutical
businesses:

* Primary Care, led by President Olivier Brandicourt, will be the world`s
leading primary care business, with strong positions in cardiovascular (#1),
infectious disease (#2), immunology (#4) and central nervous system diseases
(#2), and with unique research and development opportunities in areas like
Alzheimer`s disease and pain. 
* Specialty Care and Vaccines will be led by President Geno Germano, currently
President of Wyeth`s U.S. and Pharmaceuticals business units. It will be the
world`s second largest specialty care business, with prominent positions in
inflammation (#2), vaccines (#4) and immunology (#4); leading products such as
Enbrel, the world`s leading biologic and Prevnar, the world`s leading vaccine;
and a strong pipeline of small- and large-molecule compounds.

Jim Connolly, currently Wyeth`s Executive Vice President &amp; General Manager,
Vaccines, will join the Specialty Care and Vaccines Business Unit as President,
Vaccines, reporting to Mr. Germano. He will lead an integrated vaccine business
comprising marketing, sales and medical affairs, which will align closely with
the Vaccine Research group led by Dr. Emini. They will work together to bring
innovative new vaccines to patients around the globe.

* Emerging Markets will continue to be led by President Jean-Michel Halfon and
will have a significantly enhanced presence in high-growth, less-developed and
under-penetrated markets, including those in Latin America, the Middle East and
China. 
* Oncology will continue to be led by President Garry Nicholson and will
continue to bring patients important treatments like Sutent. It will also bring
to market one of the most robust oncology product pipelines in the
biopharmaceutical industry, one that includes compounds focusing on diverse
tumor types including lung, colorectal, liver, prostate and breast. 
* Established Products will continue to be led by President David Simmons and
will continue to be a strong global business in a marketplace that is expected
to see significant growth in the years ahead. Through portfolio enhancement and
expansion activities, including new partnerships, Established Products will
continue to extend Pfizer`s reach into this important market segment.

Cavan Redmond, currently President of Wyeth`s Consumer Healthcare business, will
become Group President, Pfizer Diversified Businesses, join Pfizer`s Executive
Leadership Team and report to Mr. Kindler. This group will include four unique
businesses, each meeting important customer needs and offering significant
growth:

* Animal Health will continue to be led by President Juan-Ram&#243;n Alaix and will

to be the world's pre-eminent manufacturer and developer of capsule products,
equipment and services for the pharmaceutical and associated health care
industries. 
* Consumer Health will be led by President Paul Sturman, currently President,
U.S. and Global Business Development, New Products for Wyeth Consumer
Healthcare. Consumer Health will remain a leader in analgesics,
cough/cold/allergy and vitamin/nutritional supplements, including brands such as
Advil, Caltrate, Centrum, ChapStick, Robitussin and ThermaCare. 
* Nutritional Health will be led by President Erica Mann, currently Managing
Director of Wyeth Australia and New Zealand. The Nutritional business at Wyeth
operates in more than 50 countries and has a portfolio that includes a full line
of nutritional products, including infant formulas, follow-on formulas,
growing-up milks, and prenatal and adult supplements.

Mr. Kindler stated: "By putting together these businesses and combining in one
team a number of strong and experienced Pfizer and Wyeth leaders, we are
creating the world`s premier biopharmaceutical company - one that is powerfully
positioned to provide substantial value for patients, customers, colleagues and
shareholders." 

Integration Progress

Added Chief Financial Officer Frank D`Amelio, who is leading the integration on
behalf of Pfizer: "With today`s announcement we have taken another significant
step in preparing for the combining of these two great companies. Having our
organizational structure in place is critical to the combined company being
operational on Day One, and the appointment of these leaders will accelerate our
ability to do so. 

"We have made substantial progress in a short period of time, particularly in
financing, as well as other requirements for closing. Our progress affirms how
well these two companies fit together, the value of this combination, and the
commitment of our companies to rapid and successful integration," Mr. D`Amelio
said. 

Mr. Kindler noted: "I want particularly to thank Wyeth Chief Executive Officer
Bernard Poussot for his strong and steady leadership and his partnership. He is
an instrumental part of our integration efforts and will continue to provide us
with critical counsel and support until the close of the acquisition. Bernard`s
commitment to Wyeth leaders and to the success of the combined company is
extraordinary. 

"We look forward to welcoming these new colleagues and I am confident Pfizer
will be strengthened by the addition of many other exceptional Wyeth scientists
and business leaders. They will join Pfizer colleagues with whom they share a
commitment to delivering the full potential of the Pfizer-Wyeth combination to
patients, customers and investors," Mr. Kindler concluded. 

The leadership team will begin working together immediately upon the completion
of the acquisition. Until the acquisition is complete, Pfizer and Wyeth
leadership will continue in their current roles. Pfizer announced on January 26,
2009, that it is acquiring Wyeth in a cash-and-stock transaction to create the
world`s premier biopharmaceutical company. The acquisition remains subject to
customary closing conditions, including approval by the stockholders of Wyeth,
and regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions. Pfizer and Wyeth continue to
expect the transaction to close at the end of the third quarter or during the
fourth quarter of 2009.

&lt;p&gt;MENLO PARK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Arista Networks today announced a 10 Gigabit Ethernet Pass-Through Card for the
IBM BladeCenter H, addressing bandwidth intensive applications while alleviating
both capital and operational costs in the data center. As opposed to traditional
blade switches, the Arista 10G Pass-Through Card enables a much simplified and
ultra-low latency, truly non-blocking network design. Each server`s 10G NIC is
"passed-through" to a rack-top switch without being switched or blocked and
without requiring any network management at the IBM BladeCenter chassis level.
The non-blocking performance improves server utilization and consequently data
center power efficiency while at the same time improving network stability and
reducing operational costs. 

"Arista`s 10G Pass-Through Card is simpler, faster, and more cost-effective than
traditional blade switches," said Andy Bechtolsheim, Chief Development Officer
of Arista. "They are ideal for high-performance blade server applications
including virtualization, network storage and video streaming." 

Designed for simplicity and reliability, the Arista 10G Pass-Through Card does
not require any software or configuration. The card is accessible by the
BladeCenter Management Module for control and status. Cable management is
simplified with QSFP cables that allow the full network bandwidth from all
fourteen 10G server blades to be passed to the network with just four cables. 

"As a fellow member of Blade.org, Arista shares in IBM`s goals to continuously
listen to customers and support the development of innovative blade solutions,"
said Doug Balog, Vice President, IBM Modular Development and Chairman,
Blade.org. "The Arista 10G Pass-Through Card for BladeCenter H is an example of
this innovation in practice - providing a unique networking solution for
customers who need non-blocking performance and a lower total cost of
ownership." 

A typical 42 RU rack can accommodate up to three IBM BladeCenter H chassis which
means that up to 42 blade servers can be connected via 10G Pass-Through Cards to
a single 48-port Arista 7148SX series switch acting as a top-of-rack aggregator.
This represents a 3-fold reduction in the number of switches to be managed
versus a traditional blade switch implementation. 

"A 10G pass-through implementation establishes a clear demarcation point between
the blade server and the network," added Jur Faber, CEO of Consolidate-IT,
Arista`s pan-European Distributor. "We anticipate many 10G deployments across
Europe with this new 10G Pass-Through Card for IBM environments as customers
continue to look for ways to lower their total cost of ownership." 

The Arista 10G Pass-Through Card for IBM BladeCenter is currently in field
trials. Production units will be available this quarter and can be ordered now.

&lt;p&gt;HORSHAM, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Quality Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: QSII) and a leading provider of healthcare
information systems and connectivity solutions for physicians and medical
groups, today announced that it has been recognized as a winner of the Microsoft
Healthcare Users Group (MS-HUG) 2009 Innovation Awards in the category of
Clinical Care - Ambulatory Records. The award was presented jointly to Elmhurst
Clinic, a multi-specialty medical group in DuPage County, Ill., for its use of
NextGen EHR (Electronic Health Records) to improve patient care, streamline
administrative workflow, increase productivity and collaboration, and decrease
costs in an ambulatory care setting. The companies were honored yesterday at an
awards ceremony held at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems
Society (HIMSS) Annual Conference &amp; Exhibition in Chicago. 

Elmhurst Clinic, which is affiliated with Elmhurst Memorial Healthcare,
implemented the NextGen EHR product in 2005 - along with the NextGen EPM
(Enterprise Practice Management) product - to address the industry`s call to
improve quality metrics and reduce the cost of healthcare. Through use of the
NextGen technology, Elmhurst Clinic has realized the following quality of care
benefits:

* Interoperability: Because NextGen EHR serves as the hub for interoperable
technologies, comprehensive patient information is available to providers,
resulting in well-informed decision making. A lab interface produces rapid
results - at times providers have called a patient on their cell phones with
results before he or she even reached home. Links between the hospital and
ambulatory systems allow providers to pull information up on their computer
screens, document approval electronically and append data to the patient record.

* Disease Management: Providers have access to extensive clinical information
from a multitude of sources at their fingertips during a patient encounter. They
are able to review recent lab and radiology reports, for example, and easily
identify services that are overdue (e.g., retinal exams, cancer screening).
Elmhurst`s outreach technology interfaces directly with NextGen EHR, extracting
care management information according to established protocols. During the last
quarter of 2008, Elmhurst booked 1,650 appointments directly resulting from
automated outreach.

In addition, Elmhurst Clinic has achieved extensive quantifiable benefits
through its use of NextGen technology, including:

* Increasing the number of providers by 44 percent and charges by more than 38
percent. At the same time, the group held total accounts receivables steady, and
reduced insurance aging older than 120 days by 49 percent and patient aging
balance older than 120 days by 78 percent. 
* Increasing monthly charges by $1.3 million, while increasing total
non-clinical support staff by only eight full-time equivalents. 
* Reducing the number of chart pulls to fewer than 70 per day (from 2,000),
totaling more than 400,000 annually. Related HIM staff cost per provider dropped
by 60 percent. 
* Converting 2,700 square feet from paper storage to revenue-producing office
space - the equivalent of eight exam rooms.

"We are proud to partner with NextGen and utilize the Microsoft platform," said
Mary Stull, vice president of the physician practice division for Elmhurst
Memorial Healthcare and chief operating officer of the Elmhurst Clinic. "The
interconnected technologies are resulting in improvement across all metrics,
patient satisfaction, financial performance and physician recruitment to mention
just a few." 

"In today`s challenging economic times, health providers are doing whatever they
can to drive better operational outcomes, while still improving the overall
quality of care," said Chris Sullivan, U.S. health providers industry solutions
director, Microsoft Corp. "NextGen`s work at Elmhurst Clinic is a great example
of how technology built on the Microsoft software platform can not only create
efficiencies through the seamless integration of data, but also ultimately
improve patient satisfaction and overall care." 

Now in their 12th year, the MS-HUG Annual Awards reward excellence in healthcare
technology and showcase organizations that promote breakthroughs by enhancing
the quality of patient care, reducing costs, streamlining clinical and business
processes, driving interoperability, improving productivity and workflow, and
enabling informed decisions, as well as independent software vendor (ISV)
solutions that demonstrate the best use of Microsoft technology to drive results
in the healthcare industry. Award contestants are evaluated on how they provide
significant business benefits to healthcare organizations and improve patient
care.

related professional services fees; uncertainties concerning the amount and
timing of professional fees incurred by the Company generally; changes of
accounting estimates and assumptions used to prepare the prior periods'
financial statements; general economic conditions; and the risk factors detailed
from time to time in Quality Systems' periodic reports and registration
statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A significant
portion of the Company's quarterly sales of software product licenses and
computer hardware is concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter,
generally with a concentration of such revenues earned in the final ten business
days of that month. Due to these and other factors, the Company's revenues and
operating results are very difficult to forecast. A major portion of the
Company's costs and expenses, such as personnel and facilities, are of a fixed
nature and, accordingly, a shortfall or decline in quarterly and/or annual
revenues typically results in lower profitability or losses. As a result,
comparison of the Company's period-to-period financial performance is not
necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future
performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

&lt;p&gt;  MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA, Apr 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM today announced that Victoria University has selected IBM (NYSE: IBM)
to design and build the university's first green data center.

    As a result of the green technology employed, Victoria University will be
able to manage its increasing need for data management for the next
decade, while expecting savings of up to $300,000 in power costs over the
same period. In addition, the IBM solution will allow the University to
achieve a 'single logical data center' across two physical sites
underpinned by cost-effective design.

    Stephen Weller, Victoria University's Pro Vice Chancellor - Students,
said, "The University has 11 campuses and sites from the CBD across
Melbourne's west, providing education to more than 45,000 students. The
data center is critical to supplying educational services to all our
students, as well as supporting the University's administrative
functions. With the rapid growth in data, we needed to make sure that we
stay ahead of the game, and so acquired a design and solution that would
cater for our data center needs for the next 10 years -- including
increased power, cooling, space, and floor load capacity."

    The project involves IBM implementing a modular design approach to enable
the University to minimize start-up energy demands from the existing site
electrical supply. IBM will also employ an in-row cooling solution which
offers targeted cooling at the heat load source, combined with free
cooling chiller plant technology to leverage the favorable Melbourne
climate. Smaller uninterruptible power supply (UPS) module sizes will be
used to maximize the amount of usable power and UPS efficiency. This will
all result in both substantial energy savings and the elimination of hot
spots to provide an optimum equipment operating environment.

    Energy efficiency is also important to the University. The solution is
cost-effective to own and operate, with up to 45 percent less power
consumption than a conventional design, potentially saving more than
300,000 kilowatts per year of energy.

    "The IBM solution includes a high level of reliability, as the power and
cooling systems have been designed for high availability and scalability
with little or no downtime. Furthermore, the solution will help the
University avoid more than 230 metric tons of CO2 carbon emissions per
year," said Malcolm Mackay, IBM Australia Executive, Site and Facilities
Services. "This agreement demonstrates the University's technical and
environmental leadership."

    The agreement was signed in March 2009.

&lt;p&gt;HOBOKEN, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
In the new book The House of Dimon, business writer Patricia Crisafulli goes
behind the scenes to divulge the secrets to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon`s
success: his uncanny ability to identify and control risks and to make not one,
but two, strategic acquisitions within six months in the midst of the worst
financial crisis since the Depression.

In March 2008, the financial markets were rocked by a stunning announcement:
JPMorgan Chase was buying Bear Stearns for $2 a share (later raised to $10 a
share)-rescuing the investment bank from the brink of bankruptcy in an 11th-hour
deal that was hailed as the deal of the century. And CEO Jamie Dimon`s profile
was catapulted to stratospheric levels as the new king of Wall Street.Now, a
year later, Dimon is still reigning as Wall Street`s top statesman.

The book explores the Bear Stearns acquisition, which Dimon says he would have
never pursued had the government not asked JPMorgan to step in; the early years
when Dimon worked alongside Sandy Weill building Commercial Credit into
financial services colossus Citigroup; Dimon`s unexpected firing at Citigroup by
then CEO and Chairman and one-time mentor Weill; the Bank One Turnaround, where
Dimon turned the firm from a loss of $511 million to a record gain of $3.5
billion over three years; the sale of Bank One to JPMorgan Chase; and Dimon`s
succession as CEO at JPMorgan, where he steered the company away from subprime
loans, ultimately limiting exposure to toxic assets that have wrought havoc on
other financial institutions.

Crisafulli conducted interviews with more than 25 individuals, including Dimon,
Weill, retired Travelers Chairman and JPMorgan board member Bob Lipp, and Steve
Burke, Comcast President and JPMorgan board member, to discover Dimon`s opinions
on everything from risk management and surviving the current crisis to the
leadership that`s needed to avoid a repeat of catastrophe in the future.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), Wyeth (NYSE: WYE), Satyam Computer Services Ltd. (NYSE:
SAY), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) and Boston Scientific Inc. (NYSE: BSX).

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Pfizer Kept at a Hold

At the current level, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) is trading at 7.2x our 2009 EPS
estimate of $1.89. We recently downgraded our recommendation on the shares from
Buy to Hold based on our reservations that Wyeth (NYSE: WYE) will provide the
opportunity to grow revenue for the long-term, the significant reduction in the
company's net cash balance and the substantially lower than expected financial
guidance for 2009. Pfizer's decision to cut its dividend also contributed to our
downgrade. 

Revenue guidance for 2009 of $44 - $46 billion (including negative $3 billion
affect from forex) is significantly below our prior expectations of $49 billion.
We believe this reflects greater-than-previously-expected weakness in some of
the company's key products, including Lipitor, Viagra and Chantix. Pfizer
expects EPS in the range of $1.85 - $1.95, including lower interest income and a
higher tax rate related to the proposed Wyeth acquisition. 

Satyam Up Huge on News Items

Shares of India-based Satyam Computer Services Ltd. (NYSE: SAY, Sell) are up a
stunning 50%+ in intra-day trading crossing the $3 mark briefly. The
scandal-plagued company`s shares had fallen dramatically following the news of
the fraud perpetrated by its ex-CEO in December 2008, bringing its market
capitalization down to &lt;$500 million, compared to nearly $7 billion back in May,
2008. 

Two related news items are apparently sparking the move. First, the Indian
authorities announced today that they have arrested three senior executives of
the company`s finance department in connection with the fraud investigation.
(Note: we were all along of the opinion that the scale of fraud committed
couldn`t have been pulled off just by the ex-CEO and his brother, a co-founder
of Satyam). 

Abbott's Stent Bests BSX's

Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) reported long-term results (comparison of years
two and three) for its Spirit II clinical trial at the i2 Summit at the American
College of Cardiology's 58th annual scientific session. The trial compared the
XIENCE V Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (ABT) against Boston
Scientific Inc.'s (NYSE: BSX) TAXUS Express2 and TAXUS Liberte stents. 

ABT`s product was the clear winner. Between years two and three, the observed
cardiac death rate for the XIENCE V stent remained at 0.5%. For the same time
period, the same measure for TAXUS more than tripled to 4.2%. When comparing
major adverse cardiac events (MACE), the rate for XIENCE V remained unchanged at
6.4%, while the rate for TAXUS increased 42% to 14.9%. MACE includes events such
as cardiac death, heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI), and
ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (ID-TLR driven by lack of blood
supply).

Der vier Monate dauernde erste Teil der Trophy Tour, der am 24. September 2009

Am 3. Dezember 2009 geht der erste Teil der Tour in der s&#252;dafrikanischen

FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft 2010. Im zweiten Teil der FIFA World Cup Trophy

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) was ordered to pay $388 million in damages for infringing a patent held by anti-piracy software maker Uniloc Inc on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Sales at Sun Microsystems Corp JAVA.O, already under pressure, could take a further hit from the collapse of IBM's (IBM.N) multibillion dollar bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failure of the high-end computer and software company to sell itself might drive customers to its rivals -- International Business Machines Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Dell Inc DELL.O -- say consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would hate to be in the Sun sales organization at the moment," said Eric Johnson, director of the Center for Digital Strategies at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. "Pretty much every corporate client is going to ask them: 'Are you going to be here next year when I need help from you?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that is raising the stakes for Sun's board and Chief Executive Jonathan Schwartz to show there is another plan for turning around the struggling computer maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company's attempt to sell itself often alarms customers by raising a host of tricky questions, such as whether the new owner will continue to add new features to the products they've already bought or to keep providing strong support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said those exact questions came up on Wednesday morning during a breakfast meeting with technology executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to an inquiry from Reuters, Sun said such concerns are unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sun is committed to our customers and channel partners, and will continue to do what has always defined the company: innovate for customers," a company spokesman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun, which rode the Internet boom to prominence in the 1990s, may be working to address such concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its board was scheduled to meet on Wednesday, according to a Bloomberg News report, which cited a person familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Sun declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enderle Group analyst Rob Enderle said the collapse of the talks damaged Sun's credibility with its biggest customer group: the financial services industry, which relies on high- end Sun servers to handle critical tasks such as trading and other banking transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that it is widely known that Sun is actively shopping itself around, Sun represents a substantial risk," said Enderle at the San Jose-based technology consulting and research firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not certain that the company will be there to support its equipment. In this market, that kind of risk can drive customers to other players."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said an IBM deal would have assured Sun's customers it would continue to support its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEEKING DISCOUNTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The withdrawal of the offer last weekend comes at a difficult time for Sun, which is firing thousands of workers as sales slow. It posted a $1.9 billion loss for the six months to December 28 on a 9 percent drop in sales to $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armonk, New York-based IBM has no plans to take the lead in restarting negotiations, said a person familiar with the matter not authorized to speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But speculation IBM would eventually buy Sun helped pull stock in the Santa Clara, California, company up 6 percent to a $6.66 close in heavy Nasdaq trading on Wednesday. That compares with $4.97 on March 17, the day before news broke of the IBM negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before talks broke down, IBM put a ceiling of $9.40 on its offer, according to a person familiar with the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers who do stick with Sun will likely try to use its financial problems and the fallout from the collapse of its negotiations with IBM to demand bigger discounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are clearly in a weakened position," said Laura DiDio, an analyst at ITIC, a research and consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The customer is going to say: 'Hey, I don't know what is going on with you. I may be better off going with IBM or HP. What are you going to do for me?' That may have a material impact on revenue and profit margins for the immediate quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once news of the IBM talks leaked out, Sun passed a critical point of no return because negotiating was essentially an admission it needed help, said Charles King, an analyst at consulting firm Pund-IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a bit like somebody who has had a serious accident checking out of the emergency room and insisting they can heal themselves at home," King added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando and Anupreeta Das.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, April 8 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
will face a shareholder proposal next month for a report on the
protection of people and the environment in countries where it
operates, following a recent ruling by financial regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. oil company is battling a $27 billion claim over
environmental damage in Ecuador, where a ruling is expected
this year, and that long-running case is among the issues cited
by a group of mostly U.S. state and municipal funds in the
proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that Chevron's record to date demonstrates a
gap between its international environmental aspirations and its
performance, which would be narrowed by a commitment to apply
the highest environmental standards wherever the company
operates," the proposal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in a decision
posted on its website, did not agree with Chevron's argument
that the proposal should be excluded because it was too vague,
too similar to a past proposal, or beyond the board's power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson, who could not comment on
the specific proposal, said votes on similar issues at previous
shareholder meetings garnered support of 8 percent to 10
percent. This year's Chevron shareholder meeting is scheduled
for May 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shareholder group includes pension funds from the city
and state of New York, Pennsylvania's treasury, and Amnesty
International, and collectively represented more than 20
million of the 2 billion-plus Chevron shares outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They note the San Ramon, California-based company operates
in 180 countries, including some where environmental regimes 
may be less protective of human health and the environment than
others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It cites Ecuador as well as a case brought by Nigerians, in
which Chevron was cleared of liability by a San Francisco jury
in December, over a deadly clash in 1998 with Nigerian forces
breaking up a protest on an oil platform over pollution and
lack of jobs. An appeal of that decision was filed last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group also mentions Unocal pipeline operations that led
to deforestation in what is now Myanmar. Chevron bought Unocal
in 2005, just weeks after Unocal settled a landmark U.S. court
case of human rights abuses committed in Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiffs in the Ecuador case, first brought by local
peasants in the early 1990s, contend that Texaco -- bought by
Chevron in 2001 -- polluted the jungle and damaged their health
by dumping billions of gallons of contaminated water from 1972
to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has questioned the independence of the scientists
who calculated the $27 billion in damages and has asked the
judge to discard the claim. [ID:nN12282159]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two weeks ago, the judge completed the last of more than
100 field inspections of former Texaco oil production sites,
according to the Amazon Defense Coalition.

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Consumers are struggling to find an easy way to get files like photographs out of their phones to share with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp's upcoming MyPhone service seems to solve the mobile industry's eternal challenge: how to make a wireless service easy to use. It may not have as much storage or as many features as the equivalent from Nokia but an early version of the service is easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of cameraphones have already passed those of digital cameras, and last year alone some 700 million cameraphones were sold. But sharing the pictures requires cables (or shaky wireless connections), time and nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's MyPhone is the solution: at least for users of Windows phones. It is a simple back-up service, still in limited testing, that uploads pictures and any other data from a phone to a Microsoft data center via the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can then log on to myphone.microsoft.com and tweak or download the pictures and data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usage is as simple as it gets: the service works on its own, quietly downloading files when the phone is not in use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To someone who has used Nokia's comparable "Share on Ovi" service since it was launched in early 2008 for storing and sharing photos, MyPhone is shocking at first: it offers total storage of just 200 megabytes. That's enough for only a few rolls of pictures with a good quality camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft official plays this down, saying 200 megabytes should be enough for most users, and if demand shows more is needed, the company is flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MyPhone will be made open to everyone in the second half of this year when the first phones using the new version of Windows Mobile reach the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, once the back-up service is up and running, Microsoft will explore linking it to other Microsoft services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's Share has more features than MyPhone, like links to other services and sharing options. It has no data limits apart from one that stops people downloading single files larger than 100 megabytes, big enough for a decent video recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But flashier outlook comes at a price. It is much more difficult to use, and it takes time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUT OF SERVICE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting to use MyPhone is pretty much pain free. It takes a couple of minutes to download the file to the cell phone. Then you restart the phone, and the service is up and running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works, and you don't have to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, although logging on to Nokia's "Share on Ovi" site on the Internet surprises positively with an attractive new design, using the service can present problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make usage from a cell phone easier, Nokia has linked a small upload icon to every picture on the phone -- but leaves the uploading work to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you click on the icon and choose the access point to the Internet, the phone starts to send the file into the Nokia cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you choose the next picture and click on upload, you get an error message -- the service declines to send it as the other file transfer is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the next try, the phone says "service not responding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Back-up and restore services are important to users, but they must be simple and intuitive to use.

&lt;p&gt;  JUPITER, FL, Apr 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
In a press conference held yesterday to review fourth quarter call report
data and TheStreet.com bank ratings, Martin D. Weiss of Weiss Research,
Inc. concluded that:


--  Three out of four of the nation's largest banks are at risk of failure -- 
    JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo.

--  Also at risk are HSBC USA, Goldman Sachs and large regional banks,
    including SunTrust Bank, Compass Bank (Alabama), Fifth Third Bank
    (Michigan), Huntington Bank (Ohio) and Etrade Bank (Virginia).

--  The total number of at-risk banks and thrifts rose to 1,816 in the
    fourth quarter, from 1,568 banks in the prior quarter, an increase of 16
    percent.
    

    
Also in the conference, Weiss provided updated commentary on his white
paper issued on March 19. Titled "Dangerous Unintended Consequences," the
white paper names U.S. banks and thrifts believed to be at risk of
failure, using that data to demonstrate that the U.S. government greatly
underestimates the scope of the debt crisis, while overestimating its
ability to effectively save troubled institutions without severe adverse
consequences.

    "Especially alarming," writes Dr. Weiss, "is the fourth quarter OCC data
demonstrating that record bank losses are spreading to interest-rate
derivatives. Until now, bank derivatives losses have been limited almost
exclusively to credit defaults swaps (CDS), which represent only 7.8
percent of the notional value U.S. derivatives held by all U.S. banks. In
the fourth quarter, although the CDS losses continued at a near-record
pace, we also witnessed record losses in the interest-rate sector, which
represents 82 percent of the derivatives market: The nation's banks lost
$3.4 billion in interest-rate derivatives, or more than seven times their
worst previous quarterly loss in this category."

    Separately, total global losses from the debt crisis to date are estimated
at close to $4 trillion, with only about one third written down so far.

    "In the face of such enormous risks and losses," Dr. Weiss continues,
"it's entirely unreasonable to expect the U.S. Government to rescue
failing U.S. financial institutions without unacceptable damage to its
own credit, credibility and borrowing power."

    In his phone conference with the press yesterday, Dr. Weiss discussed the
serious implications of his findings. (To listen to the audio recording,

consumers that had registered for a Weiss online webinar. (To view the

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), everybody's favorite beaten-down blue-chip
conglomerate, was the target of a massive surge in put buying on Tuesday. During
the course of the session, option players on the International Securities
Exchange (ISE) bought to open 30,752 puts on GE, compared to just 4,792 calls.
In other words, traders purchased 6.42 bearish bets for every bullish option. 

Tuesday's trading was simply the extension of a recent trend for GE. The stock
boasts a hefty 10-day ISE put/call volume ratio of 2.84, as traders have
purchased nearly 3 times more puts than calls during the past 2 weeks. This
ratio ranks higher than 99.2% of comparable readings taken during the past year,

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of Goldman Sachs called on Tuesday for reforms to executive pay and a broadening of financial regulation in a contrite speech that was twice interrupted by protesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, whose firm has taken $10 billion in taxpayer funds, said the economic crisis had been "deeply humbling" for financial firms, and banks receiving taxpayer bailout money need to pay back the funds as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters waved a large pink poster saying "We Want Our $$$$ Back" and yelled that taxpayers wanted to know why they should bail out Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid audience boos directed at the protesters, Blankfein told the Council of Institutional Investors conference that their message was "nevertheless real and visceral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that reflects a prevailing view in the world," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said Wall Street firms got caught up in the pursuit of profits and ignored risks. He said they needed to dramatically change compensation practices to bring responsibility back to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Decisions on compensation and other actions taken and not taken, particularly at banks that rapidly lost a lot of shareholder value, look self-serving and greedy in hindsight," Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REFORMS TO PAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He laid out reforms to pay, including rewarding long-term performance, instead of short-term gains, through deferred compensation and "clawbacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual compensation should not be set without factoring in the performance of the business unit and overall firm, Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Employees should share in the upside when overall performance is strong and they should all share in the downside when overall performance is weak," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding regulation, Blankfein said financial institutions needed to accept more oversight, including hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He voiced support for a systemic risk regulator that can look at every firm, product or practice that may pose a danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this vein, all pools of capital that depend on the smooth functioning of the financial system, and are large enough to be a burden on it in a crisis, should be subject to some degree of regulation," Blankfein said. "Yes, that includes large hedge funds and private equity funds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank, received $10 billion from the government in October under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It plans to pay back the funds this year, as the money comes with strings attached, such as caps on executive compensation, dividend restrictions, and limits on share repurchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein told the protesters it was important for the public to understand the capital provided to banks was meant as a broader stimulus effort to get the financial system back on its feet, not a bailout of individual firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks should pay back the taxpayer money as soon as it is feasible, as the capital injections were "never intended to be permanent capital," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EARNING TRUST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it will take years for the financial industry to earned back public confidence. One way to shore up that confidence is through mark-to-market, or fair value, accounting, Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark-to-market, also known as fair value accounting, is aimed at giving investors an accurate view of financial companies' books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some banks and investors have blamed the rules for accelerating the financial crisis by triggering billions of dollars in writedowns, leading to reduced capital levels and less lending. Last week the Financial Accounting Standards Board approved guidance to ease the impact of fair value accounting in illiquid markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fair value accounting gives investors more clarity with respect to balance sheet risk," Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Karey Wutkowski in Washington; additional reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;Derivatives Losses Spreading!
JUPITER, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
In a press conference held yesterday to review fourth quarter call report data
and TheStreet.com bank ratings, Martin D. Weiss of Weiss Research, Inc.
concluded that:

* Three out of four of the nation`s largest banks are at risk of failure -
JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo. 
* Also at risk are HSBC USA, Goldman Sachs and large regional banks, including
SunTrust Bank, Compass Bank (Alabama), Fifth Third Bank (Michigan), Huntington
Bank (Ohio) and Etrade Bank (Virginia). 
* The total number of at-risk banks and thrifts rose to 1,816 in the fourth
quarter, from 1,568 banks in the prior quarter, an increase of 16 percent.

Also in the conference, Weiss provided updated commentary on his white paper
issued on March 19. Titled "Dangerous Unintended Consequences," the white paper
names U.S. banks and thrifts believed to be at risk of failure, using that data
to demonstrate that the U.S. government greatly underestimates the scope of the
debt crisis, while overestimating its ability to effectively save troubled
institutions without severe adverse consequences. 

"Especially alarming," writes Dr. Weiss, "is the fourth quarter OCC data
demonstrating that record bank losses are spreading to interest-rate
derivatives. Until now, bank derivatives losses have been limited almost
exclusively to credit defaults swaps (CDS), which represent only 7.8 percent of
the notional value U.S. derivatives held by all U.S. banks. In the fourth
quarter, although the CDS losses continued at a near-record pace, we also
witnessed record losses in the interest-rate sector, which represents 82 percent
of the derivatives market: The nation`s banks lost $3.4 billion in interest-rate
derivatives, or more than seven times their worst previous quarterly loss in
this category." 

Separately, total global losses from the debt crisis to date are estimated at
close to $4 trillion, with only about one third written down so far. 

"In the face of such enormous risks and losses," Dr. Weiss continues, "it`s
entirely unreasonable to expect the U.S. Government to rescue failing U.S.
financial institutions without unacceptable damage to its own credit,
credibility and borrowing power." 

In his phone conference with the press yesterday, Dr. Weiss discussed the
serious implications of his findings. (To listen to the audio recording, go to

He then followed up with recommendations for 54,000 investors and consumers that
had registered for a Weiss online webinar. (To view the video recording, go to

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Fines Have Tripled In Recent Years
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Sixth graph, second sentence of release should read: Chevron bought Texaco in

The corrected release reads: 

AMAZON DEFENSE COALITION: SEC REJECTS CHEVRON ATTEMPT TO BLOCK SHAREHOLDER
RESOLUTION ON ECUADOR ENVIRONMENT CASE

Chevron Fines Have Tripled In Recent Years

The Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected an attempt by Chevron
management to block a vote by shareholders on a high-profile resolution that
threatens to focus attention on the company`s record-breaking $27 billion
environmental liability in Ecuador, according to a letter made available by the
regulatory agency on its website. 

The SEC decision comes after months of lobbying by the oil giant to scuttle a
resolution sponsored by two large pension funds in New York that together own
more than $1 billion of Chevron stock. The resolution calls on Chevron`s
management -- under fire in Ecuador, Burma, and Nigeria for being linked to
human rights problems -- to assess whether the company`s operations in host
countries comply with environmental regulations. 

"We applaud the SEC for rejecting Chevron`s attempt to deny shareholder
democracy on this extremely significant environmental issue," said Mitch
Anderson, who monitors the company for Amazon Watch, a non-profit environmental
group in San Francisco. 

The resolution was prompted by evidence in the Ecuador litigation that Chevron
uses lax environmental standards in developing nations that allow it to pollute
with virtual impunity. Chevron`s lawyers have proposed that the Ecuador court
adopt a soil clean-up standard 100 times more lax than in most U.S. states to
avoid liability, according to the plaintiffs. 

"We believe that Chevron`s record to date demonstrates a gap between its
international environmental aspirations and its performance," the resolution
noted in a supporting statement, citing the fact that Chevron`s fines for
environmental and safety problems worldwide more than tripled between 2003 and
2007. 

In Ecuador, Chevron is a defendant in a 15-year legal battle over the dumping by
Texaco of billions of gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways when that
company operated an oil concession there from 1964 to 1990. Chevron bought
Texaco in 2001 and will bear any liability in the case, which was transferred to
Ecuador from U.S. federal court at Chevron`s request. 

Two weeks ago, the trial judge in Ecuador completed the last of 102 field
inspections of former Texaco oil production sites. Separately, a court-appointed
expert who worked with a team of 14 scientists estimated Chevron`s damages at up
to $27 billion, which would mark a historical record for an environmental case.
A decision is expected later this year. 

Amazon Watch and shareholders have criticized Chevron for refusing to set aside
funds to satisfy the potential Ecuador judgment and for filing misleading
information with the SEC to downplay the significance of the Ecuador case.
Chevron claims the trial court in Ecuador is biased, but the plaintiffs point
out that Texaco had filed 14 expert affidavits praising those same courts as
fair to get the case transferred out of U.S. federal court. 

"Only when the evidence started to prove its own culpability did Chevron begin
to attack the court process in Ecuador," said Anderson in reference to the
Ecuador litigation. 

Chevron recently took the rare step of filing a supplemental letter with the SEC
as part of a last-ditch effort to persuade the agency that the environmental
resolution was too similar to another filed by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. In responding, the SEC ruled that it was "unable to concur" with
Chevron`s arguments. 

The resolution was co-sponsored by the state pension funds of New York City and
New York State and supported by a wide variety of Chevron shareholders,
including Amnesty International, the Pennsylvania Treasury Department, and
Trillium Asset Management. 

It will be voted on May 26 at Chevron`s annual meeting near San Francisco. At
the meeting, several shareholders and Amazon indigenous leaders are expected to
ask pointed questions of CEO David O`Reilly.

SEC, and the SEC response, visit www.chevrontoxico.com or contact Karen Hinton

&lt;p&gt; * Russia clears Exxon's Sakhalin-1 investments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon says will unfreeze new phases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Deal gives Exxon respite in dispute with Moscow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Vladimir Soldatkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOSCOW, April 8 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Wednesday it would unfreeze new phases of Sakhalin-1 after
Russia cleared its spending plan, giving the U.S. oil major a
respite in a long-running battle over the project's future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russia had long denied approval for spending on Sakhalin-1,
a production sharing deal (PSA) which is subject to special
regulations, when its tax status is fixed for a long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Government officials have said they need Exxon to justify
spending better while analysts suspected the delay is linked to
disagreements between Exxon and Russian state gas export
monopoly Gazprom (GAZP.MM) over Sakhalin's gas export plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom has long said it needs the gas produced at
Sakahlin-1 to cover domestic needs, while Exxon is planning to
export the fuel to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial crisis and a fall in global gas demand might
have made the issue less acute. Spending approval took place
after Russia and the United States said they would "press the
reset button" after years of political tensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Russia's energy ministry said a state
commission approved Sakhalin-1's spending plan for 2008 and 2009
and the project's audit results for 2003-2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The decisions taken will ensure Sakhalin-1 can move
forward," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ministry and Exxon declined to give annual investment
figures for the project, valued at over $12 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon and its consortium co-members are committed to
advancing the Sakhalin-1 project and its future development
phases," Exxon's spokeswoman Dilyara Sydykova told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said last year there was
no trust in Russia's judicial system and that should be changed
if the country wants to attract major foreign investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, Exxon warned it would suspend future phases of
Sakhalin-1 citing delays in spending approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon operates Sakhalin-1 along with Russian state oil firm
Rosneft (ROSN.MM), Japan's Itochu (8001.T), Marubeni (8002.T)
and India's ONGC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project has been producing oil for several years and
reached peak production of 11.2 million tonnes in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has been producing gas since 2005 and shipping small
volumes to continental Russia. It signed a separate deal to
supply China with 8 billion cubic metres of gas a year and hoped
to start supplies next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer, itself has a
rival plan to supply China from East Siberia via two links. It
wants to buy gas from Sakhalin-1 at market prices but talks have
been stalled for over a year due to a price disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom co-leads Sakhalin-2, a neighbouring project from
Sakhalin-1, and liquefies all of the gas produced there.

&lt;p&gt;BOCA RATON, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Which EB5, a leading immigrant advocacy organization, are celebrating today with
news confirming 31 of their EB-5 visa regional center applicants have received
approval of I-526 (conditional Green Card) petitions in the first quarter of
2009, maintaining the organization's 100% success record while bringing the
total number of successful EB-5 regional center applicants assisted to over 100.


"These thirty-one approvals are spread over various regional centers confirming
our belief that clients have different investment and visa requirements which
are best served by advising on the widest choice of regional center, rather than
a single option," said Stephen Parnell, joint managing partner of Which EB5
www.WhichEB5.com. 

Clients of Which EB-5 are typically from a number of countries including the UK,
Europe, Canada, China and India. A number already live in the USA - some moved
to America many years ago on E2 or L-1 visas and became concerned about the need
to reapply to remain in the USA. 

"These statistics are very encouraging but behind them lie some interesting
stories of why immigrants decided to use our services when taking the life
changing decision to leave their home country and relocate to the USA," said
Andrew Bartlett, joint managing partner of Which EB5. 

The current rules of the EB-5 visa pilot program require each immigrant investor

&lt;p&gt; Refiles to make JPMorgan one word in headline and text

 


 LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan has raised its gold
price forecasts for 2009 and 2010, citing prospects for
inflation and weakness in the dollar as supportive factors for
the precious metal.

 It also raised its outlook for silver prices. It now sees
silver averaging $13.90 an ounce in 2009, against a previous
forecast of $11.00, and $13.40 in 2010, against $10.00.

 The bank lifted its 2009 price view for gold to $960 an
ounce from $831 previously, and its 2010 forecast for the
precious metal to $950 an ounce from $825.

 "Investment demand continues to act as an offset, to some
degree, to a very weak physical market in precious metals, gold
in particular," the bank said in a research note.

 "Inflation and / or U.S. dollar weakness do however need to
materialise to justify gold above $1,000. In the meantime, the
threat of these factors will support prices."

 Spot gold XAU= was quoted at $886.30/887.80 an ounce at
1117 GMT.

&lt;p&gt;Brand Management Expert to Detail Practical Applications of `New Media` In
Capturing Market and Mindshare in Today`s Evolving Economy
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
TAG Marketing, a society of the Technology Association of Georgia (TAG) and
Georgia`s premier organization for technology marketing events and networking,
today announced that Coca-Cola North America marketing executive Penny McIntyre
will be the keynote speaker for TAG`s 2009 Technology Association Marketer of
the Year (TAMY) Awards and the Technology Marketing "Executive of the Year"
Award breakfast, scheduled for May 21. McIntyre, who is senior vice president
and general manager for Coca-Cola North America Water, Tea and Coffee, will
outline the practical do`s and don`ts and best practices of online brand
management. 

"In marketing organizations around the world, Web 2.0, social networking, blogs,
podcasting and viral marketing are all the rage," noted Tino Mantella, President
of TAG. "In Penny, we are very fortunate indeed to have an individual from the
Atlanta marketing community share real-world experiences in applying these `new
media` marketing tools to one of the world`s most recognizable brands." 

In her keynote, entitled "The New Rules of Brand Management - Leveraging New
Media in the New Economy," McIntyre explores the challenges and benefits of
applying Web-based communications to reach buyers directly; and explains how
Georgia technology marketers can migrate from traditional marketing approaches
to today`s online "conversational-relationship" marketing techniques in building
and extending their company`s brands. 

"Solid brand management today, just as it has always been, is about, first,
discerning the unique, core `story` that separates your brand from the
competition; and, then, effectively sharing that story across every key audience
that influences the brand," said McIntyre. "Today, though, the rules have
changed for how you do that. Professional marketers need to understand and apply
these new rules, or they run the risk of leaving their companies and themselves
behind in the process." 

McIntyre`s extensive career in international marketing includes assignments in
Asia, Russia, Africa, and Europe. During these years, she honed her skills in
applying customer insights within and across cultures to drive business results
and innovation. McIntyre has led global initiatives within Marketing Strategy,
Integrated Marketing, Sports Marketing and building a best-in-class marketing
organization. Her passion is making the complex simple and making the simple
impactful, critically important in competing for attention, time and resources. 

McIntyre will share the stage with winners of the 2009 TAMY Awards and the
Technology Marketing "Executive of the Year" at the TAG Marketing Awards
Breakfast on Thursday, May 21, at Maggiano`s restaurant in the Cumberland Mall.
The deadline to submit entries for the annual awards program is 5:00 p.m. on
Friday, April 17. For more information on the breakfast event, or for
downloadable applications and nomination forms for the awards, visit
www.tagonline.org/tamy-awards.php. 

The 2009 TAMY Awards will recognize both small and large organizations that have
demonstrated significant and measurable accomplishments in one of five
categories. The company or its affiliate must be currently active in the
technology industry in the state of Georgia, and the marketing program entered
must have been managed entirely from Georgia. In addition, the programs/tactics
submitted must have been carried out primarily during the 2008 calendar year. 

An award will be given to one emerging firm (revenues less than $10 million) and
one large firm (revenues greater than $10 million) in each of the following five
award categories:

* Corporate Repositioning; 
* Marketing for Growth; 
* Marketing to the "C" Level; 
* Customer Marketing; and 
* Marketing Tactic

2009 represents the fourth year that TAG Marketing will name a Technology
Marketing "Executive of the Year," a recognition that is based on peer
nominations for a marketing executive who has clearly demonstrated outstanding
leadership, either at a technology company or in a technology role within a
non-technology corporation.

Year (TAMY) Awards and the Technology Marketing "Executive of the Year" Award

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM) as Bull of the Day and
ABB Ltd. (NYSE: ABB) as Bear of the Day. In addition, the analysts at Zacks
Equity Research discuss the latest on Citigroup (NYSE: C), JP Morgan Chase
(NYSE: JPM) and Capital One (NYSE: COF). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM) shares are a great way to gain exposure to China
as well as other fast-growing international markets, which constitute the only
stable segment of the restaurant industry. 

Both the overseas divisions of Yum! Brands are expanding rapidly. China (28% of
2008 revenue) and Yum! Restaurants International [YRI] (27% of 2008 revenue)
segments are on track to grow operating earnings by an average CAGR of 20% and
10%, respectively, over the next five years. The U.S. operations (50% of
revenue) also show signs of revival. 

Reinvigorating sales are Taco Bell's recent product launches, including fruit
smoothies and a value menu. KFC U.S. remains Yum!'s one weak spot, with an
outdated menu. A key to improvement will be its 1H09 launch of a new grilled
chicken line, the first step in Yum!'s strategy to add healthier and more
portable menu items. 

Bear of the Day

ABB Ltd. (NYSE: ABB) is a leader in power and automation technologies that
enable utility and industry customers to improve performance while lowering
environmental impact. 

The global economic growth -- coupled with the attendant demand for power and
automation -- that stimulated investment in new and expanded plants over the
last 12 to 24 months is expected to decline to some degree during 2009, which is
cause of concern for ABB. 

Even with ABB`s impressive menu of offerings, we remain somewhat cautious with
respect to the possibilities for the next year, as there are significant
economic uncertainties -- both political and economic -- on the horizon.
Consequently, we have decided to downgrade ABB to a SELL and have adjusted our
target price to reflect the current market environment. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

Consumer Credit Drops Sharply

As the economy continues to be in recession and job losses continue to rise
sharply, consumers are cutting back on spending. 

Further, credit-card lines continue to be reduced by the lenders. It is
estimated that available lines were reduced by nearly $500 billion during 4Q08
alone. The balances on consumers' credit cards fell at a rate of 9.7% in
February 2009 -- the fastest rate of decline since 1976. 

Federal Reserve has recently implemented Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan
Facility (TALF) to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small
businesses. 

The $200 billion facility (in joint effort with the Treasury), which could be
expanded up to one trillion dollars, provides 3-year term loans to investors
against AAA-rated securities backed by recently originated consumer (credit
cards, auto loans and other types of consumer credit) and small businesses
loans. Apart from the banks like Citigroup (NYSE: C) and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:
JPM), the facility is expected to benefit the credit card issuers like Capital
One (NYSE: COF).

&lt;p&gt;First Leg of "FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola" To Visit Every African
Nation During Four-Month Journey

Coca-Cola to Distribute Free Tickets to Fans in Every Country For a Chance to
See the Authentic FIFA World Cup Trophy


ZURICH, Switzerland &amp; ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The most coveted icon in world football will spread excitement throughout every
nation in Africa later this year when the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by
Coca-Cola takes an unprecedented journey across the continent in anticipation of
the 2010 FIFA World Cup. 

The Coca-Cola Company and FIFA, football`s world governing body, today announced
details of the route which will span more than 50 countries during the course of
a 70-day tour that will allow thousands of Africans to see the real solid-gold
trophy in person. 

The initial four-month long leg of the Trophy Tour, which kicks off in Cairo,
Egypt on September 24, 2009, was developed through an exclusive partnership
between FIFA and Coca-Cola, a FIFA Partner and one of the organization`s
longest-standing corporate partners. 

On December 3, 2009, the first leg of the tour draws to a close in Cape Town,
South Africa, near the time of the 2010 FIFA World Cup Finals draw. The second
leg of the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola will see the trophy visit
additional countries across the globe from January to April 2010. Dates and
cities for that leg have not yet been finalized and will be announced at a later
date. 

During the Trophy Tour, fans will be given the chance to enjoy a rare close-up
view of the authentic FIFA World Cup Trophy. Free tickets to the 2009/10 Trophy
Tour will be made available to consumers via Coca-Cola promotions in countries
on the route. At events in each city, fans will have the opportunity to have a
souvenir photo taken of themselves with the trophy, view a special 3-D movie
showcasing memorable moments of the FIFA World Cup, participate in interactive
displays and enjoy other entertainment. Countries and dates of the route are
subject to change. 

"The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola will give thousands of fans in
Africa the extraordinary chance to get close to the real trophy for the first
time ever," said Emmanuel Seuge, group director, worldwide sports and
entertainment marketing, The Coca-Cola Company. "While South Africa is the host
country for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the entire continent will celebrate and
welcome the event. That is why it was important to us to ensure the tour visit
every country in Africa." 

"We are delighted to be partnering with Coca-Cola again to stage the FIFA World
Cup Trophy Tour," said J&#233;r&#244;me Valcke, FIFA Secretary General. "We believe that
the tour will capture the imagination of Africa`s people, enabling them to get
closer to world football's greatest prize." 

The 2010 FIFA World Cup Trophy draws on the huge success of the first global
Trophy Tour held in 2006. In 2006, the tour visited 31 cities in 29 countries,
covering 63,734 miles (102,570 kilometres) with millions of fans around the
world enjoying the chance to have a closer look at football`s most famous prize.


The authentic, FIFA World Cup Trophy is awarded to the winning nation at each
tournament. The iconic trophy measures 36.8 centimetres (14.5 inches) high,
weighs in at 6,175 grams (13.61 pounds) and is made of solid, 18-carat gold. The
winners retain it until the next tournament and are awarded a replica that is
gold-plated, rather than solid gold. The base contains two layers of
semi-precious malachite, while the bottom side of the Trophy bears the engraved
year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since 1974. 

The Coca-Cola Company has had a formal association with Federation
Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) since 1974 and an official
sponsorship of FIFA World Cup that begin in 1978. Coca-Cola has had stadium
advertising at every FIFA World Cup since 1950 and is a long-time supporter of

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX, Apr 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ClearCorrect, Inc., a manufacturer of FDA-cleared transparent orthodontic
aligners, today filed a notice of voluntary dismissal regarding its
declaratory judgment against Invisalign(R) manufacturer Align Technology
after Align stated to the court that it has no intention of suing
ClearCorrect for patent infringement.

    ClearCorrect filed its declaratory judgment on February 17th in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston
Division. Specifically, ClearCorrect's original complaint alleged that
certain patents owned by Align Technology (Invisalign) are invalid and
that ClearCorrect's clear braces products and processes do not infringe
upon those patents.

    From the outset, ClearCorrect has made it clear that if Align provided
assurance that it did not intend to sue ClearCorrect, then ClearCorrect
would voluntarily dismiss the case. In its moving papers, Align has
represented to the Court that:

    "(Align) has never expressly or impliedly asserted any claim or engaged in
any conduct that indicated that it believed (ClearCorrect) infringed any
claim under any patent or that it would engage in any action as a result
of such infringement."

    In addition, Align has expressly disavowed any statements of its employees
that indicated Align intended to sue ClearCorrect. Align has further
stated that no employee has been authorized to make such statements. Align
has also represented that it has not engaged in any "scare the customer"
tactics.

    According to ClearCorrect's attorney, Randy J. McClanahan of Houston-based
law firm McClanahan, Myers and Espey, LLP, "This is a good outcome. Align
has clarified that there is no black cloud of impending litigation.
ClearCorrect's principals can now concentrate on growing their business.
We are pleased that both parties will be able to compete fairly in this
important market."

    "We're happy to voluntarily dismiss our suit after receiving court-filed
assurances that Align has no intention to sue us for patent infringement,"
explained ClearCorrect CEO and practicing Houston dentist Dr. Willis
Pumphrey. "We are now ready to focus on competing and aggressively
marketing our product."

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp warned that first-quarter earnings would be sharply lower than the previous quarter as lower oil and gas prices took a toll and refined-product margins shrank significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company said on Thursday the earnings would include $100 million in write-offs associated with exploration, adding that the fourth quarter included a $650 million foreign-exchange benefit as the dollar weakened as well as $600 million from an asset-exchange transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares fell 2 percent to $67.78 after-hours, while shares of larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp handed back some of their 1.3 percent regular-trade gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said U.S. oil-equivalent production in January and February was 660,000 barrels per day (bpd), up from 619,000 in the fourth quarter, and international output was 1.985 million bpd, higher than both the previous quarter and a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But refining margins were down nearly across the board from a year ago, hit particularly hard last month by a recovery in crude oil prices, which increases input costs.

Earnings from its chemicals business were expected to fall on lower margins and volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also said after-tax charges for corporate and other activities might significantly differ from its normal guidance of $250 million to $350 million due to foreign currency effects and potential accruals from pension settlements and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company is due to report first-quarter results on May 1.

 (Adds more financial details paragraphs 7-8, updates shares)

 SAN FRANCISCO, April 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
warned that first-quarter earnings would be sharply lower than
the previous quarter as lower oil and gas prices took a toll
and refined-product margins shrank significantly.

 The second-largest U.S. oil company said on Thursday the
earnings would include $100 million in write-offs associated
with exploration, adding that the fourth quarter included a
$650 million foreign-exchange benefit as the dollar weakened as
well as $600 million from an asset-exchange transaction.

 Chevron shares fell 2 percent to $67.78 after-hours, while
shares of larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) handed back
some of their 1.3 percent regular-trade gain.

 Chevron said U.S. oil-equivalent production in January and
February was 660,000 barrels per day (bpd), up from 619,000 in
the fourth quarter, and international output was 1.985 million
bpd, higher than both the previous quarter and a year before.

 But refining margins were down nearly across the board from
a year ago, hit particularly hard last month by a recovery in
crude oil prices, which increases input costs. Margins had
improved in Northwest Europe from near break-even a year
before, but were down from the fourth quarter.

 Benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude prices CLc1
averaged about $43 a barrel in the first quarter, 56 percent
lower than in the same quarter last year. The quarter's average
price of natural gas for delivery at Henry Hub was $4.73 per
million British thermal units, down 44 percent from last year.

 Chevron said downstream earnings would include about $350
million from sales of its fuel marketing businesses in Brazil
and Nigeria. Earnings from its chemicals business were expected
to fall on lower margins and volumes.

 Chevron also said after-tax charges for corporate and other
activities might significantly differ from its normal guidance
of $250 million to $350 million due to foreign currency effects
and potential accruals from pension settlements and taxes.

 The San Ramon, California-based company is due to report
first-quarter results on May 1. Analysts had been expecting a
net profit before items of $2.03 billion, or 94 cents a share,
on revenue of $23.11 billion. In the same quarter last year, it
made $2.48 per share on revenue of nearly $66 billion.

 A week ago, rival ConocoPhillips (COP.N) said earnings
would be hurt by weakness in North American natural gas prices
and that its worldwide margins would be significantly lower.
[ID:nN02547075]

 Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) is expected to give its quarterly
update next week.

 Chevron's stock closed on Thursday at $69.23, up $13 from
its low in early March when it was within sight of its lowest
levels for nearly three years. A rally in energy prices and the
stock market lifted the entire industry in the past month.

 Chevron shares are down 6 percent so far in 2009, broadly

&lt;p&gt; (Adds JPMorgan comment, paragraph 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 9 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
has cut three senior analysts and a handful of junior analysts
from its North American equity research operation, according to
a person familiar with the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank is also ending coverage of nearly 50 companies, it
said in research report on small and mid-cap companies on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. bank and other Wall Street firms
have been trimming research to cut costs as the global
recession deepens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said at its annual investor day in February that
it expects to cut 1,000 to 2,000 jobs in its investment bank
this year. The research cuts are included in this figure, the
person familiar with the plans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, two alternative research executives left
JPMorgan to set up their own company and they said the bank is
cutting 30 percent of its research division [ID:nN31403840].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan spokeswoman said the 30 percent number is
"unfounded." She declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three senior analysts that have left are John Pancari,
who covered small and mid-cap banks, Kevin Pollard, who
followed small and mid-cap oil companies, and Jay Deahna, a
semiconductor equipment analyst. None of the three came from
Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan acquired a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank retains a presence in all of these sectors and
much of Pancari's and Pollard's coverage has been reassigned,
the person said. The bank may pick up its coverage of some of
the companies that have been dropped at a later date, the
source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies that the bank is dropping are mostly from the
financial, technology and energy sectors.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported in its interim update that
earnings for the first quarter 2009 are expected to be sharply lower than in the
fourth quarter 2008. Upstream earnings are expected to decline substantially, in
part due to lower prices for crude oil and natural gas. Downstream earnings are
also anticipated to be much lower than in the previous period, with average
margins on the sale of refined products off significantly. 

Basis for Comparison in Interim Update

The interim update contains certain industry and company operating data for the
first quarter 2009. The production volumes, realizations, margins and certain
other items in the report are based on a portion of the quarter and are not
necessarily indicative of Chevron's quarterly results to be reported on May 1,
2009. The reader should not place undue reliance on this data. 

Unless noted otherwise, all commentary is based on two months of the first
quarter 2009 versus full fourth quarter 2008 results. 

UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

The table that follows includes information on production and price indicators
for crude oil and natural gas for specific markets. Actual realizations may vary
from indicative pricing due to quality and location differentials and the effect
of pricing lags. International earnings are driven by actual liftings, which may
differ from production due to the timing of cargoes and other factors.

1 The Avg. Brent Spot Price is based on Platts daily assessments, using
Chevron`s internal formula to produce a quarterly average. 

Total U.S. oil-equivalent production during the first two months of the first
quarter improved 41,000 barrels per day mainly due to increased production in
the Gulf of Mexico that was associated with ongoing restoration activities
following the hurricanes last September and the ramp-up of production at Blind
Faith. 

International oil-equivalent production increased 64,000 barrels per day. The
liquids component of oil-equivalent production increased 48,000 barrels per day
primarily due to the continued ramp-up of production from the expansion project
at the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan and at the Agbami Field offshore Nigeria. Also
contributing was the impact of lower crude-oil prices on the company`s share of
production associated with production-sharing contracts and variable-royalty
agreements. International natural-gas production increased nearly four percent. 

U.S. crude-oil realizations for the first two months of the first quarter
declined about $18 per barrel to $33.37. International liquids realizations fell
approximately $9 to $37.78 per barrel. U.S. natural-gas realizations decreased
$0.78 to $4.45 per thousand cubic feet while average international natural-gas
realizations fell $0.77 per thousand cubic feet to $4.33. 

U.S. upstream results in the first quarter are expected to include charges of
approximately $100 million for write-offs mainly associated with exploration
activities, while the fourth quarter included a gain of approximately $600
million from an asset-exchange transaction. Also in the fourth quarter,
international upstream earnings included a nearly $650 million benefit from
foreign-exchange effects. 

DOWNSTREAM - REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

The table that follows includes industry benchmark indicators for refining and
marketing margins. Actual margins realized by the company may differ
significantly due to location and product mix effects, planned and unplanned
shutdown activity and other company-specific and operational factors.

2 Refining indicator margins (except for U.S. West Coast - Blended 5-3-1-1) were
revised to better reflect refined-product specifications. 

For the full first quarter, the U.S. West Coast refining indicator margin
improved while the Gulf Coast refining indicator margin declined from the fourth
quarter. Outside of the U.S., refining indicator margins were lower. Marketing
indicator margins in the U.S. decreased significantly during the full first
quarter. Comparing January and February with the fourth quarter, marketing
margins outside the U.S. were mixed. 

Downstream earnings in the fourth quarter included sizeable benefits from
provisionally priced crudes, derivatives and other timing effects. The first
quarter impact of timing effects is expected to be negative. 

During the first two months of the first quarter, U.S. refinery crude-input
volumes were essentially unchanged at 931,000 barrels per day. Outside the U.S.,
refinery crude-input volumes increased 24,000 barrels per day primarily due to
the completion of maintenance in Thailand. 

International downstream earnings in the first quarter are expected to include
gains of approximately $350 million from the previously announced sales of the
fuels marketing businesses in Brazil and Nigeria.

&lt;p&gt;-- Eric Auchard is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed
are his own --&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Eric Auchard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - Sun Microsystems JAVA.O has
endured annual restructurings it keeps straight by naming them
with classic-sounding Roman numerals. It needs to make sure
Round IX is its last, part of a deal to merge with IBM (IBM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's investors and its entrenched corporate
customer base have been left to wonder about Sun's shrinking
prospects and, unless it can woo IBM back or find a new suitor,
its future looks dim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's annual revenue tops $13 billion, its cash
position is strong and its old fans remain loyal. However, a
steep sales decline brought on by the financial crisis means
March quarter sales are set to fall 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other obvious candidates have better things to do with
their money than buy Sun. Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) recently paid
$13.9 billion to buy computer services firm EDS and is busy
digesting that deal. Dell DELL.O is short of the cash and
expertise needed to do a Sun-sized deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a huge cash pile of $29.5 billion, Cisco Systems
(CSCO.O) is a dark horse favourite among pundits looking for
alternatives to IBM. Cisco could leapfrog its way into new
computer hardware and storage businesses with Sun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Cisco showed its lack of interest this week by
acquiring Tidal Software, a small maker of data centre software
for $105 million, continuing its long-held preference for
small-scale mergers rather than big deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun was an early champion of distributing computing power to
users over networks rather than tying them to specific machines.
In recent years it has become a victim of its success in winning
over most of the rest of the industry to thinking as it did long
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun's motto "The network is the computer" may end up
becoming its epitaph, as the value of the software and services
available over the Internet has exploded while computing
hardware itself has headed toward a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is an aging rock star in an industry where tastes long
ago shifted to bubble-gum pop and boy bands. The company has
struggled to remain competitive when its core computer hardware
products rely its own chip designs instead of the cheap and
plentiful Intel processors that most of the industry have
adopted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM was the only bidder, despite month of efforts by Sun to
shop itself around, and remains the odd-on bet to acquire Sun.
Sun's shares fell sharply after merger talks broke down with IBM
but remain 30 percent higher than before talks between the two
emerged on a bet they would find a way to do a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's advantage is that it is consolidating a rival maker of
computers, storage and software and can justify a big part of
any deal with expected cost savings. Consolidation players are
far more likely to find favour with investors than deals based
on strategic prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Sun, IBM continues to develop its own chip to advance
its lines of mainframe and high-server computers. Switching
Sun's customers away from Sun SPARC chips to similar machines
using IBM Power chips would help the economics of IBM's
computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one but IBM has stepped forward, for good reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's initial offer of a 100-percent premium to buy Sun made
the tentative deal look a sure bet, so much so that Wall Street
analysts didn't see the point in calculating the value of the
parts of Sun's businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consolidating chip production could shave $500 million from
Sun's annual research and development budget of between $1.8
billion and $2.0 billion. Rationalizing corporate expenses in
the merged organisation could realize another $1 billion in
savings off its roughly $4 billion SGA accounting line. These
potential cost savings are what gives IBM the edge over other
bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Differences between IBM and Sun over the deal's price and
protections demanded by Sun in the event that competition
regulators seek to delay the deal look like negotiating tactics
to drive a better price than reasons to derail the merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun investors see an obvious parallel with last year's Yahoo
debacle, when brinksmanship by the company's then leadership
cost Yahoo investors a premium north of 50 percent on Yahoo
stock after Microsoft pulled its offer.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM originally was talking to Sun about paying $10-$11 per
share to buy Sun, but reportedly cut its offer to between $9.10
and $9.40 after due diligence, leading Sun to walk away. Whether
Sun gets $9 or $10, it should seize the deal. The company's
board has overseen a plunge in the stock price from $275 to $5
and there is little hope of seeing Sun trading at $20 a share in
the near future except as part of IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best way to get this deal done may be for IBM to offer
Sun a mix of stock and cash, allowing Sun investors to
participate in future gains from IBM stock. This could prove the
lever that that IBM uses to woo Sun back to the negotiating
table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- At the time of publication Eric Auchard did not own any
direct investments in securities mentioned in this article. He
may be an owner indirectly as an investor in a fund. Eric worked
at a unit of Sun for a short time in the late 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Andrew Dobbie)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 9 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
has cut three senior analysts and a handful of junior analysts
from its North American equity research operation, according to
a person familiar with the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank is also ending coverage of nearly 50 companies, it
said in research report on small and mid-cap companies on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. bank and other Wall Street firms
have been trimming research to cut costs as the global recession
deepens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said at its annual investor day in February that it
expects to cut 1,000 to 2,000 jobs in its investment bank this
year. The research cuts are included in this figure, the person
familiar with the plans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, two alternative research executives left JPMorgan
to set up their own company and they said the bank is cutting 30
percent of its research division [ID:nN31403840].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three senior analysts that have left are John Pancari,
who covered small and mid-cap banks, Kevin Pollard, who followed
small and mid-cap oil companies, and Jay Deahna, a semiconductor
equipment analyst. None of the three came from Bear Stearns,
which JPMorgan acquired a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank retains a presence in all of these sectors and much
of Pancari's and Pollard's coverage has been reassigned, the
person said. The bank may pick up its coverage of some of the
companies that have been dropped at a later date, the source
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies that the bank is dropping are mostly from the
financial, technology and energy sectors.

It needs to make sure Round IX is its last, part of a deal to merge with IBM (IBM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's investors and its entrenched corporate customer base have been left to wonder about Sun's shrinking prospects and, unless it can find woo IBM back or find a new suitor, its future looks dim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's annual revenue tops $13 billion, its cash position is strong and its old fans remain loyal. However, a steep sales decline brought on by the financial crisis means March quarter sales are set to fall 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other obvious candidates have better things to do with their money than buy Sun. Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) recently paid $13.9 billion to buy computer services firm EDS and is busy digesting that deal. Dell DELL.O is short of the cash and expertise needed to do a Sun-sized deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a huge cash pile of $29.5 billion, Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) is a dark horse favorite among pundits looking for alternatives to IBM. Cisco could leapfrog its way into new computer hardware and storage businesses with Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Cisco showed its lack of interest this week by acquiring Tidal Software, a small maker of data center software for $105 million, continuing its long-held preference for small-scale mergers rather than big deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun was an early champion of distributing computing power to users over networks rather than tying them to specific machines. In recent years it has become a victim of its success in winning over most of the rest of the industry to thinking as it did long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun's motto "The network is the computer" may end up becoming its epitaph, as the value of the software and services available over the Internet has exploded while computing hardware itself has headed toward a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an aging rock star in an industry where tastes long ago shifted to bubble-gum pop and boy bands. The company has struggled to remain competitive when its core computer hardware products rely its own chip designs instead of the cheap and plentiful Intel processors that most of the industry have adopted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM was the only bidder, despite month of efforts by Sun to shop itself around, and remains the odd-on bet to acquire Sun. Sun's shares fell sharply after merger talks broke down with IBM but remain 30 percent higher than before talks between the two emerged on a bet they would find a way to do a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's advantage is that it is consolidating a rival maker of computers, storage and software and can justify a big part of any deal with expected cost savings. Consolidation players are far more likely to find favor with investors than deals based on strategic prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Sun, IBM continues to develop its own chip to advance its lines of mainframe and high-server computers. Switching Sun's customers away from Sun SPARC chips to similar machines using IBM Power chips would help the economics of IBM's computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one but IBM has stepped forward, for good reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's initial offer of a 100-percent premium to buy Sun made the tentative deal look a sure bet, so much so that Wall Street analysts didn't see the point in calculating the value of the parts of Sun's businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidating chip production could shave $500 million from Sun's annual research and development budget of between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion. Rationalizing corporate expenses in the merged organization could realize another $1 billion in savings off its roughly $4 billion SGA accounting line. These potential cost savings are what gives IBM the edge over other bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences between IBM and Sun over the deal's price and protections demanded by Sun in the event that competition regulators seek to delay the deal look like negotiating tactics to drive a better price than reasons to derail the merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun investors see an obvious parallel with last year's Yahoo debacle, when brinksmanship by the company's then leadership cost Yahoo investors a premium north of 50 percent on Yahoo stock after Microsoft pulled its offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM originally was talking to Sun about paying $10-$11 per share to buy Sun, but reportedly cut its offer to between $9.10 and $9.40 after due diligence, leading Sun to walk away. Whether Sun gets $9 or $10, it should seize the deal. The company's board has overseen a plunge in the stock price from $275 to $5 and there is little hope of seeing Sun trading at $20 a share in the near future except as part of IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to get this deal done may be for IBM to offer Sun a mix of stock and cash, allowing Sun investors to participate in future gains from IBM stock.

&lt;p&gt; By Eric Auchard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - Sun Microsystems JAVA.O has
endured annual restructurings it keeps straight by naming them
with classic-sounding Roman numerals. It needs to make sure
Round IX is its last, part of a deal to merge with IBM (IBM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's investors and its entrenched corporate
customer base have been left to wonder about Sun's shrinking
prospects and, unless it can find woo IBM back or find a new
suitor, its future looks dim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's annual revenue tops $13 billion, its cash
position is strong and its old fans remain loyal. However, a
steep sales decline brought on by the financial crisis means
March quarter sales are set to fall 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other obvious candidates have better things to do with
their money than buy Sun. Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) recently paid
$13.9 billion to buy computer services firm EDS and is busy
digesting that deal. Dell DELL.O is short of the cash and
expertise needed to do a Sun-sized deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a huge cash pile of $29.5 billion, Cisco Systems
(CSCO.O) is a dark horse favourite among pundits looking for
alternatives to IBM. Cisco could leapfrog its way into new
computer hardware and storage businesses with Sun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Cisco showed its lack of interest this week by
acquiring Tidal Software, a small maker of data centre software
for $105 million, continuing its long-held preference for
small-scale mergers rather than big deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun was an early champion of distributing computing power to
users over networks rather than tying them to specific machines.
In recent years it has become a victim of its success in winning
over most of the rest of the industry to thinking as it did long
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun's motto "The network is the computer" may end up
becoming its epitaph, as the value of the software and services
available over the Internet has exploded while computing
hardware itself has headed toward a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is an aging rock star in an industry where tastes long
ago shifted to bubble-gum pop and boy bands. The company has
struggled to remain competitive when its core computer hardware
products rely its own chip designs instead of the cheap and
plentiful Intel processors that most of the industry have
adopted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM was the only bidder, despite month of efforts by Sun to
shop itself around, and remains the odd-on bet to acquire Sun.
Sun's shares fell sharply after merger talks broke down with IBM
but remain 30 percent higher than before talks between the two
emerged on a bet they would find a way to do a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's advantage is that it is consolidating a rival maker of
computers, storage and software and can justify a big part of
any deal with expected cost savings. Consolidation players are
far more likely to find favour with investors than deals based

the tentative deal look a sure bet, so much so that Wall Street
analysts didn't see the point in calculating the value of the
parts of Sun's businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consolidating chip production could shave $500 million from
Sun's annual research and development budget of between $1.8
billion and $2.0 billion. Rationalizing corporate expenses in
the merged organisation could realize another $1 billion in
savings off its roughly $4 billion SGA accounting line. These
potential cost savings are what gives IBM the edge over other
bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Differences between IBM and Sun over the deal's price and
protections demanded by Sun in the event that competition
regulators seek to delay the deal look like negotiating tactics
to drive a better price than reasons to derail the merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun investors see an obvious parallel with last year's Yahoo
debacle, when brinksmanship by the company's then leadership
cost Yahoo investors a premium north of 50 percent on Yahoo
stock after Microsoft pulled its offer.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM originally was talking to Sun about paying $10-$11 per
share to buy Sun, but reportedly cut its offer to between $9.10
and $9.40 after due diligence, leading Sun to walk away. Whether

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded and assigned Rating Outlooks or Recovery Ratings
(RR) to the following classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp.'s commercial pass-through certificates, series 2004-CIBC9: 

--$20.7 million class D to 'A-' from 'A'; Outlook Stable; 

--$11 million class E to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$15.2 million class F to 'BBB-' from 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable; 

--$9.6 million class G to 'BB+' from 'BBB'; Outlook Stable; 

--$17.9 million class H to 'B-' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$2.8 million class J to 'B-' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$4.1 million class K to 'CCC/RR1' from 'BB'; 

--$5.5 million class L to 'CCC/RR1' from 'BB-'; 

--$5.5 million class M to 'CC/RR4' from 'B+'; 

--$2.8 million class N to 'C/RR6' from 'B'; 

--$2.8 million class P to 'C/RR6' from 'B-'. 

In addition, Fitch has affirmed and assigned Rating Outlooks to the following
classes: 

--$11.2 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$146 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$103.7 million class A-3 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$466.4 million class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$158 million class A-1A at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$27.5 million class B at 'AA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$13.8 million class C at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch does not rate the $13.8 million class NR. 

The downgrades to classes D through P are due to projected losses on the three
specially serviced loans (5.1%). The affirmations to classes A-1 through C
reflect sufficient Fitch-expected credit enhancement to the senior classes. The
Rating Outlooks indicate the likely direction of any changes to the ratings over
the next one to two years. 

There are three loans in special servicing (5.1%) with losses expected. The
largest specially serviced loan (4.3%) is secured by 433,829 square feet (sf) of
owned space at a 603,207 sf retail property located in Sacramento, CA. The loan
transferred March 11, 2008 due to imminent default. The borrower continues to
forward excess cash flow, and the loan is paid through March 2009 except for a
portion of the replacement reserves. The largest tenant at the property,
Gottschalk's (48%), filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in January 2009,
and in March 2009 announced liquidation of all remaining stores. Another major
tenant (10%) indicated that rent payments will cease, but has been paying one
month in arrears. The recent appraised value indicates losses. 

The second largest specially serviced loan (0.5%) transferred April 3, 2006 due
to monetary default. The loan is secured by three industrial properties located
in Portage, MI which comprise a total of 119,211 sf. The special servicer is
discussing a potential deed-in-lieu of foreclosure with the borrower. Fitch
expects losses on the loan. 

The smallest specially serviced loan (0.3%) was transferred to the special
servicer Dec. 3, 2008 due to monetary default. The collateral is a 126-unit
multifamily complex located in Humble, TX. The year-end 2007 debt service
coverage ratio (DSCR) was reported at 1.30x, compared to a reported DSCR of
0.95x through second-quarter 2008. The property was 80% occupied as of June 30,
2008. Losses on the loan are possible. 

In addition to the specially serviced loans, two loans (1.6%) are currently 30
days delinquent. Fitch expects a higher probability of transfer to the special
servicer and eventual losses on these loans. Including the specially serviced
and the delinquent loans, 15 loans (12.7%) have been designated as Fitch Loans
of Concern. 

Fitch reviewed financial statements, rent rolls, and other information
corresponding to the shadow rated loans: Centro Retail Portfolio II (13.7%) and
Grace Building (11%). Based on stable performance since issuance, both loans
maintain investment-grade shadow ratings. 

As of the March 2009 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance
has been reduced 5.8 % to $1.04 billion, from $1.1 billion at issuance. Eight
loans (6.2%) have defeased since issuance. Five loans (1.8%) mature in 2009, of
which two (0.5%) have defeased. For the non-defeased loans maturing in 2009, the
weighted-average coupon is 4.57% and the weighted-average servicer-reported DSCR
is 1.82x. No loans mature or are anticipated to repay in 2010. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

&lt;p&gt;CEA/Leti Becomes a Research Associate of IBM and IBM`s Semiconductor
Joint Development Alliance Ecosystem Centered in Albany


GRENOBLE, France--(Business Wire)--
CEA/Leti (the Electronics and Information Technology Laboratory of the CEA,
based in Grenoble), and IBM today announced that they will collaborate on
research in semiconductor and nanoelectronics technology. 

This five-year agreement is focused on advanced materials, devices and processes
for the development of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process
technology for the production of microprocessors and integrated circuits at 22nm
and beyond. 

With this agreement, CEA/Leti becomes a research associate of IBM and IBM`s
semiconductor Joint Development Alliance ecosystem centered in Albany, N.Y.
CEA/Leti will reinforce this ecosystem through its specific expertise in
low-power CMOS (such as SOI technologies), in e-beam lithography and in
nanoscale characterization and modelling. This agreement strengthens the links
between the IBM and Crolles-Grenoble ecosystems, following STMicroelectronics`
decision to join the IBM Alliance in 2007, for the development of core CMOS and
value-added application-specific derivative technologies and industrialization
of these processes. 

"Due to increasing complexity, CMOS technologies can only be developed through
global alliances. CEA/Leti chose to partner with IBM since its alliance directly
benefits companies with strong industrial activity based in Europe," said
Laurent Malier, General Manager of CEA/Leti. "With 22 and 16nm nodes ahead of
us, many challenges remain to be tackled and we are strongly committed to
speeding up the advent of the best options for these technologies". 

"This agreement reinforces the IBM ecosystem of leading companies and research
organizations who are working together to achieve significant advances in
semiconductor and nanoelectronics technology," said Scottie Ginn, vice
president, IBM design enablement and packaging. "This unique model of
collaborative development can help accelerate the production of more powerful
and energy efficient chips for next-generation computers, consumer electronics
and mobile devices." 

Complementary expertise

This collaboration will focus on three key areas:

* Advanced lithography for fast prototyping and 22nm chip technology 
* CMOS technologies and low-power devices for 22nm chip technology and beyond 
* Technology enablement, including innovative nanoscale characterization
techniques for research and for the monitoring of manufacturing protocols

This development work will bring complementary expertise to the IBM Research
Alliance. Research work will be carried out on CEA/Leti`s 300mm silicon platform
in Grenoble, as well as at the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering of
the University at Albany, N.Y., STMicroelectronics` facility in Crolles, and
IBM`s 300mm fab in East Fishkill, N.Y. A team from CEA/Leti will be assigned to
work on the program at Albany Nanotech. 

"We are very pleased with this agreement between CEA/Leti and IBM. It is within
the logic of overall cooperation and it represents an important step for the
development of advanced processes which are necessary for the implementation of
the core CMOS and value-added applications specific derivative technologies at
our Crolles site," added Jean-Marc Chery, executive vice president, chief
technology officer, STMicroelectronics. 

This agreement reinforces CEA/Leti`s role as a supporter of the European
microelectronics industry, as the results of this cooperation will benefit
European partners of the IBM Alliance as well as the users of the alliance
technology. 

"A company`s competitiveness depends on innovation, which is why IBM enters into
partnerships with industry leading companies and laboratories to jointly take on
the challenge of developing the technologies of the future," said Daniel
Chaffraix, country general manager, IBM France. "Partnerships between public and
private research teams can dramatically spur projects, rapidly transforming the
results of researchers into benefits that improve our daily lives."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) was ordered to pay $388 million in damages for infringing a patent held by anti-piracy software maker Uniloc Inc on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, said it was disappointed in the verdict, and plans to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verdict was reached by a jury in a long-running case in federal court in Rhode Island, which found that Microsoft infringed Uniloc's patent on software that generates unique identities for licensed users and prevents unauthorized use or copying of programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that we do not infringe, that the patent is invalid and that this award of damages is legally and factually unsupported," said a Microsoft spokesman. "We will ask the court to overturn the verdict."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uniloc USA and its Singapore-based parent originally filed suit against Microsoft in 2003, claiming that Microsoft infringed its patent with security software it was using to prevent unlicensed use of its Windows XP operating system and parts of its Office suite of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six years of legal wrangling, the jury trial started in March. The damages award is one of the largest on record in patent law disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case: Uniloc USA, Inc., et al v. Microsoft Corp., et al, U.S. District Court District of Rhode Island (Providence), 1:03-cv-00440-S-DLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing Bernard Orr, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, Apr 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has signed a five-year agreement with
Sainsbury's, to transform the retailer's supply chain network. IBM will
help Sainsbury's further enhance its customer experience by implementing
new systems which aim to heighten stock availability for customers.

    The new IBM solution, which is based on the Wesupply network and
visibility application, aims to provide an effective platform to help
Sainsbury's and its approximately 4,000 suppliers find smarter ways of
managing overall supply chain performance to support the continued growth
of the business.

    With large stores offering around 30,000 products, the IBM solution will
allow Sainsbury's to monitor the status of orders across its entire
network and manage the availability of products. The Wesupply service
will allow information flows to be streamlined and greater visibility of
real-time supply chain performance will be provided to heighten stock
control.

    "To support our continued growth, we were looking to enhance our
collaboration with suppliers without a significant increase in cost, while
continuing to introduce greater intelligence into our supply chain,"
explained Tim Goalen, of Sainsbury's. "With a thorough understanding of
the solution and services required, and after a detailed review of the
market, we chose the IBM and Wesupply solution."

    IBM will provide business consulting services to manage the establishment,
implementation and maintenance of the Wesupply services which are designed
to meet the requirements of a large supplier network such as Sainsbury's.
IBM will then manage the migration of suppliers onto the systems,
providing Sainsbury's with enhanced communication across its network. As
part of this migration, Sainsbury's will be transitioning its EDI VAN
service to Inovis. With hundreds of Sainsbury's suppliers already using
Inovisworks, the VAN service fits very well within the IBM solution.

    "Visibility of stock and collaboration with suppliers are key aspects of
Sainsbury's vision of success, making the transactional platform a
critical element of their operation," said Justin Suter, Retail Supply
Chain Leader, IBM Global Business Services. "Utilising its retail
expertise IBM is committed to working with Sainsbury's to achieve this
vision and develop smarter solutions that benefit the continued growth of
its business."

    "We're delighted to be part of the solution and providing Sainsbury's with
the tools to enable increased visibility with suppliers," added Bob
Godfrey, CEO, Wesupply.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Apr 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
A new IBM (NYSE: IBM) consulting service can help clients establish
sustainability standards -- from labor practices, to safety, to the
environment -- throughout their global supplier networks.

    The IBM Sustainable Procurement offering is designed to help clients
define cost, efficiency and sustainability measurements and goals for
their procurement activities. This covers all supplies, materials,
ingredients, components, finished goods and services they purchase to run
their operations and to develop, manufacture and deliver their own
products or services. The offering then helps them understand current
practices, and develop and implement strategies for measuring suppliers'
compliance with sustainable procurement goals.

    In a globalized economy, companies and government agencies can work with
thousands of suppliers around the world. In addition to headline-grabbing
problems that can arise -- faulty components, toxic ingredients, unsafe
working conditions -- gross inefficiencies and waste can proliferate in
such complex networks, as suppliers operate to their own individual
practices and guidelines.

    But effectively managing those relationships through a comprehensive
sustainable procurement strategy can provide significant business
advantages, such as cost and efficiency improvements, better regulatory
compliance, lower environmental impact and improved reputation with
customers and other key stakeholders.

    For example, according to internal IBM estimates 80 percent of greenhouse
gas emissions associated with supply chain activities occur outside a
company's or government agency's own operations. But establishing
guidelines for energy use and monitoring performance throughout the supply
chain can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping finished goods by
as much as 10 percent, with a corresponding savings in energy costs.

    "Driving sustainability practices through a global supply chain provides
the biggest opportunity for companies and government agencies to improve
efficiency and reduce environmental impact on a large scale," said Eric
Riddleberger, IBM's business strategy consulting global leader, who heads
up the company's corporate social responsibility consulting efforts. "It
creates a domino effect, helping all supply chain partners become greener,
more efficient and economical, and improving their contributions to the
communities and countries they operate in."

    In addition, greater sustainability performance can enhance relationships
with key stakeholders such as customers, investors, current and potential
employees and, in the case of governments, citizens. For companies this
can mean an opportunity to differentiate themselves from competitors,
expand their access to new markets and tap new opportunities to grow
revenue. For governments, it can mean better stewardship of public assets
and revenue and enhanced service to key constituents.

    The IBM Sustainable Procurement offering covers six main areas of CSR
throughout the supply chain:


--   Environment -- reducing energy and water usage, minimizing waste and
the use of potentially hazardous chemicals and materials, increasing
recycling and recyclability, and improving efficiency; 
--   Community -- ensuring suppliers support and contribute to the
communities they operate in; 
--   Health and safety -- promoting safe workplace practices as well as
ensuring safety in products and services; 
--   Ethics and financial accountability -- ensuring suppliers practice
appropriate business ethics and adhere to applicable standards for
financial accounting and transparency; 
--   Diversity -- encouraging diversity and inclusiveness throughout the
supply chain; 
--   Labor practices -- ensuring suppliers adhere to local, national and
internationals laws, rules and standards for labor practices. 

    
This offering draws on IBM's own experience running one of the
largest, most complex supply chains in the world, with 30,000 supplier
locations spread out over more than 60 countries. IBM has established its
own Supplier Conduct Principles outlining its expectations regarding
working hours, wages and benefits, employee health and safety,
nondiscrimination, communications, the environment and ethics.

    For government organizations, the IBM Sustainable Procurement offering can
help U.S. federal government agencies comply with Executive Order 13423
and Department of Defense Green Procurement Strategy guidelines. It is
adaptable, however, for use at any level of government in any country.

    The IBM Sustainable Procurement offering joins a growing portfolio of
consulting services from IBM designed to help clients address CSR issues
throughout their operations. It can be used in combination with those
other offerings to provide a comprehensive solution based on each
client's needs.

    This portfolio includes: the CSR Assessment and Benchmarking Utility, the
Carbon Tradeoff Modeler, Green Sigma(TM), Environmental Product Lifecycle
Management, the Supply Chain Network Optimization Workbench (or SNOW),
Strategic Carbon Management, and the Public Sector Energy and Environment
Diagnostic.

</body></entry><entry author="None" date="2009-04-09T14:44:42+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS144991+09-Apr-2009+MW20090409"><headline>IBM Unveils Prototype of World's Fastest Financial Analysis System</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Apr 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Today, IBM (NYSE: IBM) unveiled a revolutionary prototype of the world's
fastest automated options trading system. During the project, scientists
at IBM Research collaborated with TD Securities to achieve a 21 times
performance improvement on the volume of data consumed by financial
trading systems.

    Financial services firms must rapidly, capture, process and find value in
massive volumes of data in order to maximize client returns and minimize
risk. Traditional business intelligence approaches -- which rely on
capturing, organizing and then querying a fixed snapshot of data -- can no
longer keep pace.

    Through the combination of IBM's InfoSphere Streams -- a breakthrough
software technology from IBM Research -- and IBM's Blue Gene/P
supercomputer, the IBM Research team created a unique stream processing
system ideally suited to meet and surpass the demands of the financial
services industry. By enabling rapid, intelligent analysis of live
streaming data from a practically unlimited number of sources, IBM
delivered astoundingly low latency -- the time between when data is
received and when it's acted upon -- far surpassing the performance of
traditional trading systems.

    "In the constantly evolving electronic marketplace, innovative technology
solutions to better manage high volumes of real time information are a
significant competitive edge," said Rizwan Khalfan, Chief Information
Officer at TD Securities.

    According to the Financial Information Forum, the combined options and
equities traffic has exploded, doubling in size every year since 2003. The
challenge to ingest, analyze and automatically act upon millions of
messages every second is the difference between success and failure for
automated trading systems. IBM's use of its unique stream computing
architecture and Blue Gene allowed for significant enhancements to
real-time messaging and analytical capabilities while offering a
simplified, energy-efficient underlying infrastructure.

    The collaboration with TD Securities is part of IBM's First-Of-A-Kind
program (FOAK), which engages IBM's scientists with the company's clients
to explore how emerging technologies could solve real world business
problems. In this collaboration, IBM Research scientists worked with TD
Securities to create a tailored, unique system through applying advanced
and emerging technologies and new approaches.

    "TD Securities could potentially use the new system to analyze and act on
information before their competitors can finish ingesting and analyzing,
effectively blinding the competition to its actions," said Nagui Halim,
chief scientist of the Stream Computing Project at IBM. "We're not talking
about 20 percent faster here. We're talking about 20 times faster," he
added.

    Today's exchange data rates challenge financial firms trading systems to
process up to two million messages per second. The goal of any automated
trading systems is to reduce the time between the receipt of market data
messages and the decision, achieving a very low latency while processing
extreme amounts of data. The more messages a system can process, the more
decisions can be made; hence, the more valuable the system.

    In testing, the system was found to be capable of handling data at 21
times the speed of Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA), the world's
single largest market data feed, while maintaining ultra low end-to-end
latencies.

    IBM InfoSphere Streams

    The IBM InfoSphere Streams computing platform offers low-latency,
high-throughput analytics processing for the continuous streaming of
heterogeneous data, and can scale seamlessly from a single server to
thousands of general-purpose computational nodes and/or special-purpose
computing architectures such as the IBM Blue Gene supercomputer. The
stream processing core continually monitors and adapts to the state and
utilization of its computing resources, the information needs expressed by
users and the availability of data to meet those needs.

    In financial services, where increasingly volatile trading conditions
necessitate ever faster decisions, stream computing is a game-changing
technology that enables traders to see clearly through a rising storm of
data. By enabling financial services firms to absorb and understand vast
quantities of live data from almost limitless sources, IBM's stream
software can deliver clear competitive advantage in an increasingly
fast-moving and interconnected world. Firms that can derive insight and
build new models ahead of the news cycle and faster than the competition
will achieve higher margins and faster time-to-market, using their
intellectual property to drive competitive differentiation.

real-world Construction Administration application for an architecture firm. The
application is a critical, legacy MS Access application that has outgrown MS
Access and is ready to become a full-fledged enterprise application. The domain
is modeled out via whiteboard sketches, and the application is built using C#,
ASP.NET, AJAX.NET, and other Microsoft technologies and best practices. The main
focus of the book is on the domain object model and the supporting framework
that is being built to support that object model.

&lt;p&gt;- New Agreement Provides ORBCOMM Opportunity to Expand and Extend Scope of
Relationship with General Electric Asset Intelligence, LLC Through 2013 -
FORT LEE, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
ORBCOMM Inc. (Nasdaq: ORBC), a global satellite data communications company
focused on providing Machine to Machine (M2M) solutions, with its subsidiary,
Stellar Satellite Communications Ltd., today announced the entering into several
agreements with General Electric Asset Intelligence, LLC (GEAI). ORBCOMM will be
the sole provider to GEAI of telematics and M2M data communications on all
subscriber communicators sold or managed by or on behalf of GEAI, whether
satellites, cellular, or dual mode (cellular plus satellite), generally as long
as ORBCOMM provides competitive services at competitive rates with appropriate
regulatory approvals, subject to the terms of the agreement. 

Pursuant to the settlement agreement, GEAI paid a one-time settlement fee
associated with the prior hardware agreement between GEAI and Stellar dated
October 10, 2006. ORBCOMM and GEAI have concurrently entered into a services
agreement, which will expand the scope of services provided by ORBCOMM to GEAI.
The new services, in addition to ORBCOMM`s low-earth-orbit satellite-based data
communications services, may include network services for M2M applications using
other satellite, cellular or dual mode (cellular plus satellite) data
communications services thereby focusing on subscriptions rather than hardware
sales. The services agreement, whose term coincides with the amended
International Value Added Reseller (IVAR) agreement, is for five years through
December 31, 2013. 

"We are pleased to have this new agreement with General Electric in place," said
Marc Eisenberg, Chief Executive Officer of ORBCOMM. "The new agreement focuses
on subscriber additions as opposed to hardware sales, further embedding ORBCOMM
into GEAI`s go-to-market strategy. As a result, this allows ORBCOMM to leverage
the satellite network and terrestrial reseller agreements we have been
establishing. This agreement strengthens ORBCOMM`s relationship with GEAI
through December 31, 2013."

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Sales at Sun Microsystems Corp JAVA.O, already under pressure, could take a further hit from the collapse of IBM's (IBM.N) multibillion dollar bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failure of the high-end computer and software company to sell itself might drive customers to its rivals -- International Business Machines Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Dell Inc DELL.O -- say consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would hate to be in the Sun sales organization at the moment," said Eric Johnson, director of the Center for Digital Strategies at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. "Pretty much every corporate client is going to ask them: 'Are you going to be here next year when I need help from you?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that is raising the stakes for Sun's board and Chief Executive Jonathan Schwartz to show there is another plan for turning around the struggling computer maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company's attempt to sell itself often alarms customers by raising a host of tricky questions, such as whether the new owner will continue to add new features to the products they've already bought or to keep providing strong support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said those exact questions came up on Wednesday morning during a breakfast meeting with technology executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to an inquiry from Reuters, Sun said such concerns are unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sun is committed to our customers and channel partners, and will continue to do what has always defined the company: innovate for customers," a company spokesman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun, which rode the Internet boom to prominence in the 1990s, may be working to address such concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its board was scheduled to meet on Wednesday, according to a Bloomberg News report, which cited a person familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Sun declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enderle Group analyst Rob Enderle said the collapse of the talks damaged Sun's credibility with its biggest customer group: the financial services industry, which relies on high- end Sun servers to handle critical tasks such as trading and other banking transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that it is widely known that Sun is actively shopping itself around, Sun represents a substantial risk," said Enderle at the San Jose-based technology consulting and research firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not certain that the company will be there to support its equipment. In this market, that kind of risk can drive customers to other players."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said an IBM deal would have assured Sun's customers it would continue to support its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEEKING DISCOUNTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The withdrawal of the offer last weekend comes at a difficult time for Sun, which is firing thousands of workers as sales slow. It posted a $1.9 billion loss for the six months to December 28 on a 9 percent drop in sales to $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armonk, New York-based IBM has no plans to take the lead in restarting negotiations, said a person familiar with the matter not authorized to speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But speculation IBM would eventually buy Sun helped pull stock in the Santa Clara, California, company up 6 percent to a $6.66 close in heavy Nasdaq trading on Wednesday. That compares with $4.97 on March 17, the day before news broke of the IBM negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before talks broke down, IBM put a ceiling of $9.40 on its offer, according to a person familiar with the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers who do stick with Sun will likely try to use its financial problems and the fallout from the collapse of its negotiations with IBM to demand bigger discounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are clearly in a weakened position," said Laura DiDio, an analyst at ITIC, a research and consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The customer is going to say: 'Hey, I don't know what is going on with you. I may be better off going with IBM or HP. What are you going to do for me?' That may have a material impact on revenue and profit margins for the immediate quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once news of the IBM talks leaked out, Sun passed a critical point of no return because negotiating was essentially an admission it needed help, said Charles King, an analyst at consulting firm Pund-IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a bit like somebody who has had a serious accident checking out of the emergency room and insisting they can heal themselves at home," King added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando and Anupreeta Das.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks Research In Motion (Nasdaq: RIMM) as Bull of the Day
and Wilmington Trust Corp. (NYSE: WL) as Bear of the Day. In addition, the
analysts at Zacks Equity Research discuss the latest on Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:
XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) and Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

Research In Motion (Nasdaq: RIMM), the manufacturer of BlackBerry smart-phone
devices, continues with robust financial performance in spite of facing a global
economic recession and an extremely competitive industry. The company`s fourth
quarter (ended February 28) fiscal 2009 financial results were well above our
expectations. 

Newly launched high-end Blackberry handsets experienced significant market
traction as net new subscriber additions reached record breaking levels in the
reported quarter. We expect the smart-phone device market to gain further
momentum should economic conditions improve and as demand for portable mobile
access remains firm on a global basis. 

RIMM has a solid pipeline of innovative feature-rich products to be launched by
mid-fiscal 2010. Management also provided an encouraging financial outlook. We
maintain our Buy rating and the same valuation target. 

Bear of the Day

Wilmington Trust Corp. (NYSE: WL) is scheduled to release its 1Q09 earnings
results on April 24, 2009 with a conference call schedule later on the same day.


We remain concerned with WL`s exposure to commercial real estate-construction
loans (about 20% of the portfolio). Within the construction loan portfolio, 75%
loans are for residential construction/land development. 

Though WL lends mainly to smaller homebuilders in the Delaware Valley (60% of
the portfolio) and not to national homebuilders, we expect a further
deterioration in the credit quality on account of the ongoing weakness in sales.


Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

Oil Inventories Higher Again

Crude oil prices have pulled back from their mid-$50's high for the year in the
face of continued concerns about the health of the global economy. While we
expect the commodity's near-term price movement to continue mirroring the
evolving macro economic picture, we do not expect it to revisit its Dec'08 lows.
We believe that oil prices have troughed already and are currently in a
consolidation phase. 

The continued anemic demand and the strong build in excess production capacity
over the last few months are expected to prevent any sustained price rallies. We
continue to advocate some defensive positioning in the group through Exxon Mobil
Corp. (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX), but are increasingly getting
more comfortable with building positions in the deepwater drillers, such as
Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB), the global oilfield service franchise.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Inc. (NASDAQ: BBBY),

JAVA) and IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

2 Retailers Worth a Look

Two retailers that may be worth a look are Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE:
FDO) and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Inc. (NASDAQ: BBBY). Both reported quarterly results
and investors liked what they saw. FDO shares are higher by 5% and BBBY shares
are up about 20%. 

Family Dollar reported strong fiscal second quarter results, with sales up 9%
year-on-year and EPS up 33%. The retailer is benefiting from selling
non-discretionary items such food and staples, and consumers trading down to
cheaper alternatives. Management is also doing a good job of driving store
traffic by emphasizing its low cost merchandise in a convenient format. 

Atheros: Listen for Q2 Guidance

Atheros Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATHR, Hold) is expected to release its
fiscal Q1 results on April 23. We are expecting the company to post $80.4
million in revenues with non-GAAP EPS of $0.03. This compares to consensus
revenue estimate of $83 million and pro-forma EPS of $0.04. For the full fiscal
year, we currently expect the company to report revenues of $370 million and
non-GAAP EPS of $0.32. 

Following sell-side downgrades recently, shares of ATHR dropped nearly 5% and
then bounced back over 16% before dipping again slightly. ATHR is up around 4%
in trading so far today. Keep in mind that ATHR`s 52-week high was $34.75 back
in August 2008 before it tumbled to $11.26 in November along with broader market
averages. 

JAVA-IBM Talks Break Down

The talks between Sun Microsystems Inc. (NASDAQ: JAVA) and IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM)
have ended. Sun wanted both a higher price and guarantees that IBM would
essentially push the merger through any anti-trust investigation. 

As we had discussed in our first blog on the deal, we thought the two major
flaws in the deal were the very high price and anti-trust considerations, so we
were not surprised when the deal fell through. Sun fell into the same trap that
many company executives fall into -- the assumption that a company is worth more
than the price in the stock market.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The downturn in the civil aerospace sector is expected to be more severe than previously estimated mainly due to a decline in world air traffic and global gross domestic product, said Goldman Sachs, which downgraded Rolls Royce Group (RR.L) by a notch to "sell."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further double-digit drop in world international air traffic data, which fell 10.1 percent for February -- the worst decline since the current crisis began, could put Airbus and Boeing (BA.N) under pressure to cut production schedules for the second half of 2009 and 2010, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage also said: "We believe further double-digit declines are likely for several more months as consumers and businesses seek to preserve cash in the face of economic uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it was cautious on the U.S. defense sector and downgraded BAE Systems (BAES.L) to "neutral" from "buy" on concerns related to U.S. defense spending. BAE gets about 50 percent of its sales from U.S. defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although U.S. defense spending looks healthy in 2009 and 2010, President Barack Obama has made clear his intention to reduce the budget from 2011, the brokerage noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe he intends to either cut or scale back a number of defense programs and implement defense procurement reform more aggressively than we previously thought."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European defense stocks have outperformed U.S. defense stocks so far in 2009 as the market seems concerned about the longer-term outlook for the U.S. defense budget and faster-than-expected moves by Obama to implement defense procurement reform, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tresa Sherin in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry leaders - Maxis, Nokia, Maybank and Visa - Move beyond Pilot Phase to
Make Paying by Mobile Phone a Reality in Malaysia 
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced the launch of the world`s first commercial
Visa mobile payments service for point-of-sale transactions using Near Field
Communications (NFC) technology. The service marks the first time consumers can
purchase an NFC-enabled mobile device off the shelf and use that device to make
Visa payWave-enabled transactions at the point-of-sale instead of using their
payment card. 

"We believe that Visa`s NFC mobile payment launch in Malaysia signals a tipping
point for the payments industry globally as we move from mobile payment pilots
to commercial availability," said Elizabeth Buse, Global Head of Product at Visa
Inc. "Malaysia has historically been an early adopter of new payment
technologies. The launch of Visa`s first commercial NFC program in Malaysia is
based on Visa's experience gained from undertaking extensive pilot activities
around the globe and is something Visa plans to replicate in other places around
the world." 

Maxis - the largest wireless carrier in Malaysia with more than 11 million
subscribers, Nokia - the world`s leading handset manufacturer and Maybank - a
leading financial institution in Malaysia have teamed with Visa to offer Visa
payWave on mobile devices. 

The service, launched today, allows Maybank Visa account holders to simply wave
their NFC-enabled Nokia 6212 classic handset in front of a contactless reader to
complete a secure Visa transaction in a matter of seconds. 

Maybank Visa account holders can download their Visa payWave credit account
details directly to their Nokia 6212 classic handset over the Maxis wireless
network. Once the account has been personalized on the phone, account holders
can then begin to make purchases at any one of the 1,800 merchant outlets that
currently accept Visa payWave in Malaysia. 

The contactless chip embedded in the device will also power a number of
additional functions, including a contactless transit application that enables
Malaysian commuters to pay for charges while using metropolitan transit systems,
bus terminals, highway toll gates and car park facilities at more than 3,000
contactless payment touch points throughout Malaysia. Maxis has branded these
mobile payment services under the name Maxis FastTap. 

Dr Nikolai Dobberstein, Maxis` Senior Vice President of Strategy and New
Businesses said, "Maxis has been a long-standing partner of Visa in Malaysia and
is excited to be the first to market with a commercial Visa payWave service on
mobile devices. Our collaboration with Visa is part of our wider NFC strategy
which includes multiple applications including mass transit, road tolling,
parking, mobile marketing through smart posters and of course retail payment
through Visa payWave. We see this announcement as important not only for
consumers in Malaysia but for the broader financial services and telecom
industries because it serves as a proof point that win-win business models are
possible in mobile commerce." 

Momentum for Visa Mobile Payments Continues to Grow

Visa is driving the convergence of two of the world`s most ubiquitous consumer
products, 1.7 billion Visa cards and 4 billion mobile phones, by bringing its
expertise in payments to the mobile industry. Over the last two years, Visa has
worked closely with mobile network operators, handset manufacturers and
financial institutions, merchants and technology provider to develop and
commercialize mobile payments and related services. 

Recent Visa mobile payment activities include:

* Visa announced last week that it is extending mobile payments to Singapore in
partnership with Citibank Singapore Limited and MobileOne (M1). The Citi M1 Visa
payWave payment trial on mobile devices marks the first program in Singapore
where a mobile device will be used for payments at the point-of-sale.

More than 750 merchant locations across Singapore are participating in the
three-month pilot, which begins in May 2009. Up to 300 selected Citi M1 Visa
Platinum account holders will be invited to join. Participating account holders
will be provided a Nokia 6212 classic, the same NFC-enabled handset used in the
commercial launch in Malaysia. Participating Citi M1 Visa Platinum account
holders will be able to purchase an item at a Visa payWave merchant in Singapore
simply by waving the mobile phone in front of a contactless reader at the point
of sale.

* In Canada, Visa, RBC, and Rogers Wireless have come together for the next
phase of a mobile payment pilot, which will ultimately allow Canadians the
flexibility to make purchases securely at the point of sale with a wave of their
mobile phone. Designed to be a fast and convenient way for customers to pay for
small purchases, pilot participants will be issued specially-equipped mobile
phones that can simply be waved at Visa payWave-enabledcheckout readers at
select retail stores and quick-service restaurants in Toronto`s downtown core.

&lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
U.S. Bank customers familiar with earning miles on Northwest Airlines by using
their WorldPerks Visa cards will have the flexibility to earn points toward free
flights on over 150 airlines with no blackout dates or award ticket redemption
fees with new U.S. Bank FlexPerks Travel Rewards Visa cards. 

U.S. Bank will upgrade current WorldPerks Visa cardholders to new FlexPerks
products beginning in May. When the cardholder`s new FlexPerks card arrives it
will have the same credit card number, so no application is required and
automatic bill payments should continue uninterrupted. Cardholders will receive
a letter with specific details of their transition to FlexPerks. 

FlexPerks Travel Rewards cardholders will earn one FlexPoint for each dollar
spent on their new card. Customers will automatically earn double FlexPoints for
what they spend on gas, groceries or airline purchases - whichever is highest
for the customer during the month. In addition, double points are earned on most
cell phone related charges. Cardholders can redeem as few as 20,000 FlexPoints
for airline tickets on more than 150 airlines, including Northwest and Delta Air
Lines. Each redeemed award ticket will also feature a credit allowance of up to
$20 for possible baggage fees or in-flight food or beverages. FlexPerks
cardholders also have the choice to redeem FlexPoints for gift cards,
merchandise, travel certificates or statement credits. Debit card products will
transition to FlexPerks this summer, enabling cardholders to combine their
FlexPoint earnings from both credit and debit card purchases. Cardholders will
continue to enjoy the universal acceptance that is available to Visa card
customers. 

"U.S. Bank FlexPerks Visa is designed to upgrade our valued WorldPerks Visa
customers to what we truly believe will be the most valuable travel rewards card
in the marketplace," said Cliff Cook, chief marketing officer in U.S. Bank
Retail Payment Solutions. "We had the perfect opportunity to confirm what was
most important to our travel-minded customers and designed a new card program
that gives travelers even more of what they seek: flexibility and value."

&lt;p&gt;LIMA, April 11 (Reuters) - Suspected leftist rebels killed 13 troops in two ambushes in a mountainous region of Peru where security forces are fighting cocaine traffickers, the government said on Saturday. Defense Minister Antero Flores said both attacks took place on Thursday in Ayacucho province, a coca-growing area and the birthplace of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group. Flores told a news conference the rebels used grenades and dynamite to attack army patrols as they passed. In the first attack one soldier was killed, while 12 troops died in a second ambush. The attacks bring to 11 the number of assaults on security services by suspected Shining Path rebels since the start of the year. Peru's government says the Shining Path has all but abandoned its fight from leftist ideological in favor of running drugs in Peru, the world's No. 2 cocaine producer. The rebel group led a nearly two-decade rebellion until its leadership was captured and it collapsed in the early 1990s. But some members of the group are still active, especially in the country's main coca-farming regions. Some government officials have said an upswing in violence stems from eradication efforts and the growing influence of Mexican drug cartels that buy cocaine in Peru. Like his Colombian counterpart, Alvaro Uribe, Peruvian President Alan Garcia receives anti-drug money from the United States and supports programs to eradicate coca fields.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's half-brother has been denied a visa to come back to Britain after he earlier gave a false name to police when accused of an attempted sexual assault, British media reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A database showed that British police arrested Samson Obama, who lives in Kenya, last November after he allegedly tried to sexually assault a young girl, the News of the World said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama gave officers a false identity at the time of his arrest, claiming to be Henry Aloo, the report said. He was fingerprinted but not charged and left Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tried to enter Britain again to visit relatives while on his way to President Obama's inauguration in January but immigration officials barred him, the News of the World said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His details were stored on a new government database of fingerprints and biometric details and this turned up a match when immigration officials checked it in January. The White House was informed, according to the British newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Obama was born in Hawaii to a white American mother and a Kenyan father. He has relatives living in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House had no comment on the reports. However, a White House official said the president had not spoken with Samson in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Samson was granted a visa by the U.S. consulate in Nairobi to attend the inauguration. The president, however, did not see him while he was in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The News of the World said Samson Obama, who manages a mobile phone shop near Nairobi, was believed to have taken a connecting flight to the United States in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sunday Mirror newspaper gave a slightly different account of the story, saying Samson Obama had been allowed to stop over in Britain while on his way to and from the inauguration and was only later refused a British visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Home Office spokeswoman said the ministry did not comment on specific immigration cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Border Agency, responsible for immigration issues, said: "We will oppose the entry of individuals to the UK where we believe their presence is not conducive to the public good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The UK's border controls are among the toughest in the world. All visa applicants are fingerprinted and checked against watchlists. Using this hi-tech system we have detected more than 5,600 attempts to use false identities since December 2007," it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Adrian Croft in London and Ross Colvin in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Wright)&lt;/p&gt;

expand its business in Asia. It will continue to hire
experienced bankers, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are actually in discussions with a few other very
senior people in the market," he said. "Our growth plans are
still on track. 2009 is a tough year, but we feel we can
manage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not reveal how much assets the bank was managing in
Asia. Globally it had 352 billion Swiss francs ($311 billion)
in average assets under management at the end of 2008, down
10.6 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many of Julius Baer's competitors such as UBS (UBSN.VX) and
Citigroup (C.N) have shed staff in Asia as clients stay away
from markets for fear of losses. Societe Generale (SOGN.PA)
last month said it will cut around 10 percent of staff from its
private banking arm in Asia excluding Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a reversal of a trend that peaked two years ago
which saw private banks aggressively poaching bankers from each
other. Years if fast economic growth and buoyant markets have
created more millionaires in Asia than anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have said profit at private banks is falling as
the financial crisis slashed revenues from fees and financial
product sales.

 SEOUL, April 14 (Reuters) - Seoul shares fell on Tuesday
after a firm opening, as both institutions and foreigners booked
profits, but banks rose on stronger-than-expected numbers from
Goldman Sachs (GS.N).

 The Korea Composite Stock Price Index .KS11 (KOSPI) was
down 0.59 percent at 1,330.11 points at 0124 GMT.

 "Stocks are taking a breather as they have risen quite
steeply in a short period," said Lee Kyoung-su, a market analyst
at Taurus Investment  Securities.

 Institutions were sellers of a net 185.5 billion won worth of
shares and foreigners were net sellers of 10.6 billion won as of
0128 GMT.

 "We maintain our view that the main index will rise to around
1,500 points by the end of the second half, as both financial
markets and macroeconomic conditions continue to improve," Lee
said.

 Banking issues rose after surprisingly better-than-expected
quarterly results from Goldman Sachs (GS.N) after the closing
bell. The U.S. investment bank also announced a $5 billion public
offering of common equity. [ID:nN13389368]

 Woori Finance Holdings (053000.KS) rose 2.5 percent and Hana
Financial Group (086790.KS) advanced 0.64 percent.

 Hynix Semiconductor (000660.KS) rose 4.1 percent, helped by
news that Japan has decided to scrap a punitive import tariff on
computer memory chips made by the world's No.2 memory chip maker,
ending a three-year trade spat. [ID:nT40597]

 Korea Plant Service  Engineering (051600.KS) advanced 3.37
percent after it said in its filing to the Korea Exchange that it
had won a domestic order worth 6.27 billion won ($4.74 million).

 Automakers declined across the board following their latest
gains, which for instance have lifted Hyundai Motor (005380.KS)
67 percent so far this year as of Monday's close, compared with
the benchmark index's 19 percent rise.

 Hyundai Motor retreated 2.12 percent and Kia Motors
(000270.KS) lost 1.87 percent.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc may succeed in its bid to pay back U.S. taxpayer money with the help of a $5 billion common share sale, but it may still not get the freedom it wants from intense public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which posted a better-than-expected first-quarter profit and announced the public offering on Monday, has navigated the global financial crisis better than many of its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its share price has more than doubled since hitting a record low in November, and is up more than 50 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it may be allowed to return the $10 billion it took under the U.S. Treasury Department's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which has become a headache for recipients with oversight over compensation, expenses and acquisitions, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But given Goldman's size and importance to the financial system, regulators may still want to keep a close eye on it, said Seamus McMahon, an independent banking and regulatory consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So the question is, even if they are allowed to do it, how much of a victory is this actually ultimately?" McMahon said. "Is it more marketing or does it really give them operating freedom?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dilemma was underlined on Monday when Goldman posted a profit as it took on more trading risk and disclosed it was paying its employees on average in the quarter almost 35 percent more than in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add to regulators' headaches, Goldman's bid to return the money could prompt other banks that are not in as good financial condition to seek to do the same, forcing some difficult policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators would want to be sure that banks that return the money have enough capital. But they would also be concerned if a two-tier market is created, with Goldman, Wells Fargo  Co and some other banks being seen as strong enough to thrive or survive without government help, and others such as Citigroup Inc seen as requiring government nursing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Goldman, others such as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp have signaled their eagerness to pay back the money as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It breaks the ice for somebody big to want to pay it back," said Chip MacDonald, a banking partner at law firm Jones Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department did not have an immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THROWING THE GAUNTLET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has managed to sidestep most of the pitfalls of the financial crisis, having posted just one quarterly loss since the middle of 2007, even as competitors posted four or more quarters of losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selling common stock could further strengthen its stake, as it would boost its tangible common equity (TCE), a key focus for investors in determining the strength of banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TARP funds did not boost the TCE ratios of banks and so Goldman's offering would be seen as a positive, MacDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regulators need to make sure there is adequate capital," MacDonald said. "But I don't know why they would resist a redemption if they feel like there is adequate capital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it would force regulators to make a decision on a tricky subject sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are throwing the gloves down," McMahon said, referring to Goldman. "In a way it's signaling to the government that they are different from the other institutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can understand what Goldman's rush is.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Monday said first-quarter profit rose as the bank's traders generated outsized gains thanks to volatile and less crowded markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, whose earnings healthily beat forecasts, also said it planned to raise $5 billion through a secondary share offering and that it would use the proceeds, plus additional funds, to repay funds accepted last year from the government's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL HOLLAND, HEAD OF NEW YORK INVESTMENT FIRM HOLLAND  CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once again (Goldman) surprised to the upside, and as the quintessential survivor of the Wall Street storms. It's classic Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an important first step in the next part of the journey for these companies, in terms of companies that run their businesses well will continue to separate themselves from those who haven't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL JAMES, SENIOR TRADER AT REGIONAL INVESTMENT BANK WEDBUSH MORGAN IN LOS ANGELES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think just about every metric that they reported was better than what most people's expectations were.

Spreads are humongous and the high volatility has been beneficial to their prop trading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is one of the main drivers of the market, so when things are good, they're like a machine humming on all cylinders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEVE CLAUSSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT ONLINE BROKERAGE FIRM OPTIONSHOUSE IN CHICAGO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is kind of a surprise regarding the timing of the release. The stock had a tremendous run over the past five sessions and even though Goldman's earnings came in quite a bit better than expected, it appears that this is a classic case of buy the rumor and sell the news. In the last two trading sessions, the stock has been up over $15 in total. So perhaps the positive impact of these good earnings was already baked into the price. Goldman option premiums indicated a 10 percent swing in the stock price between now and April expiration on Friday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KENNETH CRAWFORD, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ARGENT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, ST. LOUIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given at least for now the fairly negative view of TARP, if the company can come out of that program sooner than later it would be embraced by the market. Being free and clear to run operations as the company deems fit I think would a positive in the minds of investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEITH WIRTZ, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF FIFTH THIRD ASSET MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman may provide all the other companies with a road map on how to separate from the government. Removing the government from your back is great positive news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The simple fact that they doubled expectations is really great news. It's another sign, another brick on the wall that the financial sector has gone through the worst."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GARY TOWNSEND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF HILL-TOWNSEND CAPITAL IN CHEVY CHASE, MARYLAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are spectacular, it far exceeds any estimate that I'm aware of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It just shows the resiliency of the American financial system. This, combined with the pre-announcement from Wells Fargo on Thursday puts the lie to the whole argument that the U.S. financial system is insolvent and needs to be nationalized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think for them the principal issue is going to be how much of the market they are seizing in the absence of competitors that have fallen by the wayside. What we are seeing here is the competitive advantage that Goldman has, asserting itself as others have disappeared."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, Leah Schnurr, Phil Wahba, Doris Frankel, Paritosh Bansal and Juan Lagorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Paritosh Bansal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) may succeed in its bid to pay back U.S. taxpayer money

 (Adds revenue, compensation details, information about
Lyondell, share movement, background on Wells Fargo and AIG)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Dan Wilchins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) posted much higher-than-expected first-quarter profit as
it took more trading risk, and said it plans a $5 billion
common share sale to help pay back government funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also said it lost $1 billion in December 2008,
mainly due to trading and investment losses. That month was
reported separately and for the first time on Monday as Goldman
and Morgan Stanley have both changed their financial years to
match calendar years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also disclosed that it has set aside $168,901 per
employee on average for compensation in the quarter, almost 35
percent more than in the first quarter of the previous fiscal
year. The figure is likely to raise eyebrows given concerns
expressed by lawmakers and others about excessive compensation
on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results, which were announced a day ahead of schedule,
were seen by many analysts as evidence of Goldman's ability to
sidestep the worst of the financial crisis. It has posted just
one quarterly loss since the middle of 2007, even as
competitors have posted several quarterly losses, or gone out
of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the quarter ended March 27, Goldman reported net income
for common shareholders of $1.66 billion, or $3.39 a share, far
exceeding analysts' average forecast of $1.49 a share,
according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 13 percent to
$9.43 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts said the results, following Wells Fargo 
Co's (WFC.N) surprising announcement last Thursday that it
expects to report a record first-quarter profit, were a sign
the U.S. banking industry is stabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's another sign that the financial sector has gone
through the worst," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief
investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's profit came in part because of strong trading
results in fixed income, currencies and commodities, where the
company posted $6.56 billion of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The earnings do not compare directly with Goldman's fiscal
quarter last year, which ended on Feb. 29, 2008, but in last
year's quarter the bank posted net income for common
shareholders of $1.47 billion, or $3.23 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Multiple U.S. banks have said that low interest rates and
rebounding markets helped them post stronger results in the
first two months of the quarter. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N)
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has said that March was more
difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's shares fell 1.8 percent in after-market trading
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its shares had risen 4.7 percent to $130.15 during the main
trading session and the bank is one of the few whose shares
trade above their accounting value, or book value. Goldman's is
$98.82 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's share price has more than doubled since hitting a
record low in November. It is up more than 50 percent this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A RARE OPPORTUNITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Goldman's report was not all positive. The bank said
its net loss for common shareholders was $1.03 billion in
December, prompting some to question whether the change in
financial years had allowed Goldman to dump much of its bad
news into that one-off period and start afresh in the first
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "December was a rare opportunity for both Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley," said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford
Bernstein. "A single month, without any comparisons that can be
made with any other months, so none of us will ever know what
goes into the month of December. It's one of those rare
opportunities that CFOs dream about." Hintz is a former Lehman
Brothers chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said in January that it recorded a roughly $850
million loss from loans extended to units of chemicals company
LyondellBasell in December, though the units filed for
bankruptcy in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Between the December losses and the subsequent profit,
Goldman's tangible book value per common share was essentially
unchanged from the end of November, at $88.02, the bank said.
Tangible common equity is a measure of the bank's net worth,
ignoring intangible assets such as goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A measure of the bank's trading risk, average daily
value-at-risk, surged to $240 million in the first quarter of
2009, compared with $157 million for the three months ended
Feb. 28, 2008, implying that the bank took more trading risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Value-at-risk represents the estimated maximum possible
trading loss on 95 percent of the days in the quarter, and it
could have risen because the bank did not pare down existing
positions even as markets grew riskier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The increase in risk may raise concerns given the current
drive by the U.S. and other governments to reduce risks in the
financial sector. Many say that banks had to be bailed out
because they took on too much risk in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial markets grew increasingly turbulent after the
demise of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. American
International Group (AIG.N) was rescued by the government soon
after. AIG has given $12.9 billion in payments and collateral
to Goldman since last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it planned to use the proceeds of its share
offering plus additional funds to repay the $10 billion of
capital it received from the U.S. government under the Troubled
Asset Relief Program. The bank said it would pay back the funds
after the bank is stress tested by regulators and if the
authorities allow it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has been vocal about its preference to repay TARP
money as soon as possible. In February, Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar said the bank is looking to avoid the restrictions
that come with TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would like to get out from under that," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later in February, U.S. President Barack Obama signed a law
that placed limits on executive compensation for TARP
recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have said that the government may be reluctant to
allow banks to repay TARP until all are ready to repay it, to
prevent any institutions unwilling or unable to return the
capital from being singled out as weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs employees have traditionally been among the
highest paid on Wall Street. If Goldman continues to pay
employees as much as it did in the first quarter, the average
employee will receive more than $675,000 for 2009. In 2007, per
capita personal income in the United States was $38,611,
according to the United States Census.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the
matter, reported late Monday that 953 Goldman employees, or
nearly 1 in 30, were paid more than $1 million a year last
year.

&lt;p&gt; TOKYO, April 14 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei stock average is
likely to rise on Tuesday, with financial shares seen higher,
after optimism about earnings in the U.S. banking and finance
sector helped push up Wall Street.

 Goldman Sachs (GS.N) surprised investors after the close on
Monday by posting stronger-than-expected quarterly results a day
early, and announced a $5 billion public offering of common
equity. [ID:nN13387020]

 Tokyo banking stocks will also be in focus after sources said
Citigroup Inc (C.N) has told potential buyers of its Japanese
retail brokerage arm that it may also be willing to sell its
Japanese investment banking and asset management operations.

 In February, Citigroup's efforts to sell Nikko Cordial drew
interest from Japan's top three banks: Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group (8306.T), Mizuho Financial Group (8411.T) and Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T). [ID:nN13342726]

 Investors will also look at Sumitomo Metal Industries
5405.T after the Nikkei business daily said the steelmaker is
considering setting up a blast furnace steelmaking joint venture
in India with midtier local producer Bhushan Steel Ltd.

 "The Nikkei will likely try the 9,000 level, with investors
encouraged by a strong performance of financial shares in the
U.S. market and Goldman Sachs's earnings results," said Kazuhiro
Takahashi, general manager at Daiwa Securities SMBC.

 "Although the market will be solid, further gains may be
limited as investors are still trying to find out whether risks
towards the financial sector could be further reduced."

 Nikkei futures traded in Chicago 2NKc1 closed at 9,020 on
Monday, 130 points above the Osaka close 0#JNI:, pointing to a
higher opening.

 Market participants expect the benchmark Nikkei .N225 to
move between 8,800 and 9,100 on Tuesday. It fell 0.4 percent the
previous day to end at 8,924.43.

 Investors closely watch U.S. bank results due this week, with
JPMorgan (JPM.N) set to report results on Thursday and Citigroup
(C.N) on Friday. [RESF/US]

 -- Aeon Co Ltd (8267.T)

 Its unit Talbots Inc's TLB.N posted a deeper-than-expected
quarterly loss and offered staid sales projections, which sent

news of a new $150 million loan facility that the women's apparel
retailer says will boost liquidity. [ID:nN13388016]

open about 500 small convenience store-sized supermarkets in the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) posted higher-than-expected first-quarter profit as it took more trading risk and said it planned to raise $5 billion of common shares to help pay back government funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank also said it lost $1 billion in December 2008, mainly due to trading and investment losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank has managed to sidestep most of the worst of the financial crisis, having posted just one quarterly loss since the middle of 2007, even as competitors posted four or more quarters of losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the quarter ended March 27, Goldman reported net income for common shareholders of $1.66 billion, or $3.39 a share, far exceeding analysts' average forecast of $1.49 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's income came in part because of strong client trading activity in fixed income, currencies and commodities, where the company posted $6.56 billion of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some analysts, the results are a clear positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's another sign that the financial sector has gone through the worst," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results do not compare directly with Goldman's fiscal quarter last year, which ended on February 29, 2008, but in last year's quarter the bank posted net income for common shareholders of $1.47 billion, or $3.23 a share.

"A single month, without any comparisons that can be made with any other months, so none of us will ever know what goes into the month of December. It's one of those rare opportunities that CFOs dream about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between the December losses and the subsequent profit, Goldman's tangible book value per common share was essentially unchanged from the end of November, at $88.02, the bank said. Tangible common equity is a measure of the bank's net worth, ignoring intangible assets such as goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A measure of the bank's trading risk, average daily value-at-risk, surged to $240 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared with $157 million for the three months ended February 28, 2008.

 (Recasts with Goldman results; adds U.S. market close)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By John O'Callaghan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, April 13 (Reuters) - U.S. efforts to stimulate
the economy with infrastructure projects are "ahead of schedule
and under budget," President Barack Obama said on Monday, while
Goldman Sachs' earnings offered hope of a recovery in banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is cheering, not so much that the banks are on
the mend but that they are not going to die," said Les Satlow,
portfolio manager of Cabot Money Management in Salem,
Massachusetts. "My view is that a key crisis phase of this
economic downturn is behind us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obama will give a "major" speech on the economy on Tuesday,
the White House said. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is
also due to speak about the financial crisis on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the closing bell, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) beat forecasts
by posting first-quarter earnings of $1.66 billion, helped by
strong trading revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it planned to raise $5 billion of common
shares and use the proceeds, plus additional funds, to repay
the $10 billion of capital it got from the U.S. government
under the Troubled Assets Relief Program. [nN13387020]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the encouraging U.S. developments, data from China,
Japan and India offered mixed signals as investors and analysts
remained concerned about how quickly the global economy can
bounce back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further evidence of the state of the U.S. economy will come
this week with retail sales, housing and industrial production
data. But some analysts see little hope of a meaningful
rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm still very pessimistic about the prospects of any
enduring recovery," said T.J. Marta, chief market strategist at
Marta on the Markets, in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE G7 MEETINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seeking a concerted escape from the worst crisis since the
Great Depression, finance ministers from the Group of Seven
leading nations will meet in Washington on April 24 and follow
that with a Group of 20 ministerial session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will host both
meetings, which come just weeks after the G20 leaders' summit
in London and before semi-annual gatherings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank. [nN13374603].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The G20 has agreed on a $1.1 trillion deal to fight the
crisis, including a huge infusion of funds for the IMF. But
differences persist over what steps should be taken to rebuild
the financial sector, free up lending and boost economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a key part of Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan, the
United States is embarking on thousands of major infrastructure
projects to create jobs and shore up highways, bridges and mass
transit systems. [nN13376942]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This government effort is coming in ahead of schedule and
under budget," said Obama, who has also pushed tax cuts and
reforms of the healthcare and energy sectors. "It is now clear
that day by day, project by project, we are making progress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A jump in China's industrial output last month, along with
a record rise in new lending, lent credence to the idea that
the bottom of the crisis may not be far away and lifted the
Chinese yuan CNY= and stocks in Shanghai. [nSP469226]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But data showing a big fall in Japanese wholesale prices
suggested the world's second-largest economy is sliding back
toward deflation. [nT344226]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In India, a huge emerging market, the effects of the global
downturn slowed economic growth to just below 7 percent in the
2008/09 fiscal year that ended in March, Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh said. [nDEL472815]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANKS CHEER U.S. INVESTORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stocks [.N] cut losses, with the SP 500 .SPX and

percent after Boeing (BA.N) gave a gloomy profit forecast and
slashed production, reviving investor worries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market was also weighing a report that the Treasury has
told General Motors (GM.N) to prepare for a fast "surgical"
bankruptcy if GM fails to reach agreement with bondholders to
exchange about $28 billion in debt into equity and with the
auto workers union on concessions. [nN12356870]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM shares fell more than 16 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As GM rival Chrysler [CBS.UL] races to complete a

appetite for risk eroded the safe-haven appeal of the U.S. and
Japanese currencies. U.S. government bond prices rose as the
Fed stepped up purchases of Treasury and agency debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China is planning a new economic stimulus package to boost

senior official of the State Information Center. [nSHA22356]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But an adviser to China's central bank said the economy was

optimistic." [nPEK394] [nPEK43527]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Japan, the economic situation remained bleak. With

Japan has limited weapons to hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If prices continue to slide, the BOJ may need to expand
its government bond buying and move toward quantitative
easing," said Norihiro Fujito, general manager at Mitsubishi

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon CEO total pay up 34 pct&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron CEO total pay off 39 pct
 (Recasts first paragraph, adds details from Chevron SEC
filing, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, April 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
Chief Executive Rex Tillerson's total compensation rose 34
percent in 2008 while the head of its largest U.S. rival
Chevron Corp (CVX.N) saw his total pay fall 39 percent,
according to regulatory documents filed on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil companies experienced a roller-coaster year in 2008.
Crude oil peaked over $147 a barrel in July before the global
recession hit demand and knocked prices down to about $40 per
barrel at year's end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson's total compensation was valued at $22.4 million
in 2008, up from $16.7 million in 2007. That tally includes
salary, bonus, the value of stock awards and change in pension
values and deferred compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson's bonus rose 19 percent to $4 million and his
stock awards increased to $7.8 million from $5.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's chief was also granted $17.6 million in restricted
stock awards in 2008, according to the proxy filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's board of directors also gave Tillerson an 10
percent salary increase for 2009. His pay will now be $2.06
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total compensation for David O'Reilly, the CEO of Chevron
fell to $19.3 million from $31.54 million a year ago. A sharp
drop in 2008 stock awards accounted for the bulk of the steep
decline, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. public companies are required to disclose the total
value of annual pay awards to top executives under U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The reported figures
may differ from how executive pay consultants and others
tabulate an executive's annual compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. oil major Exxon reported record net income of $45.2
billion in 2008, but its shares fell 15 percent alongside a
steep decline in the price of oil. Still, shares of the Irving,
Texas company outperformed an 33 percent drop in the Chicago
Board Options Exchange index of oil companies .OIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the year, Chevron shares fell 21 percent.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Goldman letter on fund's performance)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) on Monday said first-quarter profit rose as the bank's traders generated outsized gains thanks to volatile and less crowded markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, whose earnings healthily beat forecasts, also said it planned to raise $5 billion through a secondary share offering and that it would use the proceeds, plus additional funds, to repay funds accepted last year from the government's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL HOLLAND, HEAD OF NEW YORK INVESTMENT FIRM HOLLAND  CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once again (Goldman) surprised to the upside, and as the quintessential survivor of the Wall Street storms. It's classic Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an important first step in the next part of the journey for these companies, in terms of companies that run their businesses well will continue to separate themselves from those who haven't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL JAMES, SENIOR TRADER AT REGIONAL INVESTMENT BANK WEDBUSH MORGAN IN LOS ANGELES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think just about every metric that they reported was better than what most people's expectations were. The key thing for investors now is how is the stock going to trade tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously the expectations were pretty high going into it, they delivered a pretty solid quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it was a surprise that they announcened a secondary offering, there was some talk of that on Friday in The Wall Street Journal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People weren't necessarily concerned that they would report a good number, it's just a matter of what the guidance looks like, which we haven't seen yet, and how the stock price reacts tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MATT MCCORMICK, BANKING ANALYST  PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BAHL  GAYNOR, INVESTMENT COUNSEL, CINCINNATI, OHIO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The volatility and market swings have been very profitable for Goldman -- they have been the chief beneficiary of this market snapback. Spreads are humongous and the high volatility has been beneficial to their prop trading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is one of the main drivers of the market, so when things are good, they're like a machine humming on all cylinders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEVE CLAUSSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT ONLINE BROKERAGE FIRM OPTIONSHOUSE IN CHICAGO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is kind of a surprise regarding the timing of the release. The stock had a tremendous run over the past five sessions and even though Goldman's earnings came in quite a bit better than expected, it appears that this is a classic case of buy the rumor and sell the news. In the last two trading sessions, the stock has been up over $15 in total. So perhaps the positive impact of these good earnings was already baked into the price. Goldman option premiums indicated a 10 percent swing in the stock price between now and April expiration on Friday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KENNETH CRAWFORD, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ARGENT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, ST. LOUIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given at least for now the fairly negative view of TARP, if the company can come out of that program sooner than later it would be embraced by the market. Being free and clear to run operations as the company deems fit I think would a positive in the minds of investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEITH WIRTZ, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF FIFTH THIRD ASSET MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman may provide all the other companies with a road map on how to separate from the government. Removing the government from your back is great positive news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The simple fact that they doubled expectations is really great news. It's another sign, another brick on the wall that the financial sector has gone through the worst."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GARY TOWNSEND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF HILL-TOWNSEND CAPITAL IN CHEVY CHASE, MARYLAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are spectacular, it far exceeds any estimate that I'm aware of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It just shows the resiliency of the American financial system. This, combined with the pre-announcement from Wells Fargo on Thursday puts the lie to the whole argument that the U.S. financial system is insolvent and needs to be nationalized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think for them the principal issue is going to be how much of the market they are seizing in the absence of competitors that have fallen by the wayside. What we are seeing here is the competitive advantage that Goldman has, asserting itself as others have disappeared."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, Leah Schnurr, Phil Wahba, Doris Frankel, Paritosh Bansal and Juan Lagorio)&lt;/p&gt;

$4.97 for the fourth quarter ended November 28, 2008. Annualized return on
average common shareholders` equity (1) was 14.3% for the first quarter of 2009.

the calendar year-to-date. (2)

revenues of $6.56 billion, 34% higher than its previous record, reflecting
strength across most businesses, including record results in interest rate
products and commodities. 
* The firm`s Tier 1 Ratio under Basel II (3) was 16.0% at the end of the first
quarter of 2009, up from 15.6% as of November 28, 2008. The firm`s Tier 1 Ratio

        was 13.7% at the end of the first quarter of 2009.

______________ 

"Given the difficult market conditions, we are pleased with this quarter's
performance," said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
"Our results reflect the strength and diversity of our client franchise, the
resilience of our business model and the dedication and focus of our people. We
believe these attributes position the firm to continue to create value for our
clients and actively fulfill our role in the capital markets." 

Net Revenues

Investment Banking

Net revenues in Investment Banking were $823 million, 30% lower than the first
quarter of 2008 and 20% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. 

Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $527 million, 21% lower than the first
quarter of 2008, reflecting lower levels of deal activity. Net revenues in the
firm`s Underwriting business were $296 million, 42% lower than the first quarter
of 2008. Net revenues in equity underwriting were significantly lower, primarily
reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide equity and equity-related
offerings. Net revenues in debt underwriting were also significantly lower,
primarily due to a decline in leveraged finance activity. The firm`s investment
banking transaction backlog decreased from the end of fiscal year 2008. (5)

Trading and Principal Investments

Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $7.15 billion, compared
with net revenues of $5.12 billion for the first quarter of 2008 and negative
net revenues of $4.36 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. 

Net revenues in FICC were $6.56 billion, more than double the amount in the
first quarter of 2008. These results reflected particularly strong performance
in interest rate products, commodities and credit products, as FICC operated in
a generally favorable environment characterized by client-driven activity,
particularly in more liquid products, and high levels of volatility. However,
illiquid assets generally continued to decline in value. Net revenues in
currencies were solid, but lower compared with a particularly strong first
quarter of 2008. Results in mortgages were higher compared with a difficult
first quarter of 2008. During the quarter, credit products included losses from
corporate debt and private equity investments, and mortgages included a loss of
approximately $800 million (excluding hedges) on commercial mortgage loans and
securities. In the first quarter of 2008, credit products included a loss of
approximately $1 billion, net of hedges, related to non-investment-grade credit
origination activities, and mortgages included a net loss of approximately $1
billion on residential mortgage loans and securities. 

Net revenues in Equities were $2.00 billion, 20% lower than the first quarter of
2008. Net revenues in the shares business were lower compared with the first
quarter of 2008 due to lower commissions, primarily reflecting lower levels of
activity outside of the U.S. Net revenues in derivatives were solid, but lower
compared with the first quarter of 2008. Results in principal strategies were
also lower compared with the first quarter of 2008. During the quarter, Equities
operated in an environment generally characterized by continued weakness in
global equity markets and high, but declining, levels of volatility. 

Principal Investments recorded a net loss of $1.41 billion for the first quarter
of 2009. These results included net losses of $640 million from real estate
principal investments and $621 million from corporate principal investments, as
well as a $151 million loss related to the firm`s investment in the ordinary
shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC). 

Asset Management and Securities Services

Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.45 billion, 29%
lower than the first quarter of 2008 and 17% lower than the fourth quarter of
2008. 

Asset Management net revenues were $949 million, 28% lower than the first
quarter of 2008, due to lower management and other fees, reflecting lower assets
under management, principally due to market depreciation, and lower incentive
fees. During the quarter, assets under management decreased $27 billion to $771
billion (6), due to $16 billion of market depreciation, primarily in equity
assets, and $11 billion of net outflows. 

Securities Services net revenues were $503 million, 30% lower than the first
quarter of 2008. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflected the impact of
lower customer balances compared with the first quarter of 2008. 

Expenses

Operating expenses were $6.80 billion, 10% higher than the first quarter of
2008. 

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, discretionary
compensation, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as
payroll taxes, severance costs and benefits) were $4.71 billion, 18% higher than
the first quarter of 2008, primarily due to higher net revenues. The ratio of
compensation and benefits to net revenues was 50.0%, compared with 48.0% for the
first quarter of 2008. Employment levels decreased 7% compared with the end of
fiscal year 2008. 

Non-Compensation Expenses

Non-compensation expenses, excluding consolidated entities held for investment
purposes (7), were $1.62 billion, 21% lower than the first quarter of 2008 and
25% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. More than one-half of the decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2008 was attributable to lower brokerage,
clearing, exchange and distribution fees, principally reflecting lower
transaction volumes in Equities. The remainder of the decrease compared with the
first quarter of 2008 generally reflected lower levels of business activity, the
impact of reduced employment levels and the effect of expense reduction
initiatives. The increase in non-compensation expenses related to consolidated
entities held for investment purposes primarily reflected impairment charges of
approximately $300 million related to real estate assets during the first
quarter of 2009. Including consolidated entities held for investment purposes,
non-compensation expenses were $2.08 billion, 5% lower than the first quarter of
2008 and 17% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. 

Provision for Taxes

The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2009 was 31.0%, up from
approximately 1% for fiscal year 2008 and 29.5% for the first quarter of 2008.
The increases in the effective tax rate were primarily due to changes in
geographic earnings mix. 

Capital

As of March 27, 2009, total capital was $252.08 billion, consisting of $63.55
billion in total shareholders` equity (common shareholders` equity of $47.05
billion and preferred stock of $16.51 billion) and $188.53 billion in unsecured
long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $98.82 and tangible book
value per common share (8) was $88.02, both essentially unchanged from November
28, 2008. Book value and tangible book value per common share are based on
common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees
with no future service requirements, of 476.1 million at period end. 

Under the capital guidelines applicable to the firm when it was regulated by the
SEC as a Consolidated Supervised Entity, the firm`s Tier 1 Ratio under Basel II
(3) was 16.0% as of March 27, 2009. Under the regulatory capital guidelines
currently applicable to bank holding companies, the firm`s Tier 1 Ratio under
Basel I (3) was 13.7% as of March 27, 2009. 

Other Balance Sheet and Liquidity Metrics

* Total assets (9) were $925 billion as of March 27, 2009, up 5% from November
28, 2008. 
* Level 3 assets (10) were approximately $59 billion as of March 27, 2009 (down
from $66 billion as of November 28, 2008) and represented 6.4% of total assets. 
* Average global core excess (4) liquidity was $163.74 billion for the first
quarter of 2009, up from $111.43 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the
firm`s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are
inherently uncertain and outside of the firm`s control. It is possible that the
firm`s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially,
from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these
forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important
factors that could affect the firm`s future results and financial condition, see
"Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm`s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 and "Management`s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of
the firm`s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28,
2008. 

Certain of the information regarding the firm`s Tier 1 Ratios, risk-weighted
assets, total assets, level 3 assets and average global core excess liquidity
consist of preliminary estimates; these estimates are forward-looking statements
and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its
quarterly financial statements. 

Statements about the firm`s investment banking transaction backlog also may
constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk
that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be
completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually
earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those
currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the
terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case
of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general
economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities
markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the
securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the
securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse
development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a
required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that
could adversely affect the firm`s investment banking transactions, see "Risk
Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm`s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 and "Management`s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm`s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008.

          immediate           
          obligations without 
          the need to sell

          funding from credit 
          -sensitive markets

 (5)      The firm`s          
          investment banking  
          transaction backlog 
          represents an       
          estimate of the     
          firm`s future net   
          revenues from       
          investment banking  
          transactions where  
          management believes 
          that future revenue 
          realization is more 
          likely than not.    
                              
 (6)      Excludes the federal 
          agency pass-through 
          mortgage-backed     
          securities account  
          managed for the     
          Federal Reserve.    
                              
 (7)      Consolidated        
          entities held for   
          investment purposes 
          are entities that   
          are held strictly   
          for capital         
          appreciation, have a 
          defined exit        
          strategy and are    
          engaged in          
          activities that are 
          not closely related 
          to the firm's       
          principal           
          businesses. For     
          example, these      
          investments include 
          consolidated        
          entities that hold  
          real estate assets, 
          such as hotels, but 
          exclude investments 
          in entities that    
          primarily hold      
          financial assets.   
          Management believes 
          that it is          
          meaningful to review 
          non-compensation    
          expenses excluding  
          expenses related to 
          these consolidated  
          entities in order to 
          evaluate trends in  
          non-compensation    
          expenses related to 
          the firm's principal 
          business activities. 
                              
 (8)      Tangible common     
          shareholders' equity 
          equals total        
          shareholders' equity 
          less preferred      
          stock, goodwill and 
          identifiable        
          intangible assets.  
          Tangible book value 
          per common share is 
          computed by dividing 
          tangible common     
          shareholders` equity 
          by the number of    
          common shares       
          outstanding,        
          including restricted 
          stock units granted 
          to employees with no 
          future service      
          requirements.       
          Management believes 
          that tangible common 
          shareholders` equity 
          is meaningful       
          because it is one of 
          the measures that   
          the firm and        
          investors use to    
          assess capital      
          adequacy. The       
          following table sets 
          forth a             
          reconciliation of   
          total shareholders' 
          equity to tangible  
          common shareholders' 
          equity:

 (10)    SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value  
         Measurements," establishes 
         a fair value hierarchy that 
         prioritizes the inputs to  
         valuation techniques used  
         to measure fair value. The 
         hierarchy gives the highest 
         priority to unadjusted     
         quoted prices in active    
         markets for identical      
         assets or liabilities      
         (level 1 measurements) and 
         the lowest priority to     
         unobservable inputs (level 
         3 measurements). Level 3   
         assets reflect prices or   
         valuations that require    
         inputs that are both       
         significant to the fair    
         value measurement and      
         unobservable. For a further 
         discussion of the firm's   
         level 3 assets, see

         Annual Report on Form 10-K 
         for the fiscal year ended  
         November 28, 2008. This    
         amount represents a

         December 26, 2008, and     
         three months ended November

 (12)    VaR is the potential loss  
         in value of Goldman Sachs` 
         trading positions due to   
         adverse market movements   
         over a one-day time horizon 
         with a 95% confidence      
         level. The modeling of the 
         risk characteristics of the 
         firm`s trading positions   
         involves a number of       
         assumptions and            
         approximations. While      
         management believes that   
         these assumptions and      
         approximations are         
         reasonable, there is no    
         standard methodology for   
         estimating VaR, and        
         different assumptions      
         and/or approximations could 
         produce materially         
         different VaR estimates.   
         For a further discussion of 
         the calculation of VaR, see 
         Part II, Item 7A           
         "Quantitative and          
         Qualitative Disclosures    
         About Market Risk" in the  
         firm`s Annual Report on    
         Form 10-K for the fiscal   
         year ended November 28,    
         2008.                      
                                      
 (13)    Equals the difference      
         between total VaR and the  
         sum of the VaRs for the    
         four risk categories. This 
         effect arises because the  
         four market risk categories 
         are not perfectly          
         correlated.                
                                      
 (14)    Substantially all assets

         The fair value of the      
         investment in the ordinary 
         shares of ICBC, which trade 
         on The Stock Exchange of   
         Hong Kong, includes the    
         effect of foreign exchange 
         revaluation for which the  
         firm maintains an economic 
         currency hedge. During the 
         quarter ended March 27,    
         2009, the firm committed to 
         supplemental transfer      
         restrictions in relation to 
         its investment in ICBC.    
         Under the prior transfer   
         restrictions, the ICBC     
         shares held by the firm    
         would have become free from 
         transfer restrictions in   
         equal installments on April 
         28, 2009 and October 20,   
         2009. Under the new        
         transfer restrictions, the

         effective for fiscal years

         equivalents to be treated  
         as a separate class of

         per common share for the   
         one month ended December   
         26, 2008 was computed in   
         accordance with the FSP and 
         the impact was a loss per

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) on
Monday confirmed natural gas production from the Sable Offshore
Energy Project in Nova Scotia had returned following an
operational incident last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Just confirming that we're back in production. There was a
mechanical repair required and we did that repair over the
weekend," said Exxon spokesman Merle MacIsaac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MacIsaac said normal production from the facility, about
400 million cubic feet per day, could continue to be affected
on any given day by some ongoing planned maintenance work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spectra Energy (SE.N) units Maritimes Canada and Maritimes

&lt;p&gt;  STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN, Apr 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The world's most talented and creative students of computer science and
engineering will gather in Stockholm, Sweden on April 21 for what is
affectionately known as the "Battle of the Brains," organized by the
Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), sponsored by IBM (NYSE: IBM) and
hosted by KTH Royal Institute of Technology (KTH).

    The 33rd World Finals of the ACM International Collegiate Programming
Contest (ICPC) brings together the top 100 three-person teams from
universities around the globe to build systems to solve a dozen problems
modeled after  real-world business challenges such as cracking complex
password codes or re-architecting space plans. These problems are
designed to challenge the students' problem-solving savvy and business
acumen -- key skills sought after by global employers in the new
information technology (IT) workforce.

    Limited to only five hours, the teams need to exercise skills in a contest
equal to a semester's worth of curriculum. The team that solves the most
problems correctly in the least time will emerge as champions, earning
scholarships, bragging rights and prizes from IBM, and greater visibility
with potential employers like IBM itself.

    "Our world gets smaller every day, requiring a highly-skilled,
interconnected workforce with the flexibility to span time zones and
cultures," said Doug Heintzman, Director of Strategy at IBM Software
Group, and ICPC Sponsorship Executive. "The ICPC helps students enhance
their critical thinking, problem solving and collaboration skills, while
at the same time helping them embrace their roles as future global
leaders."

    To enhance the learning experience for ICPC participants, IBM has
organized numerous opportunities for the students to learn about how
technology is helping the world become more interconnected, instrumented
and intelligent. Through technology demonstrations, seminars and
collaboration with IBM's leading researchers, students will learn about
running a smart city with automated technologies to reduce a city's
traffic congestion and emission through road usage tolls, predicting and
preventing service failures in railcars and other vehicles, managing drug
diversion and theft, tracking food to ensure its safety and freshness,
and the intersections between technology and creating a smarter planet.

    More than 7,109 teams representing 1,838 universities from 88 countries
competed in the fall Regionals competition this year, compared to 840
teams in 1997 when IBM first sponsored the competition. St. Petersburg
University of Information Technology, Mechanics &amp; Optics, the 2008 World
Finals champions, will return to the 2009 Finals. To view the full list
of teams, visit the ICPC website.

    "A decade ago, the ICPC was international. Today, we are global. The IBM
folks will do that to you," said ICPC Executive Director and Baylor
University Professor, Dr. Bill Poucher. "Doug will be the first to tell
you it's about the students. There is no question that they are talented.
But, it takes more than that to be a World Finalist in the ICPC. It takes
focus, dedication, and zest to take on a world-class challenge. It's the
same in business. You want a smarter planet? You help make it happen.
That's a whole lot easier when you team with ACM, the world's first
scientific and educational IT society, and IBM, the first in everything
else."

    IBM's sponsorship in cooperation with leading IT Society ACM, ICPC World
Headquarters at Baylor University, and 2009 World Finals Host KTH Royal
Institute of Technology is just one of the company's many
university-focused programs concentrating on open standards skills. For
example, the IBM Academic Initiative offers colleges and universities a
wide range of technology benefits including free access to IBM software,
discounted hardware, course materials, training and curriculum
development to better educate millions of students for a more competitive
IT workforce.

    In addition, during IBM's Extreme Blue global internship program, interns
develop technology-based business plans for new products or services that
address existing market challenges. Since 1999, more than 360 patent
disclosures have been submitted from the Extreme Blue participants
worldwide. Underscoring the high caliber of IBM's internship program
participants, to date 31 of the United States applicants to Extreme Blue
have identified themselves as ICPC contestants.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Apr 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it is collaborating with more than
250 universities in 50 countries that are offering courses or degree
programs in Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME). SSME is a
new academic discipline designed to produce students with the combined
business and technology skills needed to enter today's workforce ready to
contribute immediately to their countries' economic and innovation
agendas.

    As the world becomes more instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent,
customers are being served through complex systems that require new
problem solving and communication skills in the global workforce. SSME
educates people about these complex systems and networks that serve
customers better, creating what IBM calls a smarter planet -- building a
smarter healthcare system, smart grids and smarter cities. Beyond teaching
technology and businesses courses with factory floor examples, SSME
programs focus on many complex service systems, such as healthcare and
transportation networks.

    Governments from 18 nations, including Germany and Japan, have responded
to the call for prioritizing and providing funding for service research
and curricula. "Service Science is not just a powerful way to provide
better service offerings at less cost, it also provides insights into
human behavior that can be used for the greater good of mankind," said Jim
Whelan, program manager, Industrial Development Agency of Ireland.

    "IBM has been working with universities and other industry organizations
to identify the skills needed in this ever-changing world economy," said
Jai Menon, vice president of technical strategy and university programs,
IBM. "We're finding that a combined education in business, technology,
and social sciences is the right education needed for students to have
the baseline of skills for innovation. The rapid expansion of SSME has
been exciting to see, in emerging markets from Vietnam to India, to
established economies like the U.S. and Germany."

    SSME has spread to 250 universities in 50 countries on six continents
offering degree programs and specific courses. Some examples include:


--  The University of Pavia, Italy, has a Service Engineering Master's
degree, including a course focused on helping the re-engineering of the
Italian health system, in order to make it more efficient and more
innovative. Students are developing their final thesis and dissertation in
cooperation with Maugeri Hospital. 

--  Vietnam National University has an IT Services Management program.


--  University of Bahcesehir in Turkey has a dual SSME Master's program
jointly with Northeastern University in Massachusetts. 

--  University of Pretoria in South Africa is creating an SSME program.


--  Universidad del Salvador in Argentina offers a Master's degree in
Global Services Management. 

--  Bond University in Queensland, Australia offers a Master's degree in
Service Management. 


    
Many universities in the United States have SSME programs and research
centers; some examples include:


--  North Carolina State University has an SSME concentration in their MBA
and Masters of Engineering programs.

--  University of Maryland Smith School of Business has two centers that
involve SSME, the Center for Excellence in Service and the Center for
Complexity in Business.

--  University of Washington has a Global Integrated Systems Engineering
program.

--  Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey offers a Master of
Information Systems degree.

--  Missouri State University offers a Bachelor's degree in IT Service
Management.


    
"Service science improves the quality and productivity of at least
three quarters of the economy," said Dr. Cheng Hsu, Professor of Decision
Sciences and Engineering Systems and Professor, Information Technology,
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. "More importantly, service science
propels new and sustainable value creation for a digitally connected
world, which may provide the next great opportunities for the global
economy."

    There also has been an industry-wide call that has ratified the need for
Service Science-related skills. Organizations calling for a curricula
change include the Service Research and Innovation Initiative (SRII), the
Technology Professional Services Association (TPSA), the Service and
Support Professionals Association (SSPA), the Association for Services
Management International (ASMI), and the Center for Innovation Management
Studies.

    "Service businesses are the fastest growing part of the global technology
industry. Yet most companies struggle to make service investments that
lead to strategic outcomes or real innovation," said J.B. Wood, president
and CEO of the TPSA, SSPA, and ASMI. "We understand how to do product
research and development but not service research and development. What's
missing is the toolbox for companies to apply classic research techniques
and disciplines to this important market. Service science is that
toolbox."

    "Xerox, IBM and other SSME partners have realized that to enhance our
skills base we need to embrace the emerging field of service science,"
said Dr. Santokh Badesha, Xerox Fellow and Manager, Open Innovation, Xerox
Innovation Group. "We see great value in the SSME initiative for this
reason and have been actively participating to expand its scope. Our
Services Innovation @ Xerox initiative needs increased service science
skills for the services business. We are trying to help expand SSME
partnership within and across our industry and academia which will allow
us to effect this change in the fastest possible manner."

    In support of service research, service innovation, and SSME, there are
now 27 SSME research innovation centers at universities around the world.
These centers offer practical experience and industry participation to
interdisciplinary teams of university researchers. IBM also advises on
student competitions that improve service systems to create a smarter
planet, as well as sponsors award programs for both students and faculty,
around SSME.

Initiative is available at www.ibm.com/press/university.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - The chief executives of Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc met last week to discuss potential partnerships between the companies' Internet search and advertising operations, the technology blog All Things Digital reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide-ranging talks have taken place between executives at the companies, the blog reported, including discussion of the potential for Microsoft to handle Yahoo's search advertising business, and for Yahoo to combine and run the two companies' display advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo declined to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectation that the two technology giants would enter negotiations over Yahoo's search business has been rising since Yahoo's new CEO, Carol Bartz, took the reins in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She succeeded Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, who beat back Microsoft's effort to buy all of Yahoo last year for $47.5 billion, which soured relationships between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft wanted to buy Yahoo chiefly to combat Google Inc's dominance in the Internet search arena, and CEO Steve Ballmer has made it clear he would still like to do some sort of deal in that area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unless I'm fooling myself, over time I would expect there's a good opportunity for a deal," Ballmer told a media conference in New York last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's half-brother has been denied a visa to come back to Britain after he earlier gave a false name to police when accused of an attempted sexual assault, British media reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A database showed that British police arrested Samson Obama, who lives in Kenya, last November after he allegedly tried to sexually assault a young girl, the News of the World said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama gave officers a false identity at the time of his arrest, claiming to be Henry Aloo, the report said. He was fingerprinted but not charged and left Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tried to enter Britain again to visit relatives while on his way to President Obama's inauguration in January but immigration officials barred him, the News of the World said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His details were stored on a new government database of fingerprints and biometric details and this turned up a match when immigration officials checked it in January. The White House was informed, according to the British newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Obama was born in Hawaii to a white American mother and a Kenyan father. He has relatives living in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House had no comment on the reports. However, a White House official said the president had not spoken with Samson in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Samson was granted a visa by the U.S. consulate in Nairobi to attend the inauguration. The president, however, did not see him while he was in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The News of the World said Samson Obama, who manages a mobile phone shop near Nairobi, was believed to have taken a connecting flight to the United States in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sunday Mirror newspaper gave a slightly different account of the story, saying Samson Obama had been allowed to stop over in Britain while on his way to and from the inauguration and was only later refused a British visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Home Office spokeswoman said the ministry did not comment on specific immigration cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Border Agency, responsible for immigration issues, said: "We will oppose the entry of individuals to the UK where we believe their presence is not conducive to the public good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The UK's border controls are among the toughest in the world. All visa applicants are fingerprinted and checked against watchlists.

&lt;p&gt;  BANGALORE, INDIA, Apr 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has signed a 10-year information
technology (IT) outsourcing agreement with Kurmanchal Nagar Sahakari Bank
Ltd, one of the leading urban co-operative banks in the state of
Uttarakhand in India. As part of the agreement, IBM will remotely host
and manage the IT infrastructure, manage the disaster recovery site and
provide the networking infrastructure for the bank. This will help the
bank focus on its aggressive expansion plans while reducing its capital
expenditure on IT by as much as 60%.

    Signed in 1Q 2009, this agreement is first-of-a-kind for IBM in
Uttarakhand and follows its success with other co-operative banks in
different parts of the country. IBM is aggressively increasing its focus
on the small and medium businesses in India.

    Established 25 years ago, Kurmanchal Bank plans to expand its banking
network from 17 existing branches to nearly 35 over the next two years. As
part of its expansion strategy it also acquired another co-operative bank
last year. The bank is now looking at rolling out core-banking solution
along with offerings like Internet banking, mobile banking and ATM
facilities to its customers. The end-to-end managed services provided by
IBM will greatly reduce the burden of upfront capital expenditure for the
bank as the agreement allows it to spend in an operational expenditure
model over a 10-year period.

    "Customer-friendly approach, product innovation and rapid technology
adoption have been some of the core strengths of the bank," said Mr. Manoj
Sah, CEO, Kurmanchal Bank. "We are delighted with our partnership with
IBM, the world's leading IT services company. We believe their technology
expertise and focus on delivering cost-efficient solutions will help us
achieve our growth strategy and higher levels of customer satisfaction."

    Nipun Mehrotra, Vice President and General Manager, Global Technology
Services, IBM India/South Asia, remarked, "With businesses across India
sharpening their focus on cost-efficiency in these challenging times, IBM
has once again proved its partnership value for small and mid-sized
customers. We are excited about our relationship with Kurmanchal Bank to
offer managed services that will help them reduce their upfront IT
expenditure. The fact that the bank decided to enter into a 10-year long
agreement further reiterates the trust clients -- big or small -- put in
IBM's capabilities."

    Through this agreement, IBM will host and manage Kurmanchal Bank's entire
IT infrastructure from its data center in Bangalore as well as providing
backup and replication services to the bank's Disaster Recovery site in
Nainital.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading (GSET) announced today the release of the
latest version of REDIPlus, Goldman Sachs` award-winning execution management
system. The release of version 9.0 marks the first of two major releases in
2009, and brings clients significant enhancements to options trading and
workspace usability features. 

"With version 9.0, we continue to build on the key elements which have made
REDIPlus successful. Our consistent focus on multi-asset strategies, global
market access, and superior execution quality drives both our major product
updates and our minor ergonomic enhancements," said Rishi Nangalia, Managing
Director and global head of GSET Business Development. "These ongoing
improvements help us meet the needs of our diverse client base." 

The new options enhancements include the introduction of three new algorithmic
strategies, the ability to auto-hedge options orders, and active limit support.
The three new algorithms - Strike, Pegging, and Volatility Limit - bring the
total number of advanced options strategies to seven. These algorithms also take
advantage of existing SIGMA options smart routing functionality, through which
over 70% of GSET electronic options flow is now executed. Options traders who
upgrade to version 9.0 can also auto-hedge their orders, enabling them to
automatically execute equity hedges in real-time as the option order is filled.
Additionally, 9.0 offers options traders an Active Limit Support tool, a
real-time graphical representation of a customer`s floating limit price and
executions relative to the current market. 

Several ergonomic improvements help make the trading process more streamlined
and user friendly. REDIPlus customers will now receive upgrade notifications,
automatically alerting the user whenever a new version of the trading platform
becomes available. Multi-currency order entry and monitoring enables customers
to manage their global strategies more effectively. "Freeze panes" are the
latest enhancement to the spreadsheet-like functionality embedded within
REDIPlus, providing customers with a more flexible view and the ability to sort
trade data. 

"As clients increasingly employ portfolio trading strategies as an efficient way
to manage their trading workflow, we continue to make significant enhancements
to portfolio trading features within REDIPlus," said Nangalia. New list
segmentation offers the ability to take sections of a portfolio trade list and
break them into smaller, customized pieces, allowing for greater flexibility.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, Apr 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Ilona Becker, motivational dating coach and certified matchmaker, will be
appearing on Justin Sachs' Podcast "Motivational Minds" today. A
motivational speaker who deals with one of the hardest aspects of a
professional's life -- finding the perfect match -- she will be offering
insights on matchmaking, romance, and motivating yourself to change.

    Ilona Becker points out the reason why she offers a dating coaching
service on www.catch-me-a-catch.com: "Many of my clients for both my
matchmaking and for my dating coach services, are successful businessmen
and women who have spent so long developing their professional selves and
etiquette that they have lost -- or possibly never learned -- the art of
developing their romantic selves and etiquette. My dating coaching
service gives them a chance to learn those skills again so that they
present themselves with the same polish in their personal life as they do
in their professional one."

    The National Health and Social Life Survey has consistently shown, since
the 80s, that married couples are objectively happier than single couples,
and while divorce rates may be high nationally, Ilona Baker believes that
careful matchmaking can help make professionals happier and find them
their true partner for life.

    "I get clients who are very successful -- millionaires, sometimes, who
can't get past the first date because they don't know how dating etiquette
works," Ilona concludes. "My job for my clients, in addition to finding
them a mate, is to motivate them to work on improving themselves. Even if
you aren't looking for a mate yourself, this podcast should help you
understand some of the ways you can get motivated to make a positive
change in yourself."

    The podcast will be available at www.JustinSachsOnline.com by clicking on
"Podcast."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - The chief executives of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) met last week to discuss potential partnerships between the companies' Internet search and advertising operations, the technology blog All Things Digital reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide-ranging talks have taken place between executives at the companies, the blog reported, including discussion of the potential for Microsoft to handle Yahoo's search advertising business, and for Yahoo to combine and run the two companies' display advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo declined to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectation that the two technology giants would enter negotiations over Yahoo's search business has been rising since Yahoo's new CEO, Carol Bartz, took the reins in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She succeeded Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, who beat back Microsoft's effort to buy all of Yahoo last year for $47.5 billion, which soured relationships between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft wanted to buy Yahoo chiefly to combat Google Inc's (GOOG.O) dominance in the Internet search arena, and CEO Steve Ballmer has made it clear he would still like to do some sort of deal in that area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unless I'm fooling myself, over time I would expect there's a good opportunity for a deal," Ballmer told a media conference in New York last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
COSTA MESA, Calif., April 13, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Emulex Corporation
(NYSE:ELX) today announced that its LightPulse(r) 8Gb/s Fibre Channel Host Bus
Adapters (HBAs) are optimized for use with the new generation of IBM System x
Intel(r) Xeon(r) processor 5500 series-based servers. Emulex 8Gb/s HBAs, working
with IBM System x3650 M2 and IBM System x3550 M2 equipped with Intel QuickPath
Interconnect technology (QPI), provide customers with the increased performance,
I/O bandwidth and the scalability necessary for their virtualized server
environments.

"With greater transaction rates and more effective CPU utilization than other
market offerings, Emulex 8Gb/s HBAs are best positioned to handle the
mission-critical and I/O-intensive applications of next-generation data

    integrity and protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.
 *  Support for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
    preboot environment common across all new IBM systems.
 *  Common driver model allows a single driver to support all Emulex
    HBAs on a given operating system -- lowers administrative costs
    and speeds server deployment.
 *  Support for 8Gb/s, 4Gb/s &amp; 2Gb/s Fibre Channel devices --
    integrates seamlessly into existing SANs.
"Offering superior performance in virtualized environments, as well as
significantly lower power requirements, our new System x servers give customers
a reason to invest in their IT infrastructures, even in challenging economic
times," said Robert Galush, Vice President of Systems x Servers and Options, IBM
Corporation. "With Emulex's 8Gb/s HBA supporting our new systems, IBM is even
better equipped to drive x86 server innovation and help customers to maximize

&lt;p&gt;Top Industry Pro Tapped to Continue Firm`s Performance Revival
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Putnam Investments today announced that Walter C. Donovan will serve as the
firm`s chief investment officer, reporting to Robert L. Reynolds, president and
chief executive officer. Donovan, who brings nearly 25 years of investment
management experience to the position, joins Putnam at a time when the company
has been moving to deepen its talent pool, raise investment results and
significantly enhance its presence in the retirement marketplace. 

Donovan, age 46, comes to Putnam from Fidelity Investments, where he served as
President of the company`s Equity Division with responsibility for portfolio
management, investment research and trading. In addition, he was responsible for
the high yield group at Fidelity. 

In his Putnam role overseeing the management of the entire investment group,
Donovan will lead an investment organization that has seen the arrival of an
array of well-regarded senior portfolio managers, research analysts and equity
traders, as well as the launch of the industry`s first suite of target absolute
return funds, along with a broad restructuring of the equity investment division
itself last fall. 

"In Walter Donovan, we are bringing aboard an investment chief of extraordinary
talent and experience, who will take the lead in driving continued improvement
in investment results for Putnam`s clients and shareholders," said Reynolds.
"Given the challenges and opportunities provided by today's market environment,
we sought - and now have - a distinguished industry veteran to lead our
investment team, as we create a performance-driven culture for a new era at
Putnam." 

Donovan has served as President of the Equity Division for Fidelity Investments
since the beginning of 2007, during which time he oversaw a further build out of
international investment and mega-cap investment capabilities, development of a
style consistent value team, a multi-manager group, and a strong focus on select
fund performance and sales. He also ran the high income bond division. 

Prior to joining Putnam, Donovan held a number of key positions at Fidelity
including Executive Vice President and head of Equity Research, head of High
Income Division, and leadership roles in Equity Trading, Structured Credit, and
Counterparty Risk Management. Upon joining the company in 1995, he was Director
and Head Trader of Taxable Fixed Income, and then became Director of High Income
and Emerging Market Debt Trading. 

Before joining Fidelity, Donovan worked as a Director on the corporate debt
trading desk with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets for seven years, and began his
career as a municipal bond trader and underwriter for Salomon Brothers. He
earned a Bachelor of Arts from Amherst College and earlier attended the Phillips
Exeter Academy and Medford High School. 

"Walter will bring enormous energy, focus and well-honed investment leadership
to our goal of raising the performance bar at Putnam. We aim to produce some of
the most competitive and effective investment solutions for the retail and
institutional marketplaces, through continuous enhancements to our investment
structure and new product innovations," Reynolds added, "and Walter will be a
key driver in that mission." 

Rebuilding Putnam Investments

The hiring of Donovan is the latest - and most visible - step by Reynolds to
revitalize performance at the Boston-based asset management firm which he joined
on July 1, 2008. The company`s recent moves to improve equity performance and
strengthen Putnam`s investment unit include:

* A broad restructuring of Putnam`s equity investment division announced on
November 17, 2008, with both a clear focus on individual fund manager
responsibility and a realignment of manager and analyst incentives to reward
those who deliver top-quartile results for clients; 
* A series of senior hires in equity trading, portfolio management and
securities analysis, including David Glancy from Andover Capital; Nick Thakore
and Robert Ewing from RiverSource; Gerard Sullivan and Robert Brookby from
American Century; and David Calabro, formerly of MFS. Additionally, Putnam has
also strengthened its research efforts through recent hires; and, 
* The launch, announced January 13, 2009, of the industry`s first suite of
target absolute return mutual funds, designed to seek annualized total returns

&lt;p&gt;Top Industry Pro Tapped to Continue Firm`s Performance Revival
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Putnam Investments today announced that Walter C. Donovan will serve as the
firm`s chief investment officer, reporting to Robert L. Reynolds, president and
chief executive officer. Donovan, who brings nearly 25 years of investment
management experience to the position, joins Putnam at a time when the company
has been moving to deepen its talent pool, raise investment results and
significantly enhance its presence in the retirement marketplace. 

Donovan, age 46, comes to Putnam from Fidelity Investments, where he served as
President of the company`s Equity Division with responsibility for portfolio
management, investment research and trading. In addition, he was responsible for
the high yield group at Fidelity. 

In his Putnam role overseeing the management of the entire investment group,
Donovan will lead an investment organization that has seen the arrival of an
array of well-regarded senior portfolio managers, research analysts and equity
traders, as well as the launch of the industry`s first suite of target absolute
return funds, along with a broad restructuring of the equity investment division
itself last fall. 

"In Walter Donovan, we are bringing aboard an investment chief of extraordinary
talent and experience, who will take the lead in driving continued improvement
in investment results for Putnam`s clients and shareholders," said Reynolds.
"Given the challenges and opportunities provided by today's market environment,
we sought - and now have - a distinguished industry veteran to lead our
investment team, as we create a performance-driven culture for a new era at
Putnam." 

Donovan has served as President of the Equity Division for Fidelity Investments
since the beginning of 2007, during which time he oversaw a further build out of
international investment and mega-cap investment capabilities, development of a
style consistent value team, a multi-manager group, and a strong focus on select
fund performance and sales. He also ran the high income bond division. 

Prior to joining Putnam, Donovan held a number of key positions at Fidelity
including Executive Vice President and head of Equity Research, head of High
Income Division, and leadership roles in Equity Trading, Structured Credit, and
Counterparty Risk Management. Upon joining the company in 1995, he was Director
and Head Trader of Taxable Fixed Income, and then became Director of High Income
and Emerging Market Debt Trading. 

Before joining Fidelity, Donovan worked as a Director on the corporate debt
trading desk with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets for seven years, and began his
career as a municipal bond trader and underwriter for Salomon Brothers. He
earned a Bachelor of Arts from Amherst College and earlier attended the Phillips
Exeter Academy and Medford High School. 

"Walter will bring enormous energy, focus and well-honed investment leadership
to our goal of raising the performance bar at Putnam. We aim to produce some of
the most competitive and effective investment solutions for the retail and
institutional marketplaces, through continuous enhancements to our investment
structure and new product innovations," Reynolds added, "and Walter will be a
key driver in that mission." 

Rebuilding Putnam Investments

The hiring of Donovan is the latest - and most visible - step by Reynolds to
revitalize performance at the Boston-based asset management firm which he joined
on July 1, 2008. The company`s recent moves to improve equity performance and
strengthen Putnam`s investment unit include:

* A broad restructuring of Putnam`s equity investment division announced on
November 17, 2008, with both a clear focus on individual fund manager
responsibility and a realignment of manager and analyst incentives to reward
those who deliver top-quartile results for clients; 
* A series of senior hires in equity trading, portfolio management and
securities analysis, including David Glancy from Andover Capital; Nick Thakore
and Robert Ewing from RiverSource; Gerard Sullivan and Robert Brookby from
American Century; and David Calabro, formerly of MFS. Additionally, Putnam has
also strengthened its research efforts through recent hires; and, 
* The launch, announced January 13, 2009, of the industry`s first suite of
target absolute return mutual funds, designed to seek annualized total returns
of 1%, 3%, 5%, or 7% above inflation as measured by Treasury bills over a period
of three years or more. Unlike relative return funds that measure themselves
against market indices, Putnam`s target absolute return funds are designed to
provide positive returns over time, with less volatility than more traditional
funds, whether markets are rising or falling.*

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Petrobras (NYSE: PBR), Cosan Ltd. (NYSE: CZZ), Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:
WFC), Wyeth (NYSE: WYE), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE).

the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Petrobras Denies CZZ Takeover

Some days ago we wrote about the statement of Petrobras (NYSE: PBR) regarding
the possibility of some kind of partnership with local Brazilian ethanol
producers and how this would benefit Cosan Ltd. (NYSE: CZZ), the biggest ethanol
producer in Brazil and one of the biggest in the world. 

We also said that there were rumors in the market that Petrobras could even
consider the acquisition of Cosan. In the last few days, Cosan's shares soared
more than 40%. 

Wells Fargo's Pleasant Surprise

Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE: WFC) delivered a pleasant surprise to the markets
this morning by announcing that it expects a net income of $3 billion, or $0.55
per share, for 1Q09, as against estimates of earnings of $0.23 cents per share.
Revenue projection for the quarter at $20.0 billion was also ahead of the
estimates of $18.98 billion. The Company will report its financial results on
April 22, 2009. 

The bank said that the revenue received a boost from exceptionally strong
mortgage banking results and strong capital market activities. It appears that
the bank benefited from a larger share in the mortgage markets after acquiring
Wachovia, and also from the demise of some smaller players. 

Wyeth Offers Limited Update

We currently rate shares of Wyeth (NYSE: WYE) a Hold with a $49 price target.
Our target assumes Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) shares trade up near $16 (currently
$13.49) by the expected close date in the third or fourth quarter. At an
exchange ratio of 0.985 and combined with the $33 cash per Wyeth share, this
equates to roughly $49 per share. 

Revenue in 2008 grew 2% and was up 1% excluding the benefit from foreign
exchange. EPS was flat from 2007 on lower interest income and a higher tax rate,
partially offset by lower SG spend. Fourth quarter results disappointed due to
softness in a number of products and a foreign exchange headwind.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Research Director, Dirk Van Dijk says that S 500 earnings are continuing
to show red ink. He tracks companies on the Zacks.com web site, naming names,
while forecasting trends for the months ahead. 

Key Points from Van Dijk's Latest Earnings Assessment

* Massive UPWARD revisions to 1Q expectations for Financials 
* Mostly due to major banks, but gains don't translate to similar gains for full
year 
* Very early first-quarter results not encouraging, total net income of 21 firms
down 11.9% 
* Full S 500 (SPX) total net income expected to be 27.5% lower than last year 
* Was a 37.2% decline last week, Financials decline cut to 9.0% from -27.2% last
week 
* Total net income expected to fall 10.8% for all of 2009, after 19.0% fall in
2008 
* P/Es based on 2009 estimates will prove to be to low as "E" plunges 
* Estimate cuts still outnumber increases by more than 3:1 for both years 
* Financials expected to rebound after disastrous 2008 
* Bottom-up estimate for S 500 now $60.39 in 2009 S 500 now expected to earn
$74.82 in 2010.

Total Net Income Growth

The big news this week is the massive upward revision in the first-quarter
earnings expectations for the Financials. In total, the sector is expected to
earn than $3 billion more this week in the first quarter than forecasts
predicted a week ago. Most of the increase is attributable to the mega banks
like J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C). 

Changes in the mark to market rules (well the anticipation of the changes, the
actual change is to recent to be captured by these numbers) is likely the
biggest reason. If so, then it is mostly a change in the accounting earnings,
not the economic earnings. 

The other explanation is that passing through of American International Group,
Inc. (NYSE:AIG) bailout money to these large banks by settling their CDS
exposures in full. That gift from the taxpayers would be a real economic benefit
bank bottom lines. 

While the sector as a whole is still expected to earn less than it did a year
ago, the magnitude of the decline has been cut dramatically, to just a 9.0% drop
from an expected 27.2% decline just last week. This has caused the expected
decline in the total earnings for the S 500 as a whole to also moderate
significantly, with a 27.5% drop expected now vs. a 37.2% decline forecast just
last week. 

We just have a relative handful of actual earnings reports in for the first
quarter, all of them firms with February fiscal period ends. As such it is far
from a representative sample. However, the 21 firms that have collectively
earned a total of $5.1 billion, a 11.9% drop from the $5.8 billion they earned
in the first quarter of 2008. Quite surprisingly the Consumer Durables sector is
doing very well, posting a 22.2% increase in total net income so far. Every
other sector has total net income below last year, but the sample size is far
too small to draw any real conclusions. 

For the full year, earnings estimates continue to be cut for both 2009 and 2010.
The negative revisions continue to outpace increases by more than a 3:1 ratio
for both years, but that is better than what we were seeing a few months ago
when the margin was more like 5:1. On the other hand, the improvement is
happening on a very light volume of total estimate revisions (seasonally
normal), so the improvement has as much to do with old cuts falling off the four
week running totals as it does with new increases being made. 

Scorecard and Median EPS Growth Rates

* Early first quarter are results weak with median EPS down 5.8% 
* Surprise ratio at 2.0, median surprise 9.7% with 21 firms reporting 
* A 15.8% decline is seen in the first quarter 
* Nearly every sector but Health Care expected to be down (Utilities are 
* unchanged) 
* Second-quarter profits will be only slightly better, down 9.4% 
* Implied second-half rebound; full year 2009 expected to be up 6.6%

Only a handful of firms have reported their first quarter results. These are all
companies with fiscal periods ending in February, and are hardly a
representative sample. 

The results over the last week have been better than expected and the surprise
ratio has jumped to 2:1 from an even 1:1 last week. The Consumer Discretionary
sector has a perfect record so far with 8 results in and 8 positive surprises.
Those firms have generated median EPS growth of 15.8%, and a median surprise of
18.9%. The remaining firms in the sector are not expected to fare as well, with
a median EPS of 27.3% expected. But then again, that is what makes for
surprises. 

Health Care is the only sector currently expected to post better year-over-year
EPS than a year ago, The Utilities are expected to be flat and Consumer Staples
is only expected to see a negligible decline. Beyond that the expectations start
getting very ugly, with 6 of the sectors expected to post median drops of over
20%. 

Materials and Energy are expected to see drops of over 40%. Those two sectors
however are facing very difficult comps. Remember just how much the oil
companies were making last year, well other commodities were also doing very
well then as well. 

Looking ahead to the second quarter, there should be significant improvement,
with every sector by energy expected to show either a bigger increase, or a
smaller decline than in the first quarter. 

The Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2009

* Revisions ratio for full S 500 down to 0.31, from 0.29 last week 
* All sectors but Telecom in negative territory Consumer Discretionary getting
less negative 
* 7 sectors have at least 2 cuts for every increase, 5 have at least 4 cuts per
increase Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 0.26, up from 
* 0.25 
* Total number of revisions (4 week total) down to 1,907 from 2,060 last week
(-7.4%) Increases down to 448 from 465 (-3.7%), cuts down to 1,459 from 1,595 
* (-8.5%) 
* Estimate activity nearing seasonal low

The revisions ratio reversed a gradual uptrend it had been in for several weeks,
and remains in very negative territory. 

Generally we consider anything below 0.80 to be negative, and anything above
1.25 to be positive. 

Only health Care has made into neutral territory. The overall pace of estimate
revisions is slowing dramatically, as it usually does after earnings season is
over. The revisions ratio is based on the four week moving totals of estimate
changes. Thus the rise in the ratio may have more to do with old estimate cuts
falling off faster than old estimate increases than it does with new estimate
revisions. 

The Telecom sector was the only one with more increases than cuts, but the
sample size is so small (19 total) that it really is not that significant. 

The Consumer Discretionary sector has improved significantly, most likely in
response to the better than expected earnings for the early reporters in the
sector. The dramatic improvement in the total net income expectations for the
Financial sector in the first quarter has not been matched to a flood of
estimate increases for the full year, which should make you suspicious of how
real the improvement really is. The Industrial sector is an absolute mess, with
cuts out pacing increases by a margin of over 40:1. 

The Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2010

* Overall picture for 2010 similar to that of 2009 
* Revisions ratio steady at 0.27 
* More than 3 cuts per increase for 6 sectors, more than 5 per increase in 
* 4 sectors 
* Telecom, Discretionary the "strongest", Industrials, Energy weakest for 2010 
* Ratio of rising to falling mean estimates rises to 0.29 from 0.28 
* Total number of revisions falls to 1,285 from 1,326 (-3.1%) 
* Estimate increases fall to 277 from 283 (-2.1%), cuts fall to 1,008 from 
* 1043 (-3.4%)

The 2010 revisions ratio story is pretty much the same as 2009. A gradual
pattern of a low but improving revisions ratio was slightly reversed this week.
In a bit of a surprise, the total number of revisions actually grew this week,
counter the normal seasonal pattern. 

The very small Telecom sector (23 total revisions) and Health Care the best on a
relative basis, but nothing to really write home about. The Consumer
Discretionary sector has also improved significantly in recent weeks. As with
2009, the Industrials sector was far and away the weakest, with Financials,
Energy and Materials also very weak. However, in recent days the price of oil
has started to rebound. If that holds, it seems likely that the estimates could
start to head up again for the Energy sector. As it stands now, the size of the
cuts in the sector is very large. 

Earnings Shares and P/Es

* P/Es are too low since earnings estimates are too high 
* Earnings Shares, including historical, based on current make up of S 500
Health Care expected to take Earnings crown from Energy in 2009, keep it in 2010
Energy's earnings share expected to plunge to 12.8% from 23.8% 
* Financials' 2009 earnings share expected to rise to 12.1% from -2.1% in 2008. 
* Consumer Discretionary market cap share far above earnings shares 
* (overvalued?) 
* Health Care Market Cap share well below earnings shares (undervalued?) 
* The 12-month forward S 500 P/E of 13.1 equates to earnings yield of 7.63%.
This is very attractive relative to 10 year T-note yield of 2.63%, but only
mediocre relative to 5.68% A rated 10-year corporate. 
* T-note rates are rising and the more realistic earnings yields of near 6.15%,
based on lower earnings ($50), means the spread, while still attractive, is not
overwhelming.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc sold $5 billion of stock to help fulfill what it called its "duty" to repay a federal bailout, but the government worries a quick return of funds could pressure other banks to repay their aid prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sale of 40.65 million shares at $123 each gives the bank roughly half what it needs to return the $10 billion of taxpayer money it took from the Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We never believed the investment of taxpayer funds was intended to be permanent," Goldman CFO David Viniar said on a conference call on Tuesday. "We view it as our duty to return the funds, as long as we can do it without negatively impacting our financial profile, or ability to act as a central liquidity provider to the global capital markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said repayment would depend on regulatory approval and the results of a government "stress test" gauging Goldman's ability to weather a deep recession. Nineteen banks are undergoing such tests, which are to be completed this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repaying the funds would free Goldman from many government restrictions, including caps on executive pay. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein's compensation fell to $1.1 million last year from $70.3 million in 2007, Goldman's proxy filing shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it retains a $164 billion pool of cash and liquid assets that it could use to buy troubled assets and loans as rivals pare their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's stock sale came a day after Goldman posted better-then-expected quarterly profit, bolstered by substantial risk taking, and after the bank's shares had more than doubled from their record low of $47.44 last November 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors who bought the new stock, however, may have had quick losses. Goldman shares posted their largest percentage drop since January 20, closing down $15.04, or 11.6 percent, at $115.11 on the New York Stock Exchange. A Standard  Poor's index of financial stocks fell 7.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OBAMA EYES BANK CAPITAL, LENDING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department declined to comment on Goldman's plan to repay the TARP funds, but regulators did not indicate any efforts to block it. A Treasury spokesman said that, in general, financial firms raising private capital is a positive step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While repaying TARP might show Goldman's strength, policymakers worry it could "harm the recovery effort" by prompting other banks to return their bailout money too soon, limiting lending capacity, a person familiar with the Obama administration's thinking said. The person was not authorized to speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said President Barack Obama did not want the government to run every troubled bank, and that banks had a "need for responsibility" in paying employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama, in a speech in Washington, said that if banks need more capital and cannot raise it privately, the government will "force the necessary adjustments" and provide support to clean up the lenders' balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman converted to a commercial bank in September as a credit market freeze and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's bankruptcy upended the Wall Street banking model. The same month, Goldman got a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGHER TRADING RISK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman on Monday posted a $1.66 billion first-quarter profit after preferred stock dividends, or $3.39 per share, more than double what analysts had forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said profit resulting from payments from ailing insurer American International Group Inc "rounded to zero" in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's results may raise expectations for rivals scheduled to report this month, including JPMorgan Chase  Co on Thursday, Citigroup Inc on Friday and Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Trone, a Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst, said Goldman benefited from a "windfall" in fixed income, currencies and commodities results that is "unlikely to repeat." He rates Goldman "in line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said its "value at risk," or the maximum it would expect to lose daily on 95 percent of trading days, rose to a record $240 million in the first quarter from $197 million in the fourth quarter. It ended the first quarter with $925 billion of assets, up 5 percent from the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trading activity suggests Goldman "has not backed off in any way from taking risk in the markets," wrote Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman, said the "vast majority" of the quarter's risk-taking was on behalf of clients, not the company. He also said value-at-risk measures would not have risen from the fourth quarter had mortgage and credit volatility not increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is paying 5 percent interest on the government's $10 billion preferred stock stake. It also sold the government warrants to buy up to 12.2 million shares at $122.90 each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said he was pleased about Goldman's plans to repay TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To the extent that we have people pay it back, we should welcome that," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said the environment remains "dangerous" in light of "extremely difficult macroeconomic conditions" and tight credit, which put a premium on liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman is doing less to diversify away from businesses sensitive to capital markets and corporate business activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, for example, is taking a majority stake in a venture combining its brokerage with Citigroup's and has said it plans to bulk up in retail banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not really a consumer lender," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repaying TARP could be risky if conditions worsen more than Goldman expects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our economists are, I would say, more optimistic or less pessimistic than they've been about the outlook for the economies going into the second half of the year, so that gives us some cause for optimism," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins, Jonathan Stempel and Christian Plumb in New York; and Ross Colvin, Susan Cornwell, Corbett B.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Meet the new Goldman Sachs, trying to be the same as the old Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth-largest U.S. bank said late Monday that it earned $1.66 billion in the first quarter, as it boosted its risk and assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also raised extra capital to repay the government, in a move widely seen as an effort to avoid extra regulatory scrutiny, particularly when it comes to compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are unusual steps in an environment where most Wall Street banks are slimming down their balance sheets, taking risk only reluctantly and slashing compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman wants to go back to the way things were before the crisis, where they do what they do best, which is taking risk, and the government leaves them alone," said Bill Fitzpatrick, an analyst covering financial stocks at Optique Capital Management in Milwaukee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a surprising tack for Goldman, just weeks after the bank's chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, admitted that the financial services industry has made many mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said in a Washington speech that decisions made at many banks during the crisis, particularly regarding pay, "look self-serving and greedy in hindsight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman for its part denies it is making outsized bets to boost earnings. Spokesman Lucas van Praag said that the "vast majority" of the bank's risk taking in the first quarter was to facilitate client trades rather than bet the bank's own money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts believe that argument and say that Goldman is playing an important role in buying and selling client assets now even as competitors are not. Spokesman van Praag notes that banks are under enormous pressure to keep financing markets open and liquid, which Goldman is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to many investors, the combination of a 5 percent increase in assets during the quarter and the jump in value-at-risk, a measure of risk, signal that Goldman is likely trading more of its own funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've never seen such high value-at-risk figures out of Goldman before, even in 2006. I would be astonished if they weren't taking more risk," said one hedge fund manager who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is maintaining a $164 billion pool of available funds that it said could be used to buy assets, signaling to many investors that the bank is still willing to snatch up assets with its own funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CATCHING UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, regulators may balk. The bank has nearly $1 trillion of assets and it became a bank holding company rather than an investment bank in September, meaning it should face much more government supervision, particularly when it comes to risk taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as their bets are paying off, and regulators are still figuring them out, they won't have to change," said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at regulatory consulting and research firm Federal Financial Analytics in Washington. "But the regulators will eventually catch up with them," Petrou added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has historically been an incredibly effective risk- taker even in turbulent times. In the moments after two planes crashed into the World Trade Center on September 11 2001, the bank's London trading floor began shedding riskier assets and buying government bond options, steps that generated fat profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2006 and early 2007, Goldman trading desks across the entire company began preparing for a U.S. housing crisis, making it one of the few banks to consistently turn in profits in 2007 and the first three quarters of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this crisis has proven treacherous for even smart risk-takers. Goldman Sachs posted its first quarterly loss as a public company in November, and recorded some big writedowns in December, including an $850 million charge from loans made to units of chemicals company LyondellBasell that filed for bankruptcy in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And much more is at stake now if Goldman's risk taking goes awry. In late November 2001, Goldman had $312.2 billion of assets on its balance sheet. In March 2009, it had $925 billion. And as of September, Goldman became part of the U.S. banking system, meaning that questions about Goldman's stability may shake faith in the safety of depository institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner signaled in congressional testimony last month that systemically important companies require extra scrutiny now. He proposed setting up a single regulator to look at companies crucial to the financial system that "will ... need to impose liquidity, counterparty, and credit risk management requirements that are more stringent than for other financial firms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Federal Financial's Petrou, "Proprietary trading does not fit well into that kind of a framework."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds Treasury spokesman in paragraph 9)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Karey Wutkowski and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs
Group Inc (GS.N) sold $5 billion of stock to help fulfill what

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Tuesday as a surprising drop in retail sales dented hopes the recession was abating and financial shares slid on fears that Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) share offering could prompt others to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail sales in March snapped two months of increases and sparked selling across the board, with the stocks of retailers, big manufacturers, technology and energy companies among the casualties. The SP retail index .RLX fell 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the financial sector, which had recently led the stock market's 5-week rebound from 12-year lows, took the biggest beating by far, with the KBW Bank index .BKX falling 8.1 percent and the SP financial index .GSPF dropping 7.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is fear that other banks wanting to pay back government funds may want to raise cash by issuing shares," said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Ohio-based Schaeffer's Investment Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gloomy news on retail shows that "maybe the economy hasn't turned around as the last 5-week bounce suggested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 137.63 points, or 1.71 percent, to 7,920.18. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell 17.23 points, or 2.01 percent, to 841.50.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The influential chairman of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, Representative Barney Frank, on Tuesday welcomed Goldman Sachs Group Inc's plan to repay government bailout funds and said worries it could stigmatize other banks were "silly."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am very pleased," Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, told Reuters. "To the extent that we have people pay it back, we should welcome that. It goes into the Treasury."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday it has a "duty" to repay the $10 billion in taxpayer money it was given in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the Obama administration's thinking said it was concerned that allowing Goldman Sachs to pay back its bailout funds could stigmatize weaker banks still dependent on government money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is one of the dumbest things I've heard," Frank said in the phone interview with Reuters. "Do you think that if you were analyzing a bank, you would look primarily at the TARP money?" he said, referring to the bailout plan, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, by its acronym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Should we say, 'All repay at the same time?'" Frank asked, noting there are many metrics to decide whether a bank is strong or weak, such as its capital and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repaying taxpayer funds would free Goldman and other banks from many government restrictions, including caps on executive pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's announcement goes counter to a meeting U.S. President Barack Obama had with a group of bank executives last month. At that meeting, the administration relayed the message that the large banks should keep the TARP funds for now, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama's concern was that it would be "very bad" if banks gave the funds back, only to have them subsequently seek more bailout funds if economic conditions deteriorated further, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department views Goldman Sachs Group Inc's plan to repay government bailout funds as a sign of strength, and welcomes private capital replacing taxpayer funds at healthy banks, according to a source familiar with the Obama administration's thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some officials are concerned that Goldman's plan could prompt other banks to want to repay government capital prematurely, thereby compromising the effort to boost banks' lending capacity, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday it has a "duty" to repay the government money it was given in October. The company sold $5 billion of common stock at $123 a share, and plans to use the proceeds and other resources to repay the taxpayer money received under the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source familiar with Treasury Department discussions said Goldman's plan to repay the money will be seen as a pocket of strength in the financial industry, but will in turn create pressure on other banks to prematurely return their bailout funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't comment on specific institutions," Treasury spokesman Andrew Williams said. "As a general matter, Treasury views firms raising private capital as a positive step that contributes to the financial system's ability to continue lending through this downturn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams also said Treasury is pleased to have banks continue in the government capital program because it has helped increase lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Tuesday that he was happy to hear that Goldman Sachs planned to repay the TARP funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To the extent that we have people pay it back, we should welcome that. It goes into the Treasury," Frank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's announcement goes counter to a meeting U.S. President Barack Obama had with a group of bank executives last month, said the source familiar with Treasury's discussions. At that meeting, the administration relayed the message that the large banks should keep the TARP funds for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama's concern was that it would be "very bad" if banks gave the funds back, only to have them subsequently seek more bailout funds if economic conditions deteriorated further, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wayne Abernathy, an executive at the American Bankers Association and a former Treasury official, said Goldman's plan will be a test case to see if Treasury tries to hold up the repayment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We haven't had a big bank actually blaze that trail," Abernathy said. "I think we'll be looking to see to what extent Treasury facilitates the exit or inhibits it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of small banks have returned TARP money, but none of the largest banks, instructed by the Treasury Department in October to take bailout funds in an attempt to de-stigmatize the program, have repayed the funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abernathy said the government has two roadblocks it can put up. One is that the bank has to get the approval of its regulator to pay back the funds. The second is that Treasury has the opportunity to write regulations on how a bank can repay the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our reading is that Treasury doesn't intend to write those regulations," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abernathy said banks want to be liberated not only from the executive compensation and dividend restrictions that come from TARP, but also from its stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's now been changed to become a sign that a bank needed a bailout," he said. "That's why banks all want out of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Karey Wutkowski; editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Updates to early afternoon; changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks tumbled on
Tuesday as an unexpected drop in March retail sales suggested
that the economic slump was far from abating and as Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) slid sharply after a stock offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casualties in the broad sell-off also included such
economically sensitive plays as energy shares, big
manufacturers, retailers and technology stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But financials took the biggest beating by far, with the
KBW Bank index .BKX falling 6 percent and the SP financial
index falling 5.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We haven't seen economic news actually turn positive yet,"
said Dan Faretta, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a
retail brokerage firm, in Chicago. "We're still seeing bad
numbers. They're just not as bad as they were three or four
months ago. Fundamentally the economy has not turned around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI shed 133.89 points,
or 1.66 percent, to 7,923.92. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX dropped 15.89 points, or 1.85 percent, to 842.84. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC declined 30.00 points, or 1.81
percent, to 1,623.31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. President Barack Obama said there were signs of
recovery, but "by no means are we out of the woods just yet."
For more details see [ID:nN14428395]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman Sachs slid 9.3 percent to $118.02, a day
after the company said it would raise $5 billion by issuing
common stock. Such equity offerings are traditionally a drag
due to their dilutive effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Government data showing that retail sales in March snapped
two months of increases sparked selling in such
consumer-oriented stocks as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) , off 1.3
percent to $50.85, Home Depot Inc (HD.N) , down almost 3
percent to $25.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of fast-food company McDonald's Corp (MCD.N)
declined 2.5 percent to $54.68, making the stock one of the top
Dow drags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan (JPM.N) , due to post quarterly results
on Thursday, dropped 6.5 percent to $31.51, while among energy
shares, Chevron (CVX.N) declined 2.5 percent to $66.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nasdaq, shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) , the iPhone maker,
were a top drag, down 2.2 percent to $117.48. Speculation that
Dell may be readying a bid to enter the smartphone market with
a roll-out in China also hit shares of Research in Motion, the
maker of the Blackberry smart phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial sector had surged in recent weeks after some
major banks said they had made money in the first two months of
the year, spurring hopes that some stabilization may be
returning to the battered sector.

"Do you think that if you were analyzing a bank, you would look primarily at the TARP money?" he said, referring to the bailout plan, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, by its acronym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Should we say, 'All repay at the same time?'" Frank asked, noting there are many metrics to decide whether a bank is strong or weak, such as its capital and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repaying taxpayer funds would free Goldman and other banks from many government restrictions, including caps on executive pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's announcement goes counter to a meeting U.S. President Barack Obama had with a group of bank executives last month.

Jamie Dimon is Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co. - a company that has been a staunch supporter of WNET.ORG`s programs
and educational projects. Mr. Dimon became Chairman of the Board, effective
January 1, 2007, following his appointment as CEO on January 1, 2006. He also
assumed the title of President upon the company`s merger with Bank One
Corporation on July 1, 2004. Mr. Dimon began his professional career at American
Express Company, serving as Assistant to the President from 1982 until 1985. He
then became a key member of the team that launched and defined the strategy for
Commercial Credit Company in October 1986, when the consumer lending company was
spun off from Control Data Corporation. He served as Chief Financial Officer and
an Executive Vice President, and then President. A completely restructured
Commercial Credit made numerous acquisitions and divestitures, substantially
improving its profitability. Most significantly, in 1987, it acquired and
changed its name to Primerica Corporation, which in 1993 acquired The Travelers
Corporation and was renamed Travelers Group. At Travelers, Mr. Dimon was
President and Chief Operating Officer for seven years. He was named Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of its Smith Barney Inc. subsidiary in January 1996,

Officer. In November 1997, with the merger of Smith Barney and Salomon Brothers,
he became Co-Chairman and Co-CEO of the combined firm. In 1998, he was named
President of Citigroup Inc., the global financial services company formed by the
combination of Travelers Group and Citicorp in 1998. In addition, he served as
Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Salomon Smith Barney Holdings Inc.,
the investment banking and securities brokerage subsidiary. In 2000 Mr. Dimon
was named Chairman and CEO of Bank One. During his four years with the company,
he engineered a dramatic turnaround - taking the bank from a half-billion-dollar
loss in 2000 to record earnings of $3.5 billion in 2003. A summa cum laude
graduate of Tufts University, Mr. Dimon holds an MBA degree from the Harvard
University Graduate School of Business, where he was a Baker Scholar. He serves
on the boards of directors of a number of non-profit institutions, including the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Harvard Business School and the United Negro
College Fund. Mr. Dimon and his wife, Judy, have three daughters. 

Kevin Kline is a Tony and Academy Award-winning actor, lauded both for his work
on stage as well as screen. After graduating from Indiana University in
Bloomington, Kline studied at the Juilliard School in New York. In 1972, he
became a founding member of John Houseman's The Acting Company and performed
classic and contemporary plays in repertory in New York and on tour across the
country. On Broadway, Kline has won two Tony Awards for his work in the musicals
On the Twentieth Century (1978) and The Pirates of Penzance (1981). After
working on the stage for years, Kline made his film debut in Sophie's Choice
(1982) which earned him a BAFTA nomination and the first of five Golden Globe
nominations for his performance. His work in the ensemble cast of The Big Chill
(1983) would be followed by Silverado (1985). For his role as Otto West in A
Fish Called Wanda (1988), Kline won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Other
notable films from the past decades include: Cry Freedom (1987), I Love You To
Death (1990), Grand Canyon (1991), Soapdish (1991), Dave (1993), The Ice Storm
(1997), In &amp; Out (1997), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999), Life As A House
(2001), The Emperor's Club (2002), De-Lovely (2004), A Prairie Home Companion
(2006), Trade (2007) and HBO's As You Like It for which he earned a Screen
Actors Guild Award in 2008. On stage, Kline has earned rave reviews for Shaw`s
Arms and the Man, Chekhov`s Ivanov, The Seagull and in Shakespeare`s Henry IV
Part 1. Other notable Shakespearean roles on stage include King Lear, Richard
III, Henry V, and Much Ado About Nothing. Kline co-directed a televised version
of his Public Theater production of Hamlet for the PBS series Great
Performances. Last year he won an Outer Critics Circle Award for his performance
in Cyrano de Bergerac on Broadway, which also aired on PBS as part of the Great
Performances series. Kevin Kline is the first American actor to receive the Sir
John Gielgud Golden Quill Award and was recently honored with the Lucille Lortel

Reuters. "To the extent that we have people pay it back, we
should welcome that. It goes into the Treasury."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday it has a "duty" to repay the
$10 billion in taxpayer money it was given in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source familiar with the Obama administration's thinking
said it was concerned that allowing Goldman Sachs to pay back
its bailout funds could stigmatize weaker banks still dependent
on government money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That is one of the dumbest things I've heard," Frank said
in the phone interview with Reuters. "Do you think that if you
were analyzing a bank, you would look primarily at the TARP
money?" he said, referring to the bailout plan, the Troubled
Asset Relief Program, by its acronym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Should we say, 'All repay at the same time?'" Frank asked,
noting there are many metrics to decide whether a bank is
strong or weak, such as its capital and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Repaying taxpayer funds would free Goldman and other banks
from many government restrictions, including caps on executive
pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's announcement goes counter to a meeting U.S.
President Barack Obama had with a group of bank executives last
month. At that meeting, the administration relayed the message
that the large banks should keep the TARP funds for now, the
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obama's concern was that it would be "very bad" if banks
gave the funds back, only to have them subsequently seek more
bailout funds if economic conditions deteriorated further,
according to the source.

Marine Life Artist Wyland has earned the distinction as one of America`s most unique creative influences and a leading advocate for marine resource conservation. He is perhaps best known for his monumental Whaling Wall mural project - an epic series of life-size marine life murals that spans fourteen countries on four continents and is viewed by an estimated 1 billion people every year. His Wyland Foundation, in partnership with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, is actively engaged in teaching millions of students around the world to become caring, informed stewards of our oceans, rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands. Today, he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 21st

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) said its daily risk in commodities grew just 5 percent in
the first quarter while earnings from the sector, combined with
fixed income and credit, hit record highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman's revenues from fixed income, commodities, credit
and currencies (FICC) for the quarter ended March 27 surpassed
previous records set in the third quarter to Aug. 29, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The revenues in FICC were very, very broad based" across
the variety of commodities, rates, currencies and credit
businesses, Viniar told a conference call, adding that Goldman
"clearly had the benefit of higher spreads, less competition".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's first quarter results released on Monday showed
FICC revenues at almost $6.6 billion, versus a negative $3.4
billion in the fourth quarter ended Nov. 28, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the third quarter to Aug. 29, those revenues hit a record
$3.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's Value-at-Risk -- or the maximum it stood to lose
in a single day -- for trading commodities rose to $40 million
in the first quarter, from $38 million in the fourth and third
quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 5 percent growth for the commodities VaR was the
smallest among Goldman's FICC divisions. The bank's daily risk
toward interest rate activities rose 22 percent and for
currencies it grew by 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once Wall Street's most profitable investment bank before
converting to a commercial bank last September, Goldman
returned to profitability in the first quarter after suffering
just one quarter of losses in the economic downturn. It posted
a $1.66 billion profit after preferred stock dividends, more
than double what analysts had forecast. [ID:nN14414897]

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc posted much higher-than-expected first-quarter profit as it took more trading risk, and said it plans a $5 billion common share sale to help pay back government funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank also said it lost $1 billion in December 2008, mainly due to trading and investment losses. That month was reported separately and for the first time on Monday as Goldman and Morgan Stanley have both changed their financial years to match calendar years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also disclosed that it has set aside $168,901 per employee on average for compensation in the quarter, almost 35 percent more than in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year. The figure is likely to raise eyebrows given concerns expressed by lawmakers and others about excessive compensation on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, which were announced a day ahead of schedule, were seen by many analysts as evidence of Goldman's ability to sidestep the worst of the financial crisis. It has posted just one quarterly loss since the middle of 2007, even as competitors have posted several quarterly losses, or gone out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the quarter ended March 27, Goldman reported net income for common shareholders of $1.66 billion, or $3.39 a share, far exceeding analysts' average forecast of $1.49 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 13 percent to $9.43 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said the results, following Wells Fargo  Co's surprising announcement last Thursday that it expects to report a record first-quarter profit, were a sign the U.S. banking industry is stabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's another sign that the financial sector has gone through the worst," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's profit came in part because of strong trading results in fixed income, currencies and commodities, where the company posted $6.56 billion of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earnings do not compare directly with Goldman's fiscal quarter last year, which ended on February 29, 2008, but in last year's quarter the bank posted net income for common shareholders of $1.47 billion, or $3.23 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple U.S. banks have said that low interest rates and rebounding markets helped them post stronger results in the first two months of the quarter. But JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has said that March was more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's shares fell 1.8 percent in after-market trading on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares had risen 4.7 percent to $130.15 during the main trading session and the bank is one of the few whose shares trade above their accounting value, or book value. Goldman's is $98.82 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's share price has more than doubled since hitting a record low in November. It is up more than 50 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A RARE OPPORTUNITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman's report was not all positive. The bank said its net loss for common shareholders was $1.03 billion in December, prompting some to question whether the change in financial years had allowed Goldman to dump much of its bad news into that one-off period and start afresh in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"December was a rare opportunity for both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley," said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. "A single month, without any comparisons that can be made with any other months, so none of us will ever know what goes into the month of December. It's one of those rare opportunities that CFOs dream about." Hintz is a former Lehman Brothers chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said in January that it recorded a roughly $850 million loss from loans extended to units of chemicals company LyondellBasell in December, though the units filed for bankruptcy in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between the December losses and the subsequent profit, Goldman's tangible book value per common share was essentially unchanged from the end of November, at $88.02, the bank said. Tangible common equity is a measure of the bank's net worth, ignoring intangible assets such as goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A measure of the bank's trading risk, average daily value-at-risk, surged to $240 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared with $157 million for the three months ended February 28, 2008, implying that the bank took more trading risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value-at-risk represents the estimated maximum possible trading loss on 95 percent of the days in the quarter, and it could have risen because the bank did not pare down existing positions even as markets grew riskier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in risk may raise concerns given the current drive by the U.S. and other governments to reduce risks in the financial sector. Many say that banks had to be bailed out because they took on too much risk in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial markets grew increasingly turbulent after the demise of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. American International Group was rescued by the government soon after. AIG has given $12.9 billion in payments and collateral to Goldman since last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it planned to use the proceeds of its share offering plus additional funds to repay the $10 billion of capital it received from the U.S. government under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The bank said it would pay back the funds after the bank is stress tested by regulators and if the authorities allow it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been vocal about its preference to repay TARP money as soon as possible. In February, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the bank is looking to avoid the restrictions that come with TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would like to get out from under that," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in February, U.S. President Barack Obama signed a law that placed limits on executive compensation for TARP recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said that the government may be reluctant to allow banks to repay TARP until all are ready to repay it, to prevent any institutions unwilling or unable to return the capital from being singled out as weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs employees have traditionally been among the highest paid on Wall Street. If Goldman continues to pay employees as much as it did in the first quarter, the average employee will receive more than $675,000 for 2009. In 2007, per capita personal income in the United States was $38,611, according to the United States Census.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported late Monday that 953 Goldman employees, or nearly 1 in 30, were paid more than $1 million a year last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins; Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay and Juan Lagorio; Editing by Andre Grenon, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annual Conference Helps Attendees Evaluate Latest Business Solutions to Manage
and Leverage Web and Enterprise Content
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
The sixth annual Gilbane San Francisco Conference (http://gilbanesf.com/)
announced today that its lineup of keynote speakers will address the critical
theme of helping organizations assess new tools and technologies to manage web
content both internally behind the firewall and externally to customers and
partners. The upcoming Gilbane San Francisco event, produced by the Gilbane
Group and Lighthouse Seminars, takes place June 2-4, 2009 at The Westin Market
Hotel in San Francisco. The opening keynote addresses will be delivered by Kumar
Vora, Vice President &amp; General Manager, Enterprise, of Adobe who will discuss
new technologies for secure engagement within and beyond the enterprise; and
Tricia Bush, Group Product Manager of SharePoint for Microsoft Corporation who
will focus on the next generation of web platform strategies. Rounding out the
keynote program is an all industry-analyst panel discussion featuring experts
from Forrester, IDC, WelchmanPierpoint and Gilbane Group. 

Gilbane San Francisco 2009 brings together industry thought leaders from
technology, enterprise IT, analyst, and consulting firms who provide attendees
with the latest successful content management and enterprise social software
strategies, technologies and techniques. In addition to visionary keynotes, the
event features in-depth pre-conference workshops and a main conference providing
coverage of web content management, enterprise and site search; content
globalization; semantic technologies; publishing; XML; and enterprise social
media tools and platforms from Twitter to business blogs, project wikis and
other collaboration tools and platforms. 

Keynote Sessions

Engaging Beyond the Enterprise

To successfully engage beyond the enterprise, companies need the right
technologies to more effectively communicate with customers, constituents,
partners, and employees in key business processes. The most critical business
applications have to manage content that either crosses firewall boundaries, or
needs to work simultaneously with enterprise content or data. Adobe`s Kumar
Vora, Vice President &amp; General Manager, Enterprise, will discuss how
organizations can deliver rich and engaging applications that streamline and
quicken data exchange, and accelerate decision-making. 

The Web Platform of the Future

Managing content outside the four walls is as important as that within. There`s
a large opportunity to leverage an investment in process and technologies into
the .com environment, but it`s often difficult to bridge the chasm that exists
among content owners, marketing, interactive agencies, and IT. Microsoft`s
Tricia Bush, Group Product Manager of SharePoint, will address how these worlds
converge when a company outlines its web platform strategy around one of three
pillars: Reach, Revenue, or Retention. 

Keynote Industry Analyst Panel

An integral part of the keynote program, this panel represents an opportunity
for conference attendees to hear differing opinions on enterprise and social
media content strategies from a variety of expert sources. Panelists
includeJeremiah Owyang, Senior Analyst, Social Computing, Forrester; Hadley
Reynolds, Research Director, Search &amp; Digital Marketplace Technologies, IDC;
Larry Hawes, Lead Analyst, Collaboration and Enterprise Social Software, Gilbane
Group; and Lisa Welchman, Founding Partner, WelchmanPierpoint. 

"In today`s business environment, every organization has one thing in common:
the need to synchronize content across multiple business applications and
multiple communities," says Frank Gilbane, CEO of the Gilbane Group and
moderator of the keynote sessions. "This year`s keynotes share the timely theme
of how to move enterprise and web content - including product, marketing,
regulatory, and transactional information - both behind the corporate firewall
and out to customer- and partner-facing applications, including social media
environments. Our speakers reflect the diversity of ideas and technology
solutions to meet this challenge."

&lt;p&gt;Majestic Realty Will Rely on Microsoft, ExactTarget and Neudesic to Deliver
Results
INDIANAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
A new partnership between Microsoft and its Certified Gold Partners ExactTarget
and Neudesic is helping one of the nation`s largest privately held commercial
real estate developers more effectively market despite the down economy. 

Commercial real estate developer Majestic Realty Co. announced today it will
harness the power of the three companies to aggregate its multiple sources of
customer data and integrate them into ExactTarget`s platform to deliver bottom
line-boosting email marketing results. 

"This solution will deliver faster, more comprehensive exposure of our
properties to the brokers and the companies they represent who are most likely
to lease them," said Jon Grunzweig, vice president and chief information officer
of Majestic Realty. "The result will contribute to higher, faster rates of
property leasing." 

Majestic chose the Microsoft-led team for the project to capitalize on the three
companies proven strengths in delivering solutions for businesses around the
globe. With Neudesic`s expertise in creating and deploying Microsoft solutions
and ExactTarget`s off-the-shelf integration with Microsoft CRM, Majestic was
able to implement an integrated solution based on Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0
that could deliver and track its email marketing campaigns. 

Now an email marketing send that used to take the company up to 40 hours and
include creating custom HTML code can be done in less than a day. Powered by
ExactTarget`s integrated email marketing application, Majestic marketers can now
use customized templates to format emails without having to rely on an outside
department for technical support. Once sent, the emails can be easily tracked in
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0, giving marketers more visibility into the success of
their email campaigns and the data they need to make their email even more
relevant in the future. 

"The strategic alliance of Microsoft, Neudesic and ExactTarget will provide
Majestic Realty with a platform that will help them better serve their customers
and seamlessly integrate and transfer data between Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0
and ExactTarget," said Scott Roth, ExactTarget`s director of product marketing. 

The news of the technology triad delivering the solution for Majestic Realty
comes less than a month after Microsoft announced that the ExactTarget for
Microsoft Dynamics CRM solution earned Certified for Microsoft Dynamics
accreditation, its highest standard for partner-developed software solutions. 

The case study on Majestic Realty`s use of technology is available online here.

&lt;p&gt;  TOKYO, Apr 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that The Hokkoku Bank in Japan has
extended its strategic outsourcing contract for an additional six years
and eight months. As part of the agreement, IBM Japan will manage the
operation and maintenance of the company's information technology (IT)
system.

    The Hokkoku Bank's business plan includes enhancing the organization's
capabilities, reducing overall operational costs, managing risk and
compliance and improving productivity. IBM will help The Hokkoku Bank
realize its strategy through the IT infrastructure services agreement.

    IBM was selected for the extended agreement based on its proven service
quality and business contribution in the previous outsourcing agreement
signed in 2000. IBM helped stabilize the company's information system and
increase operational efficiency by using standard business processes and
automation.

    In the new agreement, IBM Japan will provide flexible central processing
unit (CPU) and software resources based on The Hokkoku Bank's business
needs through data center and mainframe hosting services. The support by
IBM Japan will help The Hokkoku Bank further optimize its IT investments
and operational efficiencies.

    The Hokkoku Bank is a member of the "TSUBASA Project" which is a system
sharing alliance with Chiba Bank, Daishi Bank, Chugoku Bank and Iyo Bank.
IBM Japan has supported the project through the standardization of
administrative work by using a standard business platform for banking as
well as developing the call center systems, and will continue contributing
to the project's success through the new outsourcing contract.

    The new agreement was signed in March 2009 and follows the original
ten-year contract signed in December 2000.

&lt;p&gt;  TOKYO, Apr 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that The Hokkoku Bank in Japan has
extended its strategic outsourcing contract for an additional six years
and eight months. As part of the agreement, IBM Japan will manage the
operation and maintenance of the company's information technology (IT)
system.

    The Hokkoku Bank's business plan includes enhancing the organization's
capabilities, reducing overall operational costs, managing risk and
compliance and improving productivity. IBM will help The Hokkoku Bank
realize its strategy through the IT infrastructure services agreement.

    IBM was selected for the extended agreement based on its proven service
quality and business contribution in the previous outsourcing agreement
signed in 2000. IBM helped stabilize the company's information system and
increase operational efficiency by using standard business processes and
automation.

    In the new agreement, IBM Japan will provide flexible central processing
unit (CPU) and software resources based on The Hokkoku Bank's business
needs through data center and mainframe hosting services. The support by
IBM Japan will help The Hokkoku Bank further optimize its IT investments
and operational efficiencies.

    The Hokkoku Bank is a member of the "TSUBASA Project" which is a system
sharing alliance with Chiba Bank, Daishi Bank, Chugoku Bank and Iyo Bank.
IBM Japan has supported the project through the standardization of
administrative work by using a standard business platform for banking as
well as developing the call center systems, and will continue contributing
to the project's success through the new outsourcing contract.

    The new agreement was signed in March 2009 and follows the original
ten-year contract signed in December 2000.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury
Department views Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) plan to repay

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Apr 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the creation of a new consulting
organization dedicated to the market for advanced business analytics and
business optimization. IBM Business Analytics and Optimization Services
will draw on the company's deep expertise in vertical industries,
research, mathematics and information management to help clients both
improve the speed and quality of business decisions while better
understanding the consequences and business outcomes of those decisions.

    A survey of business executives published in a study by IBM's Institute
for Business Value and released today reveals one in two business leaders
say they don't have access to the information in their organization they
need to their job. With organizations facing unprecedented scrutiny,
pressure and ever-shrinking margins for error, leaders are looking for
new ways to inject certainty and predictability into their decision
making. The survey also showed that eight out of ten business leaders
make major decisions with missing or untrusted information.

    "Our clients understand they're operating in a competitive environment
where more than ever before, in addition to being fast, they have to be
right. That requires something beyond the traditional notion of 'sense and
respond,'" said Frank Kern, senior vice president, IBM Global Business
Services. "That drives the need to speed business decisions, understand
the consequences of any decision and predict outcomes with more certainty
-- in short, moving to a new level of enterprise intelligence."

    This marks the first launch of a new service line by IBM Global Business
Services since it was formed in 2002 following the acquisition of
PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting. The new service also will draw on IBM's
vast Information Management portfolio, including technologies from the
recent acquisitions of Cognos and iLog, as well as the expertise of the
only research department in private industry dedicated to mathematics and
business analytics.

    Working with more than 4,000 consultants dedicated to this effort will be
experts from IBM Research's world renowned laboratories with more than 200
mathematicians and advanced analytics experts. The company also made
significant investments in Services Research for the past 10 years to
build technologies and intellectual property that optimize new services
offerings -- all culminating in this new consulting practice in support
of IBM's Smarter Planet strategy, which recognizes the need for improved
business insight.

    The growing market for a more sophisticated way to use information,
extract insight, and optimize business processes, models and individual
business decisions has been demonstrated by IBM through a number of pilot
initiatives leading to the formation of the new Business Analytics and
Optimization service line.

    One such pilot, the IBM Center for Business Optimization (CBO), was formed
five years ago inside Global Business Services. Last year, the CBO engaged
with more than 200 clients to use advanced analytics to solve complex
business problems. A related capability housed in IBM Research, On Demand
Innovation Services, has completed another 1,000 client engagements during
the past six years.

    IBM worked with The Sentinel Group, which provides healthcare fraud
detection and investigation services to payers throughout the United
States, to enhance the fraud and abuse detection capabilities of their
investigators. Through advanced analytics, IBM transformed what was once a
manual process for identifying potential fraud to a data-driven process
that helped the company identify over $45 million in fraudulent claims
since 2005.

    The new IBM Business Analytics and Optimization service line is led by
Fred Balboni, formerly the leader of IBM's retail industry consulting
practice. An expert in data-intensive industries and consultative
capabilities, Balboni leads a core team of analytics experts within each
industry IBM serves and will address five core areas, including Strategy,
Business Intelligence and Business Performance Management, Advance
Analytics and Optimization, Enterprise Information Management, and
Content Management.

    The Business Analytics and Optimization service line rounds out IBM Global
Business Services' established lines of business, including Application
Innovation Services, Customer Relationship Management, Financial
Management, Human Capital Management, Strategy &amp; Change, and Supply Chain
Management.

Services announcement, visit the online press kit at

&lt;p&gt;  ARLINGTON, VA, Apr 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Group Logic, the leading provider of Mac/Windows connectivity solutions,
today introduced native Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS) support
for Macs with the release of ExtremeZ-IP 6.0. The latest version also
delivers support for Network Spotlight, the full content search function
for Mac users. Together, these important new features give organizations
the ability to provide both Mac and Windows users with the same level of
network compatibility, file and print sharing capabilities in
Windows-based infrastructures.

    As companies with Macs look to deploy DFS in order to improve the
manageability, reliability and performance of their file server
infrastructure, ExtremeZ-IP's support for DFS is critical to providing
"compatibility without compromise." ExtremeZ-IP 6.0 provides full virtual
DFS Namespace access to Mac clients in a seamless and intuitive manner on
Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5 and supports full DFS replication and site costing.
ExtremeZ-IP is the only solution on the market that allows customers to
maintain the Mac's native AFP file sharing protocol in a DFS environment.

    Microsoft DFS delivers improved performance and flexibility for
administrators and convenience for end-users, but without a viable
solution to support the growing enterprise Mac population, many
heterogeneous organizations have been slow to implement this technology.
As the only server-side software to support Microsoft DFS for Macs,
ExtremeZ-IP provides organizations with a simple, cost-effective approach
to ensure that all users benefit from DFS technology.

    "ExtremeZ-IP 6.0 continues Group Logic's investment in the integration of
Mac and Windows innovations," said Derick Naef, Chief Technology Officer
(CTO) for Group Logic. "Organizations uncertain about DFS deployments due
to Mac support issues, and those looking for better search capabilities
for their end-users, can rely on ExtremeZ-IP to fully meet their needs.
With Mac users found in nearly every business environment today,
ExtremeZ-IP continues to be essential go-to software that delivers
compatibility without compromise."

    ExtremeZ-IP 6.0 also features new support for Apple's innovative Network
Spotlight full content searching feature that was introduced in Mac OS X
10.5. Mac users connected to an ExtremeZ-IP file server can type a phrase
and immediately get back a list of all the files on the server that
contain that phrase. This allows users to find the files they need
without looking through hundreds or thousands of files and folders.

    "Organizations are increasingly finding a requirement to accommodate Macs
in their Window IT infrastructures," said Michael Silver, Gartner Research
VP and Analyst. "Mac users will continue to demand parity with Windows
users for additional capabilities like DFS and enterprise search."

    ExtremeZ-IP is used by thousands of customers worldwide who depend on it
for reliable file sharing between their Mac desktops and Windows servers.
It delivers no-compromise access, providing complete platform and
application compatibility. ExtremeZ-IP 6.0 is available immediately and is
a free update to all licensed ExtremeZ-IP 5 users that have an active
support contract. For details on all of the new features, information on
upgrading or purchasing ExtremeZ-IP, or to download a free trial version,
please visit Group Logic's Web site at www.grouplogic.com. Upgrades can
also be purchased by contacting Group Logic directly at

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise-Class Content Creation Solution Streamlines Adoption of XML, DITA by
SharePoint Users
NEW YORK &amp; LONDON--(Business Wire)--
JustSystems, the largest independent software vendor in Japan and a worldwide
leader in XML and information management technologies, today announced XMetaL&#174;
Author Enterprise for Microsoft&#174; SharePoint, the enterprise-class content
creation solution for enterprises using SharePoint as their content management
system. By uniting XMetaL Author Enterprise and SharePoint, JustSystems
effectively streamlines the adoption of XML and DITA for SharePoint users,
making the advantages of reusable, structured content available to the entire
enterprise. 

"Microsoft SharePoint is one of the most popular, widely deployed content
management systems in the enterprise," said Aaron Deitcher, vice president of
North America and EMEA for JustSystems. "Together, XMetaL and SharePoint offer a
comprehensive content lifecycle solution that lets anyone in the organization
create, share, reuse, and deliver XML-based content, including less frequent
content contributors such as engineers, managers, and customer service staff. In
turn, users can improve content quality and consistency and reduce publishing
costs." 

Structured Content for SharePoint

SharePoint provides secure collaboration and content management, facilitating
more productive use and sharing of information on a platform familiar to IT
professionals and developers. XMetaL Author Enterprise for Microsoft SharePoint
extends the SharePoint platform with an easy-to-use content creation solution
that seamlessly introduces XML and DITA to manage content more effectively. With
XMetaL Author Enterprise for Microsoft SharePoint, even non-technical writers
can create and collaborate on reusable content without needing to be proficient
in XML. 

Highlights of XMetaL Author Enterprise for Microsoft SharePoint include:

* Access content in SharePoint libraries. Users can deliver consistent content
faster by assembling reusable, topic-based DITA content in multiple
deliverables. After writing a piece of content, users can check it into a
SharePoint library to enable team members across the world to reuse it. 
* Support for check-in/check-out. A document opened with XMetaL Author
Enterprise for Microsoft SharePoint is automatically checked out from
SharePoint, preventing other users from making conflicting changes. After making
changes, users can check the new version of the document directly back into
SharePoint from the XMetaL user interface. 
* Leverage SharePoint-based security. Users can use SharePoint user management
and permissions features to control who can view and/or edit content. Access
control extends to individual sections, paragraphs, and phrases incorporated
through the DITA content reference (conref) mechanism. 
* Client-side deployment. XMetaL Author Enterprise for Microsoft SharePoint
communicates directly with the SharePoint server via SharePoint`s SOAP
interface. Everything needed to enable XML authoring is installed on the local
machines of the authors who need it. No installation or additional configuration
is required on the SharePoint server, greatly simplifying IT and maintenance
tasks.

Pricing and Availability

XMetaL Author Enterprise for Microsoft SharePoint is available today. Pricing
starts at US$1,390.

&lt;p&gt;New Solution Delivers Hands-on Access to Rich Oilfield Content for Petroleum
Industry
HOUSTON &amp; DUBAI, United Arab Emirates--(Business Wire)--
The Information Store&#174; (iStore) and Infusion Development have expanded the
PetroTrek&#174; Digital Oilfield onto the Microsoft Surface multi-touch presentation
platform. The petroleum industry`s first Surface solution was unveiled at this
year`s Microsoft Global Energy Forum for the Middle East and Africa. 

The co-developed solution combines iStore`s PetroTrek data access technology and
oilfield content visualization on Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 with
Infusion`s custom surface application, Falcon Eye, to give users a powerful new
medium for rapidly accessing and interacting with E information. 

The combined Falcon Eye and PetroTrek Digital Oilfield solution for Microsoft
Surface delivers on the promise of Microsoft`s multi-touch interface with a
revolutionary user experience design that puts the right information at the
fingertips of the right people. The application leverages the GIS capabilities
of Microsoft Virtual Earth to give users a top-to-bottom view of an area of
operation, such as a producing field. 

In addition, it allows users to drill-down to specific points of interest, such
as wells, facilities, and platforms. Production data, charts, key performance
indicators (KPIs), and human resources or logistic information are easily
plotted in context. Users simply touch the Surface interface to interact with
the data, including zooming, panning, and scrolling to display various vantage
points. 

"Out of the box, our new Surface offering gives the petroleum industry a whole
new interface to their world that just a few years ago would have been
considered science fiction," commented Barry Irani, iStore`s President and CEO.
Irani added, "By teaming with Infusion and Microsoft, we are delivering a
Digital Oilfield that leverages the potential of Microsoft`s interactive Surface
technology and extends it to include the specific functionality and content that
makes sense to workers in the business." 

Commenting on the regional value of the offering, Ezat Zarasvand, iStore`s
General Manager for the Middle East and Africa added, "At a time of sinking oil
prices and cost cutting there is strong demand in our industry for
cost-effective, compelling and streamlined technology that quickly plugs in to
the petroleum enterprise to enhance productivity and improve asset value." 

"Falcon Eye, Infusion`s 3D operational dashboard, seamlessly integrates
information from multiple sources and displays the data streams on a virtual
map. Combined with PetroTrek and displayed on the Microsoft Surface, it provides
a unique experience that appeals to everyone," said Vimal Sethi, general
manager, Infusion Development-Middle East &amp; Africa. "The appeal of this solution
is more than its cutting edge appearance, it`s in the functionality. This
solution allows executives to visualize and manage the 'big picture,' but it
also contributes and assists managers and team members in finding, managing and
manipulating E data important to their everyday work." 

The combination of Falcon Eye and the PetroTrek Digital Oilfield for Microsoft
Surface addresses the needs of executives, who can use the solution to manage
"the big picture," and of asset team members, who can use the Surface
applications to find, manage, and manipulate the various E data they need on a
day-to-day basis. 

"Many customers expressed the need for an interactive, collaborative, and
location-intelligent solution to help them better manage asset performance and
empower informed decision making," commented Omar Saleh, Microsoft`s Middle East
&amp; Africa Oil &amp; Gas sales manager. "The combined solution from Infusion and
iStore - leveraging Microsoft`s Surface, Performance Point and Virtual Earth,
provides executives and geoscientists with an unparalleled out-of-the-box user
experience that brings sophisticated asset mapping and drilldown KPI monitoring
to their finger tips, whilst deliver an agile and expandable platform for
collaborative and intelligent asset management."

&lt;p&gt;Students Can Work Abroad for One Year; Popular Jobs Include Scuba Diving and
Surf Instructors
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Arecent study conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employees
(NACE) predicted that employers will hire 22 percent fewer graduates from the
class of 2009 than they did last year, and 67 percent of employers have altered
their hiring plans for the class of 2009. 

With campus recruiting down and the job market flooded with newly laid off
workers, 2009 graduates should consider looking to travel and work across the
Pacific. 

Australia`s one-year-old "Work and Holiday" visa program allows American
students and recent graduates (ages 18 to 30) the opportunity to work and travel
in Australia for a 12-month period. Australia is the first country with which
the United States has entered into a work and holiday visa arrangement. 

"The strength of the U.S. dollar Down Under and the addition of new airlines in
the market, means that American college graduates should seriously consider
taking their trip to work and travel in the land of Oz," said Michelle Gysberts,
Vice President of the Americas, Tourism Australia. 

"Many employers look very favorably upon work and travel abroad, so after
spending up to a year in Australia, graduates will return to the U.S. with a leg
up on the competition," continued Gysberts. 

The visa has sparked the interest of travel agencies and tour operators who
market to the youth sector. 

STA Travel offers travel packages, not including air fare, with `start up kits`
and a selection of professional courses. Each package to become a sailing,
windsurfing or surfing instructor includes accommodations, equipment, exam fees,
and assistance in finding a job. Packages start at $5,445. 

A five-day ranch hand training camp provides experience in horse riding, sheep
shearing and mustering cattle, and includes accommodation, meals and job
placement assistance. Packages start at $785. 

Learn the tricks necessary to become a bartender for $90 for a two-day boot camp
with classes in alcohol service, bar skills and food service. 

"STA provides a starting point and network for young people traveling to
Australia looking for work," said Kristen Celko, vice president for marketing
and ecommerce, STA Travel North America. "The Work and Holiday visa program has
allowed us to expand our services beyond pure travel experiences to include
placements in a wide variety of jobs." 

Current students or those who have deferred may also apply for the visa. While
the GAP year has been popular for years in Australia and Europe, it is a new
concept for American students, and one that is becoming increasingly attractive.
Princeton University now has a new `bridge year` program allowing students to
defer enrollment for a year so that they can go abroad. 

"Australia continues to rank as a desirable destination for Americans,
especially young people. Now, with the ability to support their travel with
work, students can take their own walkabout," concluded Gysberts. 

U.S. citizens wishing to come to Australia must be aged 18 to 30 and can either
apply for the visa online or by completing an application form and lodging it
with the nearest Australian Embassy or Consulate.

&lt;p&gt;  SCOTTSDALE, AZ, Apr 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Informative Graphics Corporation (IGC), a leader in viewing,
collaboration and redaction technology, today announced that its
web-based Brava!(R) Enterprise is now integrated to IBM(R) FileNet(R) P8,
enabling agile Enterprise Content Management (ECM) through multi-format
viewing and collaboration for the enterprise. The newly integrated
solution helps P8 users streamline document-related processes through
fast, accurate viewing, convenient annotation and automated redaction
features.

    Brava provides a simple, unified viewing and annotation interface for all
document and image formats -- even CAD drawings -- making review processes
and workflows easy. The solution includes the ability to output files to
IGC's own Content Sealed Format with Visual Rights(R) persistent file
security, allowing users to expire files when sending them out for review,
bid cycles, and more. Brava, the leading multi-format viewer for secure
content delivery, easily integrates into existing intranet, enterprise
content management, project management and portal solutions, now including
IBM FileNet P8, while honoring user rights, leveraging metadata, and
managing annotations. The comprehensive solution allows enterprises to
automatically view, collaborate, redact and secure sensitive documents.

    Benefits of the Brava integration with IBM FileNet P8 include:


--  Agile ECM - enable business process efficiency

--  Parallel Reviews - allow multiple users to view and annotate
    simultaneously using their own markup files

--  Consolidated Annotation - reviewer can view all approved users
    comments simultaneously (based on P8 usernames)

--  Records Management and Compliance - original document remains
    untouched; markups and annotations are maintained in an overlay file

--  Workflow Automation - start or insert workflow processes based on new
    markup creation, approval status and more, helping speed processes
    

    
"By tightly coupling Brava! Enterprise with the IBM FileNet P8
solution, we provide exceptional business productivity to our mutual
customers," said Gary Heath, CEO of Informative Graphics. "Brava plays
perfectly into IBM's Active Content concept and helps IBM ECM users make
better decisions faster. Our integration marries the need to view and
comment on different file formats with the need for increased content
security within IBM ECM deployments."

    As a participant of the IBM ECM ValueNet Business Partner Program, IGC is
committed to providing both product and service excellence for IBM
customers. This program is comprised of ValueNet partners who combine
FileNet's technology with their own industry-specific expertise to create
custom solutions that meet customers' operational, regulatory and
technical needs.

pointed to a flat to higher open on Tuesday as strong earnings
from Goldman Sachs lifted bank shares and, Johnson  Johnson
results were slightly above forecast, while investors awaited
U.S. retail sales for March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs (GS.N) posted a much higher-than-expected
first-quarter profit, but said it planned a $5 billion common
share sale to help pay back government funds. It's shares
traded down around 2.6 percent before the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Healthcare group Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N) reported first
quarter earnings of $1.26 per share compared with a Reuters
estimate of $1.22 a share and $1.26 a year earlier. The
company's shares rose nearly 2 percent in premarket trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the macroeconomics front, March retail sales are due at
8.30 a.m. (1230 GMT), as are March producer price data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We should see a little uptick in retail sales which should
continue to boost investor confidence today," said Peter
Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup (C.N) shares traded up 14.5 percent to $4.50 in
premarket trade, while Bank of America (BAC.N) rose 5 percent
to $11.59. Goldman Sachs fell 1.6 percent to $128.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 rose 2.9 points and were above fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 rose 19
points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures added 7.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) is set to kick off tech earnings
season, with results eyed closely for guidance on the
semiconductor market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors will also be eyeing comments from U.S. Federal
Chairman Ben Bernanke, who will give a lecture, entitled "Four
questions about the Financial Crisis", at 1.30 p.m. (1730 GMT)
in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other news, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing
people familiar with the matter, that Chrysler's creditors
planned to make a counteroffer to the U.S. Treasury this week
in which they might ask for equity in a firm combining Chrysler
with potential partner Fiat FIA.MI in exchange for
concessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 and Nasdaq rose on Monday as bets that major
banks will post reassuring quarterly results fueled a run-up in
financials, offsetting uneasiness about the fate of General
Motors (GM.N) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow, however, slipped after Boeing (BA.N) said cuts in
output of wide-body planes and lower-than-expected airplane
prices would hurt first-quarter profit.

 (Repeats story sent on April 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Paritosh Bansal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) may succeed in its bid to pay back U.S. taxpayer money
with the help of a $5 billion common share sale, but it may
still not get the freedom it wants from intense public
scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which posted a better-than-expected first-quarter
profit and announced the public offering on Monday, has
navigated the global financial crisis better than many of its
rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its share price has more than doubled since hitting a
record low in November, and is up more than 50 percent this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it may be allowed to return the $10 billion it took
under the U.S. Treasury Department's $700 billion Troubled
Asset Relief Program (TARP), which has become a headache for
recipients with oversight over compensation, expenses and
acquisitions, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But given Goldman's size and importance to the financial
system, regulators may still want to keep a close eye on it,
said Seamus McMahon, an independent banking and regulatory
consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "So the question is, even if they are allowed to do it, how
much of a victory is this actually ultimately?" McMahon said.
"Is it more marketing or does it really give them operating
freedom?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dilemma was underlined on Monday when Goldman posted a
profit as it took on more trading risk and disclosed it was
paying its employees on average in the quarter almost 35
percent more than in the first quarter of the previous fiscal
year. [ID:nN13387020]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To add to regulators' headaches, Goldman's bid to return
the money could prompt other banks that are not in as good
financial condition to seek to do the same, forcing some
difficult policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators would want to be sure that banks that return the
money have enough capital. But they would also be concerned if
a two-tier market is created, with Goldman, Wells Fargo  Co
(WFC.N) and some other banks being seen as strong enough to
thrive or survive without government help, and others such as
Citigroup Inc (C.N) seen as requiring government nursing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides Goldman, others such as Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and
Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) have signaled their eagerness to
pay back the money as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It breaks the ice for somebody big to want to pay it
back," said Chip MacDonald, a banking partner at law firm Jones
Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Treasury Department did not have an immediate
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THROWING THE GAUNTLET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has managed to sidestep most of the pitfalls of the
financial crisis, having posted just one quarterly loss since
the middle of 2007, even as competitors posted four or more
quarters of losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Selling common stock could further strengthen its stake, as
it would boost its tangible common equity (TCE), a key focus
for investors in determining the strength of banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TARP funds did not boost the TCE ratios of banks and so
Goldman's offering would be seen as a positive, MacDonald
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Regulators need to make sure there is adequate capital,"
MacDonald said. "But I don't know why they would resist a
redemption if they feel like there is adequate capital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it would force regulators to make a decision on a
tricky subject sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are throwing the gloves down," McMahon said,
referring to Goldman. "In a way it's signaling to the
government that they are different from the other
institutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I can understand what Goldman's rush is. But the
government can't be in rush to do that," he added.

 By Harry Suhartono

 SINGAPORE, April 14 (Reuters) - Indonesian shares resumed a
rally that has pushed the main index to six-month highs on
Tuesday after a peaceful election boosted investor confidence
in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.

 The Indonesia Stock Exchange Composite Index .JKSE,
gained 1.9 percent, following a more than 5 percent rise a day
earlier. The country's largest coal producer, PT Bumi Resources
Tbk (BUMI.JK), advanced 13 percent.

 "I think the market is still in election euphoria, but we
should be cautious as profit taking could kick in soon," said
Amica Darmawan, analyst at First State Investment in Jakarta,
who helps manage around 1.5 trillion rupiah worth of assets.

 Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur Composite Index .KLSE gained 1.3
percent, and Singapore's benchmark Index .FTSTI rose 1.1
percent, helped by a 7 percent gain in property firm Capitaland
(CATL.SI).

 Philippine shares .PSI edged down 0.3 percent, but
Vietnam stocks .VNI gained 2.1 percent. Thai markets .SETI
were closed for a holiday.

 The Democrat Party of Indonesia's President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono, nearly trebled its share of the vote to around 20
percent in last Thursday's parliamentary elections, exit polls
showed on Monday, raising hopes the reformist president will be
in a stronger position to rule the country.

 Indonesian bank stocks also drove the market up, with top
lender PT Bank Mandiri Tbk (BMRI.JK) up 3.3 percent and PT Bank
Negara Indonesia Tbk (BBNI.JK) gaining 7.7 percent.

&lt;p&gt;  DALLAS, TEXAS, Apr 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
To better serve its professors, faculty and students, the Tarrant County
College District has deployed a unified communications solution from the
Nortel(1) (TSX: NT)(OTCBB: NRTLQ) and Microsoft Innovative Communications
Alliance. By integrating communications with their existing learning and
teaching environments, Tarrant County College District(2) has improved
efficiencies by enhancing collaboration which has enabled the District to
operate faster while lowering their operational expenses.

    "The Innovative Communications Alliance solution enables real-time
collaboration from a familiar Microsoft environment that incorporates
Nortel features and reliability, which reduces and simplifies the time it
takes to communicate. The goal is to provide new technologies that aid
communications and expand the classroom learning environment," said
Dwayne Killins, project technical lead, TCCD.

    "Our students and faculty will be able to reap the benefits of this
technology," said Dr. Mark Workman, vice president of Teaching and
Learning, South East Campus, TCCD. "Faculty will be able to virtually
bring guest speakers directly into their physical and/or virtual
classrooms through the Live Meeting tools. Additionally, our college
administrators should immediately realize tangible benefits, such as
improved quality of work, with the implementation of this new toolset.
The integrated communications solution will not only allow us to improve
our traditional communications, but it will redefine the way that we do
things in the future with students, faculty and staff."

    Joel Hackney, president, Enterprise Solutions, Nortel, said, "Speed,
simplicity and savings drive a significant advantage for our Innovative
Communications Alliance unified communications customers. Tarrant County
College District is realizing the benefits of anywhere-anytime
communications and the result is a more responsive, faster, better
operational model. Especially in the field of education, the ability to
share ideas is of particular importance - this solution provides the
means to do so more effectively."

    In addition to improved operations, the Innovative Communications
Alliance solution helps them identify and reduce their IT costs while
enabling them to deliver new, high-value services with substantially less
effort and over-head than previously possible.

    "We already had both Microsoft and Nortel's technology, so it was a
simple software upgrade and integration from Nortel Services which made
the evolution seamless and efficient. We expect a return on investment
through the improved efficiencies this solution provides in the areas of
desktop conferencing, for example, which reduces travel time to meetings
for district employees," said Ann Fuller, project manager for the TCCD
initiative. "In addition to the work we completed with Nortel, Martin
Patrick and Rick Barksdale, two of our key network experts, were
instrumental in the deployment of this solution."

    Tarrant County College District unified communications solution provides
converged office capabilities using Nortel's Communication Server 1000
and Microsoft's Office Communications Server 2007(2) products.

    Established between Nortel and Microsoft in 2006, the Innovative
Communications Alliance has delivered unified communications to more than
1,200 customers around the world - with more than 200 Nortel service
deployments globally.

    The ICA offers a broad portfolio breadth that delivers unified
communications solutions across a number of areas:

    - Voice, Telephony and Unified Messaging

    - Unified Communications Integrated Branch

    - Conferencing

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), MIPS Technologies, Inc.

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from
the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

U.S. Steel Bending to Pressure

United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) is a leading steel manufacturer in the
U.S. Rising supply from China, low demand from the automotive and residential
sectors and rising labor costs are affecting the company's operations. In order
to consolidate operations, the company has closed several facilities and plans
more shutdowns in the near term. 

Going forward, U.S. Steel's tubular business will be unsustainable, given the
sharp deterioration in energy prices and drilling activity, coupled with the
continued onslaught of imports. These lead us to rate the stock a Hold. 

MIPS Tech Attractively Priced

MIPS Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:MIPS) develops embedded processors and
intellectual property for use in performance-oriented markets, such as digital
entertainment, wired and wireless communications (including broadband access),
office automation, security and automotive markets. The firm continues to drive
bottom-line margins higher in a very difficult environment. 

The valuation on MIPS has become very compelling as the stock has shed 74% from
its 52-week high and the new acquisition has the potential to drive margin
expansion. We would be buyers of the stock at these levels. We feel the
valuation is compelling given the recent pullback in the shares. 

Chevron`s Mixed Guidance

After the market close on Thursday, Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) released its
first-quarter interim update, covering the first two months of the quarter. On
the whole, the update is mixed, with excellent operational performance and
production growth offset by weak commodity-price realizations. 

The best part of the update pertained to upstream volumes, highlighting
Chevron`s "growthy" profile among the super-majors. The company reported that
oil and natural gas production average 2.645 million oil-equivalent barrels per
day -- better than our estimate and 1.8% above the first-quarter 2008 level.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, production would be up an impressive 4%.
We remain comfortable that the company can sustain this operational momentum,
which puts it on track to meet its production target for the year. 

Hold Montpelier Re Pre-Earnings

Prior to the expected release of Montpelier Re Holdings Ltd's (NYSE: MRH) 1Q09
results after market close on April 27, 2009, we maintain our Hold
recommendation. 4Q08 operating earnings were just two pennies short of our
expectations. 4Q08 results were impacted by lower levels of premium writings and
investment income than expected. 

However, the company has begun to benefit from its new operating platforms. The
company is also witnessing positive pricing trends in the majority of its
business lines, ending 22 consecutive months of price reductions. Though
increased demand for reinsurance is expected in 2009 due to weaker capital
adequacy positions and shrinking risk tolerances following the recent widespread
investment and catastrophe losses, we suspect such benefits to be somewhat
restricted due to the economic slowdown. 

Taiwan Semi Fairly Priced at $10

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM) is the world's largest
pure-play foundries. December top and bottom-line results met consensus
estimates. Despite the firm being an industry leader, macro conditions and
inventory issues will be tremendous headwinds in the coming quarters. 

Management has developed a six step plan to combat the industry conditions. We
look for spending to pick up in 2009 for 45-nanometer products, but much of this
will be dependent on macro conditions. We are reiterating our Hold rating with a
target price of $10.00.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - European shares extended gains
in early trading on Tuesday as strong earnings from Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) boosted banks, while firmer metals prices pushed
mining shares higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; At 0753 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European shares was up 1 percent to 785.55 points after closing
2.1 percent higher on Thursday. The index recorded its fifth
weekly gain in a row last week, which was shortened by the Good
Friday holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks were among top gainers on the index, with Barclays
(BARC.L) surging 11.6 percent, Lloyds (LLOY.L) up 9 percent,
Natixis (CNAT.PA) advancing 10 percent and Commerzbank (CBKG.DE)
gaining 11.7 percent.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds index futures, analyst comment)

 LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - European index futures pointed to a mixed open
when trading resumes after the Easter break on Tuesday, as investors digested
strong earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS.N) but a weak start to the European
results season from Philips (PHG.AS).

 Futures for the DJ Euro Stoxx 50 STXEc1 and for France's CAC FCEc1 were
up 0.1 percent, while German DAX futures FDXc1 were down 0.2 percent.

 Goldman posted much higher than expected first quarter profit as it took
more trading risk, and said that it planned a $5 billion common share sale to
help pay back government funds.

 But it lost $1 billion in December 2008 mainly due to trading and investment
losses. Goldman reported the month separately and for the first time on Monday
as Goldman and Morgan Stanley have both changed their financial year to match
calendar years.

 And signs of a troubled economy persisted with General Motors (GM.N) shares
plunging 16 percent on Wall Street on Monday as fears grew that the automaker
would go bankrupt by June 1.

 In Europe, Philips posted a core first quarter loss early on Tuesday, and
analysts said company results in the region were likely to be poor, deflating a
rally that has lifted the index 21 percent from a lifetime low in early March.

 "The Goldman figures are remarkably good but bank results are mercurial and
you have to pick through them carefully. It's not going to be pretty reading on
the corporate results front this quarter," said Justin Urquhart Stewart, finance
director at Seven Investment Management.

 "I would expect a couple of quarters of negative news until people start
rebuilding inventories. Bad news on results should not come as a surprise but it
will be used an excuse to mark down shares," he said.

 Political risk reared its head with North Korea saying it was no longer
bound by an international nuclear disarmament deal and would re-start its plant
that makes arms grade plutonium after the United Nations chastised it for
launching a long range rocket.

  U.S. index futures SPc1 DJc1 NDc1 were 0.8-1.1 percent weaker.

 JP Morgan (JPM.N) reports on Thursday and Citigroup (C.N) on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co and Wells Fargo  Co shares command premium valuations, particularly after a recent rally, but many analysts wonder if worsening loan losses will bring these stocks back to earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two banks, which have largely avoided the mistakes that have hobbled rivals Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), are now the two largest U.S. lenders by market value. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are seen as among the few strong big banks left, which could help them acquire even more troubled assets with regulators' blessings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are awarding them with some of the highest valuations in the financial sector. Wells Fargo (WFC.N) trades at about 1.3 times its book price, or accounting value, while JPMorgan (JPM.N) trades at 0.85 times. Most of their competitors trade at less than 0.7 times book value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These valuations have only been helped by Wells Fargo's report last week that it expected to earn a record $3 billion in the first quarter. JPMorgan is expected to report on Thursday that it also earned a first-quarter profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both banks benefited from a refinancing boom in the first quarter and an uptick in capital markets activity after a brutal fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts caution that these benefits may not last. Credit trends seem to be worsening as unemployment skyrockets. And there may be the risk of shareholder dilution ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both have said they would like to pay back the cash infusions the government forced them to take. If results of regulatory stress tests convince investors that they can withstand a severe recession, the two banks may then have the ability to raise capital on their own to repay the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) showed the danger to investors of further capital raising on Tuesday after its shares fell more than 11 percent following a $5 billion equity offering, although they remain up 41 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It feels like the economy may have turned a corner, but it might not rise in a straight line, and there could be more left to the story of consumer weakness," said Ralph Cole, portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to wonder how much more expensive these shares can get," Cole added. Ferguson Wellman recently sold Wells Fargo shares, but may buy JPMorgan shares if they fall enough, because the company is more diversified than Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a market low on March 6, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo shares have more than doubled as the SP 500 has rallied 26 percent, driven in part by several bank chief executives including JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon saying that January and February were profitable months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE LEFT TO THE STORY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dimon also said that March was tougher, and both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan could continue to wrestle with their large consumer loan exposure -- JPMorgan has about $482 billion of total consumer loan exposure, while Wells Fargo has about $475 billion, including credit cards, mortgages and other loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While consumer loan exposure may hurt the shares of all banks, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo may have further to fall because of their premium valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, with the U.S. government committed to supporting the banking sector and a flurry of wider initiatives to lift the U.S. economy out of a year-long recession, both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan are expected to report stronger earnings this year compared with 2008, excluding one-time items. Some analysts believe the recent rally could be sustained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both banks have undergone massive transformations through acquisitions in the last year. JPMorgan bought the assets of failed thrift Washington Mutual in October and Wells Fargo acquired large rival Wachovia at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expect that before exceptional items JPMorgan will earn $1.48 this year, while they peg Wells Fargo at $1.31, according to Reuters Estimates. On that basis, JPMorgan earned 84 cents a share for 2008 and Wells Fargo earned 75 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond economic concerns, the stress tests could create problems for bank shares. The government is due to complete its stress tests of banking companies in the next few weeks. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until the stress test (results) are known ... I don't think these stocks are going to double again," said Ben Wallace, analyst at Grimes  Company. "The main overhang right now is whether there'll be some dilutive issuance," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to wonder what the upside is for someone like a Wells Fargo over the next 12 months," Ferguson Wellman's Cole said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Apr 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
In the news release, "Berman DeValerio Files Class Action Lawsuit on
Behalf of General Electric Investors," issued earlier today by Berman
DeValerio, we are advised by the firm that the civil action number in the
fourth paragraph should read "09-civ-3787." Complete corrected text
follows.

    Berman DeValerio Files Class Action Lawsuit on Behalf of General Electric
Investors

    NEW YORK, NY -- April 15, 2009 -- The City of Brockton Contributory
Retirement System ("Brockton") sued General Electric Co. ("GE" or the
"Company") today, claiming GE violated federal securities laws by
concealing risks incurred by its financial services unit, General Electric
Capital Services ("GE Capital"), the law firm Berman DeValerio said.

    GE operates worldwide as a technology, media and financial services
company. Almost half of GE's revenues are derived from GE Capital, which
operates in commercial finance, consumer finance, leasing and real estate
services.

    Berman DeValerio (www.bermandevalerio.com) filed the class action
complaint in United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York on behalf of purchasers of GE common stock from September 25,
2008 through and including March 19, 2009 (the "Class Period"). The
lawsuit was also filed on behalf of investors that purchased shares
pursuant or traceable to the Company's $12 billion public offering of
common stock commencing on October 1, 2008 (the "October Offering").

    The complaint, filed as 09-civ-3787, seeks damages for violations of
Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the
"Securities Act"), as well as Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). To receive a copy of the
complaint, please call Berman DeValerio at (617) 542-8300 or click here
to download a copy.

    The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants issued
numerous materially false and misleading statements which caused GE's
securities to trade at artificially inflated prices throughout the Class
Period. More specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants made the
following false and misleading statements in the offering documents for
the October Offering and/or throughout the Class Period: (1) that GE
would not lower its quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share; (2) that the
Company had sufficiently reserved for anticipated loan losses due to
underperforming mortgages issued by GE Capital; (3) that GE Capital would
earn $5 million in revenues in 2009; and (4) that the Company's Triple-A
credit rating was safe.

    The complaint alleges that the truth was slowly disclosed to the public
regarding GE and GE Capital's true financial health and well being in a
series of partial disclosures issued throughout the Class Period. In
response to these disclosures, the Company's share price fell by more than
seventy-five percent -- from a high of more than $26 per share to a low of
approximately $5.90 per share. Thus, Brockton and other members of the
putative class have suffered significant damages as a result of
defendants' alleged fraud.

    If you are a member of the class, you may, no later than May 4, 2009,
request that the Court appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. You
may contact the attorneys at Berman DeValerio to discuss your rights and
interests in the case, or you may submit information online by clicking 
here. Please note: You may also retain counsel of your choice and need
not take any action at this time to be a class member.

    Berman DeValerio is a national law firm representing plaintiffs in
lawsuits against corporate wrongdoers, chiefly for violations of
securities and antitrust laws. The firm has 34 lawyers in Boston, San
Francisco, and Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, updates share to close)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it expects bottlers
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc (CCE.N) and Pepsi Bottling Group Inc
PBG.N to benefit from accelerated soda sales, new
distribution agreements and a possible fall in commodity
prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also added Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS.N) to its
conviction buy list, saying soda volume growth at the beverage
maker was well ahead of expectations as consumers were opting
for sodas over higher-priced alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said in a note dated April 14 that it sees room for
bottlers to lower costs given the favorable prices of key
inputs, particularly aluminum, oil and corn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New distribution agreements are expected to boost domestic
profit at Coca-Cola Enterprises, Pepsi Bottling and
PepsiAmericas Inc PAS.N by more than 500 basis points, the
brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Enterprises has a distribution deal to sell
Hansen Natural Corp's HANS.O Monster energy drinks in parts
of the United States, in Canada and in six Western European
countries, while Pepsi Bottling sells CytoSport Inc's protein
drink Muscle Milk in the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said shares of multi-national soft-drink makers
like Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) "could tread
water in the near term" as quarterly results may show a
slowdown in Coca Cola's international businesses and continued
weakness in PepsiCo's U.S. beverage unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its price targets on shares of Dr
Pepper Snapple to $23 from $20 and Pepsi Bottling to $27 from
$24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Enterprise's shares closed up 2 percent at
$14.37, while shares of Pepsi Bottling closed up 2 percent at
$24.59 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Plano, Texas-based Dr Pepper Snapple closed up 2
percent at $19.78.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Apr 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The City of Brockton Contributory Retirement System ("Brockton") sued
General Electric Co. ("GE" or the "Company") today, claiming GE violated
federal securities laws by concealing risks incurred by its financial
services unit, General Electric Capital Services ("GE Capital"), the law
firm Berman DeValerio said.

    GE operates worldwide as a technology, media and financial services
company. Almost half of GE's revenues are derived from GE Capital, which
operates in commercial finance, consumer finance, leasing and real estate
services.

    Berman DeValerio (www.bermandevalerio.com) filed the class action
complaint in United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York on behalf of purchasers of GE common stock from September 25,
2008 through and including March 19, 2009 (the "Class Period"). The
lawsuit was also filed on behalf of investors that purchased shares
pursuant or traceable to the Company's $12 billion public offering of
common stock commencing on October 1, 2008 (the "October Offering").

    The complaint, filed as 09-civ-3783, seeks damages for violations of
Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the
"Securities Act"), as well as Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). To receive a copy of the
complaint, please call Berman DeValerio at (617) 542-8300 or click here
to download a copy.

    The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants issued
numerous materially false and misleading statements which caused GE's
securities to trade at artificially inflated prices throughout the Class
Period. More specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants made the
following false and misleading statements in the offering documents for
the October Offering and/or throughout the Class Period: (1) that GE
would not lower its quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share; (2) that the
Company had sufficiently reserved for anticipated loan losses due to
underperforming mortgages issued by GE Capital; (3) that GE Capital would
earn $5 million in revenues in 2009; and (4) that the Company's Triple-A
credit rating was safe.

    The complaint alleges that the truth was slowly disclosed to the public
regarding GE and GE Capital's true financial health and well being in a
series of partial disclosures issued throughout the Class Period. In
response to these disclosures, the Company's share price fell by more than
seventy-five percent -- from a high of more than $26 per share to a low of
approximately $5.90 per share. Thus, Brockton and other members of the
putative class have suffered significant damages as a result of
defendants' alleged fraud.

    If you are a member of the class, you may, no later than May 4, 2009,
request that the Court appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. You
may contact the attorneys at Berman DeValerio to discuss your rights and
interests in the case, or you may submit information online by clicking 
here. Please note: You may also retain counsel of your choice and need
not take any action at this time to be a class member.

    Berman DeValerio is a national law firm representing plaintiffs in
lawsuits against corporate wrongdoers, chiefly for violations of
securities and antitrust laws. The firm has 34 lawyers in Boston, San
Francisco, and Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Crude oil prices should stay range bound "for a while" as concerns about high inventory levels and uncertainties over global growth offset measures by OPEC to limit supplies, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said in an interview on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They could spike up, they could spike down, but I think if you look through that volatility they're pretty range bound where they are now until you see a significant turnaround in the economy," Tillerson told Reuters at the World Economic Forum on Latin America. "They are going to be in this range for a while."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil demand may rise in a consistent way only when the global economy rebounds, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, even when the economies of the United States and other countries gain ground, prices will be affected by "very high inventory levels" and "a pretty significant capacity overhang."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Globally, are we at the bottom of it? Of course that would be different for different countries," Tillerson said. "For energy you have to look in a global perspective, so as the global economy bottoms, then stabilizes and begins to turn, that's what will bring the demand back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has continued to invest in oil production in the United States and overseas. Its U.S. oil output has been relatively stable despite lower domestic demand, helping to curtail the use of imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So the domestic capacity is pushing out imports, that's what it's doing," Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jim Marshall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supports Data Center Consolidation with Expanded Support for IBM DB2, Informix,
Cognos Software and IBM i and System z Operating Systems with z/VM and Linux
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Guardium, the database security company, today announced continuing customer
momentum for its database security solutions safeguarding IBM database software.
The world`s leading organizations in financial services, government, retail,
manufacturing, healthcare and other industries have selected Guardium and IBM
software to better manage and protect their enterprise data. 

With today`s news, Guardium also announced sweeping support for a broad range of
IBM server platforms and database software products. The support helps
organizations mitigate risks by protecting sensitive databases across the
enterprise from both internal and external threats, while reducing IT costs with
centralized security policies for heterogeneous infrastructures. It also
supports data center and server consolidation initiatives by providing
continuous, real-time monitoring controls that reduce the risk of concentrating
critical data on shared infrastructures. 

In addition, the company announced that it recently became the first database
security company to achieve IBM Information On Demand Specialty accreditation. 

In the February 2009 report, "Market Overview: Database Security," Forrester
estimates that over 70 percent of all threats to databases come from inside the
enterprise, and that database administrators spend less than 5 percent of their
time on database security. Insider threats are difficult to detect and block
because privileged users typically have unfettered access to sensitive data. In
addition, according to a recent IBM report1, SQL injection attacks were up 134
percent in 2008 and have replaced cross-site scripting as the predominant type
of Web application vulnerability, with attacks spiking to 450,000 per day during
2008. 

Guardium`s scalable enterprise platform streamlines operations with a single
unified set of security policies - for IBM DB2, Informix, Microsoft SQL Server,
Oracle, Sybase, MySQL and Teradata - without performance impact or changes to
database or applications. In addition, Guardium allows customers to:

* Protect against data leakage by looking for unauthorized access to sensitive
tables and sensitive data in query results. 
* Ensure data governance by preventing unauthorized changes to critical data
values or database structures. 
* Discover sensitive data in databases, for compliance with privacy requirements
such as PCI-DSS and NIST 800-53. 
* Enhance database security postures with automated vulnerability management and
configuration auditing.

Guardium`s solution uses real-time, policy-based monitoring to immediately
identify unauthorized or suspicious activities, without relying on traditional
DBMS-resident logs that can easily be disabled by privileged users. In addition,
Guardium S-GATE is the industry`s only solution for blocking administrators from
viewing or changing sensitive data in heterogeneous DBMS environments. 

Customer Momentum

More customers are choosing Guardium and IBM software including:

* Financial Services: 3 of the top 4 global banks, one of the top cardholder
brands, one of the largest U.S. mutual fund companies and a NYSE-traded
financial services company with four data centers managed by IBM Global Business
Services. 
* Government: Critical government agencies in the U.S. and other geographies
worldwide. 
* Retail &amp; Hospitality: 2 of the top 3 global retailers and a major office
supply brand. 
* Manufacturing: Customers include a top 3 auto maker, top 3 aerospace
manufacturer, global beverage brand and global consumer food company. 
* Health Care: Major health care providers and Blue Cross-Blue Shield
organizations. 
* Energy: Some of the world`s largest utilities and energy companies including
National Grid.

"The integrity and confidentiality of our ERP, financial and customer data are
paramount to our company and enable us to serve our millions of customers
safely, reliably and efficiently," said Cindy Peluso, director of information
security, National Grid. "We have selected Guardium's real-time database
monitoring and compliance automation solution to help us meet our compliance
goals for database monitoring." 

Expanded Support for IBM Database Software and Operating Systems

Guardium has added support for some of the most popular IBM database platforms
including:

* IBM DB2 UDB 9 for z/OS, building upon the company`s previously announced
Guardium for Mainframes product. 
* IBM DB2 for IBM i, bringing advanced protection to IBM`s mid-range integrated
platform. 
* IBM DB2 9.5 for Linux, UNIX and Windows, in addition to previous support for
DB2 8 and 9. 
* Cognos 8, for which Guardium now identifies fraud and other unauthorized
activities via application-layer monitoring. This is in addition to previous
support for enterprise applications such as SAP, PeopleSoft and SOA applications
developed for IBM WebSphere Application Server and other middleware platforms. 
* IBM Informix 11.5, supplementing previous support for Informix 9, 10 and 11. 
* System z Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for System
z, providing coverage for all major DBMS platforms running in the IBM z/VM
hypervisor.

"IBM is helping companies address the challenges of managing huge volumes of
data with its Information Agenda approach to quickly transform data into a
strategic asset, and, in turn, make smarter business decisions," said Boris
Bialek, program director for IBM Data Management. "Guardium`s enterprise
database security and real-time monitoring technology supports this approach by
enabling organizations to simplify and unify their infrastructures with the
safety and assurance that they`re not increasing their risk posture." 

Enabling Data Center Consolidation by Enhancing Controls to Mitigate Risks

Many organizations are consolidating data centers to reduce operational costs
and "go green." These initiatives often leverage advanced virtualization
technologies, such as z/VM with Linux, to create a more flexible infrastructure.


This approach requires additional controls because it concentrates risk.
Privileged users with access to the shared infrastructure - such as DBAs,
developers and outsourced personnel - must be prevented from viewing
confidential data in databases. This is challenging because traditional network
security technologies and DBMS-resident controls cannot protect data from
administrators. Monitoring privileged users is also important because attacks,
such as SQL injection, frequently result in the external attacker obtaining
privileged access. Implementing fine-grained access policies is also required
for key regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI-DSS), NIST 800-53 and SAS 70. 

Guardium reduces cost and complexity by replacing manual, time-consuming
log-based processes with centralized and automated controls. In a commissioned
case study conducted by Forrester Consulting2 on behalf of Guardium, Guardium`s
solution delivered a risk-adjusted ROI of 239% with a payback period of less
than 6 months for a F500 global manufacturer with SAP, Siebel and 21 other key
financial applications running on IBM DB2 and Oracle on IBM AIX, and Microsoft
SQL Server. 

Information On Demand Certification

Guardium has become the first database security company to achieve IBM
Information On Demand Specialty accreditation based on its demonstrated skills,
technical solution reviews and proof of market success with IBM customers. The
company previously achieved IBM Advanced Industry-Optimized status for Financial
Markets by demonstrating successful implementations with IBM customers in the
financial services industry, and has been a member of IBM`s prestigious Data
Governance Council since 2005. 

"Real-time database monitoring and data-level access controls help enterprises
with three of their top pain points: preventing data leaks, assuring proper data
governance and reducing operational costs," said Guardium CTO Ron Bennatan,
Ph.D., IBM Gold Consultant and author of Implementing Database Security and
Auditing. "Guardium gives all IBM customers - including mainframe and iSeries
customers - unprecedented visibility and control over their data access

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/c8929d/technology_watch_f) has
announced the addition of the "Technology Watch from The Data Room - Microsoft
Global Energy Forum - Houston, February 2009 Conference" report to their
offering. 

Around 500 attended the Microsoft Global Energy Forum (GEF) to hear from oil
companies like BP, Chevron, Marathon, ConocoPhillips, Shell and around 30 or so
exhibitors. Use of Microsoft's Office suite is pretty much taken as a 'given'
among its oil and gas clients - to the extent that the few references to these
end user tools were the usual caveats about individuals 'managing' too much data
in Excel. 

The centerpiece of the GEF was Microsoft Share Point and the 'business
intelligence' stack which combine to provide monitoring and reporting solutions
in a variety of business contexts from production to refining. SharePoint seems
to offer both business and IT a good balance between development and productized
solutions that integrate with existing systems. A constellation of application
vendors exists to provide point integration with SCADA and ERP systems and a
good line up of consultants and systems integrators are available to do the
donkey work. But SharePoint and business intelligence is not magic, these
projects require data 'issues' to be addressed - and, as Anadarko reports, can
bring about a culture change especially in regard of 'fixing' data issues at
source. Business intelligence also highlights how much business was previously
done in Excel and other 'non systems of record.' 

Shell reported enthusiastically on early results from its trials of social
networking. In a somewhat iconoclastic presentation, Shell found that it is
about technology after all. Tools including project websites, document
repositories, portals, wikis, blogs and forums really are making a difference. A
refreshing change from the old 'knowledge management' days when you weren't
allowed to say that technology was a good thing! A rather overblown 'survey' by
Microsoft and SAIC seemed to back up Shell's findings.

</body></entry><entry author="Jonathan Ford" date="2009-04-15T14:29:02+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersComService4/idUSTRE53E3VN20090415"><headline>Beware Goldman's "dutiful" TARP repayment: Jonathan Ford</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Patriotism, as Dr Johnson once observed, is the last refuge of a scoundrel. So when you hear words like "duty" drip from the lips of a senior executive at Goldman Sachs (GS.N), you instinctively count the spoons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd be right to do so too. Chief financial officer David Viniar's observation that Goldman has a duty to repay the money it received last autumn from the U.S. government as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program may be marginally less cynical than the apercu flung out recently by his boss, Lloyd Blankfein, that investment bankers should be paid less and shouldn't be rewarded for failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not much less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And my, do Blankfein's comments seem cynical in light of the bank's first quarter results. After all, Goldman accrued 50 percent of its quarterly revenues (yes, that's revenues) against payments it plans to make to its employees. That is broadly the same proportion that it paid out to them throughout the boom. No question, then, that Goldman's bankers should do without to pay back the TARP money. With breathtaking cheek, Goldman has also used taxpayers' cash to bail out Jon Winkelried, one of its wealthiest and most senior executives, after he lost too much money in its own hedge funds. And as for clawing back past rewards that turned out to be excessive -- well what about that $70 million you got in 2007, Blankfein?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no senior Goldmanite ever says anything without a purpose. And so it is with Viniar. Goldman may have been through the wars like its rival investment banks -- but it has survived. Because of its controversial hedging strategies (especially the enormous payments received from the taxpayer via AIG) it has thus far weathered the crisis better than rivals. Indeed it has been able to exploit a profitable niche borrowing money cheaply from the Fed and punting it on its own account. In the first quarter, for instance, the value of Goldman's principal equity trades was 4.2 times the business it did for customers, according to NYSE data. So much for serving the client. Meanwhile, along with its fellow survivors it has enjoyed the reduction in competition the slump has brought. It would like to make this reduction permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mighty" Goldman is actually quite vulnerable to the changes that have taken place in the banking world. A large chunk of its shares are still held by employees, whose loyalty to the firm is unlikely to extend to bailing it out -- even were they financially able to support a firm with $850 billion of liabilities. This is not a sound basis upon which to build a diversified financial services firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By repaying the politically-charged TARP money quickly, Goldman aims to draw a distinction between itself and other large recipients, such as Bank of America and Citigroup, which have no hope of paying back their government cash any time soon. Goldman can then get down to the serious business of lobbying Washington to widen the definition of activities that it is permitted to carry on while remaining a bank holding company. Deploying its $164 billion of resources to buy distressed debts with the financial backing of the U.S. Treasury is merely the start. In the long run, given its limitations, Goldman's objective must be to persuade the government, in effect, to treat it as a "broker dealer" (a non-bank securities firm which is able to gear its balance sheet to a far higher level than any Fed-regulated institution) while continuing to enjoy the benefit of being a bank, including the yummy cheap funding. It is a sign of investors' confidence in Goldman's ability to swing this that it has been able to sell $5 billion of equity, at a mere 5 percent discount, much of it to new investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy is an odd mixture of cunning and desperation. After all, Goldman genuinely needs to release itself from the TARP to ensure it can pay employees the vast sums they still expect. That requires a free hand to do what business it likes and to remunerate as it sees fit. Without those two preconditions, the firm could start to break up. Achieving either is not a certainty. Although the administration sees Wall St firms as important financial assets to serve U.S. companies around the globe, the AIG saga -- especially the suggestion that Goldman may in effect have got paid twice by AIG because it hedged its counterparty exposure to the insurer by shorting its shares -- is political poison. This is something Goldman should clear up before any decisions are taken about its future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any event, it would be a historic error to hand Goldman the "get out of jail" card it craves. American taxpayers may regard the repayment of a few billion of TARP money as a good result. But they should be careful what they wish for. They may pay a long-term price for Goldman's "dutiful" act if it leads to a deal in Washington that results in higher prices for investment banking services and greater moral hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  PLEASANTON, CA, Apr 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
180SQUARED, a team of Microsoft(R) Mediaroom(TM) Alumni with extensive
Mediaroom product and services expertise, today announced a new Mediaroom
solution geared towards smaller carriers. While working with Microsoft to
support existing Mediaroom customers with their Software and extensive
Mediaroom Services knowledge, 180SQUARED has also been working towards
developing an end-to-end solution: the goal being to help smaller
carriers in the US to sharpen their business case around IPTV and support
Mediaroom as the middleware of choice.

    Some of the Key Features of the 180SQUARED "Mediaroom in a Box" solution
encompass the following components;


--  Services
    --  Full Architecture and Deployment Services for Mediaroom
    --  B/OSS Integration Service
--  Software
    --  180SQUARED Framework B/OSS Package
        --  Global Operations Manager
        --  B/OSS Interfaces and Work Flow Engine
        --  Basic STB Management
    --  Caller ID

"Some new things have been happening in Microsoft recently," said Amir
Littman, a Founder and Vice President of 180SQUARED. "Recently, Microsoft
has made some major strides in scalability in their software. In addition,
with their use of Virtualization, they've effectively now brought a
solution that used to require a large server foot print to support their
Middleware down to something most smaller carriers can fit into their
CAPEX budget."

    "In addition," says Littman, "there has been a renewed interest in
Microsoft to support these smaller Carriers as they (Microsoft) want to
see continued growth in their XBOX 360 and 'Connected Home' markets. This
has led them to a path that now supports a licensing model more geared
towards supporting smaller carriers."

    180SQUARED's Mediaroom in a Box solution takes advantage of these efforts
in Microsoft to develop a single end-to-end solution that works in
Partnership with smaller Carriers. "The goal is to bring a single
end-to-end solution with all the components carriers are asking for, at
one low price with a quick time to market," states Littman.

    "In addition," says Littman, "there has been a renewed interest in
Microsoft to support these smaller Carriers as they (Microsoft) want to
see continued growth in their XBOX 360 and 'Connected Home' markets. This
has led them to a path that now supports a licensing model more geared
towards supporting smaller carriers."

&lt;p&gt; SEOUL, April 17 (Reuters) - Seoul shares may rise on Friday,
with better-than-expected earnings from JPMorgan (JPM.N) likely
to send Seoul financial issues such as KB Financial Group
(105560.KS) higher after helping lift Wall Street overnight.

 "U.S. peers' firm gains and decent quarterly numbers from
JPMorgan will probably boost market sentiment," said Lee
Jae-mahn, a market analyst at Tong Yang Securities, adding that
the the index was poised to rise to as much as 1,450 within the
second quarter.

 Retail issues such as Lotte Shopping Co Ltd (023530.KS) may

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs Group racked up billions of dollars in trading profits in a volatile first quarter -- but don't expect these lucrative markets to last into the next quarter, or to necessarily benefit other banks, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman and JPMorgan, seen as probable long-term survivors amid the carnage that ravaged most of the industry, boosted their trading risk levels in the first three months of the year to exploit swings in asset prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They both expanded market share following Lehman Brothers' demise in September and Bank of America Corp's capture of Merrill Lynch  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc, another major competitor in past years and under intense scrutiny following a government rescue, will see whether its hobbled financials significantly weakened its trading business when it reports quarterly results on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But trading profits and market-share gains may not be so easy to come by in the second quarter, analysts caution, and it may be too late for other banks like Morgan Stanley -- which reports next Wednesday -- to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about the best it's going to get," said Paul Miller, analyst with FBR Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of good things happened in the first quarter," added Miller, noting the pick up in debt and equity issuance after capital markets stagnated at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's results benefited from debt underwriting in particular, where it finished second in global rankings for quarterly issuance, followed by Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman -- in third, fifth, seventh and ninth places, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For global equity issuance, JPMorgan was again second, followed by Bank of America, with Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs in fourth, sixth and eighth places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the first-quarter mortgage refinancing push led by the U.S. government helped JPMorgan and Wells Fargo  Co, Miller said, and it may have helped other commercial banks including Citi and Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the rush from consumers refinancing mortgages, or from companies raising capital, may slow in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not projecting this quarter's out performance to be sustained for several more quarters," said Michael Wong, analyst at Morningstar Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some indications are that volatility is abating -- the Chicago Board Options Exchange's VIX volatility index has fallen for its third straight day -- and credit spreads may be easing. These shifts could mean less trading opportunities for JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if markets fluctuate further, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs's first-quarter trading revenue of $6.96 billion and $7.15 billion, respectively, could still be under threat if competition heats up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone knows this is the business line that outperformed this quarter," said Wong, adding that as other firms jump onto the bandwagon, there will be more competition for trades and underwriting fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boutique banks have been hiring and expanding into trading as larger banks have trimmed staff in a bid to cut costs. Aladdin Capital, a $15 billion Stamford, Connecticut-based money manager, said on Tuesday it is launching a debt capital markets group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORGAN STANLEY, BofA IN SPOTLIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors' focus for the next week will be on whether Morgan Stanley and Bank of America -- which combined its investment banking unit with Merrill's in January -- have also managed to profit from volatile markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does put a good deal of pressure on Morgan Stanley and the Bank of America unit to have and be able to report strong results," said George Ball, chairman of investment firm the Sanders Morris Harris Group in Houston. "If they do not they will be badly compromised," Ball added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the two last surviving investment banks, Morgan Stanley became a bank holding company along with Goldman Sachs last fall, but it has struggled more than Goldman under losses from complex debt securities and leveraged loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America is also battling mounting losses at Merrill Lynch as well as its own credit card and mortgage units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in general the trading profits from JPMorgan and Goldman indicate that other investment banking units may have prospered, the caveat is that other banks do not have the capital to support the same volume and scale of trading activity as Goldman and JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan and Goldman have some of the best balance sheets in the industry, we can see they benefited from that," said Wong, adding, "Morgan Stanley is not as strong as JPMorgan and Goldman, so they may not have benefited to the extent that JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs did in this environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase on Thursday sold $3 billion in debt that does not have the backing of the U.S. government as the bank aims to boost its capital amid plans to repay government loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debt marks the first time the bank has sold dollar-denominated debt without government backing since a $1.6 billion sale of perpetual securities last August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also completed a 2 billion euro ($2.64 billion) bond sale on March 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Thursday that keeping money that was received under the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) has become a "scarlet letter" and that the bank is waiting for guidance from the government on when it can repay its debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon added that the bank already has enough money to repay the $25 billion in taxpayer funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's ability to sell debt without government backing is "a good sign," said Ricardo Kleinbaum, trading sector specialist at BNP Paribas in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he said, "the question is who follows? Is the banking space going to get bifurcated?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc earlier this week raised $5 billion in a stock sale to help pay back the $10 billion it received from the government. Goldman also said it would return the funds when regulators gave the green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks want to repay TARP to remove restrictions on their compensation and give the government less say in the way the bank is managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the government is unlikely to want to bifurcate the market by giving some banks the freedom to pay executives high levels of compensation, which would create an outflow of people from weaker institutions to stronger ones, said Kleinbaum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government may tell the banks it's too early to repay the funds, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If banks repay the TARP funds, it is also unclear whether they will still have access to funds borrowed under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which allows them to issue debt that is guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems to me that if they repay they should be disqualified from borrowing under the FDIC program," said Kleinbaum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan has issued $39.2 billion in bonds under the TLGP, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's bond sale comprised 10-year bonds that were priced to yield 350 basis points more than comparable U.S. Treasuries, said International Financing Review, a Thomson Reuters service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Karen Brettell; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co on Thursday said first-quarter profit fell, as the deepening recession and rising unemployment hurt its consumer banking business, although they beat analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $2.1 billion, or 40 cents a share, for the three months ended March 31, down from $2.37 billion or 67 cents a share for the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 50 percent to $29.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were down 2.1 percent in electronic premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL HOLLAND, FOUNDER, HOLLAND  CO, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's buy on the rumor, sell on the news. People expected Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to outperform this quarter after the Wells Fargo results, and they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now it's time to take profits. You have the continuing concerns that things are still dicey for the consumer. The provision for loan losses asnd the comments about future provisions show why people are concerned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRIS HOSSAIN, SENIOR SALES MANAGER, ODL SECURITIES, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The headline figure from JP Morgan is certainly reassuring, with EPS coming in above analysts' expectations at 40 cents. The key ingredient will be how the market compares these results versus peers Goldman and Wells Fargo. Comments from CEO Jamie Dimon may well prove to be the catalyst for impetus to the upside."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JONATHAN MONK, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT AERION FUND  MANAGEMENT IN LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results are good, like Goldman's. What is encouraging is their good quality -- they probably added the correct amount to their credit reserves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the way along they had been performing better than the other banks. We own the stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The (sector) results we have seen so far have been better than expected, but I'm not sure about the quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEPHEN POPE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT CANTOR FITZGERALD,  LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally, they were much better than anticipated... The sentiment seems to be that they are making profit and gaining market share in every single strand of activities that they are up to. The fact that this is an institution that all the way along says, we don't need TARP money, we don't want TARP money. It works through in a very good order. I take that as a very encouraging signal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST AT AVALON PARTNERS, IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the surface right now the stock is indicating a little bit higher but I suspect what we'll see is a cautious opening here as these earnings are digested. Of course we have other economic indicators coming out today - jobless claims, housing starts and the Philadelphia Fed. I suspect the housing starts and the JPMorgan earnings could be the market movers for today. However, right now we're indicating just slightly higher in the averages and the reason for that is the market is probably going to wait and see what JP Morgan has to say in the conference call."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sitaraman Shankar, Atul Prakash and Dominic Lau in London and Dan Wilchins, Ryan Vlastelica and Chuck Mikolajczak in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co posted better-than-expected quarterly profit, demonstrating the kind of resilience that allowed Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to assert the bank could pay back the government $25 billion immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank benefited in the first quarter from surging debt trading and underwriting revenue. But weak property and job markets are weighing on the bank and it set aside $10 billion to cover losses on credit cards and consumer loans it manages, twice the amount set aide last year. It also warned it might have to reserve even more if the economy worsens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these difficulties, Dimon said the bank has the money to repay taxpayer funds it received from the U.S. government in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's probably the most positive thing any investor could hear from them," said Rob Lutts, chief investment officer of Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank was forced to take the bailout funds in October under the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could pay it back tomorrow," Dimon said on a conference call, adding that the bank is waiting for guidance from the government on when it can do so. Goldman Sachs Group Inc earlier this week raised $5 billion in a stock sale to help pay back the $10 billion it received from the government. Goldman also said it would return the funds when regulators gave the green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said JPMorgan could raise capital if it wanted to, adding that no bank should be allowed to repay the government before his bank. Keeping money received under TARP has become a "scarlet letter" for banks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were up $1.14 to $33.70 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $34.01 in earlier composite dealings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income available to JPMorgan common shareholders was $1.52 billion, or 40 cents a share, compared with $2.29 billion, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts' average forecast was 30 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income before preferred dividends was $2.14 billion, down from $2.37 billion a year earlier. Revenue increased 45 percent to $25 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit was driven largely by the investment bank, which reported record revenue driven by debt underwriting, and higher volumes in credit trading, emerging markets, currencies and rates businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a "historic" quarter for the investment bank, Dimon said, noting the bank has increased market share across sectors, helped in part by the acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said it was "unreasonable" to expect investment banking to remain as strong as it was in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSUMER WORRIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan largely avoided the losses and writedowns on complex debt securities and subprime mortgages that hurt other banks in 2008, it is heavily exposed to consumer credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank reported net charge-offs of $1.1 billion from home equity loans in the first quarter, compared with $447 million a year ago. Charge-offs for prime mortgages jumped to $312 million from $50 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credit card business reported a loss of $547 million as delinquent loans soared and consumers spent less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have the continuing concerns that things are still dicey for the consumer," said Michael Holland, founder of investment management firm Holland  Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from the bank's retail division was boosted by its acquisition of failed Seattle, Washington-based thrift Washington Mutual Inc last fall, as well as higher mortgage fees and a pickup in refinancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, an increasingly popular measure of capital strength, was about 4.3 percent in the first quarter. That is high compared with weaker competitors, some of which have ratios below 3 percent. The market is not clear about what level is ideal for this ratio and some analysts argue banks should be closer to 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with JPMorgan's capital ratios relatively high, the bank feels comfortable returning money to the United States, Dimon said. JPMorgan has no plans to participate in the government's Public-Private Investment Program, where investors receive U.S. support to buy bad loans and securities from banks, as either an investor or a seller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're certainly not going to borrow from the Federal government because we've learned our lesson about that," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank on Thursday launched a $3 billion 10-year bond, without taking advantage of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp's program for backing bank debt, according to International Financing Review, a Thomson Reuters service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares have outperformed the broader sector so far this year, rising about 3 percent through Wednesday, compared with a 20 percent decline in the KBW Bank Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; additional reporting by Dan Wilchins and Jonathan Stempel; editing by John Wallace and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co and Wells Fargo  Co shares command premium valuations, particularly after a recent rally, but many analysts wonder if worsening loan losses will bring these stocks back to earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two banks, which have largely avoided the mistakes that have hobbled rivals Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc, are now the two largest U.S. lenders by market value. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are seen as among the few strong big banks left, which could help them acquire even more troubled assets with regulators' blessings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are awarding them with some of the highest valuations in the financial sector. Wells Fargo trades at about 1.3 times its book price, or accounting value, while JPMorgan trades at 0.85 times. Most of their competitors trade at less than 0.7 times book value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These valuations have only been helped by Wells Fargo's report last week that it expected to earn a record $3 billion in the first quarter. JPMorgan reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both banks benefited from a refinancing boom in the first quarter and an uptick in capital markets activity after a brutal fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts caution that these benefits may not last. Credit trends seem to be worsening as unemployment skyrockets. And there may be the risk of shareholder dilution ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both have said they would like to pay back the cash infusions the government forced them to take. If results of regulatory stress tests convince investors that they can withstand a severe recession, the two banks may then have the ability to raise capital on their own to repay the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group showed the danger to investors of further capital raising on Tuesday after its shares fell more than 11 percent following a $5 billion equity offering, although they remain up 41 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It feels like the economy may have turned a corner, but it might not rise in a straight line, and there could be more left to the story of consumer weakness," said Ralph Cole, portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to wonder how much more expensive these shares can get," Cole added. Ferguson Wellman recently sold Wells Fargo shares, but may buy JPMorgan shares if they fall enough, because the company is more diversified than Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a market low on March 6, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo shares have more than doubled as the SP 500 has rallied 26 percent, driven in part by several bank chief executives including JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon saying that January and February were profitable months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE LEFT TO THE STORY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dimon also said that March was tougher, and both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan could continue to wrestle with their large consumer loan exposure -- JPMorgan has about $482 billion of total consumer loan exposure, while Wells Fargo has about $475 billion, including credit cards, mortgages and other loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While consumer loan exposure may hurt the shares of all banks, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo may have further to fall because of their premium valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, with the U.S. government committed to supporting the banking sector and a flurry of wider initiatives to lift the U.S. economy out of a year-long recession, both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan are expected to report stronger earnings this year compared with 2008, excluding one-time items. Some analysts believe the recent rally could be sustained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both banks have undergone massive transformations through acquisitions in the last year. JPMorgan bought the assets of failed thrift Washington Mutual in October and Wells Fargo acquired large rival Wachovia at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported net income fell to $2.1 billion, or 40 cents a share, for the three months ended March 31, down from $2.37 billion or 67 cents a share for the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 50 percent to $29.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond economic concerns, the stress tests could create problems for bank shares. The government is due to complete its stress tests of banking companies in the next few weeks. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until the stress test (results) are known ... I don't think these stocks are going to double again," said Ben Wallace, analyst at Grimes  Company. "The main overhang right now is whether there'll be some dilutive issuance," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to wonder what the upside is for someone like a Wells Fargo over the next 12 months," Ferguson Wellman's Cole said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman and JPMorgan, seen as probable long-term survivors amid the carnage that ravaged most of the industry, boosted their trading risk levels in the first three months of the year to exploit swings in asset prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They both expanded market share following Lehman Brothers' demise in September and Bank of America Corp's capture of Merrill Lynch  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc, another major competitor in past years and under intense scrutiny following a government rescue, will see whether its hobbled financials significantly weakened its trading business when it reports quarterly results on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But trading profits and market-share gains may not be so easy to come by in the second quarter, analysts caution, and it may be too late for other banks like Morgan Stanley -- which reports next Wednesday -- to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about the best it's going to get," said Paul Miller, analyst with FBR Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of good things happened in the first quarter," added Miller, noting the pick up in debt and equity issuance after capital markets stagnated at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's results benefited from debt underwriting in particular, where it finished second in global rankings for quarterly issuance, followed by Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman -- in third, fifth, seventh and ninth places, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For global equity issuance, JPMorgan was again second, followed by Bank of America, with Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs in fourth, sixth and eighth places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the first-quarter mortgage refinancing push led by the U.S. government helped JPMorgan and Wells Fargo  Co, Miller said, and it may have helped other commercial banks including Citi and Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the rush from consumers refinancing mortgages, or from companies raising capital, may slow in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not projecting this quarter's out performance to be sustained for several more quarters," said Michael Wong, analyst at Morningstar Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some indications are that volatility is abating -- the Chicago Board Options Exchange's VIX volatility index has fallen for its third straight day -- and credit spreads may be easing. These shifts could mean less trading opportunities for JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if markets fluctuate further, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs's first-quarter trading revenue of $6.96 billion and $7.15 billion, respectively, could still be under threat if competition heats up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone knows this is the business line that outperformed this quarter," said Wong, adding that as other firms jump onto the bandwagon, there will be more competition for trades and underwriting fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boutique banks have been hiring and expanding into trading as larger banks have trimmed staff in a bid to cut costs. Aladdin Capital, a $15 billion Stamford, Connecticut-based money manager, said on Tuesday it is launching a debt capital markets group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORGAN STANLEY, BofA IN SPOTLIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors' focus for the next week will be on whether Morgan Stanley and Bank of America -- which combined its investment banking unit with Merrill's in January -- have also managed to profit from volatile markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does put a good deal of pressure on Morgan Stanley and the Bank of America unit to have and be able to report strong results," said George Ball, chairman of investment firm the Sanders Morris Harris Group in Houston. "If they do not they will be badly compromised," Ball added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the two last surviving investment banks, Morgan Stanley became a bank holding company along with Goldman Sachs last fall, but it has struggled more than Goldman under losses from complex debt securities and leveraged loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America is also battling mounting losses at Merrill Lynch as well as its own credit card and mortgage units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in general the trading profits from JPMorgan and Goldman indicate that other investment banking units may have prospered, the caveat is that other banks do not have the capital to support the same volume and scale of trading activity as Goldman and JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan and Goldman have some of the best balance sheets in the industry, we can see they benefited from that," said Wong, adding, "Morgan Stanley is not as strong as JPMorgan and Goldman, so they may not have benefited to the extent that JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs did in this environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks surged on Thursday as expectations of reassuring results from bellwethers, including Google, lifted technology shares, while JPMorgan's better-than-expected profit added to bank stabilization hopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors, encouraged by recent signs the economic slump may be abating, bet that technology earnings would show upside surprises, driving Google's stock up 2.4 percent to $388.74 ahead of the Web search leader's results after the close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And indeed, Google delivered by reporting a stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit.

&lt;p&gt;Yubico and Collective Software release affordable, integrated one-time-password
authentication solution for Microsoft Active Directory 
SUNNYVALE, Calif. &amp; SPRINGFIELD, Ill.--(Business Wire)--
Collective Software, the premier developer for the Microsoft ISA Server platform
has partnered with Yubico to release AuthLite, an affordable, integrated
multi-factor authentication system designed to secure access to Windows
workstations and Microsoft Active Directory network services including VPN,
Outlook, SharePoint, and CRM. 

"The combination of ease of use, simplicity of configuration,
cost-effectiveness, tight integration with ISA and AD, and exquisite security
makes AuthLite stand out from the crowd," said Thomas Shinder, Microsoft
Forefront Security Specialist at Prowess Consulting. "I highly recommend any
company without a current two-factor authentication solution to consider
AuthLite." 

Organizations throughout the world use Microsoft Active Directory to provide
network services, authenticate users, and manage their IT enterprise. Normally,
Windows user accounts are weakly protected with only a single-factor password.
Different systems exist to extend this security, but they often require
expensive hardware tokens, deployment of reader devices, costly annual service
agreements and confusing user training. 

Collective Software developed AuthLite to incorporate Yubico`s YubiKey, in
addition to the user's normal password. YubiKey's one-touch design emulates a
USB keyboard to enter strong one-time credentials automatically without
expensive hardware or complicated, multiple step logon procedures. 

For maximum security and manageability, YubiKey data is stored within Active
Directory and authentication is accomplished without relying on an external
server on the Internet. The AuthLite software can automatically program each
user's new YubiKey when they visit the Windows "Change Password" screen on their
workstation. In this manner, converting any number of users to the AuthLite
system is easily done without tedious administrative key provisioning. 

AuthLite also enables multi-factor logon to offline workstations, VPN services,
and Extranet portals. The thin, 2 gram YubiKey can easily be carried on a
keychain and used with AuthLite for all secure authentications to the
enterprise. 

A free evaluation of AuthLite can be downloaded from www.AuthLite.com, and
YubiKeys can be ordered from yubico.com/order. 

About Collective Software

Collective Software is the premier filter developer for the Microsoft ISA Server
platform since 2004. They provide innovative solutions to enhance and complement
ISA Server and Microsoft Authentication technologies in the enterprise
environment. Their headquarters are located in Springfield, Illinois.

net. In business since 2007, with over 1,100 customers in 50 countries, the
Yubico technology is rapidly being adopted by developers and web 2.0 companies

U.S. Justice Department agreed to extend some portions of
federal antitrust oversight by 18 months, to May 2011,
according to court papers filed on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft settled U.S. antitrust charges in 2002 that it
abused its dominance of the market for personal computer
operating systems. Court oversight had been scheduled to end on
Nov. 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Justice Department and states involved in the antitrust

"It is a very positive step."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The next status hearing is set for next Wednesday, April
22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has also been tangling with EU authorities, and
the U.S. company has been fined in Europe several times for
allegedly abusing its 95 percent dominance of personal computer
systems through its ubiquitous Windows software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU fined the U.S. software company a record 899 million
euros last year for discouraging software competition, the
biggest ever imposed on a corporation at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 600 MICROSOFT EMPLOYEES ON THE JOB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The extension of U.S. court oversight was not linked to
Microsoft's coming release of Windows 7, the document said.
However, the government needs to "thoroughly review" all the
technical documentation for Windows 7 and that will be possible
only after Microsoft releases the final system documents on
June 30, the court filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even if there were no pending release of Windows 7, (the
government) would recommend the same extension to the final
judgments," the court document said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, in a section of the court document that the
company authored, said more than 600 company employees were
working on the company's communications protocol program to
improve technical documentation provided to licensees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft understands that Windows Operating System
products released during the pendency of the final judgment
must comply with the final judgment and will take all steps
necessary to ensure that compliance including providing (the
government and states) an adequate opportunity to conduct their
compliance review," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. v Microsoft, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia, No. 98-1232

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Pfizer Inc, two leading developers of AIDS drugs, are merging their HIV operations into a new company that will hold nearly a fifth of the market for treatments against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glaxo will initially have an 85 percent stake in the joint venture and Pfizer 15 percent, reflecting Glaxo's stronger position in marketed products, although this could change according to future sales and product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tie-up underlines a growing trend by big pharmaceutical companies to collaborate in the costly and risky process of developing new medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said the partnership showed "creative thinking" by Pfizer, whose laboratories have produced few big-selling medicines over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it plans to provide the venture at least the amount of money it now spends on HIV research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners said on Thursday the new business would be stronger and  broader in scope than either company's individually, and would hold a 19 percent share of the growing market for HIV/AIDS treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both companies are facing some pressures in the HIV area," said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.

(GSK is) getting hit pretty hard from Gilead and Bristol."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new company will have 11 marketed products -- including Glaxo's top-sellers Combivir and Epzicom -- which together generated sales of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) last year, plus a pipeline of six new medicines, of which four are in mid-stage Phase II development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pro forma operating profits were 870 million pounds in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the goals will be to develop new fixed-dose combination therapies, using existing and novel medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new company -- which will be named once it starts operations at the end of the year -- will contract RD services directly from Glaxo and Pfizer, and the parent companies will also be responsible for manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISK SHARING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank analysts said the deal made sense for both sides, with Pfizer's new drug Selzentry filling a gap in Glaxo's portfolio as older compounds come off patent, while Pfizer benefits from Glaxo's greater global HIV distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaxo Chief Executive Andrew Witty said the tie-up was "highly indicative" of the kind of risk-sharing partnerships he wanted to foster, in preference to costly mega-mergers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not interested in a classic big piece of MA in the pharmaceuticals sector," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very focused on bolt-on acquisitions or innovative deal structures which allow us to build more efficient business models.

 (Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks soared on
Thursday as expectations of reassuring results from
bellwethers, including Google, lifted technology shares, while
JPMorgan's better-than-expected profit added to bank
stabilization hopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors, encouraged by recent signs the economic slump
may be abating, bet that technology earnings would show upside
surprises, driving Google's stock up 2.4 percent to $388.74
before the Web search leader's results after the close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And indeed, Google delivered by reporting a
stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit. Its stock popped
up 5 percent to $408.00 in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the regular session, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) rose 5
percent to $36.60, while International Business Machines Corp
(IBM.N) gained 2.6 percent to $101.43. On Nasdaq, Apple Inc
(AAPL.O) shares climbed 3.2 percent to $121.45. The
semiconductor index .SOXX rose 3.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are starting to feel that maybe there's a slight
chance this is not just a bear market rally," said John
O'Brien, senior vice president at MKM Partners LLC in
Cleveland, referring to the market's 28 percent rebound since
the 12-year closing low of March 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are anticipating a pretty good number from
Google," O'Brien told Reuters ahead of Google's earnings
report. "They seem to like to under-promise and
over-deliver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 95.81 points,
or 1.19 percent, to 8,125.43. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX gained 13.24 points, or 1.55 percent, to 865.30. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC jumped 43.64 points, or 2.68
percent, to 1,670.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before the bell, JPMorgan's results beat analysts'
expectations as debt trading and underwriting revenue surged.
For details, see [ID:nN16542451] The news got Wall Street's
day off to a solid start, adding to a string of encouraging
results from other banks, including Wells Fargo's (WFC.N)
strong preliminary figures last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regions Financial (RF.N)  said it will post a first-
quarter profit, pushing the regional banking company's shares
up 34 percent to $6.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan climbed 2.1 percent to $33.24, while
Citigroup (C.N) , due to post quarterly results on Friday,
rose 1.01 percent to $4.01. The KBW Bank index .BKX rose 2.1
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a sign that investor fear may be receding, the CBOE
Volatility Index .VIX, or VIX, dropped for a third straight
day, hitting its lowest close since late September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOR ROSETTA, LIFE BEGINS AT 40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, Rosetta Stone Inc's (RST.N) strong debut
suggested equity investors were becoming more willing to take
on risk. Rosetta Stone's initial public offering was only the
third to price this month, making April the best month since
last July. [ID:nN16131770]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rosetta Stone jumped to $25.12 on the New York Stock
Exchange -- up 40 percent from its IPO price of $18. Also
boosting sentiment were stronger-than-expected quarterly
results from Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N), which boosted
consumer spending hopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The motorcycle maker's shares rose 5.7 percent to $18.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Optimism about the technology sector also received a boost
from cellphone maker Nokia's (NOK1V.HE)(NOK.N) after its
announcement that a drop in demand for its products was
stabilizing, driving its shares up 11.4 percent to $14.88 on
the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in one sign of the recession's impact on consumers,
General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), the second-largest U.S.
mall owner, on Thursday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, making it one of the biggest victims of the credit
crisis yet. [ID:nN16359952]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The day's economic data provided a mixed picture. The
Philadelphia Federal Reserve's survey of regional
manufacturing showed a less drastic contraction, while the
Commerce Department data showed March housing starts fell 10.8
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 510,000 units,
the second lowest on record dating back to 1959.

&lt;p&gt; * Equity split: 85 pct Glaxo, 15 pct Pfizer

 * Scope for cost savings, little near-term earnings impact

 * Glaxo CEO says tie-up indicative of future deals
 (Adds comments from Glaxo CEO, Pfizer, analyst)

 By Ben Hirschler

 LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Pfizer
Inc (PFE.N), two leading developers of AIDS drugs, are merging
their HIV operations into a new company that will hold nearly a
fifth of the market for treatments against the virus.

 Glaxo (GSK.L) will initially have an 85 percent stake in the
joint venture and Pfizer 15 percent, reflecting Glaxo's stronger
position in marketed products, although this could change
according to future sales and product development.

 The tie-up underlines a growing trend by big pharmaceutical
companies to collaborate in the costly and risky process of
developing new medicines.

 Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said the partnership
showed "creative thinking" by Pfizer, whose laboratories have
produced few big-selling medicines over the past decade.

 Pfizer said it plans to provide the venture at least the
amount of money it now spends on HIV research and development.

 The partners said on Thursday the new business would be
stronger and and broader in scope than either company's
individually, and would hold a 19 percent share of the growing
market for HIV/AIDS treatments.

 "Both companies are facing some pressures in the HIV area,"
said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Pfizer's "Selzentry is
not doing as well as it probably could if it had more resources
behind it ... (GSK is) getting hit pretty hard from Gilead
(GILD.O) and Bristol (BMY.N)."

 The new company will have 11 marketed products -- including
Glaxo's top-sellers Combivir and Epzicom -- which together
generated sales of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) last year,
plus a pipeline of six new medicines, of which four are in
mid-stage Phase II development.

 Pro forma operating profits were 870 million pounds in
2008.

 One of the goals will be to develop new fixed-dose
combination therapies, using existing and novel medicines.

 The new company -- which will be named once it starts
operations at the end of the year -- will contract RD services
directly from Glaxo and Pfizer, and the parent companies will
also be responsible for manufacturing.

 RISK SHARING

 Deutsche Bank analysts said the deal made sense for both
sides, with Pfizer's new drug Selzentry filling a gap in Glaxo's
portfolio as older compounds come off patent, while Pfizer
benefits from Glaxo's greater global HIV distribution.

 Glaxo Chief Executive Andrew Witty said the tie-up was
"highly indicative" of the kind of risk-sharing partnerships he
wanted to foster, in preference to costly mega-mergers.

 "We're not interested in a classic big piece of MA in the
pharmaceuticals sector," he told reporters.

 "We are very focused on bolt-on acquisitions or innovative
deal structures which allow us to build more efficient business
models. I don't think you should look at this as a template for
how we plan to do other things, but it is certainly an
example."

 Witty joined Glaxo in 1985 and held a variety of roles
before leaving briefly to work for a biotechnology firm. He
returned to Glaxo in 1990 to help develop Epivir, an HIV
treatment which is a key component of many Glaxo HIV drugs.

 "Glaxo delivered the (HIV) breakthroughs in the late '80s
and early 90s," Witty said. "This transaction absolutely
restates GlaxoSmithKline's commitment to be a leader in this
field," Witty told journalists on a conference call.

 Asked if Glaxo and Pfizer plan to spin off their new
company, Witty said they intend to make it "sustainable."

 Glaxo expects earnings per share dilution of approximately 1
to 2 percent in 2010 and 1 percent in 2011, though this will
reverse as the new company's pipeline starts to generate sales.

 The transaction is expected to be neutral to Pfizer's
earnings in 2009 and slightly accretive in 2010 and 2011.

 Dominique Limet, currently head of Glaxo's Personalised
Medicine Strategy, has been appointed chief executive designate
of the new company.

 There is no cure for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
that causes AIDS, but combinations of drugs can keep the virus
from replicating and damaging the immune system.

 An estimated 33 million people globally are infected with
the AIDS virus, most of them living in Africa and other
developing countries.

&lt;p&gt; * IBM to sell Brocade's ethernet switching products&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Products by Foundry, acquired by Brocade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Brocade shares up 9.1 percent
 (Adds share move, analysts' comments, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ritsuko Ando&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) will begin
selling ethernet switching and routing products from Brocade
Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O), seeking to diversify
partnerships amid increasing rivalry with Cisco Systems Inc
(CSCO.O), sources with knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brocade shares jumped 9.1 percent to $4.57 and analysts
said the expanded partnership with IBM, which the sources said
will be announced later this month, shows Brocade is benefiting
from Cisco's recently announced move to start selling computer
servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco's move was widely seen as a direct challenge to IBM
and Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), which help sell Cisco's routers
and other network equipment through partnerships. Analysts said
IBM and HP may reevaluate their partnerships in favor of
Cisco's smaller rivals like Brocade and Juniper Networks Inc
JNPR.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Avi Cohen, head of research at Avian Securities, said IBM's
move made sense although Cisco, which has begun expanding from
routers and switches to other equipment and software, was not
yet a major threat in the server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When one of your bigger partners decides to be a small
competitor, you typically look for avenues to round out your
offering," he said. "You wouldn't just sit back and wait til
Cisco gained traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp already sells some
Brocade equipment, such as storage-related devices, but will
bolster the relationship by selling switches and routers made
by Foundry Networks, which Brocade acquired late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The expanded partnership will help IBM offer its customers
greater choice and an alternative to its current vendor
partnership with Cisco, said one source who spoke on condition
of anonymity because the announcement has not been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cisco has basically declared war on HP and IBM. And so HP
and IBM want to come back and get into Cisco's key markets and
that's the ethernet space. That's a $20 billion market
opportunity every year," said Brian Marshall, an analyst at
Broadpoint AmTech. He said Brocade would likely gain market
share as a result of the growing rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A very small share shift could have a profound impact on
Brocade's financial model," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials at Brocade and IBM declined to comment, but
Brocade Chief Executive Michael Klayko told Reuters in an
interview earlier this week that the company expects to benefit
from Cisco's growing competition with its partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares rose 2.6 percent to $101.43.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) on
Thursday sold $3 billion in debt that does not have the backing
of the U.S. government as the bank aims to boost its capital
amid plans to repay government loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The debt marks the first time the bank has sold
dollar-denominated debt without government backing since a $1.6
billion sale of perpetual securities last August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also completed a 2 billion euro ($2.64 billion)
bond sale on March 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Thursday that
keeping money that was received under the government's Troubled
Asset Relief Program (TARP) has become a "scarlet letter" and
that the bank is waiting for guidance from the government on
when it can repay its debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon added that the bank already has enough money to repay
the $25 billion in taxpayer funds. For details, see
[ID:nN16542451]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's ability to sell debt without government backing
is "a good sign," said Ricardo Kleinbaum, trading sector
specialist at BNP Paribas in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, he said, "the question is who follows? Is the
banking space going to get bifurcated?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) earlier this week raised $5
billion in a stock sale to help pay back the $10 billion it
received from the government. Goldman also said it would return
the funds when regulators gave the green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks want to repay TARP to remove restrictions on their
compensation and give the government less say in the way the
bank is managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the government is unlikely to want to bifurcate
the market by giving some banks the freedom to pay executives
high levels of compensation, which would create an outflow of
people from weaker institutions to stronger ones, said
Kleinbaum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government may tell the banks it's too early to repay
the funds, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If banks repay the TARP funds, it is also unclear whether
they will still have access to funds borrowed under the
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which allows them
to issue debt that is guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems to me that if they repay they should be
disqualified from borrowing under the FDIC program," said
Kleinbaum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan has issued $39.2 billion in bonds under the TLGP,
according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thursday's bond sale comprised 10-year bonds that were
priced to yield 350 basis points more than comparable U.S.
Treasuries, said International Financing Review, a Thomson
Reuters service.

 (Adds Cummings, AIG comments, background, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Kevin Drawbaugh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) - A U.S. congressman on
Thursday expressed concern about a stake in Goldman Sachs Group

 (Recasts first two paragraphs, updates share price, adds
detail of bond sale)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elinor Comlay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
posted better-than-expected quarterly profit, demonstrating the
kind of resilience that allowed Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to
assert the bank could pay back the government $25 billion
immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank benefited in the first quarter from surging debt
trading and underwriting revenue. But weak property and job
markets are weighing on the bank and it set aside $10 billion
to cover losses on credit cards and consumer loans it manages,
twice the amount set aide last year. It also warned it might
have to reserve even more if the economy worsens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite these difficulties, Dimon said the bank has the
money to repay taxpayer funds it received from the U.S.
government in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's probably the most positive thing any investor could
hear from them," said Rob Lutts, chief investment officer of
Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank was forced to take the bailout funds in October
under the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We could pay it back tomorrow," Dimon said on a conference
call, adding that the bank is waiting for guidance from the
government on when it can do so. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
earlier this week raised $5 billion in a stock sale to help pay
back the $10 billion it received from the government. Goldman
also said it would return the funds when regulators gave the
green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said JPMorgan could raise capital if it wanted to,
adding that no bank should be allowed to repay the government
before his bank. Keeping money received under TARP has become a
"scarlet letter" for banks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares were up $1.14 to $33.70 in afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as
$34.01 in earlier composite dealings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First-quarter net income available to JPMorgan common
shareholders was $1.52 billion, or 40 cents a share, compared
with $2.29 billion, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier.
Analysts' average forecast was 30 cents a share, according to
Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income before preferred dividends was $2.14 billion,
down from $2.37 billion a year earlier. Revenue increased 45
percent to $25 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profit was driven largely by the investment bank, which
reported record revenue driven by debt underwriting, and higher
volumes in credit trading, emerging markets, currencies and
rates businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a "historic" quarter for the investment bank, Dimon
said, noting the bank has increased market share across
sectors, helped in part by the acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he said it was "unreasonable" to expect investment
banking to remain as strong as it was in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONSUMER WORRIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While JPMorgan largely avoided the losses and writedowns on
complex debt securities and subprime mortgages that hurt other
banks in 2008, it is heavily exposed to consumer credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank reported net charge-offs of $1.1 billion from home
equity loans in the first quarter, compared with $447 million a
year ago. Charge-offs for prime mortgages jumped to $312
million from $50 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The credit card business reported a loss of $547 million as
delinquent loans soared and consumers spent less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You have the continuing concerns that things are still
dicey for the consumer," said Michael Holland, founder of
investment management firm Holland  Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue from the bank's retail division was boosted by its
acquisition of failed Seattle, Washington-based thrift
Washington Mutual Inc last fall, as well as higher mortgage
fees and a pickup in refinancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's ratio of tangible common equity to tangible
assets, an increasingly popular measure of capital strength,
was about 4.3 percent in the first quarter. That is high
compared with weaker competitors, some of which have ratios
below 3 percent. The market is not clear about what level is
ideal for this ratio and some analysts argue banks should be
closer to 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with JPMorgan's capital ratios relatively high, the
bank feels comfortable returning money to the United States,
Dimon said. JPMorgan has no plans to participate in the
government's Public-Private Investment Program, where investors
receive U.S. support to buy bad loans and securities from
banks, as either an investor or a seller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're certainly not going to borrow from the Federal
government because we've learned our lesson about that," Dimon
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank on Thursday launched a $3 billion 10-year bond,
without taking advantage of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp's program for backing bank debt, according to
International Financing Review, a Thomson Reuters service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares have outperformed the broader sector so far
this year, rising about 3 percent through Wednesday, compared
with a 20 percent decline in the KBW Bank Index .BKX.

 (Updates to late afternoon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on
Thursday as expectations of reassuring quarterly results from
bellwethers including Google (GOOG.O) lifted technology
shares, while JPMorgan's (JPM.N) better-than-expected profit
added to bank stabilization hopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors bet that technology earnings would show upside
surprises, sending shares of Google up 2.5 percent to $389.00,
Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) up 5.3 percent to $36.70 and those of
International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) up 2.8 percent to
$101.69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are starting to feel that maybe there's a slight
chance this is not just a bear market rally," said John
O'Brien, senior vice president at MKM Partners LLC in
Cleveland, referring to the market's 28 percent rebound since
the 12-year closing low of March 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are anticipating a pretty good number from Google.
They seem to like to under-promise and over-deliver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nasdaq, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares climbed 4.3 percent
to $122.64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also boosting sentiment were stronger-than-expected
quarterly results from Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N)  that
boosted consumer spending hopes. The motorcycle maker's shares
rose 7.8 percent to $18.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI raced up 126.48
115.56 points, or 1.58 percent, to 8,156.10. The Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX climbed 16.62 points, or 1.95 percent,
to 868.68. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC rose 44.17
points, or 2.72 percent, to 1,670.97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Web search leader Google is scheduled to post quarterly
results after the bell. Hewlett-Packard was the Dow's second
top boost, behind IBM, the technology services giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Optimism in the technology sector also received a boost
from cellphone maker Nokia's (NOK1V.HE)(NOK.N) after its
announcement that a drop in demand for its products was
stabilizing, driving its shares up 10.6 percent to $14.77in
New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan climbed 3.1 percent to $33.59, while
those of Citigroup (C.N) , due to post quarterly results on
Friday, rose 3 percent to $4.09. The KBW Bank index .BKX
rose nearly 4 percent.

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
More than 300 Hispanic students and their families from Houston are receiving a
full day of hands-on instruction today to learn how to apply to, attend and pay
for college. Hosted by the Hispanic Scholarship Fund and sponsored by
ExxonMobil, the program is called "Steps for Success Saturday" and is designed
to help many first-generation college attendees navigate through the application
process. 

The free event, held at Stephen F. Austin High School in central Houston,
attracted families from eight Houston high schools in an effort to encourage
more Hispanic students to pursue higher education. 

"At ExxonMobil, we know that not all students have the same advantages when it
comes to educational opportunities," said Truman Bell, senior program officer,
Education and Diversity, at ExxonMobil. "Our goal is to provide students with
the tools and encouragement they need to attend college." 

According the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanics are the fastest-growing minority
group in the United States. At the same time, only 25 percent are currently
attending an institution of higher education. In a study from the Hispanic
Scholarship Fund, 62 percent of Hispanic students reported that they hear about
college opportunities outside their home. 

For ExxonMobil, attracting more people from minority communities to higher
education, particularly in math and science careers, will help support the
country`s competitiveness and is a primary focus of the company`s philanthropic
efforts. 

About Exxon Mobil Foundation:

ExxonMobil Foundation is the primary philanthropic arm of the Exxon Mobil
Corporation in the United States. The Foundation and the Corporation engage in a
range of philanthropic activities that advance education, health and science in
the communities where ExxonMobil has significant operations. In the United

worldwide, of which more than $89 million was dedicated to education. Additional

 (Updates to early afternoon, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday
as JPMorgan's (JPM.N) better-than-expected profit added to
optimism about bank stabilization, while expectations of
reassuring technology results boosted bellwethers like
Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and Google Inc (GOOG.O) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A decline in the shares of energy companies, however,
limited the gains of the Dow Jones industrial average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan climbed almost 2 percent to $33.11,
while those of Citigroup (C.N) , due to post quarterly results
on Friday, rose almost 2 percent to $4.04. The KBW Bank index
.BKX rose nearly 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the technology front, shares of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N)
rose 3.6 percent to $36.10, making the stock the Dow's second
top boost, behind International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N),
up 1.5 percent to $100.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nasdaq, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares jumped 3.6 percent to
$121.87, while Google gained 2.8 percent to $390.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "So far we've had some encouraging news, at least they're
stable and we've got some banks that are making money," said
Frank Lesh, futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading
LLC in Chicago. "Some of these better-than-expected situations
with the banks hold the market up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 7.64 points,
or 0.10 percent, to 8,037.26. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX added 4.22 points, or 0.50 percent, to 856.28. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC rose 22.24 points, or 1.37
percent, to 1,649.04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Optimism in the technology sector received a boost from
cellphone maker Nokia's (NOK1V.HE)(NOK.N) after its
announcement that a drop in demand for its products was
stabilizing, driving its shares up 10 percent in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aside from JPMorgan in the financial sector, Regions
Financial (RF.N)  said it will post a first quarter profit,
sending the regional banking company up more than 26 percent to
$6.31. JPMorgan's results beat analysts' expectations as debt
trading and underwriting revenue surged. For details, see
[ID:nN16542451]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HP shares rose after Citigroup wrote that the company's
quarter was "tracking ahead of guidance and consensus." Google,
the Web Search leader, is due to post quarterly results after
the bell. The mean estimate of analysts polled by Reuters is
for earnings of $4.93 a share and revenue of $5.53 billion in
the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also boosting sentiment were stronger-than-expected
quarterly results from Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N)  that
pointed to some stabilization in consumer spending. The
motorcycle maker's shares rose 6.8 percent to $18.34.
[ID:nN14443324]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the downside, shares of Chevron Corp (CVX.N) were a top
drag on the Dow, off 1.6 percent to $65.62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Downbeat broker comments weighed on American Express
(AXP.N), off 2.7 percent to $20.07. In one sign of the
recession's impact on consumers, General Growth Properties Inc
(GGP.N), the second-largest U.S. mall owner, on Thursday filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, making it one of the
biggest victims of the credit crisis yet. [ID:nN16359952]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The day's economic data provided a mixed picture. The
Philadelphia Federal Reserve's survey of regional manufacturing
showed a less drastic contraction, while the Commerce
Department data showed housing starts fell 10.8 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 510,000 units, the second
lowest on record dating back to 1959.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Leah Schnurr)

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Option traders can't seem to make up their minds about General Electric Company
(NYSE: GE). The blue-chip conglomerate is scheduled to report its first-quarter
earnings before the opening bell tomorrow, and speculative investors have
shifted their focus from puts to calls just ahead of the event. 

Starting with the longer-term picture first, GE's put options have actually been
more popular than calls during the past 2 weeks. The stock's 10-day put/call
volume ratio on the International Securities Exchange (ISE) is 2.65, as traders
have purchased 260,540 puts and 98,300 calls throughout this time frame. This
ratio ranks higher than 98.4% of comparable readings taken during the past year,
indicating a near-peak of pessimism among investors on the ISE.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks rose and bond prices fell on Thursday after better-than-expected results from JPMorgan and regional U.S. manufacturing data that pointed to a less drastic contraction gave investors a reason to cheer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European shares rose to a two-month high, also boosted by the outlook given by cellphone maker Nokia, but U.S. equity gains were muted, with the Dow up slightly as bleak data from around the world reminded investors that any signs of economic recovery were still tentative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq and the SP 500, however, got a lift from Nokia and other techs, as well as from JPMorgan's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dollar and yen rose against the euro and while oil edged higher toward $50 a barrel, gains were limited because of mixed U.S. and Chinese economic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China posted its weakest quarter for growth since quarterly records began in 1992, while weak U.S. housing data and record jobless claims reflected the downturn's tenacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a harsh reminder the recession is not over, General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), the second-largest U.S. mall owner, declared bankruptcy in the biggest real estate failure in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a slew of positive news on the technology front and JPMorgan's (JPM.N) earnings lifted Wall Street's SP 500 and the Nasdaq, as well as European equities. JPMorgan's stock rose 2.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's top cellphone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE)(NOK.N) said a drop in demand for its products was stabilizing, sending its shares up 9 percent in New York. Video game publisher Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) said first-quarter results were better than expected, lifting its shares 3.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your more cyclical, economically sensitive areas have been leading the way," said Henry Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co in Philadelphia. "That gives us further confidence in making the claim the economy has bottomed, and that markets are looking for improvement in the economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After midday, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 10.03 points, or 0.12 percent, at 8,039.65. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 4.22 points, or 0.50 percent, at 856.28..

Roche posted a 7 percent rise in sales and sounded a confident note for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roche gained 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are getting a much better view in terms of what's happening at the corporate level," said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While it's not positive, it's certainly not as gloomy as many market participants had feared," Potts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. and euro zone government bond prices fell after the upbeat corporate results boosted equities and cut the appetite for less risky fixed-income assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury prices fell after the Federal Reserve purchased fewer inflation-protected bonds than it has in recent operations, buying just $1.5 billion of the $15.6 billion submitted by dealers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bund market was also pushed lower by more than 11 billion euros ($14.48 billion) of new French and Spanish bond issuance, which met good demand, easing immediate fears about oversupply as governments fund an array of stimulus packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A contraction in U.S. factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed in April, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, helping push bond prices down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The industrial recession continues, though at a less intense pace than in the early part of the year," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 15/32 in price to yield 2.82 percent.

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration Delivers Industry-Leading Cloudmark Authority&#174; Technology to
Global Forefront Security for Exchange Server Customers


SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Cloudmark, Inc., the global leader in carrier-grade messaging security, today
announced its work with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) to integrate
Cloudmark Authority&#174;, the company`s flagship messaging anti-abuse platform, into
the next generation of Microsoft Forefront Security for Exchange Server.
Cloudmark Authority software delivers fast and highly accurate spam, phishing
and virus protection and was selected as a critical anti-spam engine. Microsoft
Forefront Security for Exchange Server integrates multiple scan engines from
industry-leading security firms to help businesses protect their Microsoft
Exchange Server messaging environments from viruses, worms, spam and
inappropriate content. The solution also integrates on-premise and
hosted-filtering services into a single solution. The collaboration between
Microsoft and Cloudmark further extends the reach of Cloudmark`s messaging
security technology to Microsoft enterprise customers using Forefront Security
for Exchange Server. 

"The next generation of Forefront Security for Exchange is part of Microsoft

that is easier to manage and control," said John Chirapurath, director of
identity and security product management at Microsoft. "We are excited about our
integration with Cloudmark`s content filtering technology, as part of our broad
strategy to provide customers with `business-ready security` that helps

&lt;p&gt;Joins Microsoft Forefront "Stirling" Ecosystem
REDWOOD SHORES, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Imperva&#174;, the Data Security leader, today announced that it will integrate the
Imperva SecureSphere Data Security Suite with Microsoft Forefront code name
"Stirling." This interoperability will allow the exchange of information between
SecureSphere, Forefront "Stirling," and other Forefront-connected security
devices to investigate threats. Imperva will demonstrate this integration during
the RSA Conference next week at booth 417. 

Currently in public beta, Forefront code name "Stirling" is an integrated
security suite that delivers comprehensive protection across endpoint,
application servers and edge solutions with a central management console for
easy administration and enterprise-wide multi product visibility. 

Forefront "Stirling" enables software, hardware, and services vendors to share
and use security event information across the "Stirling" environment and the
broader partner ecosystem. Through the sharing of security event information,
partners can enhance the effectiveness of their security technologies and better
protect customer IT environments. 

SecureSphere - Microsoft Forefront "Stirling" Benefits

SecureSphere`s ability to monitor, understand, block, and audit web application
and database transactions will enable it to contribute security event
information within the Forefront environment. For example, when SecureSphere
detects a malicious request coming from a client infected by a Web worm, it will
issue an assessment so that ForeFront can launch a virus scan and removal
process on that client. The result is that the problem is located and resolved
jointly and quickly by the security ecosystem. 

Since SecureSphere automatically profiles an application`s structure and learns
how users interact with it, deviations from this profile are categorized as
anomalies and generate security alerts, while attacks and unauthorized
operations are blocked. Through the Forefront integration, when SecureSphere
detects suspicious data access it will protect the data and issue an assessment
to Forefront. In response, Forefront "Stirling" will correlate several
assessments from multiple devices and will deduce that the user is compromised.
Detecting a compromised user is very difficult when the real user is not aware
of it, but the SecureSphere-Forefront integration will create the synergy
between multiple security products to enable fast discovery of such conditions. 

"Imperva is pleased to interoperate with Forefront "Stirling", which promises to
create some powerful new ways for organizations to protect their applications,
data, and networks," said Rohit Gupta, vice president of business development
for Imperva. "SecureSphere`s unique ability to monitor, understand, block, and
audit web application and database transactions will be even more powerful with
"Stirling", and enable organizations to detect and correlate threats that today
are invisible." 

"Microsoft is excited to work with Imperva to give our joint customers more
comprehensive and responsive security across the enterprise," said John
Chirapurath, director in the identity and security business group at Microsoft.
"Microsoft is committed to collaborating with top industry vendors and providing
solutions that help organizations more effectively achieve their business goals.
We call this `business-ready security`."

&lt;p&gt;Leading Provider of Real-Time Database Security and Monitoring Announces Support
for Microsoft Forefront "Stirling"
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Guardium, the database security company, today announced that it has joined the
partner ecosystem supporting Microsoft Forefront Codename "Stirling". Currently
in public beta testing, Forefront "Stirling" is an integrated security suite
that delivers comprehensive protection across endpoint, application servers and
edge solutions with a central management console for easy administration and
enterprise-wide multi product visibility. Forefront "Stirling" enables software,
hardware, and services vendors to share and use security event information

result, partners can enhance the effectiveness of their security technologies
and better protect customer IT environments. 

Guardium is the leading provider of database security for heterogeneous DBMS
environments. High profile data breaches, coupled with regulatory compliance
demands, are driving organizations in all industries to implement tighter
controls around their database infrastructures. Guardium`s enterprise security
and monitoring platform safeguards critical data by protecting against both
insider threats and external attacks such as SQL injection while providing
centralized and automated controls that deliver reduced costs and rapid ROI. 

Integration Provides Visibility into Database and Application Layer

enterprise-wide visibility into who is accessing their critical enterprise data,
how that data is being used and any security violations such as failed logins
and database configuration changes. It allows the sharing of Guardium`s
real-time alerts and granular analysis at the database and application layer
with security information from other systems participating in the Security
Assessment Sharing (SAS) framework. 

Guardium`s cross-DBMS solution monitors all SQL transactions without consuming
DBMS resources or relying on trace or transaction logs. It uses fine-grained
security policies to block unauthorized access by privileged users such as DBAs,
while also identifying fraud at the application layer. Guardium provides
comprehensive database security assessments and integrates with advanced SQL
Server 2008 security features such as encrypted SSL connections.

Wave: Enterprise Database Auditing And Real-Time Protection, Q4 2007" by Noel
Yuhanna, October 2007). Guardium is also a past winner of SQL Server Magazine`s
Editor`s Choice Awards in both the "Security" and "Auditing and Compliance"
categories. 

"Microsoft is pleased to work with Guardium to develop interoperability between
Forefront `Stirling` and their platform, in order to give our customers more
comprehensive and responsive security across the enterprise," said John
Chirapurath, director in the identity and security business group at Microsoft
Corp. "Microsoft is committed to collaborating with top industry vendors and

&lt;p&gt; * FTSEurofirst 300 rises 1.8 pct to 2-month highs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Markets advance on JPMorgan, Nokia results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Drugmakers, autos gain on improved sentiment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Atul Prakash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - European shares hit a two-month
high on Thursday as better-than-expected results from JPMorgan
(JPM.N) and soothing comments from the top cellphone maker Nokia
(NOK1V.HE) calmed jittery investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares
ended up 1.8 percent at 802.02 points, the highest closing level
since Feb. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index, which plunged 45 percent in 2008, has surged
about 24 percent since hitting a record low on March 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market continues to find strength from the reporting
season. JPMorgan is the latest in a long list of financials to
come out with better-than-expected results, showing that the
general banking environment is perhaps better than anticipated,"
said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are getting a much better view in terms of what's
happening at the corporate level ...  while it's not positive,
it's certainly not as gloomy as many market participants had
feared," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan was the third U.S. bank to surprise positively and
it seems that the American banks have had a better first quarter
than expected," said Carsten Klude, strategist at M.M. Warburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That is positive for the markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said improved investment banking performance offset
increased losses from credit cards and other consumer debt,
helping Barclays (BARC.L) gain 7.7 percent, Lloyds (LLOY.L) 6.7
percent, Natixis (CNAT.PA) 5.7 percent, UBS (UBSN.VX) 5.4
percent and Dexia (DEXI.BR) 15.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nokia shares surged more than 9 percent after the company
said demand was becoming more predictable in the second quarter,
although its first-quarter earnings came in slightly below
market expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DRUGMAKERS, AUTOS GAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sentiment was also boosted by Swiss drugmaker Roche
(ROG.VX), which brushed off the downturn in the first quarter
and posted a 7 percent rise in sales led by cancer medicine
Avastin, and sounded a confident note for the full year. Its
shares rose 1.8 percent.[ID:nLF588860]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other pharmaceutical companies gathered strength, with Shire
(SHP.L) rising 5 percent, Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) up 5.7 percent
and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) gaining 3.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The auto sector, which has drawn support from government
through purchase incentives and loans, showed some sign of
recovery in Europe, with March new car registrations down 9
percent, about half the fall seen in the quarter. [ID:nLG681209]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Porsche (PSHG_p.DE),
Peugeot (PEUP.PA) and Renault (RENA.PA) were up 1.1-3.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miners followed the broader market trend and gained despite
weaker metals prices. BHP Billiton (BLT.L), Anglo American
(AAL.L), Antofagasta (ANTO.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L), Xstrata
STA.L and Eurasian Natural Resources ENRC.L rose between 0.7
percent and 4.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CAUTION NEEDED?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some analysts advised caution as data continued to be
poor and General Growth Properties (GGP.N), the second-largest
U.S. mall owner, filed for bankruptcy protection in the biggest
real estate failure in U.S. history. [ID:nLG526072]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New U.S. housing starts fell more than expected in March
after a surprise surge the previous month, dealing a blow to
hopes that housing market stability was on the horizon.
[ID:nN15494154]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Is it yet another head fake or the real deal?" Citi said in
a strategy note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The current rally exhibits more of the hallmarks of 'the
real deal'. But we need to progress further through the earnings
downturn and see better news from the real economy and credit
before we feel confident it is not just another head fake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index .FTSE, Germany's DAX
.GDAXI and France's CAC 40 .FCHI were up 1.3-2.1 percent.

 (Updates to midday)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Edward Krudy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - The SP 500 and the Nasdaq
rose on Thursday after JPMorgan posted better-than-expected
earnings and amid a flurry of positive news on the technology
front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow dipped as shares of oil companies pulled back from
a rally starting in early March. Investors remained cautious
as they braced for a raft of earnings and outlooks expected to
shed light on how the battered sector will fare amid lower oil
and gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's top cellphone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE)(NOK.N)
said a drop in demand for its products was stabilizing,
driving its shares up 9 percent in New York, while video game
publisher Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) said first-quarter
results were better than expected and its stock rose 3
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The tech sector has been one of the leaders," said Henry
Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust in
Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Your more cyclical, economically sensitive areas have
been leading the way and that gives us further confidence in
making the claim the economy has bottomed, and that markets
are looking for improvement in the economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slipped 9.00
points, or 0.11 percent, to 8,020.62. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX gained 1.59 points, or 0.19 percent, to
853.65. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC rose 14.41 points,
or 0.89 percent, at 1,641.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aside from JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) healthy results,
Regions Financial (RF.N) said it will post a first quarter
profit. Regions' shares jumped 31 percent. The KBW Bank Index
.BKX rose 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of credit card companies also took a beating
following downbeat broker comments. American Express (AXP.N)
dropped 3.3 percent to $19.95 and its decline weighed on the
Dow. Capital One (COF.N) dropped 1.3 percent to $17.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding to the gloom about the consumer's overextended
state, General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), the
second-largest U.S. mall owner, on Thursday filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors, making it one of
the biggest victims of the credit crisis yet. [ID:nN16359952]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A mixed batch of economic data also limited gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's survey of regional
manufacturing showed a less drastic contraction, corroborating
similar evidence from New York the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The housing sector also offered its share of
disappointment. The Commerce Department said housing starts
fell 10.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
510,000 units, the second lowest on record dating back to
1959.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - European shares climbed to a
two-month closing high on Thursday as better-than-expected
results from JPMorgan (JPM.N) and soothing comments from the top
cellphone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE) calmed jittery investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares
provisionally ended up 1.6 percent at 801.02 points, the highest
closing level since Feb. 11. The index, which plunged 45 percent
in 2008, has surged 24 percent from a record low on March 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market continues to find strength from the reporting
season. JPMorgan is the latest in a long list of financials to
come out with better-than-expected results, showing that the
general banking environment is perhaps better than anticipated,"
said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are getting a much better view in terms of what's
happening at the corporate level...  while it's not positive,
it's certainly not as gloomy as many market participants had
feared," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit
as improved investment banking performance offset increased
losses from credit cards and other consumer debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays (BARC.L) jumped 7.7 percent, Lloyds (LLOY.L) was up
6.7 percent, Natixis (CNAT.PA) rose 5.7 percent, UBS (UBSN.VX)
gained 5.4 percent and Dexia (DEXI.BR) surged 15.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nokia shares jumped more than 9 percent after the company
said demand was becoming more predictable in the second quarter,
although its first-quarter earnings came in slightly below
market expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sentiment was also boosted by Swiss drugmaker Roche
(ROG.VX), which brushed off the downturn in the first quarter,
posting a 7 percent rise in sales led by cancer medicine
Avastin, and sounded a confident note for the full year.
[ID:nLF588860]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its shares rose 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index .FTSE, Germany's DAX
.GDAXI and France's CAC 40 .FCHI were up 1.3-2.1 percent.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) will begin selling ethernet switching and routing products from Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O), seeking to diversify partnerships amid increasing rivalry with Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), sources with knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move, due to be announced later this month, comes after Cisco said it would start selling computer servers to data center customers, moving into direct competition with International Business Machines Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co(HPQ.N), which both help sell Cisco's network equipment through partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said Cisco's move could prompt IBM and HP to reevaluate sales partnerships in favor of other equipment makers like Brocade, as well as Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM already sells some Brocade equipment, such as storage-related devices, but will bolster the relationship by selling switches and routers made by Foundry Networks, which Brocade acquired late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expanded partnership will help IBM offer its customers greater choice and an alternative to its current vendor partnership with Cisco, said one source who spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement has not been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at Brocade and IBM declined to comment, but Brocade Chief Executive Michael Klayko had told Reuters in an interview earlier this week that the company expects to benefit from Cisco's growing competition with its partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brocade shares rose 17 cents, or 4.06 percent, to $4.36. IBM shares rose 72 cents, or 0.73 percent to $99.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Gerald E. McCormick)&lt;/p&gt;

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation  (NYSE:XOM) today congratulated U.S. Doctors for Africa
and African Synergy for organizing the April 20-21 Leadership for Health African
First Ladies Health Summit, the first ever African First Ladies Summit to be
held in the United States. The First Ladies will introduce their domestic and
region-wide efforts across Africa in the areas of maternal health, girls'
education and HIV/AIDS; engage in dialogue with other leaders from the field of
international health; and identify actions in-line with the UN Millennium
Development Goals. ExxonMobil is an organizing partner of the Summit as well as
the presenting sponsor of the U.S. Doctors for Africa Gala to honor the First
Ladies on April 21. 

"The Leadership for Health Summit provides an excellent opportunity to hold
productive discussions about health and development programs in Africa and
partnership strategies for the future," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and
chief executive officer of ExxonMobil. "ExxonMobil congratulates the African
First Ladies, as well as U.S. Doctors for Africa and African Synergy, for their
critical work improving lives, communities and nations in Africa." 

"This Summit is about identifying effective interventions and best practices to
help the First Ladies achieve their objectives for their respective countries
and Africa. Companies such as ExxonMobil play an important role in bringing
together the expertise of the private sector to help move the agenda in health
and development forward," said Ted Alemayhu, Founder and CEO, U.S. Doctors for
Africa. 

Sara Ortwein, vice president, ExxonMobil Development Company and a member of the
ExxonMobil Educating Women and Girls Initiative Advisory Group, will speak to
the African First Ladies on "Building a Lasting Legacy." Ortwein will highlight
compelling reasons for investing in women`s economic leadership and invite
participants to explore how they can use their collective voice through
leadership and advocacy to create a better future for African women. 

Dr. Steven C. Phillips, ExxonMobil`s medical director of Global Issues and
Projects, is participating on a panel entitled "Tackling HIV/AIDS and Malaria:
Multi-partnered approaches for targeting and implementing effective
interventions." Phillips will highlight an innovative partnership with The Johns
Hopkins University-affiliate Jhpiego, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the World Health Organization to provide pregnant women in Africa
with access to life-saving interventions to prevent the transmission of malaria
to their unborn children. 

ExxonMobil has committed $130 million to Africa community outreach programs
since 2000 and has launched two major initiatives to improve the lives of its
African employees, their families and communities. The company established the
Africa Health Initiative in 2000 in support of the Abuja Declaration on Roll
Back Malaria in Africa and its goal to halve malaria deaths by 2010. Since then,
ExxonMobil has committed $54 million to fight malaria through disease
prevention, control and treatment programs in 16 African countries, making
ExxonMobil the largest non-pharmaceutical corporate donor to malaria research
and development efforts and the largest corporate donor to the U.S. government`s
President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). 

Recognizing the integral role that women play as drivers of economic and social
change, in 2005 ExxonMobil launched the Educating Women and Girls Initiative,
which provides training, resources, and support networks to help women in
developing countries fulfill their economic potential. The ExxonMobil Foundation
has committed grants totaling nearly $20 million for programs including
intensive leadership and skills development programs for women from 27 African
countries.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
pointed to a higher open on Thursday as JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) reassured some investors about the health of banks
after it reported better-than-expected quarterly results and
following several reassuring reports on the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nasdaq 100 futures rose sharply after top cellphone maker
Nokia reassured investors by reaffirming its handset market
forecast and a report said that Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O
is willing to resume takeover talks with IBM (IBM.N) if IBM
were to make a stronger commitment to closing a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are some positives out there in tech land.
Activision says they're tracking ahead of their quarter, Nokia
had good earnings, shipments were real strong," said Dave
Rovelli, equities trade at Canaccord Adams in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's top cellphone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE) said

&lt;p&gt;International Tourists` Spending in Canada Rose Three Percent in 2008; Trend
Indicates Tourism Opportunity Around 2010 Vancouver Olympics
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Despite pressures on the global economy, international tourists in Canada spent
US$300 million1 more with their Visa cards in 2008 than they did in 2007,
according to data released today by Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). 

Last year, international visitors to Canada spent more than $9 billion on their
Visa-branded payment cards, contributing to Canada`s tourism economy, which
represents approximately two percent of Canada`s overall GDP.2 Visa card
spending by international visitors in Canada increased from US$8.7 billion in
2007, with U.S. cardholders contributing more than half of the total. Visitors
from Western Europe, Asia and Australia accounted for an additional 23 percent
of Visa card spending. 

"Tourism to Canada is alive and well for Visa cardholders, and is an
increasingly appealing and cost-effective destination for U.S. travelers, as
they accounted for the majority of tourism spending on Visa cards in 20083,"
said Tim Wilson, Head of Visa Canada. "As people all over the world come to use
their Visa cards more frequently for everyday purchases, they are keeping this
habit while on vacation. It`s another way that Visa is better money for
travelers and for those who make their living in the tourism industry." 

Canada`s popularity as a tourism destination stretches to all corners of the
world: 2008 saw increased Visa card spending by visitors from Eastern Europe,
the Caribbean, the Middle East and Africa. This year-over-year growth
underscores the growing stature of Canada as a tourism destination for world
travelers. The survey found that international interest in visiting Canada in
the future is high, with nearly three out of four survey respondents reporting
they are likely to visit Canada in the future. The strongest interest comes from
Mexico, the U.S., China and Japan. 

The Olympic Opportunity

With Canada hosting the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, British
Columbia, the tourism industry is looking for an even bigger boost in revenues.
According to the Visa international tourism survey, one in four respondents said
they are likely to attend the Vancouver Games and the majority of those visitors
also plan to visit other parts of Canada. International respondents reporting
the strongest likelihood of attending the Vancouver Games originated from Brazil
(57 percent), China (52 percent) and Mexico (34 percent). 

"The Vancouver Games provide a strong opportunity to elevate Canada`s global
visibility and attract increased tourism revenues, as we saw with the recent
Beijing Games," Wilson said. 

Where Visitors Come From

Visitors from the United States continue to be the largest contributors to
tourism revenues. According to the Visa tourism survey, 60 percent of U.S.
respondents have visited Canada at least once, compared to 19 percent of all
respondents. In 2008, U.S. visitors spent $5.47 billion on Visa cards while
visiting Canada. Other top contributors to Canada inbound tourism spending in
2008 include: United Kingdom ($603 million); France ($351 million); Australia
($223 million); and Japan ($204 million). 

Where are international tourists spending their money while in Canada? General
retail purchases, such as clothing and food, represented 41 percent of Visa
transactions by international travelers visiting Canada in 2008, totaling more
than $3.7 billion, an increase of more than seven percent from the previous
year. Other major segments include lodging ($1.1 billion), airlines ($628
million) and restaurants ($467 million). 

Canadians` Tourism Intentions Remain Strong

Canadian tourism is a two-way street. Canadian respondents show strong
propensity for international travel over the coming two years - although they
report they will take a more frugal approach to their travel plans. 

The Visa international tourism survey, which polled payment cardholders in
Canada and ten other nations who have traveled internationally in the past two
years, found that a majority of respondents (64 percent) are equally or more
willing to travel compared with one year ago. In fact, 68 percent will likely
plan multiple international trips over the next 24 months. Top anticipated trip
destinations among survey respondents likely to travel internationally in the
next two years include: United States (65 percent); Caribbean (30 percent);
United Kingdom (21 percent); Mexico (21 percent); and France (12 percent). 

However, Canadian travelers are looking for ways to tighten their belt while
traveling. Fifty-one percent report they will plan to travel off-peak for lower
prices, 34 percent will travel to countries where the cost of visiting is less.
In addition, 92 percent report their travel in the next two years will likely be
basic/standard cost or economy/lower class travel. 

Electronic Payment Preferred for International Travel

Survey respondents expressed preference to use credit cards while traveling
abroad in the next year. Sixty-two percent of Canadian respondents prefer to use
a credit card, while just 16 prefer to pay with cash and 11 percent use
travelers checks. Preferred payment methods were selected largely based on three
factors: convenience (76 percent), ease of accessing funds (51 percent) and
security (49 percent). 

About Tourism Outlook: Canada

For the Visa international tourism survey, 5,539 adult consumers aged 18+ were
interviewed as part of an online panel survey hosted by GMI (Global Market
Insite, Inc). Fieldwork took place between December 11, 2008 and January 8,
2009. During the research process, questions are posed to a panel of consumers
and data is collected until various predefined sampling quotas are reached. The
results are then analyzed and sig-tested at a 95% confidence level. For this
summary, the main differences that are interesting and statistically significant
have been described accordingly. 

Visa cardholder spending data cited is based upon a review of tourism spending
on Visa-branded payment cards by international visitors from key source
countries while visiting Canada during the calendar years 2008 (January 1 -
December 31, 2008) and 2007 (January 1 - December 31, 2007). These findings are
based upon VisaVue&#174; Travel data. Visa introduced the VisaVue&#174; Travel tourism
reports to the U.S. tourism industry in 2009 and offers it to a broad audience
of state and convention and visitors bureau destination marketing entities.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported first-quarter 2009 net income of
$2.1 billion, compared with net income of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of
2008. Earnings per share were $0.40, compared with $0.67 in the first quarter of
2008. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "The firm earned
more than $2 billion this quarter, despite extremely high credit costs of $10
billion (including $4 billion added to reserves), largely in Card Services and
Retail Financial Services. Importantly, we generated record firmwide revenue;
record revenue and net income in the Investment Bank; and benefited from
underlying growth in Retail Banking, including increased deposits and checking
accounts, higher mortgage refinancing volumes and excellent progress on the
Washington Mutual integration. We also continued to see solid volumes and
earnings across Commercial Banking, Treasury &amp; Securities Services and Asset
Management." 

As of March 31, 2009, the firm reported a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.3%, or 9.2%
excluding Troubled Asset Relief Program ("TARP") capital from the government.
Tangible common equity compared to risk-weighted assets was 7.2%, the allowance
for credit losses was $28 billion and the firmwide loan loss coverage ratio
stood at 4.53%. Dimon commented: "We remain focused on capital and balance sheet
strength. These levels of capital and reserves, combined with our significant
pre-provision earnings power, enable us to withstand an even worse economic
scenario than we face today." 

Dimon further remarked: "We are maintaining our efforts to help the economy
recover. We continue to lend and have extended approximately $150 billion in new
credit to consumer and corporate customers during the first quarter. We made
additional progress on our foreclosure prevention program, opening the remaining
22 of our 24 new Chase Homeownership Centers during the quarter, and continued
working towards our goal of preventing 650,000 foreclosures by the end of next
year to help keep people in their homes. Throughout this crisis, we have
remained committed to doing our part to help bring stability to the communities
in which we operate and to the financial system overall." 

Looking ahead to the rest of 2009, Dimon concluded: "It is reasonable to expect
additional increases to credit reserves if the economic environment worsens.
Yet, we are confident that even a highly adverse economic scenario would not
compromise our overall strength and stability - or our ability to enhance our
franchises. We remain well-positioned to benefit when the economy recovers and
remain committed to serving our clients, investing in our franchise and building
a stronger company for the future." 

In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a
firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with
GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the
firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded, and for
each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a
tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other
non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of
each line of business, see notes on page 13.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was a record $1.6 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion from the prior
year. The improved results reflected an increase in net revenue, partially
offset by higher noninterest expense and a higher provision for credit losses. 

Net revenue was a record $8.3 billion, an increase of $5.3 billion from the
prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.4 billion, up 14% from the prior
year. Advisory fees were $479 million, flat compared with the prior year. Debt
underwriting fees were $593 million, up 63% from the prior year, driven by
improved bond market conditions, as well as higher loan syndication fees
compared with a weak prior year. Equity underwriting fees were $308 million,
down 14% from the prior year, due to continued challenging market conditions.
Fixed Income Markets revenue was a record $4.9 billion, compared with $466
million in the prior year. The increase was driven by record results in credit
trading, emerging markets and rates, combined with strong results in currencies
and gains of $422 million from the widening of the firm`s credit spread on
certain structured liabilities. These results were offset partially by $711
million of net markdowns on leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments,
as well as $214 million of net markdowns on mortgage-related exposures. Equity
Markets revenue was a record $1.8 billion, up by $797 million from the prior
year, reflecting strong trading results and client revenue, particularly in
prime services, as well as gains of $216 million from the widening of the firm`s
credit spread on certain structured liabilities. Credit Portfolio revenue was
$299 million, down $64 million from the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, compared with $618 million in
the prior year, due to a higher allowance reflecting a weakening credit
environment. Net charge-offs were $36 million, compared with net charge-offs of
$13 million in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses to average loans
retained was 6.68% for the current quarter, compared with 2.55% in the prior
year. Nonperforming loans were $1.8 billion, up by $1.5 billion from the prior
year and $620 million from the prior quarter, reflecting a weakening credit
environment. 

Average loans retained were $70.0 billion, down 5% from the prior year. Average
fair-value and held-for-sale loans were $12.4 billion, down by $7.2 billion, or
37%, from the prior year, as acquisition finance activity declined. 

Noninterest expense was $4.8 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in the prior
year, primarily reflecting higher performance-based compensation expense on
record revenue and the impact of the Bear Stearns merger.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $474 million, compared with a net loss of $311 million in the
prior year, as the positive impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and
positive MSR risk management results were partially offset by an increase in the
provision for credit losses. Compared with the prior quarter, net income
decreased by $150 million, or 24%, due to a decline in MSR risk management
results, an increase in the provision for credit losses, higher servicing
expense and higher FDIC insurance premiums, partially offset by wider loan
spreads. 

Net revenue was $8.8 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion, or 85%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $5.2 billion, up by $2.2 billion, or 70%,
benefiting from the Washington Mutual transaction and wider deposit and loan
spreads. Noninterest revenue was $3.6 billion, up by $1.9 billion, or 113%,
driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, positive MSR risk
management results, higher mortgage production revenue and higher
deposit-related fees. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.9 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion,
or 44%, from the prior year. Delinquency rates increased due to overall weak
economic conditions, while housing price declines continued to drive increased
loss severities, particularly for high loan-to-value home equity and mortgage
loans. The provision included $1.7 billion in additions to the allowance for
loan losses, primarily for the home lending portfolio. Home equity net
charge-offs were $1.1 billion (3.93% net charge-off rate2), compared with $447
million (1.89% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net
charge-offs were $364 million (9.91% net charge-off rate2), compared with $149
million (3.82% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net
charge-offs were $312 million (1.95% net charge-off rate2), compared with $50
million (0.56% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $4.2 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 62%, from
the prior year, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
higher servicing expense, higher mortgage reinsurance losses and higher FDIC
insurance premiums. 

Retail Banking reported net income of $863 million, up by $318 million, or 58%,
from the prior year. Compared with the prior quarter, net income declined by
$177 million, or 17%, due to decreased deposit-related fees, narrower margins on
deposits, higher FDIC insurance premiums and an increase in the provision for
credit losses. 

Net revenue was $4.3 billion, up by $1.8 billion, or 73%, from the prior year,
reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider deposit
spreads and higher deposit-related fees. 

The provision for credit losses was $325 million, compared with $49 million in
the prior year, due to an increase in the allowance for loan losses for Business
Banking loans, reflecting a weakening credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up by $1.0 billion, or 65%, from the prior
year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher FDIC
insurance premiums.

 &#8226; Number of branches grew to 5,186, up 65% from the prior year and down 5% from   
 the prior quarter, primarily due to the consolidation of Washington Mutual

 &#8226; California regional activity included rebranding of 708 Washington Mutual       
 branches and 1,900 ATMs, and opening of nine regional homeownership centers;

Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $389 million, compared with a net loss
of $856 million in the prior year. Compared with the prior quarter, the current
quarter net loss of $389 million improved by $27 million, reflecting wider loan
spreads and higher mortgage production revenue predominantly offset by a decline
in MSR risk management results, an increase in the provision for credit losses
and higher servicing expense. 

Net revenue was $4.5 billion, nearly double the $2.3 billion recorded in the
prior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
mortgage fees and related income and wider loan spreads. The increase in
mortgage fees and related income was driven by higher net mortgage servicing
revenue and higher mortgage production revenue. Mortgage production revenue was
$481 million, up by $105 million, as wider margins on new originations were
offset partially by an increase in reserves for the repurchase of
previously-sold loans and lower mortgage origination volumes. Net mortgage
servicing revenue (which includes loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management
results and other changes in fair value) was $1.2 billion, an increase of $1.0
billion from the prior year. Loan servicing revenue was $1.2 billion, up by $629
million, reflecting 83% growth in third-party loans serviced. MSR risk
management results were positive $1.0 billion, compared with negative $19
million in the prior year. Other changes in fair value of the MSR asset were
negative $1.1 billion, compared with negative $425 million in the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.6 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in
the prior year. The provision reflected weakness in the home equity, mortgage
and student loan portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the
provision for credit losses above for further detail). 

Noninterest expense was $1.6 billion, up by $581 million, or 58%, from the prior
year, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
servicing expense due to increased delinquencies and defaults, and higher
mortgage reinsurance losses.

Discussion of Results:

Net loss was $547 million, a decline of $1.2 billion from the prior year. The
decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by
higher net revenue. 

End-of-period managed loans were $176.1 billion, an increase of $25.2 billion,
or 17%, from the prior year and a decrease of $14.2 billion, or 7%, from the
prior quarter. Average managed loans were $183.4 billion, an increase of $29.8
billion, or 19%, from the prior year and a decrease of $3.9 billion, or 2%, from
the prior quarter. The increase from the prior year in both end-of-period and
average managed loans was predominantly due to the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction while the decrease from the prior quarter reflected
seasonally lower charge volume. Excluding Washington Mutual, end-of-period and
average managed loans were $150.2 billion and $155.8 billion, respectively. 

Managed net revenue was $5.1 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 31%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $4.5 billion, up by $1.3 billion, or
41%, from the prior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction, wider loan spreads and higher average managed loan balances. These
benefits were offset partially by the effect of higher revenue reversals
associated with higher charge-offs and a decreased level of fees. Noninterest
revenue was $647 million, a decrease of $72 million, or 10%, from the prior
year; the decline was driven by lower securitization income, offset by the
impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher merchant servicing
revenue related to the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint
venture. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $4.7 billion, an increase of $3.0
billion, or 179%, from the prior year. The provision reflected a higher level of
charge-offs and an increase of $1.2 billion in the allowance for loan losses,
due to a weakening credit environment. The managed net charge-off rate for the
quarter was 7.72%, up from 4.37% in the prior year and 5.56% in the prior
quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 6.16%, up from 3.66% in the
prior year and 4.97% in the prior quarter. Excluding Washington Mutual, the
managed net charge-off rate for the first quarter was 6.86% and the 30-day
delinquency rate was 5.34%. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $74 million, or 6%, from
the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and the
dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture, predominantly
offset by lower marketing expense.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $338 million, an increase of $46 million, or 16%, from the prior
year, driven by higher net revenue reflecting the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction, offset largely by a higher provision for credit losses.
Compared with the prior quarter, net income decreased by $142 million, or 30%,
driven by a higher provision for credit losses lower net revenue, and higher
noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase of $335 million, or 31%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $980 million, up by $247 million, or 34%,
from the prior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.
Excluding Washington Mutual, net interest income was lower than in the prior
year, as spread compression on liability products was predominantly offset by
double-digit growth in liability balances, a shift to higher-spread liability
products and wider loan spreads. Compared with the prior quarter, net interest
income decreased by $123 million, or 11%, due to spread compression on liability
balances, predominantly offset by wider loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was
$422 million, an increase of $88 million, or 26%, from the prior year,
reflecting record levels of deposit- and lending-related fees. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $752 million, an increase of $46 million,
or 7%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending (a new business
resulting from the Washington Mutual transaction) was $228 million, a decrease
of $15 million, or 6%, from the prior quarter. Revenue from Mid-Corporate
Banking was $242 million, an increase of $35 million, or 17% from the prior
year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $120 million, an increase of $23
million, or 24%, from the prior year due to the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction. 

The provision for credit losses was $293 million, an increase of $192 million,
or 190%, from the prior year, reflecting a weakening credit environment. The
allowance for loan losses to average loans retained was 2.59% for the current
quarter, down from 2.65% in the prior year, reflecting the changed mix of the
loan portfolio resulting from the Washington Mutual transaction; and up from
2.41% in the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were $1.5 billion, up by $1.1
billion from the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction; and up by $505 million from the prior quarter, driven by the effect
of a weakening credit environment across all business segments. Net charge-offs
were $134 million (0.48% net charge-off rate), compared with $81 million (0.48%
net charge-off rate) in the prior year and $118 million (0.40% net charge-off
rate) in the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $553 million, an increase of $68 million, or 14%, from
the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and
higher FDIC insurance premiums.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $308 million, a decrease of $95 million, or 24%, from the prior
year, driven by lower net revenue and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $92 million, or 5%, from the prior
year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $890 million, a decrease of
$163 million, or 15%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower
securities lending balances, primarily as a result of declines in asset
valuations and demand, as well as the effects of market depreciation on assets
under custody, partially offset by higher net interest income. Treasury Services
net revenue was $931 million, an increase of $71 million, or 8%, reflecting
higher liability balances, higher trade revenue and growth across cash
management products. These benefits were offset largely by spread compression on
liability products. TSS firmwide net revenue, which includes net revenue
recorded in other lines of business, was $2.5 billion, a decrease of $69
million, or 3%, compared with the prior year; the decrease was primarily due to
declines in Worldwide Securities Services. Treasury Services firmwide net
revenue grew to $1.6 billion, an increase of $94 million, or 6%, from the prior
year. 

Compared with the prior quarter, TSS net revenue decreased by $428 million, or
19%, driven by lower balances and narrower spreads related to both liability
products and securities lending, as well as lower depositary receipt revenue (in
part due to seasonal revenue in the prior quarter). Liability balances in the
prior quarter reflected increased client deposit activity resulting from recent
market conditions. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million, a decrease of $18
million from the prior year. This improvement in the provision was driven by
lower balances in trade, partially offset by a weakening credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $91 million, or 7% from the
prior year, reflecting higher FDIC insurance premiums and higher expense related
to investment in new product platforms.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $224 million, a decline of $132 million, or 37%, from the prior
year, due to lower net revenue offset partially by lower noninterest expense.
Compared with the prior quarter, net income decreased by $31 million, or 12%,
driven by the effect of lower markets and narrower deposit spreads. 

Net revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $198 million, or 10%, from the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $1.3 billion, a decline of $290 million, or 18%,
due to the effect of lower markets and lower performance fees; these effects
were offset partially by the benefit of the Bear Stearns merger. Net interest
income was $403 million, up by $92 million, or 30%, from the prior year,
predominantly due to higher deposit balances and wider deposit spreads. 

Private Bank revenue declined 2% to $583 million, as the effects of lower
markets and lower placement fees were offset by increased deposit balances and
wider deposit spreads. Institutional revenue declined 6% to $460 million, due to
lower markets and lower performance fees, offset partially by net liquidity
inflows. Private Wealth Management revenue declined 11% to $312 million, due to
the effect of lower markets. Retail revenue declined by 46% to $253 million, due
to the effect of lower markets and net equity outflows. Bear Stearns Brokerage
contributed $95 million to revenue. 

Assets under supervision were $1.5 trillion, a decrease of $105 billion, or 7%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, down by $72
billion, or 6%, from the prior year. The decrease was due to the effect of lower
markets and outflows from non-liquidity products, offset largely by liquidity
product inflows across all segments and the addition of Bear Stearns assets
under management. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were
$349 billion, down $33 billion, due to the effect of lower markets on brokerage
and custody balances, offset by the addition of Bear Stearns Brokerage. 

The provision for credit losses was $33 million, an increase of $17 million from
the prior year, reflecting a weakening credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $25 million, or 2%, from the
prior year, due to lower performance-based compensation and lower
headcount-related expense, offset by the effect of the Bear Stearns merger and
higher FDIC insurance premiums.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see notes on page 13 for further explanation
of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was $25,025 million, $17,226
million, and $16,890 million for the first quarter of 2009, fourth quarter of
2008 and first quarter of 2008, respectively. 

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $2.1 billion, a decrease of $232 million, or 10%, from the prior
year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher provision for credit losses
and higher noninterest expense, predominantly offset by higher net revenue. 

Managed net revenue was $26.9 billion, an increase of $9.0 billion, or 50%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $11.5 billion, up by $3.0 billion, or
35%. The increase was driven by significantly higher trading revenue and
positive MSR risk management results; these were offset partially by the absence
of proceeds from the sale of Visa shares in its initial public offering in the
first quarter of 2008. Net interest income was $15.5 billion, up by $6.1
billion, or 65%, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
investment- and trading-related net interest income, wider loan spreads, and
higher liability balances. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $10.1 billion, up by $5.0 billion,
or 97%, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit
losses was $8.5 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in the prior year,
reflecting higher net charge-offs, as well as increases in the allowance for
credit losses primarily related to credit card loans and home lending.
Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $5.7 billion, compared with $2.5 billion
in the prior year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates of 4.90%2 and
2.68%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion,
compared with $747 million in the prior year, and resulted from an increase in
the allowance for credit losses reflecting a weakening credit environment.
Wholesale net charge-offs were $191 million, compared with net charge-offs of
$92 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.32% and
0.18%, respectively. The firm`s nonperforming assets totaled $14.7 billion at
March 31, 2009, up from the prior-year level of $5.1 billion. 

Noninterest expense was $13.4 billion, up by $4.4 billion, or 50%, from the
prior year. The increase was driven by higher performance-based compensation
expense in the Investment Bank, the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction
and higher FDIC insurance premiums.

 Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:                                             
 a. In addition to analyzing the firm`s results on a reported basis, management    
 analyzes the firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a managed 
 basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm`s definition of managed    
 basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following       
 adjustments.                                                                      
                                                                                   
 First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit 
 card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net   
 charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a  
 managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold  
 in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the        
 earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the        
 earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the 
 concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial 
 performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and 
 decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital,     
 based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting      
 standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet 
 and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card 
 receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, 
 as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the         
 customer`s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans 
 retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed-basis information  
 is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks         
 associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm`s retained   
 interests in securitized loans.                                                   
                                                                                   
 Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of 
 the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly,    
 revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is    
 presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and  
 investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of    
 revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income 
 tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense.          
                                                                                   
 See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase`s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (first       
 quarter 2009) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase`s income statement from a    
 reported basis to a managed basis.                                                
                                                                                   
 b. Tangible Common Equity ("TCE") represents common stockholders' equity (i.e.,   
 total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less identifiable intangible     
 assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities.   
 TCE is, in management's view, a meaningful measure of capital quality.            
                                                                                   
 c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net 
 revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax        
 performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into          
 consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate   
 the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - World stocks jumped higher on 
Thursday after U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase reported
better-than-expected earnings, overwhelming earlier investors'
disappointment about China's economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Wall Street looked set for a mixed start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan (JPM.N) reported first quarter earnings per share
of 40 cents, higher than an expected 30 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MSCI's all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS was up
0.3 percent, on track for a sixth consecutive week of gains. It
has gained 27 percent since hitting a low on March 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier, economic news was the dominant market mover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A day after a mixed set of economic data from the United
States, China said its economy grew more slowly than expected in
the first quarter, but also showing improvements in March,
providing tentative signs that the worst may be behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, data showed U.S. consumer prices in March
posted their first 12-month drop in nearly 54 years, while
industrial production slipped further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, also on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said
economic activity in some parts appeared to be stabilising,
while other data showed that a decline in factory activity in
New York state eased this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After an impressive month-long rally in global equities
investors still appear conflicted between seeing glimmers of
hope that a global economic downturn is showing signs of easing
and other indicators that point to more pain ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was summed up by a Morgan Stanley note:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see green shoots of recovery and expect global growth to
resume in (the second half of 2009). The Great Recession still
has a way to go and the recovery is not likely to be V-shaped."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European shares extended gains after the JPMorgan report and
one from mobile phone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares
was up 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier, Japan's Nikkei stock average .N225 trimmed  gains
to 0.1 percent after the China data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It clung to gains of 12.30 points at 8,755.26 after earlier
touching 9,030.00, one of several recent failed efforts to break
significantly above 9,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOLLAR RISES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yen and dollar rose against other major currencies on
the mixed economic data pushed investors towards perceived safer
assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investors are reassessing whether a recent rally in risk
assets is sustainable and if a economic recovery is taking
place," said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yen was up 0.5 percent against the dollar at 98.87 yen
JPY=, while it was up 0.9 percent against the euro at 130.18
yen EURJPY=.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar was up 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies
.DXY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Euro zone government bond prices fell. Ten-year yields
EU10YT=RR were 5 basis points higher at 3.199 percent.
Two-year bond yields EU2YT=RR were 5 basis points higher at
1.408 percent.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, April 16 (Reuters) - European shares extended
their gains by midday on Thursday after quarterly reports from
mobile phone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE), the global market leader,
and U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; At 1038 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European shares was up 1.1 percent at 796.93 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks added most points to the index, building on morning
gains, after JPMorgan posted first-quarter earnings per share of
$0.40 compared with market expectations of $0.30, according to
Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nokia shares traded 8.8 percent higher after the company
reported first-quarter earnings per share just shy of market
expectations but said the demand picture was growing more
predictable.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported first-quarter 2009 net income of
$2.1 billion, compared with net income of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of
2008. Earnings per share were $0.40, compared with $0.67 in the first quarter of
2008. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "The firm earned
more than $2 billion this quarter, despite extremely high credit costs of $10
billion (including $4 billion added to reserves), largely in Card Services and
Retail Financial Services. Importantly, we generated record firmwide revenue;
record revenue and net income in the Investment Bank; and benefited from
underlying growth in Retail Banking, including increased deposits and checking
accounts, higher mortgage refinancing volumes and excellent progress on the
Washington Mutual integration. We also continued to see solid volumes and
earnings across Commercial Banking, Treasury &amp; Securities Services and Asset
Management." 

As of March 31, 2009, the firm reported a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.3%, or 9.2%
excluding Troubled Asset Relief Program ("TARP") capital from the government.
Tangible common equity compared to risk-weighted assets was 7.2%, the allowance
for credit losses was $28 billion and the firmwide loan loss coverage ratio
stood at 4.53%. Dimon commented: "We remain focused on capital and balance sheet
strength. These levels of capital and reserves, combined with our significant
pre-provision earnings power, enable us to withstand an even worse economic
scenario than we face today." 

Dimon further remarked: "We are maintaining our efforts to help the economy
recover. We continue to lend and have extended approximately $150 billion in new
credit to consumer and corporate customers during the first quarter. We made
additional progress on our foreclosure prevention program, opening the remaining
22 of our 24 new Chase Homeownership Centers during the quarter, and continued
working towards our goal of preventing 650,000 foreclosures by the end of next
year to help keep people in their homes. Throughout this crisis, we have
remained committed to doing our part to help bring stability to the communities
in which we operate and to the financial system overall." 

Looking ahead to the rest of 2009, Dimon concluded: "It is reasonable to expect
additional increases to credit reserves if the economic environment worsens.
Yet, we are confident that even a highly adverse economic scenario would not
compromise our overall strength and stability - or our ability to enhance our
franchises. We remain well-positioned to benefit when the economy recovers and
remain committed to serving our clients, investing in our franchise and building
a stronger company for the future." 

In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a
firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with
GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the
firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded, and for
each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a
tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other
non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of
each line of business, see notes on page 13.

The following discussion compares the first quarter of 2009 with the first
quarter of 2008 unless otherwise noted.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was a record $1.6 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion from the prior
year. The improved results reflected an increase in net revenue, partially
offset by higher noninterest expense and a higher provision for credit losses. 

Net revenue was a record $8.3 billion, an increase of $5.3 billion from the
prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.4 billion, up 14% from the prior
year. Advisory fees were $479 million, flat compared with the prior year. Debt
underwriting fees were $593 million, up 63% from the prior year, driven by
improved bond market conditions, as well as higher loan syndication fees
compared with a weak prior year. Equity underwriting fees were $308 million,
down 14% from the prior year, due to continued challenging market conditions.
Fixed Income Markets revenue was a record $4.9 billion, compared with $466
million in the prior year. The increase was driven by record results in credit
trading, emerging markets and rates, combined with strong results in currencies
and gains of $422 million from the widening of the firm`s credit spread on
certain structured liabilities. These results were offset partially by $711
million of net markdowns on leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments,
as well as $214 million of net markdowns on mortgage-related exposures. Equity
Markets revenue was a record $1.8 billion, up by $797 million from the prior
year, reflecting strong trading results and client revenue, particularly in
prime services, as well as gains of $216 million from the widening of the firm`s
credit spread on certain structured liabilities. Credit Portfolio revenue was
$299 million, down $64 million from the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, compared with $618 million in
the prior year, due to a higher allowance reflecting a weakening credit
environment. Net charge-offs were $36 million, compared with net charge-offs of
$13 million in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses to average loans
retained was 6.68% for the current quarter, compared with 2.55% in the prior
year. Nonperforming loans were $1.8 billion, up by $1.5 billion from the prior
year and $620 million from the prior quarter, reflecting a weakening credit
environment. 

Average loans retained were $70.0 billion, down 5% from the prior year. Average
fair-value and held-for-sale loans were $12.4 billion, down by $7.2 billion, or
37%, from the prior year, as acquisition finance activity declined. 

Noninterest expense was $4.8 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in the prior
year, primarily reflecting higher performance-based compensation expense on
record revenue and the impact of the Bear Stearns merger.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $474 million, compared with a net loss of $311 million in the
prior year, as the positive impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and
positive MSR risk management results were partially offset by an increase in the
provision for credit losses. Compared with the prior quarter, net income
decreased by $150 million, or 24%, due to a decline in MSR risk management
results, an increase in the provision for credit losses, higher servicing
expense and higher FDIC insurance premiums, partially offset by wider loan
spreads. 

Net revenue was $8.8 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion, or 85%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $5.2 billion, up by $2.2 billion, or 70%,
benefiting from the Washington Mutual transaction and wider deposit and loan
spreads. Noninterest revenue was $3.6 billion, up by $1.9 billion, or 113%,
driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, positive MSR risk
management results, higher mortgage production revenue and higher
deposit-related fees. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.9 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion,
or 44%, from the prior year. Delinquency rates increased due to overall weak
economic conditions, while housing price declines continued to drive increased
loss severities, particularly for high loan-to-value home equity and mortgage
loans. The provision included $1.7 billion in additions to the allowance for
loan losses, primarily for the home lending portfolio. Home equity net
charge-offs were $1.1 billion (3.93% net charge-off rate2), compared with $447
million (1.89% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net
charge-offs were $364 million (9.91% net charge-off rate2), compared with $149
million (3.82% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net
charge-offs were $312 million (1.95% net charge-off rate2), compared with $50
million (0.56% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $4.2 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 62%, from
the prior year, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
higher servicing expense, higher mortgage reinsurance losses and higher FDIC
insurance premiums. 

Retail Banking reported net income of $863 million, up by $318 million, or 58%,
from the prior year. Compared with the prior quarter, net income declined by
$177 million, or 17%, due to decreased deposit-related fees, narrower margins on
deposits, higher FDIC insurance premiums and an increase in the provision for
credit losses. 

Net revenue was $4.3 billion, up by $1.8 billion, or 73%, from the prior year,
reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider deposit
spreads and higher deposit-related fees. 

The provision for credit losses was $325 million, compared with $49 million in
the prior year, due to an increase in the allowance for loan losses for Business
Banking loans, reflecting a weakening credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up by $1.0 billion, or 65%, from the prior
year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher FDIC
insurance premiums.

 &#8226; Number of branches grew to 5,186, up 65% from the prior year and down 5% from

 &#8226; California regional activity included rebranding of 708 Washington Mutual       
 branches and 1,900 ATMs, and opening of nine regional homeownership centers;      
 national activity included consolidation of nearly 300 Washington Mutual branches. 


Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $389 million, compared with a net loss
of $856 million in the prior year. Compared with the prior quarter, the current
quarter net loss of $389 million improved by $27 million, reflecting wider loan
spreads and higher mortgage production revenue predominantly offset by a decline
in MSR risk management results, an increase in the provision for credit losses
and higher servicing expense. 

Net revenue was $4.5 billion, nearly double the $2.3 billion recorded in the
prior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
mortgage fees and related income and wider loan spreads. The increase in
mortgage fees and related income was driven by higher net mortgage servicing
revenue and higher mortgage production revenue. Mortgage production revenue was
$481 million, up by $105 million, as wider margins on new originations were
offset partially by an increase in reserves for the repurchase of
previously-sold loans and lower mortgage origination volumes. Net mortgage
servicing revenue (which includes loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management
results and other changes in fair value) was $1.2 billion, an increase of $1.0
billion from the prior year. Loan servicing revenue was $1.2 billion, up by $629
million, reflecting 83% growth in third-party loans serviced. MSR risk
management results were positive $1.0 billion, compared with negative $19
million in the prior year. Other changes in fair value of the MSR asset were
negative $1.1 billion, compared with negative $425 million in the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.6 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in
the prior year. The provision reflected weakness in the home equity, mortgage
and student loan portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the
provision for credit losses above for further detail). 

Noninterest expense was $1.6 billion, up by $581 million, or 58%, from the prior
year, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
servicing expense due to increased delinquencies and defaults, and higher
mortgage reinsurance losses.

Discussion of Results:

Net loss was $547 million, a decline of $1.2 billion from the prior year. The
decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by
higher net revenue. 

End-of-period managed loans were $176.1 billion, an increase of $25.2 billion,
or 17%, from the prior year and a decrease of $14.2 billion, or 7%, from the
prior quarter. Average managed loans were $183.4 billion, an increase of $29.8
billion, or 19%, from the prior year and a decrease of $3.9 billion, or 2%, from
the prior quarter. The increase from the prior year in both end-of-period and
average managed loans was predominantly due to the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction while the decrease from the prior quarter reflected
seasonally lower charge volume. Excluding Washington Mutual, end-of-period and
average managed loans were $150.2 billion and $155.8 billion, respectively. 

Managed net revenue was $5.1 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 31%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $4.5 billion, up by $1.3 billion, or
41%, from the prior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction, wider loan spreads and higher average managed loan balances. These
benefits were offset partially by the effect of higher revenue reversals
associated with higher charge-offs and a decreased level of fees. Noninterest
revenue was $647 million, a decrease of $72 million, or 10%, from the prior
year; the decline was driven by lower securitization income, offset by the
impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher merchant servicing
revenue related to the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint
venture. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $4.7 billion, an increase of $3.0
billion, or 179%, from the prior year. The provision reflected a higher level of
charge-offs and an increase of $1.2 billion in the allowance for loan losses,
due to a weakening credit environment. The managed net charge-off rate for the
quarter was 7.72%, up from 4.37% in the prior year and 5.56% in the prior
quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 6.16%, up from 3.66% in the
prior year and 4.97% in the prior quarter. Excluding Washington Mutual, the
managed net charge-off rate for the first quarter was 6.86% and the 30-day
delinquency rate was 5.34%. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $74 million, or 6%, from
the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and the
dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture, predominantly
offset by lower marketing expense.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $338 million, an increase of $46 million, or 16%, from the prior
year, driven by higher net revenue reflecting the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction, offset largely by a higher provision for credit losses.
Compared with the prior quarter, net income decreased by $142 million, or 30%,
driven by a higher provision for credit losses lower net revenue, and higher
noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase of $335 million, or 31%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $980 million, up by $247 million, or 34%,
from the prior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.
Excluding Washington Mutual, net interest income was lower than in the prior
year, as spread compression on liability products was predominantly offset by
double-digit growth in liability balances, a shift to higher-spread liability
products and wider loan spreads. Compared with the prior quarter, net interest
income decreased by $123 million, or 11%, due to spread compression on liability
balances, predominantly offset by wider loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was
$422 million, an increase of $88 million, or 26%, from the prior year,
reflecting record levels of deposit- and lending-related fees. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $752 million, an increase of $46 million,
or 7%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending (a new business
resulting from the Washington Mutual transaction) was $228 million, a decrease
of $15 million, or 6%, from the prior quarter. Revenue from Mid-Corporate
Banking was $242 million, an increase of $35 million, or 17% from the prior
year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $120 million, an increase of $23
million, or 24%, from the prior year due to the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction. 

The provision for credit losses was $293 million, an increase of $192 million,
or 190%, from the prior year, reflecting a weakening credit environment. The
allowance for loan losses to average loans retained was 2.59% for the current
quarter, down from 2.65% in the prior year, reflecting the changed mix of the
loan portfolio resulting from the Washington Mutual transaction; and up from
2.41% in the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were $1.5 billion, up by $1.1
billion from the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction; and up by $505 million from the prior quarter, driven by the effect
of a weakening credit environment across all business segments. Net charge-offs
were $134 million (0.48% net charge-off rate), compared with $81 million (0.48%
net charge-off rate) in the prior year and $118 million (0.40% net charge-off
rate) in the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $553 million, an increase of $68 million, or 14%, from
the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and
higher FDIC insurance premiums.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $308 million, a decrease of $95 million, or 24%, from the prior
year, driven by lower net revenue and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $92 million, or 5%, from the prior
year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $890 million, a decrease of
$163 million, or 15%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower
securities lending balances, primarily as a result of declines in asset
valuations and demand, as well as the effects of market depreciation on assets
under custody, partially offset by higher net interest income. Treasury Services
net revenue was $931 million, an increase of $71 million, or 8%, reflecting
higher liability balances, higher trade revenue and growth across cash
management products. These benefits were offset largely by spread compression on
liability products. TSS firmwide net revenue, which includes net revenue
recorded in other lines of business, was $2.5 billion, a decrease of $69
million, or 3%, compared with the prior year; the decrease was primarily due to
declines in Worldwide Securities Services. Treasury Services firmwide net
revenue grew to $1.6 billion, an increase of $94 million, or 6%, from the prior
year. 

Compared with the prior quarter, TSS net revenue decreased by $428 million, or
19%, driven by lower balances and narrower spreads related to both liability
products and securities lending, as well as lower depositary receipt revenue (in
part due to seasonal revenue in the prior quarter). Liability balances in the
prior quarter reflected increased client deposit activity resulting from recent
market conditions. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million, a decrease of $18
million from the prior year. This improvement in the provision was driven by
lower balances in trade, partially offset by a weakening credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $91 million, or 7% from the
prior year, reflecting higher FDIC insurance premiums and higher expense related
to investment in new product platforms.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $224 million, a decline of $132 million, or 37%, from the prior
year, due to lower net revenue offset partially by lower noninterest expense.
Compared with the prior quarter, net income decreased by $31 million, or 12%,
driven by the effect of lower markets and narrower deposit spreads. 

Net revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $198 million, or 10%, from the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $1.3 billion, a decline of $290 million, or 18%,
due to the effect of lower markets and lower performance fees; these effects
were offset partially by the benefit of the Bear Stearns merger. Net interest
income was $403 million, up by $92 million, or 30%, from the prior year,
predominantly due to higher deposit balances and wider deposit spreads. 

Private Bank revenue declined 2% to $583 million, as the effects of lower
markets and lower placement fees were offset by increased deposit balances and
wider deposit spreads. Institutional revenue declined 6% to $460 million, due to
lower markets and lower performance fees, offset partially by net liquidity
inflows. Private Wealth Management revenue declined 11% to $312 million, due to
the effect of lower markets. Retail revenue declined by 46% to $253 million, due
to the effect of lower markets and net equity outflows. Bear Stearns Brokerage
contributed $95 million to revenue. 

Assets under supervision were $1.5 trillion, a decrease of $105 billion, or 7%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, down by $72
billion, or 6%, from the prior year. The decrease was due to the effect of lower
markets and outflows from non-liquidity products, offset largely by liquidity
product inflows across all segments and the addition of Bear Stearns assets
under management. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were
$349 billion, down $33 billion, due to the effect of lower markets on brokerage
and custody balances, offset by the addition of Bear Stearns Brokerage. 

The provision for credit losses was $33 million, an increase of $17 million from
the prior year, reflecting a weakening credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $25 million, or 2%, from the
prior year, due to lower performance-based compensation and lower
headcount-related expense, offset by the effect of the Bear Stearns merger and
higher FDIC insurance premiums.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see notes on page 13 for further explanation
of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was $25,025 million, $17,226
million, and $16,890 million for the first quarter of 2009, fourth quarter of
2008 and first quarter of 2008, respectively. 

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $2.1 billion, a decrease of $232 million, or 10%, from the prior
year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher provision for credit losses
and higher noninterest expense, predominantly offset by higher net revenue. 

Managed net revenue was $26.9 billion, an increase of $9.0 billion, or 50%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $11.5 billion, up by $3.0 billion, or
35%. The increase was driven by significantly higher trading revenue and
positive MSR risk management results; these were offset partially by the absence
of proceeds from the sale of Visa shares in its initial public offering in the
first quarter of 2008. Net interest income was $15.5 billion, up by $6.1
billion, or 65%, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
investment- and trading-related net interest income, wider loan spreads, and
higher liability balances. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $10.1 billion, up by $5.0 billion,
or 97%, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit
losses was $8.5 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in the prior year,
reflecting higher net charge-offs, as well as increases in the allowance for
credit losses primarily related to credit card loans and home lending.
Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $5.7 billion, compared with $2.5 billion
in the prior year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates of 4.90%2 and
2.68%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion,
compared with $747 million in the prior year, and resulted from an increase in
the allowance for credit losses reflecting a weakening credit environment.
Wholesale net charge-offs were $191 million, compared with net charge-offs of
$92 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.32% and
0.18%, respectively. The firm`s nonperforming assets totaled $14.7 billion at
March 31, 2009, up from the prior-year level of $5.1 billion. 

Noninterest expense was $13.4 billion, up by $4.4 billion, or 50%, from the
prior year. The increase was driven by higher performance-based compensation
expense in the Investment Bank, the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction
and higher FDIC insurance premiums.

 (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)                 
                                                                                   
 &#8226; Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.3% at March 31, 2009 (estimated), 10.9% at December 
 31, 2008, and 8.3% at March 31, 2008.                                             
 &#8226; Headcount was 219,569 at March 31, 2009, which includes 38,211 from the         
 acquisition of Washington Mutual`s banking operations. The remaining 181,358,     
 which includes headcount from the Bear Stearns merger, reflects a decrease of 808 
 from March 31, 2008                                                               


 Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:                                             
 a. In addition to analyzing the firm`s results on a reported basis, management    
 analyzes the firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a managed 
 basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm`s definition of managed    
 basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following       
 adjustments.                                                                      
                                                                                   
 First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit 
 card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net   
 charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a  
 managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold  
 in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the        
 earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the        
 earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the 
 concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial 
 performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and 
 decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital,     
 based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting      
 standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet 
 and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card 
 receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, 
 as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the         
 customer`s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans 
 retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed-basis information  
 is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks         
 associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm`s retained   
 interests in securitized loans.                                                   
                                                                                   
 Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of 
 the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly,    
 revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is    
 presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and  
 investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of    
 revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income 
 tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense.          
                                                                                   
 See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase`s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (first       
 quarter 2009) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase`s income statement from a    
 reported basis to a managed basis.                                                
                                                                                   
 b. Tangible Common Equity ("TCE") represents common stockholders' equity (i.e.,   
 total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less identifiable intangible     
 assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities.   
 TCE is, in management's view, a meaningful measure of capital quality.            
                                                                                   
 c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net 
 revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax        
 performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into          
 consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate   
 the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors.

 (b) Effective January 1, 2009, the Firm adopted FSP EITF 03-6-1. Accordingly, prior period numbers have been revised as required. For further discussion of this FSP, see page 36 of JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release 
 Financial Supplement.

 (d) Net income applicable to common stock divided by total average common equity (net of goodwill). The Firm uses return on equity less goodwill, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of the 
 Firm. The Firm also utilizes this measure to facilitate comparisons to competitors.                                                                                                   
 (e) Tangible common equity ("TCE") represents common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill, net of related 
 deferred tax liabilities. For further discussion of TCE, see page 35 of JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement.

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL, April 16 (Reuters) - South Korean state-run firms
are in talks with operators of a multi-billion dollar liquefied
natural gas (LNG) project in Papua New Guinea for a steady
supply of the super-cooled gas, Export-Import Bank of Korea
(KEXIM) said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; KEXIM, often involved in South Korea's overseas energy
projects, is looking to support Exxon Mobil Ltd (XOM.N) and its
partners in the $17 billion-plus project, on condition that
Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) (036460.KS) is picked to receive steady
supply of LNG from the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; South Korea, heavily dependent on foreign reserves for
energy, generates about 20 percent of its power through LNG.
KOGAS is the world's largest commercial LNG buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With KOGAS, we're in talks with partners of the project
including Exxon. As a state-run bank, it is inappropriate for
us to support a project that a Korean company is not involved
in," said the company's spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The talks are at a preliminary stage, but KOGAS' stance is
that KEXIM's support would be possible if they are picked as
the off-setter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil and its partners are seeking $9 billion in debt
financing for the LNG project, looking to raise the funds from
a combination of loans from export credit agencies, bonds and
commercial bank loans, to supplement a $3 billion loan from
Exxon itself. [ID:nSYD398268]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, the project operators also need to raise
another $5 billion in equity, based on their target
debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other partners in the project are Oil Search Ltd (OSH.AX),
Santos Ltd (STO.AX), Nippon Oil Corp 5001.T and PNG
landowners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Engineering work has started on the project, which aims to
start delivering gas in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Export-Import Bank of China, another credit agency
which may be interested in the project, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some banking sources said the operators are seeking a
minimum of 12 years for the length of the loan, excluding the
four-year construction period, while others said it would be of
25 years.

&lt;p&gt; * Singapore's sovereign fund GIC, Kerry Coal may not sell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Utilities, coal companies likely buyers - sources
 (adds quotes, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Saeed Azhar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SINGAPORE, April 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N),
Citigroup (C.N) and hedge fund Farallon are looking to sell
around 17 percent of Indonesian coal producer Adaro Energy
(ADRO.JK) to strategic investors, sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on the latest share price for Indonesia's largest
coal producer by market value, the stake is worth about $500
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale was expected after a lockup period ended in March
for financial sponsors who had participated in Adaro's $1.3
billion initial public offering last year, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source with direct knowledge of the matter said Goldman
Sachs (GS.N), which has a 9.94 percent stake in Adaro, is
coordinating the sale of the shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pure coal plays are looking at it seriously. Utilities
could be interested too," said a second source close to the
situation. Both sources declined to be identified because any
deal is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, Citigroup, Farallon, the Government of Singapore
Investment Corp (GIC) and Kerry Coal had a combined 25 percent
stake in Adaro as part of a consortium at the time of company's
IPO in July 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Citigroup declined to comment while Farallon
and GIC were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price these cornerstone investors paid was unclear,
since many of them were existing shareholders at the time of
the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adaro shares, which closed 2 percent lower on Thursday,
have fallen around 14 percent from an IPO price of 1,100
rupiah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS, which has a "buy" rating on Adaro, said in a recent
report the cornerstone investors could make a huge profit from
the share sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said investors may want to sell given the
uncertainty over coal prices amid an economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think the slowdown in global economic activities made
the coal outlook a bit sluggish over the next 12 months," said
John Teja, head of equities sales at Ciptadana Securities in
Jakarta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Moreover tight global liquidity might force these
investors to cash in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adaro said shareholders had not briefed them about their
plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are our existing shareholders, but we have not been
briefed on the plan that they have with regards to their
ownership," Andre Mamuaya, director at Adaro told Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONTROVERSIAL IPO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IPO raised eyebrows among domestic investors and some
global funds, who were shut out of the country's biggest public
offering as shares were distributed to connected parties.
[ID:nJAK22790].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several analysts including UBS have written in recent weeks
that a share selldown was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, not every investor is looking to exit Adaro, as
GIC and Kerry Coal, a firm linked to Malaysian billionaire
Robert Kuok, will likely retain most of their stake, said a
third source familiar with the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Adaro overtook the country's biggest coal miner
Bumi Resources (BUMI.JK) as Bumi's parent faced financial
difficulties last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adaro, which expects to produce 42-45 million tonnes of
coal this year, up from 38.5 million tonnes in 2008, plans to
spend up to $100 million to acquire a coal barge and
trans-shipment firm to improve the supply chain for its
operations in Kalimantan on Borneo island.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joanne Frearson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - European shares rose in a
choppy session on Thursday morning with banks gaining ahead of
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) figures and housing data from the
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 0849 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European companies was up 0.4 percent at 791.26 points having
been as low as 786.93 points earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is going to remain volatile depending on news
flow. I have a funny feeling JPMorgan figures are going to be
good ... it really depends if there are any more write downs,"
said David Buik, partner at BGC Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks added the most points to the index. HSBC (HSBA.L),
Banco Santander (SAN.MC), UBS (UBSN.VX), Barclays (BARC.L) and
Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) gained 1.4-4.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would expect quite good figures from JPMorgan, but they
are by no means the norm for the sector," said Justin Urquhart
Stewart, investment director at Seven Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later in the session, investors are expected to focus on
results from tech bellwether Nokia (NOK1V.HE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Nokia earnings will probably be about 80 percent down to
what they were last time. We are concerned about the level of
market share they may have lost (as) their smart phone clearly
has not gone well at all. But, providing they are no worse than
expectations, it probably will be okay," Buik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across Europe, the FTSE 100 .FTSE index was up 0.7
percent, Germany's DAX .GDAXI was 0.03 percent higher and
France's CAC 40 .FCHI was up 0.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROCHE GAINS AS SALES RISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking at macroeconomic news, U.S. housing starts at 1230
GMT will also be in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The housing figures are likely to show that a little bit
more confidence is coming back in and the market shows some
signs of flattening," said Urquhart Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back to the upside, energy stocks gained as crude CLc1
rose 1.3 percent. BG Group (BG.L), BP (BP.L) and Tullow Oil
(TLW.L) added 0.2-0.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miners were higher with Antofagasta (ANTO.L), BHP Billiton
(BLT.L), Eurasian Natural Resources ENRC.L, Rio Tinto (RIO.L)
and Xstrata XTA.L up 0.5-2.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roche (ROG.VX) was up 0.7 percent after first-quarter sales
rose 8 percent and the group said it met forecasts thanks to the
strong growth of blockbuster cancer drug Avastin. [ID:nLF588860]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tempering investor optimism about a recovery was news that
General Growth Properties (GGP.N), the second-largest U.S. mall
owner, had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its
creditors, making it one of the biggest victims of the credit
crisis yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the downside, the electricity sector heavily weighed on
the index. Union Fenosa UNF.MC was down nearly 20 percent,
while Drax (DRX.L), EDF (EDF.PA) and Endesa (ELE.MC) were 0.3-1
percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Food producers also fell, with Danone (DANO.PA) down 0.4
percent after its quarterly sales fell 2.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chip maker STMicroelectronics (STM.PA) fell 1.3 percent
after it said late on Wednesday it planned to cut its quarterly
dividend by two-thirds, citing the "unstable market".

 LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) -  European shares were expected to open higher
on Thursday, after a late rally in the United States on signs that the economic
slump was showing signs of abating.

 At 0729 GMT, DJ Euro Stoxx STXEc1 futures were up 1.2 percent, Germany's
DAX futures FDXc1 were up 0.9 percent and France's CAC-40 futures FCEc1 were
up 0.9 percent.

 Later in the session, investors will assess first-quarter results from
mobile phone giant Nokia (NOK1V.HE and U.S. bank JPMorgan (JPM.N) as well as
initial jobless numbers and housing data from the United States.

 U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's Beige Book
indicated the economy continued to weaken, but the contraction's speed was
fading. American Express (AXP.N) signalled the ability of some consumers to pay
their bills is stabilising.

 China's economy slowed in the first quarter to its weakest pace on record,
but an improvement in data for March offered tentative signs that the worst may
be over for the world's third-largest economy. [ID:nPEK237287]

 Markets would be buoyed by "a strong finish on Wall Street last night and
suggestions that the Chinese GDP data could have been worse", said Matt
Buckland, CFD dealer at CMC Markets, adding: "Earnings news from JP Morgan
stands to keep the banking sector in focus."

 On Wednesday, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares
fell 0.2 percent to close at 788.21 points. 

 It is down 5.3 percent in 2009, having lost 45 percent in 2008, hammered by
a banking crisis and several major economies going into recession.

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO, April 16 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) has won a C$450
million ($372 million) deal to manage information technology
infrastructure for Canada's National Bank Financial Group
(NA.TO), the tech giant said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The seven-year deal is an early renewal of a contract that
was first signed in 2001. Its announcement comes a week after
IBM won a similar deal worth more than C$300 million with
Canadian insurance giant Sun Life Financial (SLF.TO) (SLF.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Services that IBM will provide National Bank include

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
In the course of routine surveillance, Fitch Ratings affirms Jacksonville,
Florida's (the city) approximately $534.4 million in BJP transportation revenue
bonds. The Rating Outlook is Negative. 

The 'AA' on the BJP transportation revenue bonds reflects its adequate debt
service coverage, sound legal provisions, and the general credit characteristics
of the city including strong management, healthy financial position, and a
diverse economy. The Negative Outlook reflects the city's plans to further
leverage the security to the point where coverage levels may be inconsistent
with the current rating category as well as Fitch's concerns for further
potential weakening of pledged revenues. 

The bonds are secured by the city's half-cent local option transportation sales
tax and constitutional fuel tax revenue on a subordinate basis to bonds issued
by the State of Florida for the benefit of the Jacksonville Transportation
Authority (JTA). The JTA has pledged under an interlocal agreement with the city
not to incur additional debt senior to or on parity with the bonds now offered.
Pledged revenues have historically been relatively stable with a slight 1.9%
decline in fiscal 2008. Maximum annual debt service (MADS) coverage remained
adequate at 1.66 times (x) while coverage of annual debt service was notably
higher, 2.55x, due to ascending debt service. Year to date revenues for fiscal
2009 are down 4.1% from a year prior. If revenues end fiscal 2009 down 4.1% from
fiscal 2008, MADS coverage would decline to 1.59x while actual fiscal 2009 debt
service coverage would be 2.44x. 

Located on the northeastern coast of Florida, Jacksonville is the most populous
city in Florida; the 2007 estimated population was 805,605, an increase of 9.4%
over the 2000 census figure. The city's diverse economic base has a strong long
term profile bolstered by its historical naval presence, large cargo port with a
natural river harbor, and major banking, insurance, health care, and
manufacturing industries. While the effect of the current economic downturn has
so far been less severe in the city than in other parts of the state,
unemployment has increased to 9.4% in February 2009 from 4.5% a year prior. 

Financial operations are strong resulting in operating surpluses in four out of
the last five years. Unaudited fiscal 2008 results show a $14.2 million surplus
driven by the implementation of an effective expenditure reduction program and
additional fees instituted to offset the impact of recent property tax reform.
The unreserved fund balance plus a $40 million emergency reserve held in the
general fund equal a satisfactory 8.8% of spending. Estimates for fiscal 2009
year end indicate break even results. 

Overall debt levels are moderate at 3.9% of taxable assessed value, or $2.952
per capita. The city's capital improvement plan (CIP) for fiscal 2009-2013 is
relatively small at $77 million, although it excludes all Better Jacksonville
Plan (BJP) projects, which at $2.3 billion account for the majority of the
city's capital needs. The CIP is fully funded and projects are concentrated in
roads, accounting for roughly 50% of spending.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings of Chevron Corporation
(Chevron; NYSE: CVX): 

--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA'; 

--Senior unsecured notes at 'AA'; 

Union Oil Company of California (Unocal - Chevron) 

--Unsecured notes at 'AA'; 

Chevron Corporation 

--Commercial paper at 'F1+'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1+'. 

Chevron Funding Corporation 

--Commercial paper at 'F1+'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1+'. 

The Ratings Outlook is Stable. 

Chevron's ratings reflect the diversification benefits of the integrated oil
business model, the size and quality of this supermajor's worldwide asset base,
its strong cash flow generation capability, conservative financial management,
and very low debt levels. Credit concerns center primarily on the possibility of
M to bolster upstream growth although Fitch notes that the company has a track
record of financing past transactions conservatively. 

Chevron's 2008 credit metrics were very strong, driven by outperformance at the
company's upstream arm and lower debt balances of recent years. For the latest
12 months (LTM) ending Dec. 31, 2008, the company generated cash from operations
of $29.6 billion, EBITDA of $45.7 billion, and free cash flow of $4.83 billion,
after capital expenditures of $19.67 billion and common dividends of $5.16
billion. 

Total E debt/proven reserves was just $0.84/barrel of oil equivalent (boe) at
year-end 2008, after allocating 25% of debt to other operations. At year end,
Chevron's cash and equivalents balance of $9.35 billion exceeded gross debt of
$8.9 billion for a zero net debt balance. EBITDA/interest coverage increased to
178.5 times (x) from 76.2x, while debt-to-EBITDA remained extremely low at just
0.2x. Similarly, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was just 0.7x. 

Operationally, Chevron's 2008 upstream performance was solid relative to peers
and to its own numbers from 2007. As calculated by Fitch, total conventional
proven reserves including affiliates grew by 3.9%, increasing to 11.19 billion
boe from 10.78 billion boe seen in 2007. Chevron's all-in reserve replacement
rate (RR) was 149% versus just 62% in 2007. On an organic basis, RR was 139%.
Note that at least part of the volatility in reserve replacement in 2007 and
2008 was linked to PSCs (production sharing contracts) which generally move
inversely to oil prices and took barrels off Chevron's books in 2007's high oil
environment but allowed PSC barrels to be rebooked with 2008's $44 oil price
test. Approximately 32% of Chevron's 2008 reserves were PSC-linked. A key driver
of 2008 results was also the 30-year extension of an existing contract in the
Partitioned Neutral Zone (Kuwait/S. Arabia). There were no significant sales of
reserves in 2008 by Chevron. Other upstream credit metrics were also solid, with
three-year FD low relative to peers at just $13.93/boe, while production costs
were close to industry averages at $16.42/boe. As previously stated, year-end
debt metrics were extremely low and included E debt/boe of proven reserves of
just $0.84/boe. Chevron's ratio of reserves to production (R/P) rose to 12.2
years from 11.4 years, while proven developed reserves as a percentage of total
reserves rose to 65.2% from 63.9% seen in the previous year. 

Looking forward, Fitch expects Chevron's credit metrics to decrease from these
very high levels in the first half of the year given the lower commodity price
deck and the company's recent debt issuance. However, the company's very low
debt levels mean there is headroom within the current rating category to add
leverage. 

Chevron Corporation is a large integrated oil company with 2008 upstream
production of 2.53 million boepd (barrels of oil equivalent per day) and
year-end proven hydrocarbon reserves of 11.19 billion boe. Chevron's downstream
portfolio includes interests in 18 refineries with an aggregate refining
capacity of 2.14 million bpd and 25,000 branded retail stations. Chevron's
chemicals assets are held through CPChem, a joint venture with ConocoPhillips
Corporation (COP) which holds interests in 30 chemical manufacturing sites.
Other assets include midstream assets, power generation, and mining. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

process other than through the medium of its public disclosure.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It's been more than a year since Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) unsolicited bid to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) ended in tatters and acrimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the two companies are talking again, with the less contentious agenda of forging an Internet search advertising partnership having replaced the notion of an outright merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say that co-opting Yahoo's search assets represents Microsoft's best hope to turn around its money-losing online business and to challenge Google Inc's (GOOG.O) dominant and growing share of the U.S. search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But handing search over to Microsoft would be fraught with risk for Yahoo, which would cede what is believed to be a profitable and increasingly vital plank in its online business. Search data is increasingly used to custom-tailor display advertisements for Web surfers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't walk away from search unless there's some ridiculously huge number in front of you," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross Sandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer recently talked about various partnerships, possibly with Microsoft managing Yahoo's search advertising business and Yahoo handling display ads across Microsoft's websites, according to a source familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any deal would have to be sweeter than the one unsuccessfully brokered by activist investor Carl Icahn last July, in the wake of Microsoft's failed $47.5 billion acquisition bid for Yahoo, said RBC's Sandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Icahn's search-only plan, Microsoft was willing to pay Yahoo a $1 billion upfront fee for Yahoo's search assets, plus $2.3 billion a year in guaranteed revenue for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRITICAL MASS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo have each lost 1 percentage point or more of market share in U.S. search queries since the two companies first considered combining in February 2008. Google has widened its lead from 59.2 percent market share in February 2008 to 63.7 percent in March 2009, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is urgency. I hope they both realize they need to get something done sooner rather than later," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen, who has a "buy" rating on Microsoft. "But they are not going to rush into a deal that might not work out long-term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market share is key in search-based advertising, say analysts, since many of the small businesses that buy online ads do not have enough money to spread their messages across a smattering of websites with limited audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, running ads with Google is generally considered a "no-brainer." But a combined Microsoft-Yahoo with nearly 30 percent search market share could provide a large enough audience to also be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because search advertising is based on an auction system, size is doubly important. The more advertisers participate, the more keyword prices tend to be bid higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may be best-placed to run the combined search business, given its strength in sophisticated software needed to run search engines and its superior organization, said one analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Yahoo does best is make interesting content to attract users, but they can't do project management very well," said Kim Caughey, an analyst at money manager Fort Pitt Capital Group. "Microsoft's very good at software and they are a little more structured."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANTITRUST ATTENTION?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such an arrangement might put both companies' display ad business under the control of Yahoo, which is the U.S. No. 1 in that market. In February, Yahoo led the market with 13 percent of display ad views. Microsoft was fifth with 4.3 percent and Google sixth with 1.2 percent, according to comScore figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is likely to attract the attention of antitrust regulators, who thwarted a proposed advertising pact between Google and Yahoo last year. But antitrust experts say the market for online display ads is still relatively open, and regulators' main concern is Google's dominance in search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a pure antitrust standpoint, it's hard to see a problem here," said Evan Stewart, an antitrust lawyer with Zuckerman Spaeder LLP. "If you're from the (U.S. Justice Department) Antitrust Division, what you really want to have is more effective competitors for Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say any deal would have to guarantee Yahoo's access to users' search data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without search, Yahoo looks like AOL," said RBC Capital Markets' Sandler, referring to Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) online division, which does not have its own search engine and which has seen its users and revenue erode in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ideas about how a Microsoft-Yahoo partnership could work. Ironfire Capital's Eric Jackson believes they should create a joint venture where Microsoft transfers its online business and combines it with Yahoo's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrangement, first outlined in a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report, would have Microsoft take a 49 percent stake and give Yahoo 51 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new venture was projected to have $9 billion in net revenue in 2010 versus Google's estimated $16 billion, which would make it a strong No. 2 Internet search player, while boasting the largest Internet display advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company would be run by Yahoo, which Jackson said has a better track record in the online business than Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle and Diane Bartz in Washington; editing by Tiffany Wu and Gerald E.

The more advertisers participate, the more keyword prices tend to be bid higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft may be best-placed to run the combined search business, given its strength in sophisticated software needed to run search engines and its superior organization, said one analyst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "What Yahoo does best is make interesting content to attract users, but they can't do project management very well," said Kim Caughey, an analyst at money manager Fort Pitt Capital Group. "Microsoft's very good at software and they are a little more structured." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ANTITRUST ATTENTION? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Such an arrangement might put both companies' display ad business under the control of Yahoo, which is the U.S. No. 1 in that market. In February, Yahoo led the market with 13 percent of display ad views. Microsoft was fifth with 4.3 percent and Google sixth with 1.2 percent, according to comScore figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That is likely to attract the attention of antitrust regulators, who thwarted a proposed advertising pact between Google and Yahoo last year. But antitrust experts say the market for online display ads is still relatively open, and regulators' main concern is Google's dominance in search. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "From a pure antitrust standpoint, it's hard to see a problem here," said Evan Stewart, an antitrust lawyer with Zuckerman Spaeder LLP. "If you're from the (U.S. Justice Department) Antitrust Division, what you really want to have is more effective competitors for Google." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts say any deal would have to guarantee Yahoo's access to users' search data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Without search, Yahoo looks like AOL," said RBC Capital Markets' Sandler, referring to Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) online division, which does not have its own search engine and which has seen its users and revenue erode in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    There are many ideas about how a Microsoft-Yahoo partnership could work. Ironfire Capital's Eric Jackson believes they should create a joint venture where Microsoft transfers its online business and combines it with Yahoo's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The arrangement, first outlined in a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report, would have Microsoft take a 49 percent stake and give Yahoo 51 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The new venture was projected to have $9 billion in net revenue in 2010 versus Google's estimated $16 billion, which would make it a strong No. 2 Internet search player, while boasting the largest Internet display advertising business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company would be run by Yahoo, which Jackson said has a better track record in the online business than Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle and Diane Bartz in Washington; editing by Tiffany Wu and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS--(Business Wire)--
TUESDAY, April 21st at 9:00am (EST):

A&#233;rophile will celebrate its newest venture as the Characters in Flight Operated
by A&#233;rophile balloon in Downtown Disney enjoys its grand opening!

J&#233;r&#244;me Giacomoni, president and co-founder of A&#233;rophile,

along with the balloon`s ground crew and pilot cordially invite you to attend

the official inauguration of Characters in Flight Operated by A&#233;rophile.

Come witness, cameras in hand, this breathtaking moment at Downtown Disney`s
West Side!

A&#233;rophile S.A., the new tethered balloon`s inventor and manufacturer, has given
guests of Downtown Disney Area in Lake Buena Vista, Florida a thrilling vantage
point from which to admire the sprawling Disney sites. Boasting an
unparalleled360-degree view up to 10 miles on a clear day, the Characters in
Flight Operated by A&#233;rophile balloon rises up to 400 feet in the air and can
carry up to 30 passengers in its gondola, including the pilot, on each flight
(subject to weather conditions). 

The giant tethered balloon measures 105 feet in height, has a circumference of
240 feet, a 72-foot diameter, and an impressive volume of 210,000 cubic feet.
A&#233;rophile designed its quick mooring system and star-shaped landing platform
especially for Downtown Disney. 

The world leader in tethered balloons, A&#233;rophile S.A. is proud to unveil the
latest incarnation of the Aero 30 NG Model, one of the company`s 50 systems sold
or operated in 25 countries around the world. A veritable gem of machinery, the
Aero 30 NG operates silently and is 100% pollution-free!

ABOUT A&#201;ROPHILE, S.A.

Founded in 1993 by two 25-year-old French engineers, Matthieu Gobbi and J&#233;r&#244;me
Giacomoni, A&#233;rophile S.A. reinvented the tethered gas balloon and became the
world leader in tethered gas balloons through the development of three flagship
products: 1) the AERO 30 NG (since 1994) a large tethered balloon that can lift
30 passengers up to 500 feet every 10 minutes with 50 balloons sold in more than
25 countries in cities including Paris, Berlin, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Duba&#239;,
2) the AERO2 (since 2000), a mobile balloon designed for 2 passengers, and 3)
the AEROPHARE (since 2007), the first balloon capable of flying up to 130 feet
with 12 passengers in up to 50 mph winds. All products can be used as a totem, a
billboard, or an amusement ride. 

The tethered balloon is a highly specialized aerostat that requires strict
manufacturing processes and rigorous operating practices. Not only the
manufacturer, A&#233;rophile S.A. is also the successful operator of its balloons.
A&#233;rophile Orlando LLC now operates the Characters in Flight Operated by
A&#233;rophile balloon in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, as of April 2009. 

A&#233;rophile S.A.'s personnel is comprised of forty staff members, including some
twenty pilots and technicians qualified to undertake the installation, training,
and commissioning of all systems. 

In addition to the newly installed balloon in Downtown Disney, two other
A&#233;rophile systems are currently operating on American soil in the state of
California, at Great Park in Irvine and at Wild Animal Park in San Diego, and
three others are scheduled to be installed in various locations across the
United States later this year. At Disneyland Resort in Paris, A&#233;rophile S.A. has
been successfully operating a similar A&#233;rophile system since April 2005, much to
the delight of its estimated 360,000 passengers to date.

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM, April 17 (Reuters) - The Netherlands' largest
museum risks losing a 17th-century Dutch masterpiece to an
American bank which says it is its rightful owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam bought Gerrit Adriaensz
Berckheyde's "Golden Bend" from Dutch businessman Louis
Reijtenbagh last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reijtenbagh has financial troubles and JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N), seeking repayment of a loan, has lodged a claim in a
New York court to try to obtain the painting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It says the 62-year-old businessman should not have sold it
to the museum because he was using it as collateral for a loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bank took possession of Reijtenbagh's art collection
earlier this month. This painting was also on the list," Taco
Dibbits, director of collections at Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum,
said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dibbits declined to say how much the Dutch state had paid
for the painting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase is seeking the repayment of loans that were
backed by millions of dollars worth of artwork held by
Monte-Carlo Art SA, a British Virgin Islands-based entity which
JPMorgan says is controlled by Reijtenbagh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said works by Picasso, Monet and Rembrandt had also been
used as collateral and moved illegally out of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reijtenbagh, a former doctor, made a fortune through
investing and has been described as one of the wealthiest people
in the Netherlands. He has declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Golden Bend, a light-coloured depiction of an Amsterdam
canal and its prized canal houses, is now on display at the
National Gallery Museum in Washington. It was insured for 4
million euros ($5.2 million) before it came to the Rijksmuseum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Reijtenbagh and his two sons were also sued by
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.VX), which secured a temporary
court order freezing his assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several investment funds run by the Swiss bank accuse them
of misusing more than $340 million in loans that were to have
been used to finance the family's private equity investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Timothy Heritage)

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) has
disbanded a former Bear Stearns valuation and analytical unit
and transferred its staff to other teams, a spokesman for the
U.S. bank said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The employees of the Financial Analytics and Structured
Transactions, or FAST, division, have been reassigned to
businesses that include Capital Structure and Advisory
Solutions, Global Research, and Securitised Products, Brian
Marchiony said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We just felt ... instead of it standing alone, if we could
integrate that group into other investment banking business
lines, then those people would bring more value to individual
business lines," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FAST offered advice to clients on asset and liability
management and balance sheet restructurings. It also provided
receivables-based financing analyses, and security and portfolio
analyses among other services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marchiony declined to say how many people worked at the unit
until it was disbanded but said the number was much closer to
100 than to 400 reported in the Wall Street Journal earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan bought investment bank Bear Stearns last year.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) as Bull of the Day
and Logitech International, Inc. (Nasdaq: LOGI) as Bear of the Day. In addition,
the analysts at Zacks Equity Research discuss the latest on Wells Fargo (NYSE:
WFC), JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) and Regions Financial (NYSE: RF). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) discovers, develops, manufactures and sells a
diversified line of healthcare products. We expect high-single digit EPS growth
over the next five years driven by strong sales of Humira and the company`s
rapidly growing vascular business. 

Several new drug applications have recently been filed with the FDA which should
accelerate sales in the pharmaceutical business. 

We believe ABT possesses a low risk profile and will continue to trade at an
industry premium. Accordingly, we reiterate our Buy recommendation with a price
target of $65. 

Bear of the Day

Logitech International, Inc. (Nasdaq: LOGI) reported results for the third
quarter of 2009 with weaker than expected revenues and earnings due to weakening
demand, lower gross margin and higher effective taxes. The company currently
assumes that this relatively weak macroeconomic environment will weaken further
in the coming months. 

Its outlook anticipates that the economy will have an impact on the European
consumer as well. It plans to reduce global salaried workforce by between 550
and 600 employees, and this is expected to generate annual cost savings
beginning in 2010 of approximately $50 million. 

We now estimate that revenue and EPS will reduce by 2.5% and 26.5% respectively
in 2009 compared to 2008. We are maintaining a Sell on LOGI with a target price
of $11.00. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

TARP Recipients Not Lending More

Except for housing lending, banks extended less credit to businesses and
consumers in February compared to January. The median decline in total lending
was 2% in February, with nine banks reporting an increase in lending and 12
banks reporting a decline. 

Housing loans have picked up recently as a result of record low mortgage rates,
as we have seen in the recent results/preannouncements of banks like Wells Fargo
(NYSE: WFC), JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) and Regions Financial (NYSE: RF). During the
month, residential mortgage originations increased by 35%, mainly due to the
surge in refinancing of existing mortgages. Mortgage refinancing increased of
42% and home equity originations increased 18% month-over-month. 

Loan origination for other consumer lending products, including auto, student
and other consumer loans, decreased by 47% from January to February.

Abbott Reports, Confirms Guidance

This morning Abbott Laboratories Inc (NYSE: ABT) reported financial results for
the period ending March 31, 2009. Revenue for the first quarter came in at $6.7
billion, well below our estimate of $7.05 billion and the Street`s estimate of
$7.06 billion. Revenue fell by almost 1% from the same period in 2008 but would
have grown 5.4% if not for the negative affect of foreign exchange. 

Vascular division sales, led by the continued strong performance of coronary
stents, increased by 42% in the quarter. Nutritional sales increased by 10.6% on
an operational basis and by 6.4% including foreign exchange. Pharmaceutical
sales fell by 5.7% in the quarter but would have increased by 1% excluding
foreign exchange. 

CSX Results Chug Along

After market close yesterday, CSX Corp (NYSE: CSX) kicked off first quarter
earnings for the railroad group by reporting a 23% decline in diluted EPS to
$0.62 from $0.80 in the year-ago quarter. This was well ahead of EPS consensus
of $0.51 and our estimate of $0.57, largely due to a 57% decline in fuel expense
on lower prices and volume. 

Revenues dropped 17% year over year to $2.24 billion on a 17% fall in volume.
Revenue per unit was up minimally to $1,584 from $1,580 in first quarter 2008.
All businesses reported declining volumes and revenues, except Agricultural
products, which was saved by gains in corn and ethanol shipments and experienced
a 6% increase in revenues. This reflected higher pricing per unit as volume was
flat. 

Infosys Guidance Hurts Shares

Infosys Technologies (NASDAQ: INFY, Hold) shares are off nearly 8% in trading so
far today following the company`s release of Q4 and FY2009 results (ended in
March). While the company posted better Q4 EPS on weaker-than-expected revenues,
its forward guidance is clearly impacting the share performance negatively
today. 

Q4 earnings came in at $0.56 per American Depository Shares (ADS) on revenues of
$1.12 billion. This compares with our estimate of $0.55 in earnings per ADS on
revenues of $1.14 billion and the consensus expectation of $0.54 per ADS on
revenues of $1.13 billion. 

Kimberly-Clark Going Green

Kimberly-Clark Corp (NYSE: KMB) faces many challenges in the attempt to balance
growth and profitability. Specifically in the diaper business, the company faces
a significant competitive threat from Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG). Procter
spends heavily on its Pampers line and appears to have an edge over
Kimberly-Clark in terms of cost structure and marketing acumen. As part of the
competitive battle, Kimberly-Clark develops innovative new products to both hold
and garner market share. 

Kimberly-Clark has announced the launch of a new super premium and
environmentally friendly diaper: Huggies Pure &amp; Natural diapers, which are made
from natural, organic materials, and ingredients. The new Huggies Pure &amp; Natural
diaper is hypoallergenic, latex and fragrance free. The outer cover includes
organic cotton, and the liner has natural Aloe and Vitamin E. The product's
packaging contains at least 20% recycled materials.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Infinity's RING Trial Halted

Yesterday, Infinity Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: INFI) announced the termination
of its phase III RING trial based on the recommendation of its independent data
monitoring committee (IDMC). The RING trial is a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate IPI-504, a Hsp90 inhibitor, in
approximately 200 patients with refractory GIST in over 20 countries and 50
sites worldwide. Patients whose tumors have grown despite treatment with at
least Novartis' (NYSE: NVS) Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) and Pfizer's (NYSE: PFE)
Sutent (sunitinib) were eligible to enroll in the RING trial and there was no
limit to the number of prior therapies they may have received. 

According to the company, the IDMC's recommendation yesterday evening to halt
the trial was based on an early review of safety data from the first 46 patients
enrolled in the study, which showed a higher-than-anticipated mortality rate
among patients enrolled in the treatment arm. While the RING trial had similar
entry criteria to the earlier study of IPI-504 in patients with refractory GIST,
a preliminary review of the data suggests that the patients enrolled in the RING
trial had more advanced disease, as evidenced by a greater percentage of
patients having received three or more prior therapies and longer time since
initial diagnosis. 

OmniVision Looks to Longer Term

OmniVision Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: OVTI) is a leading provider of image
sensors for the handset and notebook markets, and is strengthening its position
in other emerging markets. The company`s technology, market position and $4.60
of net cash per share should enable it to tide over the current recession. 

We are reasonably confident about a strong comeback in the post-recession
period. However, we are a little concerned about the level of inventory, and
believe that the company could have a hard time bringing it down. We anticipate
further provisions in the near future. 

Google Tops Lowered Expectations

Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) topped first-quarter expectations with GAAP earnings of
$4.49 per share, 28 cents better than the consensus estimate. Revenues were also
well above the average forecast, totaling $5.51 billion versus forecasts for
$4.16 billion. 

The numbers represent a true surprise given recent trends. Over the past 30
days, 7 brokerage analysts had lowered their first-quarter projections, causing
the consensus earnings estimate to fall by 5 cents to $4.21 per share.
Furthermore, GOOG has missed estimates 5 times in its brief history as a
publicly-traded company.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Sell Liberty Property in Near Term

Liberty Property Trust (NYSE: LRY) is a self-administered and self-managed real
estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses primarily on prime suburban
properties in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest regions of the United
States. The company's portfolio comprises over 700 industrial and office
properties, spanning 77 million square feet of space. 

Office and industrial markets continue to weaken throughout the US. In the
current environment, we do not favor suburban industrial/office companies as
rental rates and occupancies will continue their downward trend. 

The company recently cut its quarterly payout to $0.475 per share, 24% lower
than the previous payout. Negative job growth trends will keep shares under
pressure. 

3Com Fairly Priced at $4

3Com Corp (NASDAQ: COMS) is a leader in the Chinese enterprise networking
market, but may face increased competition in the server market with the entry
of large players such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO). 

Through improved operational efficiency, 3Com achieved profitability on a GAAP
basis for its third consecutive quarter. We are pleased with the company's
performance in recent quarters, but are concerned about the worsening global
economic outlook and a weak IT spending in China. Moreover, the future of its
business in China concerns us as the company reduces its dependence on Huawei as
a reseller. 

JP Morgan Beats Estimates

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE: JPM) today reported its 1Q09 net income at $2.1
billion; down from year-ago quarter net income of $2.4 billion. Earnings per
share were $0.40, ahead of consensus estimates of $0.32 a share. 

The group had very strong results in the Fixed Income Markets, with revenue at a
record $4.9 billion, compared with $466 million in the prior-year quarter,
mirroring what we saw in the Goldman Sachs` (GS) results. Both the companies
made handsome profits in credit, commodities and currency trading. Obviously
these banks are benefiting from the tremendous efforts by the Federal Reserve to
free up the credit markets. JP Morgan also had the advantage of increased market
share from its purchase of Bear Stearns. 

Krispy Kreme Rockets Up 46%

Shares of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc (NYSE: KKD) are rocketing 46% today to
$3.34, after announcing it secured credit agreement amendments that will enable
it to stay in compliance. The amendments give the doughnut chain time to weather
the recession while continuing to close under-performing units and
reinvigorating same-store sales. 

Comp sales showed signs of stabilization in the latest quarter ended February 1,
rising 0.9%. Revenue, however, fell 17% to $91.8 million, as the company
continues to close under-performing stores.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, April 17 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) has
temporarily halted output at the Cepu block, one of the
country's biggest oil finds in a decade, because of pipeline
problems, an official at the country's energy watchdog said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The giant Cepu oil block in central Java, which is being
jointly developed by ExxonMobil and Indonesian state oil firm
Pertamina, began initial production last December with a volume
of around 800 barrels per day (bpd) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cepu production has been temporary stopped in March
because the pipeline facilities for crude delivery have not
been permitted by the regional government in Tuban, East Java,"
Edi Purwanto, deputy head of the watchdog, BPMIGAS, told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cepu cannot continue production without a channel for its
crude to be delivered," he said, without specifying when the
problem would be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Purwanto said Cepu had capacity to produce around 20,000
bpd, but it was only producing around 100 bpd when it was
stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Indonesia official could not be reached for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cepu, which ranks among the U.S. major's top 10 projects
worldwide, is expected to produce 165,000 bpd when to reaches
peak output in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia hopes the project will help arrest a sharp slide
in Indonesia's crude production as ageing fields struggle to
maintain output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia's crude production dropped to 832,200 bpd in
March, compared with 844,300 bpd in February and against around
1.5 million bpd in the 1990s.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp beat discount retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc to regain the top of Fortune magazine's list of the 500 biggest publicly traded companies, based on revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widely watched Fortune 500 list, released Sunday, showed that the world's largest listed oil company regained the top spot, raking in $442.9 billion of revenue in 2008, despite the decline of energy prices late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon also was the most profitable, earning $45.2 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That performance displaced Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, which fell to runner-up after topping the list six of the past seven years. The retailer's revenue climbed 7 percent to $405.6 billion as recession-weary consumers tried to stretch their dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what was one of the worst years ever for stock markets, most companies saw revenue and earnings tumble. Overall, earnings of the Fortune 500 fell 85 percent to $99 billion last year. That, the magazine said, was the biggest one-year drop since it began compiling its list 55 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy companies, buoyed by soaring prices earlier in 2008, dominated the top ranks. Chevron Corp again came in third at $263.2 billion in revenue, up 25 percent, while ConocoPhillips climbed one notch to fourth with $230.8 billion of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co, the industrial conglomerate weighed down by its financial arm's woes, still managed to rise one slot to fifth place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, money-losing financial services companies were the hardest hit last year.

&lt;p&gt;Program Partners Win Major Prize for Championing Critical Issues in Bangladesh
and Indonesia


SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
The Asia Foundation applauds the Goldman Environmental Prize announcement today
that two of its program partners, Syeda Rizwana Hasan of Bangladesh and Yuyun
Ismawati of Indonesia, have each won the highly coveted prize honoring
grassroots environmentalists. The $150,000 prizes recognize two outstanding
individuals who have led local efforts that have achieved significant
environmental impact. The award was created to further enable these leaders to
continue their work. The winners will be awarded the prize at an invitation-only
ceremony on Monday, April 20, 2009, at 5:00 p.m. at the San Francisco Opera
House. 

"For many years, both Rizwana in Bangladesh and Yuyun in Indonesia have been at
the forefront of Asia Foundation environment initiatives," said Christopher
Plante, director of The Asia Foundation`s Environment Program. "Their dedication
in the face of immeasurable challenges has inspired us, and we salute them for
receiving this well-deserved recognition." 

Syeda Rizwana Hasan, 40, is a lawyer and executive director of the Bangladesh
Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA), a non-profit, non-governmental
organization established in 1992 to contribute to the development of sound
environmental jurisprudence in Bangladesh. Since then, BELA has played a leading
role in promoting environmental legal advocacy in Bangladesh, enhancing
environmental policy, and extending the scope and enforcement of legal standards
in environmental protection and resource management. The Asia Foundation is one
of BELA`s original supporters. Since its first grant in 1993, the Foundation has
provided institutional, programatic, and professional staff development
assistance to BELA for a variety of public advocacy initiatives. These include
advocacy efforts to sensitize public officials, Members of Parliament, and the
judiciary to environmental issues, and support for BELA`s pioneering role in
securing judicial commitment to public interest litigation in Bangladesh as an
effective legal tool for protecting environmental rights. Achievements include
landmark court decisions that: recognized the constitutional right to a clean
environment; stemmed industrial pollution; banned smoking in public vehicles;
ordered environmental compensation; and directed public agencies to take actions
to protect the environment. 

Ms. Hasan has filed numerous cases in which BELA has represented communities in
cases involving encroachment on public property, air, water, and soil pollution.
She has also played a crucial role in assisting with compensation for land
expropriation, protection of laborers from hazardous working conditions,
relocation of tanneries that discharge toxic chemicals into the environment, and
maintenance of urban environmental facilities. More recently, Ms. Hasan has
lobbied for critical legislation to protect Bangladesh`s environment and reduce
the environmental health and safety hazards faced by workers in the
ship-breaking industry. In March 2009, a BELA petition secured a High Court
direction to the Department of Environment to ensure that all ship-breaking
yards operating without environmental clearance close their operations within
two weeks, together with an order prohibiting the import of any end-of-life
ships that have not been cleaned of all hazardous materials such as asbestos,
PCBs, heavy metals, and oil residues before arrival in Bangladesh. 

Over the years, Ms. Hasan has facilitated scores of training programs for
journalists, judges, government officials, lawyers, and concerned citizens to
increase environmental awareness and support participatory law making. In 2003,
the Foundation supported her participation in the prestigious Environmental
Leadership Program of the University of California at Berkeley. 

Yuyun Ismawati, 44, is founder and director of Bali Fokus Foundation, an
Indonesian non-governmental organization working on environmental management,
pollution control and prevention, and sustainable development issues since 2000.
Ms. Yuyun`s environmental projects have received support from The Asia
Foundation since 1996, during which time she successfully pressured major hotels
in Bali to reduce solid waste and improve their recycling efforts. Living in one
of the world`s premier tourist destinations, Bali residents were faced with
consumption of natural resources and unregulated waste disposal within a finite
space. Her promotion of "green tourism" became a model that has successfully
been replicated in the resort areas of Ubud, Candi Dasa, and Hua Hin, Thailand.
Ms. Yuyun work focuses on finding community-based solutions for adequate, safe,
and sustainable waste management. The Asia Foundation continued to support Ms.
Yuyun`s work with financial grants and technical assistance, such as presenting
case studies at workshops in Asia and in the U.S. Ms. Yuyun has spearheaded
numerous initiatives with funding from The Asia Foundation including the
NGO-Business Environmental Partnership project. 

Throughout her career, Ms. Yuyun has been a staunch advocate for the cooperation
of businesses and the local community. In addition to bringing together over 30
hotel facilities to participate in an environmental audit, with Asia Foundation
support, Bali Fokus produced an Indonesian-language handbook endorsed by the
Ministry of Tourism and Culture for eco-auditing hotels. Working with the Bali
Tourism Board and NGOs from 25 Indonesian cities, Bali Fokus conducted a
national workshop on solid waste management in 2003. The workshop resulted in a
new alliance on solid waste called "GarbaNet," as well as a strategy for
furthering a national solid waste management plan. More recently, Ms. Yuyun has
been involved with national agencies in crafting Indonesia`s first-ever bill on
waste management and the country`s strategy related to climate change issues.

&lt;p&gt;PERTH, April 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N)
liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Papua New Guinea has
reached a key supply agreement with an unnamed Asian buyer,
project partner Oil Search Ltd (OSH.AX) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil Search said the venture had reached a heads of

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM's quarterly revenue fell by a bigger-than-expected 11 percent as the slowdown in corporate spending hurt even one of the healthiest U.S. technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But higher margins helped International Business Machines Corp's first-quarter profit beat Wall Street estimates, and the company affirmed its full-year earnings outlook -- helping to limit the fall in IBM shares to 1.6 percent after hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These were decent results in light of the challenging economy. Certainly the top line is being impacted by the weak economy," said Andy Miedler, analyst at Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM is managing the business well, focusing on expense control, and its movement to software and services is clearly evident in the increasing profitability. Net-net we think this is a decent quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said on Monday first-quarter revenue fell to $21.71 billion from $24.50 billion a year earlier. That compared with analysts' average forecast of $22.56 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net profit for the quarter dropped 1 percent to $2.30 billion, from $2.32 billion in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit per share, however, rose to $1.70 from $1.64, as the number of shares outstanding decreased. Analysts on average were expecting $1.67 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Short-term bookings look a little weaker than everybody had hoped.

The long-term guide looks solid," said Peter Misek, analyst at Canaccord Adams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARGIN IMPROVEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has so far fared better than many other technology companies, thanks to its growing focus on software and services, such as outsourcing and technology support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has moved to a more profitable revenue mix over the past decade, dumping increasingly commoditized hardware for software and services. Gross profit margin rose to 43.4 percent in the quarter from 41.5 percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the fall in revenue, IBM reiterated its outlook for a full-year profit of at least $9.20 per share. Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call that he was more confident in that outlook now than he was last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano was upbeat about the following year as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We remain ahead of pace for our 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 per share," he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has been hoping that the first quarter would mark the bottom of the downturn for the tech sector, eyeing an improvement in demand in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chipmaker Texas Instruments separately on Monday posted a surprise quarterly profit on better-than-expected revenue and gave a rosier outlook for the current quarter as demand for its chips appeared to stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears that the industry and TI in particular are putting in a bottom for the March quarter," said Ashok Kumar, analyst at Collins Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHRUGS OFF ORACLE-SUN DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares were quoted at around $98.80 after closing down 0.83 percent at $100.43 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM competes with the likes of Hewlett-Packard Co, and analysts expect more rivalry with Oracle Corp, which announced earlier on Monday that it is buying server and software maker Sun Microsystems Inc for more than $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's talks to buy Sun broke down earlier this month. Many analysts say Sun could have helped IBM bolster its position in the server market and expand its software portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge, when asked about Oracle's deal, said he saw no change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been competing with Sun, we know Oracle inside out," he said. "They now have the same address and same mail box, but we're talking about the same team that we've been competing against for some time and winning on the field."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts agreed a combined Oracle and Sun was unlikely to threaten IBM any time soon, but some said that there was a chance IBM could regret the missed opportunity to acquire Sun's assets like Java and Solaris operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall the whole acquisition is negative for IBM. Obviously not being able to have ownership of the proprietary Java programing language, that's definitely a big negative," said Carlos Guillen, an analyst at research firm Wall Street Strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources had told Reuters that IBM offered up to $9.40 per share, which Sun turned down.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM disappointed investors on Monday with lackluster quarterly revenue, but Texas Instruments afforded the market some cheer with a solid sales performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM reported a bigger-than-expected 11 percent fall in quarterly sales, showing that even one of the healthier U.S. technology companies is getting hurt by a slowdown in corporate spending. Shares in the firm slid more than 3 percent in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Texas Instruments posted better than expected revenue as demand for its chips seemed to stabilize. Its stock inched upward after the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY ON TEXAS INSTRUMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASHOK KUMAR, ANALYST, COLLINS STEWART&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears that the industry and TI in particular are putting in a bottom for the March quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big primary structural headwind for the company is the wireless market and we think the revenue will stabilize at these depressed levels and find its way back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADAM BENJAMIN, ANALYST, JEFFERIES  CO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously the revenue came in a little bit higher. We had thought it was going to be coming in at the higher end at $1.95 (billion) so $2.09 was better than what anyone I was talking to had indicated or thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The gross margins were a little bit lower..., they had talked of around 40 percent. The guidance implies a little bit better uptake from their factories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody knows it's better, you heard that out of Intel last week and others that have reported so far early on. So I think the expectation is business is better, earnings estimates are going up..., so there's some cautious optimism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOUG FREEDMAN, ANALYST, BROADPOINT AMTECH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Revenue clearly came in stronger than expected. The rest of it is really adding up to close to what was expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The guidance for the June quarter was above both mine and the Street's, so very strong... The trough isn't as deep and it's also not as long because they're guiding up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Past cycles have taken 3 quarters to work their way out. Now clearly this is two quarters they'll be down before the third quarter is expected to be up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY ON IBM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANDY MIEDLER, ANALYST, EDWARD JONES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These were decent results in light of the challenging economy. Certainly the top line is being impacted by the weak economy. IBM is managing the business well, focusing on expense control, and its movement to software and services is clearly evident in the increasing profitability. Net-net we think this is a decent quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The top-line wasn't quite what investors were looking for, that's clearly the result of the weak economy but also the strength of the U.S. dollar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAMES BREHM, ANALYST, FROST  SULLIVAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the things that stands out when I look at IBM's announcement were the 16 services deals greater than $100 million. Services is really bringing those guys along...I think it's a better day to be at IBM than it is at Oracle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's good. I was wondering why the market was starting to rally, now I see why. Ahead of pace for 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 per share. This is a very good quarter, well above expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not quite sure where the light revenues are coming from, but I'd say that's a secondary issue, especially since they reaffirmed guidance above the consensus. The market in the after-hours is reacting very positively to it. Their long term outlook is very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The consensus for 2010, which admittedly is very far out, is $9.78 and they are going to do $10 to $11. Revenues were impacted by a strong dollar. Understandable, certainly explainable...but it's going to take a while to verify that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tax rate did help some, it was a full percentage point less than last year in the first quarter. Over $12 billion in cash on hand, this is a company that can do a major acquisition. Strong free cash flow, strong balance sheet. So this is a very good quarter and it should certainly help the markets tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZACH ROSENSTOCK, ANALYST, WAYNE HUMMER WEALTH MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like people aren't too happy with what they are seeing. For me the thing that's upsetting is revenues, down 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's echoing some of the things we've seen from other companies, saying revenues aren't that good but earnings are really strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They reiterated guidance...but people really want to see the revenues pick up. For a while, (better-than-expected earnings) was driven by top-line growth, now you are getting it from profit margins or adjustments here and there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER MISEK, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's kind of as expected. They beat on EPS. They reiterated on guidance. I didn't expect them to miss on revenue by that much, which is probably why the stock is trading off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Short-term bookings look a little weaker than everybody had hoped. That probably means that the next quarter will be mixed. The long-term guide looks solid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle, Bill Rigby and Gabriel Madway, Compiled by Edwin Chan)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds Texas Instruments earnings after the bell)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid more than
3 percent on Monday after weak results from Bank of America
reignited concerns over the state of the banking industry and
the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street's tumble was broad-based and follows a
six-week winning streak, the longest for the SP 500 since
2007, with the Dow scoring its biggest gain over the period
since 1938.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow component Bank of America (BAC.N) shares plunged 24.3
percent to $8.02 despite reporting a rise in profits. Bank of
America's earnings report raised questions about the
sustainability of recent better-than-expected results from
banks after the company said its credit quality deteriorated
markedly . (For details see [ID:nN20380236]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had started to believe that there was light at the end
of the credit crisis tunnel and a lot of the wind got taken
out of the sails," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer
of Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 289.60
points, or 3.56 percent, to 7,841.73. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX tumbled 37.21 points, or 4.28 percent, to
832.39. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 64.86 points,
or 3.88 percent, to 1,608.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM SLIPS AFTER BELL, TEXAS INSTRUMENTS UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the closing bell, IBM (IBM.N) reported a
bigger-than-expected fall in quarterly sales, showing that
even one of the healthier U.S. technology companies was being
hurt by a slowdown in spending. [ID:nN20352411]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's stock fell 3 percent to $97.47 in extended-hours
trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Texas Instruments TXN.N shares rose 2.1 percent
after the bell to $17.69 following the tech bellwether's
report of a small quarterly profit and better-than-expected
revenue as demand for its chips appeared to stabilize even
though it emphasized "caution about the business climate."
[ID:nN20403813]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANKS' CREDIT LOSSES A CONCERN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sharp sell-off in the regular session was exacerbated
by comments from Bank of America Chief Executive Ken Lewis
that the already bad credit environment is getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy and commodity shares also fell, with U.S. crude oil
futures ending nearly 9 percent lower amid pressure from
economic concerns and a rally in the U.S. dollar on safe-haven
bids. The SP Energy Index .GSPE dropped 4.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding to the bank worry, U.S. government officials have
determined they can avoid asking Congress for more bank
bailout funds by converting the existing loans to some U.S.
banks into common stock, the New York Times reported. Such a
move would dilute stockholders' stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Citigroup Inc (C.N) lost 19.5 percent to $2.94
after Goldman Sachs analysts said credit losses at the bank
continued to grow at a rapid rate and estimated the bank's
underlying first-quarter loss was 38 cents a share.
[ID:nBNG445204].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The KBW bank index .BKX tumbled 15.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fueling more bank concerns were comments from J.P. Morgan
Securities, which said it estimates U.S. banks to incur $400
billion more in losses from the credit crisis and expects
there will be a need for more capital for certain
institutions. [ID:nBNG453139]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Treasury also said on Monday that there was "no
basis" for a report that showed its "stress tests" on the
health of the nation's top 19 banks showed several were
"technically insolvent." [ID:nN20390864]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The major indexes suffered their worst performance on a
percentage basis since March 5. But the SP 500 remains up 23
percent from the bear market closing low on March 9, with that
advance spurred by some positive comments from banks and hopes
that data signaled the economic slump may be moderating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index
.VIX, which measures the SP 500's implied volatility and is
also known as the "fear gauge," jumped 15.4 percent, its
biggest one-day rise since Jan. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding to the negative tone, U.S. President Barack Obama
said over the weekend the economy remains under strain and his
top economic adviser tempered hopes for a speedy recovery.
[ID:nN19340427].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the merger front, Oracle Corp ORCL.O  said it would
buy Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O for about $7.4 billion after
Sun's talks with IBM (IBM.N) broke down earlier this month.
[ID:nN20381533].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oracle shares shed 1.3 percent to $18.82, while Sun, the
high-end computer server and software maker, surged 37 percent
to $9.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was active on the New York Stock Exchange, with
about 1.76 billion shares changing hands, above last year's
estimated daily average of 1.49 billion, while on Nasdaq,
about 3.08 billion shares traded,  well above last year's
daily average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by
a ratio of more than 9 to 1, while on the Nasdaq, more than
five stocks fell for every one that rose.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM reported a bigger-than-expected fall in quarterly sales, showing that even one of the healthier U.S. technology companies is getting hurt by a slowdown in corporate spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in the firm slid more than 3 percent in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAMES BREHM, ANALYST, FROST  SULLIVAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the things that stands out when I look at IBM's announcement were the 16 services deals greater than $100 million. Services is really bringing those guys along...I think it's a better day to be at IBM than it is at Oracle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's good. I was wondering why the market was starting to rally, now I see why. Ahead of pace for 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 per share. This is a very good quarter, well above expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not quite sure where the light revenues are coming from, but I'd say that's a secondary issue, especially since they reaffirmed guidance above the consensus. The market in the after-hours is reacting very positively to it. Their long term outlook is very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The consensus for 2010, which admittedly is very far out, is $9.78 and they are going to do $10 to $11. Revenues were impacted by a strong dollar. Understandable, certainly explainable...but it's going to take a while to verify that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tax rate did help some, it was a full percentage point less than last year in the first quarter. Over $12 billion in cash on hand, this is a company that can do a major acquisition. Strong free cash flow, strong balance sheet. So this is a very good quarter and it should certainly help the markets tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZACH ROSENSTOCK, ANALYST, WAYNE HUMMER WEALTH MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like people aren't too happy with what they are seeing. For me the thing that's upsetting is revenues, down 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's echoing some of the things we've seen from other companies, saying revenues aren't that good but earnings are really strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They reiterated guidance...but people really want to see the revenues pick up. For a while, (better-than-expected earnings) was driven by top-line growth, now you are getting it from profit margins or adjustments here and there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER MISEK, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's kind of as expected. They beat on EPS. They reiterated on guidance. I didn't expect them to miss on revenue by that much, which is probably why the stock is trading off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Short-term bookings look a little weaker than everybody had hoped. That probably means that the next quarter will be mixed. The long-term guide looks solid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle, Bill Rigby and Gabriel Madway, Compiled by Edwin Chan)&lt;/p&gt;

decreased 11 percent (4 percent, adjusting for currency) from the first quarter

"IBM continued to perform well in a very difficult economic environment. This
was due to our long-term strategic focus: shifting into software and services,
divesting of commodity businesses, and creating solutions that help clients
reduce cost and conserve capital. At the same time we have a disciplined
approach to cost and expense management giving us a strong financial position,"
said Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. 

"We are well-positioned to continue to move aggressively and leverage our strong
cash performance to make the most of the opportunities that arise, including
smarter planet initiatives and other strategic options. We remain ahead of pace
for our 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 per share."

The weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding in the
first-quarter 2009 was 1.35 billion compared with 1.41 billion shares in the

31, 2009, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 7.0 to 1. Non-global financing
debt totaled $7.6 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion since year-end 2008,
resulting in a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 42.4 percent from 48.7 percent,

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Microsoft's chief executive said on Monday he was 'very surprised' by Oracle Corp's plans to buy Sun Microsystems Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I just learnt it ... I need to think about it. I am very surprised," Steve Ballmer told Reuters in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Monday Oracle unveiled a plan to buy Sun for more than $7 billion, after the high-end computer server and software maker's talks with IBM fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp is itself talking to Yahoo Inc on an Internet search advertising partnership which could help it turn around its money-losing online business and challenge rival Google's dominant position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer told a news conference in Moscow it was the right time to invest in that business. "We are clearly losing money. We will make money some day. Now it is the right time to invest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that advertising will be the most important way for us to make money in the online business, search, in display advertising, and partnership with Facebook is a part of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Microsoft took a $240 million stake in internet social network Facebook, beating out Google and expanding its advertising partnership with the social networking company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the potential deal with Yahoo may help it turn around its online business and challenge Google's dominant and growing share of the U.S. search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also said the economic crisis was the right time to invest in innovations, adding Microsoft will spend a total of $9 billion on research and development this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RUSSIA INVESTMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft planned to invest 10 billion roubles ($299 million) in projects in Russia in the next three years to support small businesses and promote computer literacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiatives range from projects to increase computer literacy to the creation of innovation and research facilities, Ballmer said, adding they aimed to help Russia respond to the current economic crisis and build sustainable economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view Russia not only as a market of great strategic importance for Microsoft but also as an important center for future innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth ... despite the challenges we face I am extremely optimistic about the long-term future," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=33.46 roubles)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More Than 90 Institutions to Benefit
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil today announced that 92 universities and colleges across New York are
recipients of $3.24 million through the ExxonMobil Foundation`s 2008 Educational
Matching Gift Program. 

Since its inception in 1962, the program has provided $398 million to higher
education institutions in the United States. Through the matching program,
donors may pledge up to $7,500 per year to colleges or universities with which
they are affiliated, the American Indian College Foundation, the Hispanic
Scholarship Foundation and the United Negro College Fund. Donations are matched
on a 3-to-1 basis. 

"These donations are a remarkable testament to the value ExxonMobil employees
place on higher education," said Kenneth P. Cohen, vice president for public
affairs and chairman, ExxonMobil Foundation. "We`re investing in the future,
campus by campus, by providing these much needed dollars for colleges and
universities to increase their level of excellence." 

ExxonMobil Foundation funds math and science programs to respond to the nation`s
growing need to produce more engineers and scientists and to develop more highly
qualified math and science teachers. Although matching funds are unrestricted,
the Foundation is encouraging college and university presidents to direct a
portion of the matching funds to programs that provide math and science teachers
with professional development, attract more young people to teach math and
science, and support programs that encourage women and minorities to become
scientists and engineers. 

ExxonMobil Foundation is the primary philanthropic arm of the Exxon Mobil
Corporation in the United States. The Foundation and the Corporation engage in a
range of philanthropic activities that advance education, health and science in
the communities where ExxonMobil has significant operations. In the United
States, ExxonMobil supports initiatives to improve math and science education at
the K-12 and higher education levels. 

Globally, ExxonMobil provides funding to improve basic education and combat
malaria and other infectious diseases in developing countries. In 2008, together
with its employees and retirees, Exxon Mobil Corporation, its divisions and
affiliates, and ExxonMobil Foundation provided $225 million in contributions
worldwide, of which more than $89 million was dedicated to education. Additional
information on ExxonMobil`s community partnerships and contributions programs is
available at www.exxonmobil.com/community.

&lt;p&gt;More Than 25 Institutions to Benefit
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil today announced that 29 universities and colleges across New Jersey
are recipients of $1.07 million through the ExxonMobil Foundation`s 2008
Educational Matching Gift Program. 

Since its inception in 1962, the program has provided $398 million to higher
education institutions in the United States. Through the matching program,
donors may pledge up to $7,500 per year to colleges or universities with which
they are affiliated, the American Indian College Foundation, the Hispanic
Scholarship Foundation and the United Negro College Fund. Donations are matched
on a 3-to-1 basis. 

"These donations are a remarkable testament to the value ExxonMobil employees
place on higher education," said Kenneth P. Cohen, vice president for public
affairs and chairman, ExxonMobil Foundation. "We`re investing in the future,
campus by campus, by providing these much needed dollars for colleges and
universities to increase their level of excellence." 

ExxonMobil Foundation funds math and science programs to respond to the nation`s
growing need to produce more engineers and scientists and to develop more highly
qualified math and science teachers. Although matching funds are unrestricted,
the Foundation is encouraging college and university presidents to direct a
portion of the matching funds to programs that provide math and science teachers
with professional development, attract more young people to teach math and
science, and support programs that encourage women and minorities to become
scientists and engineers. 

ExxonMobil Foundation is the primary philanthropic arm of the Exxon Mobil
Corporation in the United States. The Foundation and the Corporation engage in a
range of philanthropic activities that advance education, health and science in
the communities where ExxonMobil has significant operations. In the United
States, ExxonMobil supports initiatives to improve math and science education at
the K-12 and higher education levels. 

Globally, ExxonMobil provides funding to improve basic education and combat
malaria and other infectious diseases in developing countries. In 2008, together
with its employees and retirees, Exxon Mobil Corporation, its divisions and
affiliates, and ExxonMobil Foundation provided $225 million in contributions
worldwide, of which more than $89 million was dedicated to education. Additional
information on ExxonMobil`s community partnerships and contributions programs is

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments on online business, Russian investments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Maria Kiselyova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, April 20 (Reuters) - Microsoft's (MSFT.O) chief
executive said on Monday he was 'very surprised' by Oracle
Corp's ORCL.O plans to buy Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I just learnt it ...  I need to think about it. I am very
surprised," Steve Ballmer told Reuters in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Monday Oracle unveiled a plan to buy Sun for more
than $7 billion, after the high-end computer server and software
maker's talks with IBM (IBM.N) fell apart. [ID:nN20381533]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is itself talking to Yahoo Inc
(YHOO.O) on an Internet search advertising partnership which
could help it turn around its money-losing online business and
challenge rival Google's (GOOG.O) dominant position.
[ID:nN17347356]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer told a news conference in Moscow it was the right
time to invest in that business. "We are clearly losing money.
We will make money some day. Now it is the right time to
invest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think that advertising will be the most important way for
us to make money in the online business, search, in display
advertising, and partnership with Facebook is a part of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year Microsoft took a $240 million stake in internet
social network Facebook, beating out Google and expanding its
advertising partnership with the social networking company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say the potential deal with Yahoo may help it turn
around its online business and challenge Google's dominant and
growing share of the U.S. search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer also said the economic crisis was the right time to
invest in innovations, adding Microsoft will spend a total of $9
billion on research and development this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RUSSIA INVESTMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Microsoft planned to invest 10 billion roubles ($299
million) in projects in Russia in the next three years to
support small businesses and promote computer literacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The initiatives range from projects to increase computer
literacy to the creation of innovation and research facilities,
Ballmer said, adding they aimed to help Russia respond to the
current economic crisis and build sustainable economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We view Russia not only as a market of great strategic
importance for Microsoft but also as an important centre for
future innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth ...
despite the challenges we face I am extremely optimistic about
the long-term future," Ballmer said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp beat discount retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc to regain the top of Fortune magazine's list of the 500 biggest publicly traded companies, based on revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widely watched Fortune 500 list, released Sunday, showed that the world's largest listed oil company regained the top spot, raking in $442.9 billion of revenue in 2008, despite the decline of energy prices late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon also was the most profitable, earning $45.2 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That performance displaced Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, which fell to runner-up after topping the list six of the past seven years. The retailer's revenue climbed 7 percent to $405.6 billion as recession-weary consumers tried to stretch their dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what was one of the worst years ever for stock markets, most companies saw revenue and earnings tumble. Overall, earnings of the Fortune 500 fell 85 percent to $99 billion last year. That, the magazine said, was the biggest one-year drop since it began compiling its list 55 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy companies, buoyed by soaring prices earlier in 2008, dominated the top ranks. Chevron Corp again came in third at $263.2 billion in revenue, up 25 percent, while ConocoPhillips climbed one notch to fourth with $230.8 billion of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co, the industrial conglomerate weighed down by its financial arm's woes, still managed to rise one slot to fifth place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, money-losing financial services companies were the hardest hit last year. Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp fell out of the top 10, while Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and Wachovia Corp were among 38 companies dropping off the list completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;900 Institutions of Higher Education to Benefit
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil and its employees donated more than $36 million to 900colleges and
universities across the United States through the ExxonMobil Foundation`s 2008
Educational Matching Gift Program. 

ExxonMobil employees, retirees, surviving spouses and directors made more than
8,500 individual contributions totaling more than $11 million to institutions of
higher education in 2008, which were matched by the ExxonMobil Foundation with
more than $25 million in unrestricted educational grants. 

Since its inception in 1962, the program has provided $398 million to higher
education institutions in the United States. Through the matching program,
donors may pledge up to $7,500 per year to colleges or universities with which
they are affiliated, the American Indian College Foundation, the Hispanic
Scholarship Foundation and the United Negro College Fund. Donations are matched
on a 3-to-1 basis. 

These donations are a remarkable testament to the value ExxonMobil employees and
retirees place on higher education," said Kenneth P. Cohen, ExxonMobil vice
president for public affairs and chairman, ExxonMobil Foundation. "We`re
investing in the future, campus by campus, by providing these much needed
dollars for colleges and universities to increase their level of excellence." 

ExxonMobil Foundation funds math and science programs to respond to the nation`s
growing need to produce more engineers and scientists and to develop more highly
qualified math and science teachers. Although matching funds are unrestricted,
the Foundation is encouraging college and university presidents to direct a
portion of the matching funds to programs that provide math and science teachers
with professional development, attract more young people to teach math and
science, and support programs that encourage women and minorities to become
scientists and engineers. 

ExxonMobil Foundation is the primary philanthropic arm of the Exxon Mobil
Corporation in the United States. The Foundation and the Corporation engage in a
range of philanthropic activities that advance education, health and science in
the communities where ExxonMobil has significant operations. In the United
States, ExxonMobil supports initiatives to improve math and science education at
the K-12 and higher education levels. 

Globally, ExxonMobil provides funding to improve basic education and combat
malaria and other infectious diseases in developing countries. In 2008, together
with its employees and retirees, Exxon Mobil Corporation, its divisions and
affiliates, and ExxonMobil Foundation provided $225 million in contributions
worldwide, of which more than $89 million was dedicated to education. Additional
information on ExxonMobil`s community partnerships and contributions programs is
available at www.exxonmobil.com/community.

&lt;p&gt;April 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is
well-positioned to pass the U.S. government's stress test, and
it does not need to issue equity, said Citigroup, which raised
its price target on the U.S. banking giant's stock by 52
percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on
Thursday, demonstrating the kind of resilience that allowed
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to assert the bank could pay back
the government $25 billion immediately. [ID:nN16542451]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we do not expect Troubled Asset Relief Program
repayment near-term, JPMorgan clearly has the financial
flexibility to repay the government when the time comes,
potentially as soon as later this year," analyst Keith Horowitz
said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citing better performance at JPMorgan's investment bank,
though offset by higher credit card losses, the analyst raised
his 2010 profit estimates for the bank by 15 cents to $3.30 a
share. He raised his price target on the stock to $35 from $23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, JPMorgan shares fell in morning trade after Bank
of America (BAC.N) reported its first-quarter results and said
it continued to face "extremely difficult challenges,"
primarily from deteriorating credit quality. [ID:nN20380236]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan were trading down about 4 percent at
$31.93 Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

starting at $9.95 per month, which allows its subscribers to take full advantage
of the world`s most advanced and most broadly deployed enterprise level email
and collaboration product - Microsoft Exchange. IceMAIL makes corporate grade
email available to individuals and businesses without requiring them to make

&lt;p&gt;Enables Operators to Enhance Quality of Experience and Ensure Premium Content is
Delivered Securely to Internet TV and Mobile TV Subscribers


SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Envivio Inc., the leading provider of compression solutions for Three Screens
video convergence, announced today that its award-winning 4Caster C4 is the
first carrier-grade video encoder with comprehensive support for both Microsoft
Internet Information Services 7.0 (IIS) Live Smooth Streaming and Silverlight
DRM, powered by PlayReady. The integration of these technologies into the
4Caster C4 offers service providers a complete professional headend solution for
highly secure, high quality content delivery to Microsoft Silverlight clients on
PCs, Macs and mobile devices. Envivio will demonstrate IIS Live Smooth Streaming
with Silverlight DRM at NAB 2009 in Las Vegas from April 20 - 23, 2009 at Booth
SU2424. 

"Consumer demand for sophisticated and highly secure live and on-demand online
entertainment is both increasing and maturing year over year," said Steve
Sklepowich, group product manager for Silverlight at Microsoft Corp. "Smooth
Streaming and Silverlight DRM, paired with Envivio`s encoding platform, enable
the delivery of true HD and highly secure video to a wide range of devices over
the public IP infrastructure." 

IIS Smooth Streaming is Microsoft`s HTTP-based adaptive streaming platform that
consistently delivers the highest quality online video stream with instant start
up times to any Internet connection speed with minimal buffering, stuttering or
dropped frames. The platform dynamically detects local bandwidth and CPU
conditions and seamlessly switches, in near real time, the video quality of
content that a player receives. Smooth Streaming scales to support a full range
of content distribution applications, from lower bandwidth mobile connections to
very high bandwidth Internet connections. 

Microsoft Silverlight DRM powered by PlayReady, enables secure, encrypted
delivery of high value content from the headend to a consumer's playback device.
Unlike stream encryption technologies, Silverlight DRM protects the actual
content inside a secure encrypted wrapper to ensure that content is used only as
intended by the content owner. This level of protection makes it possible for
service providers to deliver premium content safely to subscribers over any
public HTTP network. Microsoft deploys Silverlight DRM by enabling key third
party DRM licensees such as BuyDRM, an Austin, TX based Silverlight DRM rights
management and solutions provider, which offers a complete and secure solution
to customers. 

NAB Demonstration

At NAB 2009, Envivio and BuyDRM will demonstrate the world`s first end-to-end,
fully protected content delivery system using IIS Live Smooth Streaming and
Silverlight DRM. Live streams will be captured by the Envivio 4Caster C4 and
encoded into the numerous VC-1 profiles of different bit rates required for IIS
Smooth Streaming. The output profiles will then be encrypted using PlayReady
with an encryption key managed via BuyDRM`s KeyOS platform. The encrypted
content will be delivered using IIS Smooth Streaming technology to a Silverlight
PC client, which will request the decryption key from the KeyOS platform and
then decrypt the video and audio content for playback. 

Envivio 4Caster C4

The Envivio 4Caster C4 convergence encoder is the world`s first to provide video
compression for all Three Screens of consumer video - TVs, PCs and mobile
devices - on a single platform. The 4Caster C4 enables network operators to take
multiple channels of content and encode them for mobile TV, Internet TV, and SD
and HD IPTV delivery using just one platform. The unique combination of a
high-availability hardware appliance with an embedded software encoding core
enables the feature set and performance of the C4 to evolve and keep pace with
the constantly changing needs of service providers. 

"Subscribers' quality of experience is the common denominator that separates
successful IP video services from the pack," said Julien Sign&#232;s, President and
CEO of Envivio. "Envivio designed flexibility into its encoding platform
specifically to allow evolution over time. Enhanced encoding implementations and
valuable new technologies such as IIS Smooth Streaming and Silverlight DRM can
be added to our encoders via software upgrades, enabling operators to keep their
services optimized so they can continue to attract and retain the maximum number
of subscribers." 

The Envivio and BuyDRM demonstration of IIS Live Smooth Streaming with
Silverlight DRM will be on display at the Envivio stand at NAB - Booth SU2424.
It will also be on display at the Microsoft stand - Booth SL720.

&lt;p&gt;Appalachian Woman Standing up to Big Coal`s Destructive Mountaintop Removal
Mining is among the Recipients of World`s Largest Prize for Grassroots
Environmentalists
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
The 2009 Goldman Environmental Prize recipients are a group of fearless
grassroots leaders taking on government and corporate interests and working to
improve the environment for people in their communities. 

This year`s recipients include Maria Gunnoe, a born-and-bred West Virginian who
faces death threats for her outspoken activism to stop the coal industry`s
plunder of Appalachia via mountaintop removal and valley fills. Another
recipient, Marc Ona, a wheelchair-bound civil society leader from the West
African country of Gabon, faces arrest, imprisonment and public character
assaults for his unyielding campaign to stop a destructive mining concession in
a protected national park. 

Other recipients include a Russian scientist connecting NGOs across Eastern
Europe and the Caucasus to identify and safely remove toxic chemical stockpiles;
two Saramaka leaders, members of a Maroon community in Suriname founded by freed
African slaves in the 1700s, whose legal struggle to protect their tribal land
rights led to a binding decision for all indigenous and tribal peoples in the
Americas; Bangladesh`s leading environmental attorney, whose legal advocacy led
to tighter regulations on the environmentally devastating and exploitative ship
breaking industry; and an Indonesian woman developing community-based waste
management systems to stem her island nation`s overwhelming waste infrastructure
problems. 

"This group of Goldman Prize recipients is as impressive as ever, taking on
seemingly insurmountable struggles and achieving success," said Goldman Prize
founder Richard N. Goldman. "In this, our 20th year, we are pleased to bring
attention to their courageous work." 

The Goldman Environmental Prize is awarded annually to grassroots environmental
heroes from each of the world`s six inhabited continental regions and is the
largest award of its kind with an individual cash prize of $150,000. The winners
will be awarded the Prize at an invitation-only ceremony Monday, April 20, 2009
at 5 p.m. at the San Francisco Opera House and will also be honored at a smaller
ceremony on Earth Day, Wednesday, April 22, at the Smithsonian's National Museum
of Natural History in Washington, D.C. 

This year`s winners are:

Maria Gunnoe, Bob White, West Virginia, USA: In the heart of Appalachia, where
the coal industry wields enormous power over government and public opinion,
lifelong resident Maria Gunnoe fights against environmentally devastating
mountaintop removal mining and valley fill operations. 

Marc Ona, Libreville, Gabon: In Gabon, a country without a culture of civic
engagement, Marc Ona led efforts to publicly expose the unlawful agreements
behind a huge Chinese mining development project that threatens the sensitive
ecosystems of his country`s equatorial rainforests. 

Rizwana Hasan, Dhaka, Bangladesh: Working to reduce the impact of Bangladesh`s
exploitative and environmentally destructive ship breaking industry, leading
environmental attorney Rizwana Hasan led a legal battle resulting in increased
government regulation and heightened public awareness about the dangers of ship
breaking. 

Olga Speranskaya, Moscow, Russia: Russian scientist Olga Speranskaya transformed
the NGO community in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia into a
potent, participatory force working to identify and eliminate the Soviet legacy
of toxic chemicals in the environment. 

Yuyun Ismawati, Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia: As waste management problems mount
throughout the Indonesian archipelago, Yuyun Ismawati implements sustainable
community-based solutions that provide employment opportunities to low-income
people and empower them to improve the environment. 

Wanze Eduards and Hugo Jabini, Pikin Slee Village and Paramaribo, Suriname:
Wanze Eduards and Hugo Jabini, members of Maroon communities originally
established by freed African slaves in the 1700s, successfully organized their
communities against logging on their traditional lands, ultimately leading to a
landmark ruling for indigenous and tribal peoples throughout the Americas to
control resource exploitation in their territories. 

About the Goldman Environmental Prize

The Goldman Environmental Prize was established in 1989 by San Francisco civic
leader and philanthropist Richard N. Goldman and his late wife, Rhoda H.
Goldman. It has been awarded to 133 people from 75 countries. 

Prize winners are selected by an international jury from confidential
nominations submitted by a worldwide network of environmental organizations and
individuals. 

Previous Prize winners have been at the center of some of the world`s most
pressing environmental challenges, including seeking justice for victims of
environmental disasters at Love Canal and Bhopal, India; leading the fight for
dolphin-safe tuna and fighting oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge. 

Since receiving a Goldman Prize, eight winners have been appointed or elected to
national office in their countries, including several who became ministers of
the environment. The 1991 Goldman Prize winner for Africa, Wangari Maathai, won

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Apr 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
RSA Conference, Booth #1152 -- At the 2009 RSA Conference, Liquid
Machines today announced a major upgrade to the Liquid Machines Gateway
for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server that delivers support for dynamic,
role-based ERM policies with Microsoft Active Directory Rights Management
Services (AD RMS). ERM policies map directly to Microsoft Office
SharePoint Server 2007 permission levels for document libraries, enable
advanced enforcement options and application-level auditing, and
dynamically synchronize policy updates that occur to files in use outside
of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007.

    The Gateway for SharePoint is tightly integrated with AD RMS and Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server 2007 to persistently protect files opened or
downloaded from SharePoint. The Liquid Machines Gateway for SharePoint
supports existing business processes and workflows by extending persistent
information protection to a broader range of document and file types, and
enabling advanced rights-managed workflows.

    "Our new role-based policy support and advanced auditing makes it easier
for our Office SharePoint Server 2007 customers to deploy and administer
persistent information protection with AD RMS in support of compliance and
governance initiatives," said Ed Gaudet, senior vice president of
corporate development and marketing. "With this release, Liquid Machines
continues to raise the bar for enterprise rights management integration
with industry-leading enterprise content management systems such as
Microsoft SharePoint."

     "A long-standing Microsoft partner, Liquid Machines has enabled customers
to extend AD RMS information protection to hundreds of file formats and
devices within SharePoint environments," said John "JG" Chirapurath,
director in the Identity and Security Business Group at Microsoft. "With
the addition of role-based policies and advanced auditing, our joint AD
RMS and Liquid Machines customers benefit from increased protection and
detailed compliance reporting of regulated information."

    "Properly securing an enterprise content management (ECM) system requires
an information-centric (not device- or network centric) mindset for
protecting content throughout its life cycle," said Gartner Principal
Research Analyst Adam Hils. "As part of an information-centric approach,
enterprises should consider enterprise DRM solutions that integrate
directly with the ECM so that the information rights management policy may
be applied automatically as content is moved to and from an ECM document
folder."(1)

    Key features and benefits of the Liquid Machines Gateway for
SharePoint
include:


--  Dynamic, role-based ERM Policies map directly to Office SharePoint
    Server 2007 permission levels for document libraries, enabling advanced
    enforcement options and application-level auditing. Users benefit from
    these unique role-based policies through the newly consolidated and
    simplified administration of policies. Owners of Office SharePoint Server
    2007 document libraries can easily protect their file-based assets using
    ERM policies backed by Microsoft AD RMS. ERM policies are automatically
    applied to files that are in use or saved outside of Office SharePoint
    Server 2007, persistently protecting them regardless of where they travel.

--  Advanced Auditing and Dynamic Policy Updates provide Microsoft AD RMS
    users with enhanced compliance reporting and controls. With the Gateway for
    SharePoint, organizations can take advantage of advanced enforcement
    capabilities such as an extended permission set and detailed user-level
    auditing.  All permissions including print and offline-use can be varied by
    user or group.  Changes to Office SharePoint Server 2007 permissions (i.e.
    ERM policies) are automatically synchronized, and policies on files in use
    outside of Office SharePoint Server 2007 (i.e. downloaded to disk or
    checked-out) are dynamically updated and enforced in all respective
    documents that have been downloaded from protected document libraries.

--  Enhanced Granularity of Usage Controls allow Office SharePoint Server
    2007 document library owners the ability to set print and offline
    permissions by users or groups. With Liquid Machines, ERM policies are role-
    based, containing one or more roles (e.g. author, reviewer, approver,
    executive, auditor, compliance, etc.). Roles define those authorized users
    or groups that have access to information and their specific set of
    permissions, or usage rights (e.g. read only, edit, print, expiration,
    etc.).

--  More Than 400 Files Types are supported by the Liquid Machines Gateway
    for SharePoint, which automatically protects files with Microsoft AD RMS.
    In addition to native applications (e.g. Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat
    and Reader, Microsoft Visio), Liquid Machines adds AD RMS protection to
    over 400 file types including text, graphic, word processing, spreadsheets,
    presentation, CAD, database, and email. Examples of supported file types
    include those from the following applications: Adobe Reader, FrameMaker,
    Lotus AMI Pro, Corel WordPerfect, StarOffice, WordStar, MacWrite, Paint
    Shop, Corel Draw, Photoshop, Illustrator, Micrografx, OpenOffice, Visio,
    Lotus 123, Access, Paradox, Outlook, and Yahoo IM.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Apr 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
RSA Conference, Booth #1152 - Liquid Machines, Inc., the leader in
Enterprise Rights Management (ERM) solutions, today unveiled a major
release of its Liquid Machines Gateway for the BlackBerry(R) Enterprise
Solution from Research In Motion (RIM) (NASDAQ: RIMM) (TSX: RIM). The
Liquid Machines Gateway adds advanced features that allow persistent
protection of attachments saved in more than 400 different file formats.
In this release, Liquid Machines has also added support for the latest
BlackBerry(R) smartphones.

    Mobile access to real-time communications and data can increase the risk
of a loss of confidential enterprise information such as intellectual
property and other trade secrets. To help solve this problem, the Liquid
Machines Gateway extends Microsoft(R) AD RMS information protection to a
BlackBerry smartphone in conjunction with the BlackBerry Enterprise
Server, enabling customers to persistently protect emails and attachments
with encryption and usage controls that travel with the data. This
persistent protection ensures that mobile communications, which may
include executive and board communications, customer data, intellectual
property and human resources information, can only be viewed by
authorized users.

    "By delivering Microsoft AD RMS support to the BlackBerry platform, Liquid
Machines extends our market-leading solution to cover the most popular and
widely used file formats available," said Ed Gaudet, senior vice president
of corporate development and marketing. "Our mutual customers now can
enjoy the productivity of a BlackBerry smartphone with the additional
protection of AD RMS to provide the freedom to securely send and receive
persistently protected emails and attachments created in over 400
formats."

    Unlike some mobile data protection tools that only secure the data at rest
on the device or during transmission, Liquid Machines persistently
protects emails and attachments at the user-level by restricting
unauthorized actions such as view, forward, reply, select/paste, and can
automatically expire content based on corporate usage and retention
policies.

    According to Gartner Analyst John Girard in the report "Pay for Mobile
Data Encryption Upfront, or Pay More Later": "The cost to mitigate a
single compromised data record is comparable to or greater than the seat
cost of a mobile data protection (encryption) tool, and mitigation costs
likely will increase as fines and public sensitivity increase, and as
more countries consider disclosure laws... The bottom line is that a
significant number of PCs and media devices carrying business data will
not be properly encrypted and are fated to cause disasters for companies
and the individuals who are affected. The odds suggest that this will
happen to your organization, whether it is small, midsize or large... The
existence of an analysis developed with your company's business processes
as the focus makes the risks to mobile data impossible to deny, and will
set the foundation for encryption across all systems, including all
instances of removable media, PDAs, smartphones, desktops and servers."(1)

    Liquid Machines enables users to protect new or previously unprotected
messages with AD RMS policies directly from a BlackBerry smartphone. Major
new and enhanced features in the Liquid Machines Gateway include:


--  Persistent Protection of Emails on BlackBerry Smartphones helps to
    prevent the loss of confidential information contained in email. Additional
    enforcement capabilities can help to block the leakage of sensitive data by
    preventing the user from using the cut/copy/paste function as well as
    preventing the user from forwarding emails to people outside of their
    corporate network.
--  Secure Attachment Handling enables BlackBerry users to email
    confidential documents and files with the added protection of AD RMS. The
    attachments are encrypted, persistently protecting them while at rest, in
    transit and in use on a BlackBerry smartphone. Authorized users can be
    prevented from forwarding data from attachments by disallowing the use of
    the clipboard (i.e. cut, copy, paste), SMS or PIN messaging or removable
    storage (i.e. microSD/SDHC).
--  More Than 400 Files Types are supported by the Liquid Machines
    Gateway. Using Microsoft Outlook, Liquid Machines enables users to send
    more than 400 different file types as attachments protected using AD RMS.
    These file types include text, graphic, word processing, spreadsheets,
    presentation, CAD, database and email. Examples of supported file types
    include those from the following applications: Adobe Reader, FrameMaker,
    Lotus AMI Pro, Corel WordPerfect, StarOffice, WordStar, MacWrite, Paint
    Shop, Corel Draw, Photoshop, Illustrator, Micrografx, OpenOffice, Visio,
    Lotus 123, Access, Paradox, Outlook, and Yahoo IM.
--  Support for New BlackBerry Smartphones running BlackBerry(R) OS v4.1
    and above. Liquid Machines adds support for the latest BlackBerry
    smartphones including the BlackBerry(R) Storm(TM), BlackBerry(R) Bold(TM),
    BlackBerry(R) Curve(TM) series, BlackBerry(R) Pearl(TM) series and
    BlackBerry(R) Pearl(TM) Flip smartphones.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks Biogen Idec (Nasdaq: BIIB) as Bull of the Day and
Liberty Property Trust (NYSE: LRY) as Bear of the Day. In addition, the analysts
at Zacks Equity Research discuss the latest on BB Corp. (NYSE: BBT), Goldman
Sachs (NYSE: GS) and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

Biogen Idec (Nasdaq: BIIB) posted solid results in the first quarter of 2009,
despite the slowdown in Tysabri sales due to fears of PML. We think the Biogen
core business will remain strong over the next several quarters. Tysabri
prescriptions are showing an improvement and we believe will resume their
previous pace shortly. 

In the meantime, the name is significant under-valued and would be a very
attractive takeout candidate for a large-cap pharmaceutical company looking for
a great phase III pipeline. We expect 2009 to be an eventful year on the
pipeline front. 

As investors become more comfortable with both Tysabri trends and emerging
pipeline, we believe shares will recover back into the low $60s. At today's
price, the name is too attractive to ignore. 

Bear of the Day

Office and industrial markets continue to weaken throughout the US, which is bad
news for Liberty Property Trust (NYSE: LRY). In the current environment, we do
not favor suburban industrial/office companies as rental rates and occupancies
continue their downward trend. 

The company recently cut its quarterly payout to $0.475 per share, 24% lower
than the previous payout. Negative job growth trends will keep shares under
pressure. Despite the economic downturn in the US, operations held up relatively
well in 4Q08. In addition, the company has used to debt and equity to raise
capital in a tight credit environment. 

LRY now has plenty of liquidity to address near-term debt maturities. We
maintain our near-term Sell rating based primarily on macroeconomic factors. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

BB Better Than Expected

BB Corp. (NYSE: BBT) reported its 1Q09 financial results before market open,
with a conference call held later this morning. Operating earnings for the
quarter came in at $187 million or $0.33 per diluted share, two pennies ahead of
consensus. Though the company had a decent growth in loans and deposits and
increased production in mortgage banking operations, credit quality worsened
sharply, mainly due to deterioration in its housing loan portfolio in Florida,
Atlanta and Metro D.C. areas. 

BBT joined the group of banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and JP Morgan
Chase (NYSE: JPM) waiting to be de-TARP-ed, as soon as possible. During the
conference call, the CEO said that the bank would pay back TARP funds as soon
they get government approval to do so, (presumably after the stress tests are
completed), as he considers it to be "destructive." 

Net interest income for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 1.6% sequentially and
average loans and leases for the quarter increased to $97.3 billion, with growth
spread in all categories except the retail loans and mortgage loans. Average
deposits increased 8.5% year-over-year to $93.9 billion.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:
GS), JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) and GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME).

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

GE Down, but Not Out

General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) reported first-quarter earnings of $0.26 vs.
$0.43 a year ago, but better than the $0.21 consensus expectations. The only
real area of strength for the firm was in its Energy Infrastructure business,
where segment profits increased by 19%. The most significant areas of weakness
were at NBC Universal, which was hit hard by weak advertising revenues
(something shared by almost all media companies) and the GE capital unit. 

Investors are probably most concerned about the Capital unit. The good news is
that the unit was still profitable, and it has shrunk its asset base. The bad
news is that the profits are down 58% and the credit trends look awful. 

Citi Results: Any Reason to Cheer?

Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) today announced that it made a net profit of $1.6
billion, compared with a net loss of $5.1 billion a year earlier. But after
taking into account the conversion and dividend on preferred stock, the loss was
$0.18 per share for common shareholders, which was better than the consensus
estimate of a loss of $0.34 per share. 

The results benefited from strong trading income and favorable accounting rules.


Like Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM), Citigroup also
benefited strong revenues in fixed income trading, resulting from high
volatility and wider spreads in many products. The fixed income markets group
had revenues of $4.7 billion. However, of this revenue, a net $2.5 billion came
from an accounting rule adopted in 2007, which allowed the company to benefit
from the widening of its credit default swap (CDS) spreads. 

U.S. Video Games Sales Drop

Yesterday, the NPD Group reported that US video game sales in March dropped more
than expected. Sales of hardware, software and accessories fell 17% year-on-year
to $1.43 billion. For the first quarter, sales were flat at $4.25 billion. The
double-digit decline was larger than expected. Most forecasts expected software
sales to be flat to down slightly. 

Unlike the rest of retail, video games sales have held up extraordinarily well
during this economic downturn. Video games are cheaper form of entertainment
than other activities like going to the movies or going to a sporting event. The
games are played in the home, which ties in with the trend of consumers wanted
to stay home more to save money. That makes the March sales decline important
data that could point to weakness finally spreading into the video games
industry. 

The NPD`s March sales report is giving GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) investors a
reason to sell the stock. GME shares are down about 10% since the news was
released yesterday. In response, GameStop management is out this morning trying
to assuage investor fears. The retailer updated its financial outlook for its
first quarter and fiscal year 2009. Management is still seeing strong sell-thru
of new video games released in February and March, such as Street Fighter IV,
Resident Evil 5, and Halo Wars and the launch of Nintendo DSi.

</body></entry><entry author="Stephen Farber" date="2009-04-20T05:44:23+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/reviewsNews/idUSTRE53J0PU20090420"><headline>"Earth" is flat at Disney</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Lions and tigers and bears, oh my! These creatures and many more are on vivid display in "Earth," the first feature from Disney's new division, Disneynature, which aims to revive the tradition of nature documentaries that Walt Disney pioneered in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initial entry from a team of British filmmakers tries to add an environmental slant to the animal footage that Disney favors, but the effort seems halfhearted compared with more politically charged documentaries like "An Inconvenient Truth." The film makes a few remarks about melting ice caps but spends most of its energy chronicling the exploits of polar bears, caribou, elephants, humpback whales and other exotic species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney probably is hoping for another "March of the Penguins," but this film is too diffuse to match the boxoffice success of that film. It opens in theaters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Earth's" main virtue is its consistently spectacular cinematography. From the opening shots of white snow against a crisp blue sky, the images are rendered with dazzling, crystalline clarity. The camera gets remarkably close to polar bear cubs emerging from the ice and to birds in flight. But the verbal side of the film does not equal the visual eloquence. Although the narration is provided by James Earl Jones, the words he utters in his rich, stentorian tones rarely reach beyond platitudes about the "circle of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that the film tries to cover too much ground. Just as we are getting absorbed in the story of the polar bears' struggle to survive, the film shifts to elephants trekking across the Kalahari and then surveys whales migrating thousands of miles. There are asides to birds of paradise in New Guinea, leopards and gazelles in Africa, even a brief visit to the penguins of Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield skim briskly across the globe, but their approach is too bland. While the film observes wolves stalking caribou and lions pursuing baby elephants, it discreetly cuts away from the actual kill. This obviously was meant to shield tots from any frightening images, but the fastidiousness undercuts the drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although "Earth" falls short of its potential, it still contains enough glorious photography to please its target audience. George Fenton's lush musical score enhances the spectacle, and the sound recording also is first-rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dean Gooodman at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="Bill Rigby" date="2009-04-21T21:01:14+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/ousivMolt/idUSTRE53K54K20090421"><headline>Microsoft earns seen lower, but new Windows may cheer</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Investors are looking to Microsoft Corp's earnings report on Thursday for a sign that the worst may be over for the economy and that the recent surge in technology stocks is not pure froth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is expected to post lower revenue and profit than a year ago, hurt by falling computer sales, but attention will focus on whether it backs chip-maker Intel Corp's comment last week that PC sales may have bottomed out in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would send a powerful signal that the economy at large is on the mend, despite a lack of hard evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a possibility that Microsoft will announce an early release date for its new Windows 7 operating system, offering the chance to put the public relations nightmare of its unpopular Vista system behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 has received good reviews from limited public tests, and an early release could set Microsoft up for a strong holiday shopping season, when sales of PCs typically jump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wouldn't surprise me," said Kim Caughey, an analyst at money manager Fort Pitt Capital Group, on the subject of a Windows announcement. "The beta (testing) has been going very well, and that generally sets the date. They'd like some news, and they've done that in the past during the earnings call."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A relatively positive outlook on PC sales or an early Windows 7 release could jolt Microsoft's stock, which has largely missed out on the tech rally this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite gaining 25 percent from a more than 10-year low of $14.87 in early March, the shares are still hovering below the $19 mark, about half what they were worth 18 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is down 2.6 percent so far this year, compared with a 3.6 percent rise in the Nasdaq and a whopping 24 percent jump in Google Inc's shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NETBOOK WOE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has suffered over the past three months after upsetting investors in January by withdrawing its full-year earnings and revenue forecasts, on top of a big dip in profit. It is not expected to issue any new forecasts on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It failed to win any favor with a plan to cut 5,000 jobs over the next year and a half, saving about $1.5 billion a year, and has also been dogged by uncertainty over its online strategy, recently renewing talks with Yahoo Inc over some type of search advertising deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's fiscal third-quarter results are expected to reflect the harsh reality of cash-strapped companies cutting back on technology spending, and thrifty individuals moving to lower-priced "netbooks" which yield less profit to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global shipments of personal computers fell 7.1 percent in the first quarter, according to industry tracker IDC, although the U.S. market fell only 3.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad news for Microsoft is that the figures would have been much worse had it not been for a surge in sales of netbooks, the mini-laptops good for basic tasks like websurfing and e-mail, made by the likes of Acer Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which sells versions of its old Windows XP for netbooks, gets much less money for each unit sold than for Vista on a laptop or PC. It partly blamed the shift to netbooks for lower profit at its operating system unit last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is hoping to ride the back of the netbook phenomenon with a restricted version of Windows 7, but for now netbooks are hurting its so-called "Client" business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Client is going to be tougher -- that's something they are already expecting," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen, who has a "buy" rating on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVENUE DROP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street expects Microsoft to report revenue of $14.15 billion for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates, down from last year's $14.45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect profit of 39 cents per share, on average, below last year's 47 cents, partly due to lower sales, but also because of the upfront costs of layoffs announced in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft stock is now trading at 9.7 times analysts' average forecast for fiscal 2010 profit and 10.7 times the current year. That is about half its five-year average of a price/earnings ratio of 21.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes it worth buying, according to many analysts and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a good value right now," said Caughey at Fort Pitt, which owns Microsoft stock. "They have issues they have to address, but overall the company has a whole lot of assets to throw at these problems, and a pretty good track record of meeting those challenges."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Apr 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
JiWire announced its rebirth as a mobile audience media company with
launch partner McCann WorldGroup. The agency is running an advertising
campaign for Microsoft's Office 2007 Home and Student editions that
targets affluent consumers on JiWire's Wi-Fi media channel. The new
JiWire gives advertisers targeted and measurable ways to reach people on
wireless devices such as laptops, netbooks and Wi-Fi enabled phones.

    JiWire delivers interactive and measurable advertising campaigns to the 43
million people using public hotspots, combining the best of out-of-home
with Internet advertising. The company's Wi-Fi media channel reaches an
audience that is three times more likely to have a higher income than the
general population and is twice as likely to have a management function,
than major business publications. This makes JiWire's audience desirable
for any advertiser looking to reach more active purchasers (based on
research data from Nielsen Claritas).

    McCann WorldGroup and Microsoft are using JiWire's media channel for a new
advertising campaign to increase purchase intent of Microsoft's Office
2007 Home and Student editions. Instead of demographic-only targeting, the
campaign uses geo-targeting to reach families with more accuracy. McCann,
responsible for strategy and creative, leveraged JiWire's ability to reach
parents of school-age children with relevant messages about the Student
Edition, and high-income families with messages about the Home Edition.

    "JiWire gives us a new set of options to create localized and personalized
creative that lets us connect people with brands in ways that were
unachievable before," said Marc Ruxin, executive vice president and chief
innovation officer at McCann WorldGroup. "With JiWire, we can micro-target
an audience, and knowing exactly who will be viewing our advertisements
makes for less waste and a higher attention level. We find that this form
of media provides us with a very receptive audience."

    The ability to target at a more granular level gives McCann the
opportunity to develop messages that are relevant to the audience and the
environment, creating a more effective campaign. While the advertisements
look similar to regular display ads, they are more effective because of
their relevancy. Some reference local landmarks or give business
travelers who are using Wi-Fi in an airport or hotel a virtual greeting
card with local sites to send home from the city they are visiting. Other
ads cite local reputable schools or point out how many school days remain
in each school district to promote Microsoft Office.

    "At Microsoft, we're always looking to leverage new opportunities to be
more relevant and engaging with our customers," Bill Capodanno, Director
of Customer Experience Architecture at Microsoft. "Digital channels
enable us to measure, optimize and refine our efforts in real-time. The
program that McCann and JiWire shaped via JiWire's Wi-Fi hotspot channel
to better target our audience for our Microsoft Office campaign is a
great example of the innovative opportunities in which we continue to
invest our marketing dollars."

    "We have a deep understanding of who is using wireless networks and
therefore have the ability to be that much more targeted, which is
particularly important in the current economy," explained Kevin McKenzie,
founder and chief executive officer of JiWire. "As people increasingly
access the Internet from places outside of their home and office, JiWire's
goal is to leverage this for advertisers while enabling wireless Internet
service operators to monetize their networks."

    About JiWire

    JiWire is the leading mobile audience media company, delivering
advertising across premier locations and devices. JiWire's breakthrough
advertising medium enables marketers to reach an influential mobile
demographic at the point-of-connection. JiWire's portfolio of blue-chip
advertisers, combined with its market-proven delivery platform and
registry of hotspot locations, enables wireless broadband networks and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported a lower quarterly profit on Tuesday that met Wall Street estimates and sought to quell speculation that it may have to acquire its largest bottler following a similar move by archrival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day after Pepsi bid for Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N and PepsiAmericas Inc PAS.N, Coca-Cola Chief Executive Muhtar Kent affirmed his confidence in the decentralized bottling system, in which Coke and Pepsi sell beverage concentrate to independent bottlers that in turn sell the drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I fundamentally believe the franchise model is the best way to continue to win in the marketplace," Kent said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Coke bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc (CCE.N), which jumped as much as 7.6 percent on Monday as investors pondered a possible takeout, were down 2.9 percent on Tuesday afternoon following Kent's comments. Coke shares were down 2.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pepsi's bottlers, which both soared on Monday, were down roughly 2 percent, but still above Pepsi's offer price, illustrating investors' belief that Pepsi may raise its bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent dismissed the competitive threats of a consolidated PepsiCo and pointed to several Coke initiatives to improve results in North America, where both companies' sales are suffering amid changing consumer tastes and the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiatives include the formation of Coca-Cola Supply, which should shave $150 million per year in supply chain costs by 2011 and a new concentrate pricing system meant to reduce tension between Coke and its bottlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham said Coke was unlikely to "stand still" in a market where Pepsi becomes able to push its drinks harder with more aggressive pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I suspect he (Kent) is playing a wait-and-see game because if Pepsi do manage to come through with some kind of competitive advantage, then Coke's hands may be forced," Gorham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke said North American sales volume fell 2 percent in the first quarter, while Pepsi's domestic drink volume fell 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TROUBLE IN EUROPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke said net income was $1.35 billion, or 58 cents per share, in the first quarter ended on April 3, down from $1.5 billion, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items, Coke earned 65 cents per share, meeting analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating revenue fell 2.8 percent to $7.17 billion, as the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar overshadowed a benefit from extra selling days in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stronger dollar, which decreases the value of overseas sales, hurt operating revenue by 10 percentage points and operating income by 17 percentage points. Coke forecast currency fluctuations to hurt operating income by 14 to 16 percentage points in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke, which gets the bulk of its sales from abroad, said international sales by volume rose 3 percent, which is lower than last year's growth rates which were in the 5 percent to 7 percent range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The surprise in the quarter, if I'd even call it a surprise, is that international (growth) slowed a little bit," said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo.

than last year's growth rates which were in the 5 percent to 7
percent range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The surprise in the quarter, if I'd even call it a
surprise, is that international (growth) slowed a little bit,"
said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. "But I think there had to

China and 6 percent in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volume fell 2 percent in Central and Eastern Europe, driven
by an 18 percent drop in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall worldwide volume rose 2 percent, a feat that Gary
Bradshaw of Hodges Capital Management called "not great but OK"
given the dismal economy in the United States and around the
world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Atlanta-based Coke does not provide specific earnings
forecasts, but said it was looking to meet its long-term target
of 3 percent to 4 percent volume growth and high single-digit
earnings-per-share growth this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola shares were down $1.05 at $43.28 in afternoon

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Apr 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
NSS Labs, a world leader in independent product analysis and
certification, today announced it has awarded IBM ISS GX6116 Proventia(R)
Network Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) appliance the highly coveted
"Gold" Award, the first of its kind of five years.

    NSS Labs put the product through over 1,500 individual evaluations in its
real-world test lab that cover a wide range of scenarios to evaluate its
security effectiveness and performance as well as its management and
usability capabilities. The IBM Proventia GX6116 Solution passed the NSS
Labs Network Intrusion Prevention System certification test and achieved
8Gbps of throughput on the real-world traffic mix. In order to achieve
Gold, a product must consistently block more than 95% of the exploits in
the Security Update Monitor (SUM) program; a recurring monthly test of
security effectiveness. IBM has committed its security products to monthly
testing with NSS Labs and invites other vendors to join in and commit to
raising the level of security excellence.

    "Not only did the GX6116 pass our rigorous certification requirements, but
it also demonstrated an average security effectiveness of 98.6% over a 3
month period," said Rick Moy, President of NSS Labs. "Each monthly test
added fresh exploits to ensure the product was capable of stopping current
attacks, a key requirement of security professionals."

    The strength of the Proventia Network IPS products is the preemptive
protection backed by the world leading X-Force(R) research and development
team. The proactive, behavioral research and multilayered security
technologies developed by the X-Force include the proprietary Protocol
Analysis Module and patented Virtual Patch(TM) preemptive protection. This
unique combination of detection and blocking techniques continue to keep
IBM ISS clients ahead of the evolving security threats.

    "IBM is committed to providing the highest level of security to our
clients and to investing in our X-Force security teams for proactive
threat detection," said Brian Truskowski, general manager of IBM Internet

global websites which are then automatically published to the Windows
Live profile and exposed throughout the services including Messenger and
Hotmail.

    A recent MSN Canada / Harris/Decima survey revealed the average number of
online profiles Canadians have to manage is seven while one in five
Canadians claim to have 10 or more to keep track of. More than half of
Canadians said they find it time consuming to log into all their online
profiles and would love to have all their contact lists in one place.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Apr 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Honourable Peter Van Loan, Minister of Public Safety, made the
following statement in response to the announcement that the Canada
Border Services Agency had seized approximately 200 kilograms of cocaine
with an approximate street value of $25 million in two separate incidents
at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario.

    "I want to thank the diligent work of the Border Services Officers who
prevented two key attempts to smuggle illicit drugs into Canada. The
officers' thorough efforts, coupled with sophisticated detection
technology, helped keep drugs off our streets and our communities safe.
These busts follow another recent seizure last month at the same crossing
where 78 kilograms of cocaine were discovered with an estimated worth of
$9.8 million.

    This Government's message is clear - the trafficking and distribution of
illicit drugs will not be tolerated. As part of our commitment, we have
invested $102 million over five years under the National Anti-Drug
Strategy, to help law enforcement make our communities safer, by keeping
illegal drugs off our streets. Our Government has taken several other
steps to tackle crime, including:

    - $25 million for Integrated Border Enforcement Teams, which disrupt
cross-border smuggling;

    - Arming border officers and hiring 400 new officers to eliminate
dangerous "work-alone" situations;

    - Over 1,000 new RCMP positions; and,

    - Legislation, now before Parliament, that would help ensure those
involved in serious drug crimes face mandatory jail time.

    This Government is committed to managing our border in a way that
strengthens security and facilitates trade, jobs and economic growth."

Eastern developers to provide their applications with all the client's
requirements and a proof of the platform's great potential. 

Mr. Adel added that Microsoft is proud to cooperate with Santeon to accomplish
this Arabization project that will help Middle East developers to serve their
customers better. Santeon is the pioneer solution and application provider for
the Silverlight platform solutions. Many customers choose this platform over
other technologies because of its enormous and rich features, paving the way for
next generation applications that provide companies today with the experience of
the future.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, Apr 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
RSA Annual Conference - Titus Labs, a leading provider of email and
document classification software today at the annual RSA Conference
announced the release of a new metadata security product for Microsoft
Office SharePoint. The company is exhibiting with 5 other partner
companies in the Microsoft Partner Pavilion. Titus Labs will showcase
their solution in booth 1517 along with their other leading information
classification and tagging security solutions.

    Many organizations using SharePoint as a document repository would like
to create a single document library for many different levels of users.
Today this would mean defining per document (item level) security for
many of the documents in the library. Titus Labs Metadata Security(TM)
for SharePoint offers organizations an additional layer of security for
SharePoint document libraries. The solution enables administrators to
protect any document type and restrict access in SharePoint based on user
attributes, metadata properties, or SharePoint content types. This
solution eliminates the need for administrators to define security
settings for every document.

    "For organizations that rely on SharePoint in mission-critical
environments, Titus Labs' Metadata Security offers enhanced document
security for improved records management, "said Teresa Carlson, Vice
President, Microsoft US Federal Sales. "SharePoint is now routinely used
for critical document and records management requirements, and Titus
Labs' Metadata Security provides an additional security option for
SharePoint security access."

    Titus Labs Metadata Security for SharePoint enables administrators to
easily assign security access control based on any metadata property of a
document including document attributes, content types, date, document
author etc. Administrators will find it very simple to configure security
with this solution as there is no need to assign permissions to each
individual document. Rather, administrators can create a document library
to be shared by different groups of users in Active Directory and each
group can have different views and permissions based on the document's
metadata. For example, all users could be given access to documents with
a metadata tag of PUBLIC, whereas only legal staff would be given access
to documents with a metadata tag of LEGAL INFORMATION.

    "Our newest solution simplifies and enhances document security for
SharePoint," said Charlie Pulfer, Vice President Product Management,
Titus Labs. "Administrators no longer need to define access rights for
every document and can easily ensure the right documents become available
to the right people."

    About Titus Labs

    Titus Labs is the leading provider of email, document and SharePoint
classification software solutions to help organizations share information
securely while meeting policy and compliance requirements. Our solutions
enable military, government, and large enterprise organizations to raise
awareness and meet regulatory compliance by visually alerting end users
to the sensitivity of information. Our metadata can trigger third party
technologies including encryption, archival and DLP to ensure the
complete protection of data. The company has over 150 military,
government and enterprise customers worldwide including Dow Corning,
NATO, Australian Department of Defence, Multi National Forces Iraq, and
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Based in Ottawa, Canada, Titus
Labs is privately held.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO--(Business Wire)--
Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. (Toppan Printing; Head office: Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo;
President &amp; CEO: Naoki Adachi) has established a new and improved photomask
manufacturing process in April 2009 at its photomask facility in Asaka, Japan,
to support 32nm and 28nm semiconductor device production. This photomask process
was achieved through Toppan`s ongoing joint development project with IBM. The
Toppan photomasks produced in Asaka are compatible with those produced at IBM`s
photomask facility in Essex Junction, Vt., and have been qualified by IBM. 

Photomasks are an integral component in the patterning and manufacturing of
semiconductor devices. Today,the32nm semiconductor process is in the last phase
of development prior to volume production.Advanced devices, such as those used
for communications and image processing, are expected to have better
performance, lower power consumption and lower cost. To achieve these competing
requirements, the technological advances of 32nm production have been combined
with the productivity enhancements of the 28nm ground rules. 

In order to respond to those requirements, 32nm and 28nm production photomask
process has been completed at Toppan`s Asaka facility. The introduction of this
photomask process from Toppan will help chip manufacturers accelerate the
development production of semiconductors in these next-generation technologies.
As a leading photomask manufacturer, Toppan will continuously supply
high-quality products to customers around the world in a timely manner. 

Toppan-IBM Joint Development Project in Advanced Photomasks

Toppan`s collaboration with IBM began in 2005 at the 45nm node, and has
progressed to the highly specialized masks required to support Source Mask
Optimization (SMO) at the 22nm node. SMO is the co-optimization of the
illumination source and mask pattern. SMO results in a lithographic solution for
building more advanced semiconductor devices than would be possible with
conventional lithographic techniques, and is expected to extend immersion
lithography through the 22nm node and beyond. Toppan Printing plans to launch
volume production of SMO-applied photomasks in 2011, leveraging technical assets
accumulated by the collaboration with IBM. 

Through the joint development with the industry leader IBM, Toppan Printing, a
partner of semiconductor manufacturing customers throughout the world, is
committed to providing leading-edge photomasks that match market needs. 

"This announcement marks a significant milestone in the successful, multi-year
joint development collaboration between Toppan and IBM," said Michael Cadigan,
general manager, IBM Semiconductor Solutions. "Photomasks are critical enabling
technology for semiconductor manufacturing, and together our two companies have
delivered an advanced mask-manufacturing technology that can help speed the
development, volume production and time-to-market of 32nm- and-smaller devices."


"The four years of collaborative work between Toppan and IBM enabled us to
achieve this milestone today," said Toshiro Masuda, deputy head of the
Electronics Division and managing director of Toppan Printing. "Our
collaboration with IBM now continues to the next technological challenge. Toppan
will continue to support our semiconductor-manufacturing customers with advanced
technologies and ready solutions. We will continue to enhance the semiconductor
industry by providing photomasks utilizing this newly developed process."

&lt;p&gt;Solidcore Provides Virtualization Security from Hyper-V Parent Partitions to
Guest Virtual Machines
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Solidcore Systems, Inc., the leader in protecting critical IT infrastructure
from devices to the data center, today announced it has extended the
whitelisting capabilities of its S3 Control software to secure Microsoft Hyper-V
virtual environments. Solidcore S3 Control uses combined application
whitelisting, configuration whitelisting and unique memory protection techniques
to secure Microsoft Hyper-V parent partitions and guest virtual machines (VMs). 

Microsoft Hyper-V is a hypervisor-based server virtualization technology that is
part of Windows Server 2008. Hyper-V consists of virtual machines and a parent
partition that is used to manage the VMs. Securing the Hyper-V parent partition
is extremely important because of its elevated privileges for controlling
virtual machine functions, such as rebooting VMs and creating new VMs. If the
security of the parent partition is compromised, an attacker could gain access
to the entire virtual infrastructure. Solidcore protects the Hyper-V parent
partition from malicious code and unauthorized programs, and prevents the
loading of new drivers or kernel components that can directly impact the Hyper-V
parent partition communication with the virtual machines. Solidcore assesses the
configuration of the VMs within the virtual environment, and provides the
capability to lock down good VM configurations. Solidcore`s memory protection
also prevents remote exploits from compromising the Hyper-V infrastructure using
a network connection. 

"Securing the parent partition or any other virtual service console is
absolutely essential, as any failure or compromise of the parent partition puts
all of the child VMs at risk," said Neil MacDonald, research vice president for
Gartner. "Because of the `thin` nature of virtual machines, it is impossible to
run heavy agents and scan-based security technology. Instead, whitelisting
provides the most viable solution to virtual infrastructure security." 

"As virtualization moves further into production environments, we expect to see
more targeted attacks on the hypervisor," said Rosen Sharma, chief technology
officer for Solidcore. "Solidcore is leading the charge in virtualization
security with proven whitelisting technology that can protect the integrity of
critical systems without the performance overhead."

&lt;p&gt;Thales HSMs Provide Cryptographic Key Management for Database Encryption
SAN FRANCISCO, &amp; CAMBRIDGE, England--(Business Wire)--
Thales, leader in information systems and communications security, announces its
nCipher product line hardware security modules (HSMs) now provide comprehensive
key management and hardware-based cryptography for Microsoft SQL Server 2008.
Microsoft customers selecting Thales HSMs now benefit from additional security
features including encryption key management and storage of master encryption
keys in FIPS-validated hardware - a long-standing industry best practice -
enabling organizations to meet compliance mandates such as PCI DSS and data
breach notification acts. 

"Companies and government agencies are under significant pressure to provide the
highest level of security to protect information," said Mark Jewett, director of
SQL Server marketing at Microsoft Corp. "Some Microsoft customers operate in
highly regulated industries and would benefit from adopting Thales HSMs to meet
their specific industry security requirements. The integration of Microsoft SQL
Server 2008 with Thales HSMs offers customers a security-enhanced framework for
their database security needs." 

With the introduction of transparent data encryption (TDE) in SQL Server 2008,
users now have the choice between cell-level encryption or full database-level
encryption by using TDE. With the Database Security Option Pack, Thales HSMs
provide accelerated cryptographic performance and protect and manage the keys
used for TDE and cell-level encryption in FIPS-validated hardware - allowing
organizations to take advantage of cost-effective key management across multiple
servers. In addition the encryption keys are stored separate from the data
itself as required by compliance mandates or corporate data security standards. 

"The integration of Thales HSMs with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 satisfies many
strategic objectives that organizations may have surrounding data security",
says Franck Greverie, VP, MD for the information systems security activities of
Thales. "The opportunity to apply Thales`s market-leading key management
technologies alongside Microsoft`s database encryption solution enables
customers to safeguard their sensitive data without any application changes.
Customers can now increase the overall security of their deployment helping meet
today`s ever-evolving data threats and compliance mandates." 

The Database Security Option Pack is available for both Thales nShield and
Thales netHSM. 

Thales will exhibit its industry-leading database security technologies during
the RSA Conference (booth #2023), April 20-24, 2009 at the Moscone Center in San
Francisco.

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today reported solid first quarter 2009 results despite a
challenging economic environment, with unit case volume increasing 2 percent,
successfully cycling 6 percent growth in the prior year quarter. Acquisitions
contributed 1 percentage point of unit case volume growth for the quarter. 

Internationally, the Company achieved broad-based unit case volume growth of 3
percent. Unit case volume increased in key emerging markets, with 31 percent
growth in India, 10 percent growth in China, high single-digit growth in
Southern Eurasia, Thailand and Vietnam and mid single-digit growth in Korea and
Nigeria. 

During the quarter, Latin America continued with strong unit case volume growth
of 5 percent, led by a 6 percent increase in Mexico and a 4 percent increase in
Brazil, as well as continued volume and value share gains in both sparkling and
still beverages. 

Europe outperformed the industry and gained volume and value share. Unit case
volume growth of 3 percent in Northwest Europe was offset by significant
macroeconomic challenges in Central and Eastern Europe resulting in unit case
volume for the group declining 2 percent in the quarter, cycling 4 percent
growth in the prior year quarter. 

North America again outperformed the industry, gaining nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink share for the fifth consecutive quarter. North America realized
sequential improvement with unit case volume declining 2 percent in the quarter.


In Japan, unit case volume was even, outperforming the nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink industry and resulting in the fourth consecutive quarter of share
gains. 

Sparkling beverage unit case volume was even in the quarter. International
sparkling beverage unit case volume increased 1 percent in the quarter, cycling
5 percent growth. 

Still beverage unit case volume increased 9 percent in the quarter, led by
strong growth across the portfolio, including juices and juice drinks, sports
drinks, teas, and water brands. International still beverage unit case volume
increased 13 percent in the quarter. 

Globally, the Company gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink beverages for the seventh consecutive quarter. 

Financial Highlights

The Company reported first quarter 2009 earnings per share of $0.58. After
considering items impacting comparability, earnings per share for the quarter
were $0.65, a decrease of 3 percent versus the 2008 first quarter. Reported
earnings per share for the first quarter of 2009 included a net charge of $0.07
per share primarily related to restructuring charges and asset write-downs.
Reported earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008 were $0.64, including
a net charge of $0.03 per share primarily related to restructuring charges and
asset write-downs. Results in the first quarter of 2009 were also positively
impacted by 5 additional selling days, which will offset in the fourth quarter. 

Operating income for the first quarter of 2009 decreased 1 percent on a reported
basis versus the first quarter of 2008. Items impacting comparability reduced
first quarter operating income by $92 million in 2009 and by $85 million in
2008. After considering these items, operating income was even. Excluding the
impact of currency, operating income increased 17 percent, exceeding the
Company`s currency neutral long-term profit target. 

In February, the Company approved its 47th consecutive annual dividend increase,
raising the 2009 quarterly dividend 8 percent. 

The Company is currently on track to deliver $500 million in annualized savings
from productivity initiatives by year-end 2011. The continued acceleration of
these efforts will enable cash flows to be redeployed to drive investments for
growth. 

"While the global economic environment remains challenging, we are well
positioned for long-term growth. Our business was built for times like these,"
said Muhtar Kent, president and chief executive officer, The Coca-Cola Company.
"We again exceeded our long-term profit target and delivered solid volume
results. Importantly, in many worldwide markets, we outperformed the
nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry, driving further volume and value share
gains. I am confident that, armed with strong brands and solid business
fundamentals, our experienced management team will continue delivering against
our long-term targets." 

"Consumers around the world love and trust our brands and turn to us to provide
simple moments of refreshment nearly 1.6 billion times every day. And every
week, our system reaches 20 million customers around the world with innovative,
category-leading brands and services that deliver at the point-of-sale. There
really is no better consumer business to be in today&#8230;or tomorrow." 

"Further, our business has historically generated significant cash flow in all
economic conditions, enabling us to invest in key brands and geographies, and
consistently return value to our shareowners. This is clearly reflected by our
47th consecutive annual dividend increase and the continued investment behind
our growing stable of billion dollar brands." 

"Our strong foundation, consistent set of strategic priorities, and alignment
with our invaluable bottling partners were drivers of our continued success this
quarter. Our system is truly like no other, and is now more aligned and more
capable of creating value for our consumers, our customers, and our shareowners.
All of this provides us confidence that The Coca-Cola Company will continue to
deliver consistent, long-term sustainable growth and with great resolve will
come out of this tumultuous period much better than when we entered."

Eurasia and Africa

* The Eurasia and Africa Group`s unit case volume increased 3 percent in the
quarter, successfully cycling 5 percent growth in the prior year quarter. Net
revenues for the quarter decreased 10 percent, reflecting a double-digit
negative impact from currencies partially offset by an 8 percent increase in
concentrate sales including the impact from the additional shipping days in the
quarter as well as positive pricing and mix. Operating income for the quarter
decreased 9 percent, reflecting the decrease in net revenues primarily related
to currency, and the continued investment in key marketing and business
initiatives. 
* Eurasia and Africa delivered solid unit case volume growth, with sparkling
beverages increasing 2 percent and still beverages increasing 4 percent for the
quarter. Unit case volume increased across most markets in the quarter, led by
India increasing 31 percent, cycling double-digit growth from the prior year.
India gained volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages.
Southern Eurasia increased unit case volume 7 percent, cycling 8 percent growth
from the prior year. In Africa, unit case volume increased 6 percent in Nigeria
and increased 2 percent in South Africa. Russia`s unit case volume declined 18
percent in the quarter, reflecting the impact of a continued challenging
macroeconomic environment, while maintaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink volume
and value share.

Europe

* Europe Group unit case volume decreased 2 percent in the quarter, cycling 4
percent growth in the prior year quarter, reflecting the more challenging
macroeconomic environment. Net revenues for the quarter decreased 13 percent,
primarily driven by a double-digit negative impact from currency, partially
offset by a 1 percent increase in concentrate sales which included the impact of
the additional shipping days in the quarter and the shift of the Easter holiday
into the second quarter, and also partially offset by positive pricing and mix.
Operating income decreased 6 percent reflecting the impact of the lower net
revenues, primarily related to currency, partially offset by tight expense
controls. 
* In a declining market, Europe outperformed the industry in sparkling and still
beverages and gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink
beverages in most countries including Germany, Great Britain, Italy and France. 
* Sparkling beverages gained share despite declining 3 percent, which reflects
the challenging environment. Trademark Coca-Cola declined 2 percent, but
outperformed the category. Still beverages increased 4 percent for the quarter
and gained volume and value share. Strong performance in Great Britain was
offset by weakness in Germany and Spain as well as a mid single-digit decline in
Eastern Europe as these countries were more severely impacted by the
macroeconomic conditions.

Latin America

* The Latin America Group once again delivered strong unit case volume growth of
5 percent in the quarter, successfully cycling 9 percent growth in the prior
year quarter. Net revenues for the quarter decreased 5 percent, primarily due to
a double-digit negative impact from currencies, partially offset by a 10 percent
increase in concentrate sales including the impact from the additional shipping
days in the quarter, and positive pricing and mix. Operating income for the
quarter decreased 10 percent reflecting the net revenue decrease, primarily
related to currency, and continuing investment in key marketing initiatives. 
* Latin America delivered growth across the portfolio with sparkling beverages
increasing 1 percent and still beverages increasing 33 percent for the quarter.
Unit case volume increased across key markets in the quarter, with Mexico and
Brazil increasing 6 percent and 4 percent respectively, cycling double-digit
growth from the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point of the
overall unit case volume growth in the quarter. 
* Latin America continued gaining volume and value share in sparkling and still
beverages.

North America

* North America Group unit case volume declined 2 percent in the quarter,
primarily reflecting the continuing difficult macroeconomic environment. Retail
unit case volume declined 4 percent, while Foodservice and Hospitality increased
3 percent. North America gained volume share for the fifth consecutive quarter
and value share for the second consecutive quarter, despite the challenging
environment. Net revenues for the quarter increased 8 percent, reflecting a 2
percent increase in concentrate sales, including the impact from the additional
shipping days in the quarter, as well as positive pricing and mix, partially
offset by a low single-digit negative currency impact. Operating income
increased 32 percent for the quarter reflecting the increase in net revenues,
continued investment in strategic marketing programs and a benefit from
productivity initiatives and incentive costs. 
* Though solid strategic marketing programs positively impacted sparkling
beverages and improved brand health, unit case volume for sparkling beverages
declined 4 percent in the quarter reflecting industry-leading bottler pricing.
Importantly, Coca-Cola Zero delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of
double-digit growth, increasing unit case volume 25 percent in the quarter. 
* Still beverage unit case volume increased 3 percent in the quarter and
achieved volume share gains for the seventh consecutive quarter, due to the
significant growth in Powerade, increasing unit case volume 17 percent, and
continued strong share performance of Fuze, glac&#233;au, Trademark Simply and Minute
Maid Enhanced Juices. Additionally, the performance of these premium brands
delivered value share gains in the quarter.

Pacific

* The Pacific Group increased unit case volume 4 percent in the quarter,
successfully cycling 10 percent growth in the prior year quarter. Net revenues
for the quarter increased 14 percent, reflecting a 10 percent increase in
concentrate sales, including the impact from the additional shipping days, a mid
single-digit currency benefit and positive pricing and mix, partially offset by
the impact of structural changes. Operating income for the quarter increased 18
percent reflecting the net revenue increase and continued investments in key
business initiatives. 
* Pacific delivered unit case volume growth across the portfolio with sparkling
beverages increasing 3 percent and still beverages increasing 6 percent for the
quarter led by solid performance in key markets. 
* Unit case volume in China increased 10 percent in the quarter, cycling 20
percent growth from the prior year, led by double-digit unit case volume growth
in Minute Maid and Trademark Fanta, high single-digit growth in Trademark Sprite
as well as growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, each of which contributed to volume
and value share gains in sparkling and still beverages for the quarter. 
* Unit case volume in Japan was even in the quarter. Sparkling beverage unit
case volume growth of 12 percent in the quarter was led by Trademark Coca-Cola
and Trademark Fanta, which grew unit case volume 14 percent and 16 percent,
respectively. Unit case volume declines in Sokenbicha and Aquarius offset strong
growth in sparkling beverages. Japan gained share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink
beverages for the quarter.

Bottling Investments

* The Bottling Investments Group`s unit case volume decreased 4 percent in the
quarter, reflecting bottling divestitures partially offset by organic growth
across most operations. Net revenues decreased 13 percent during the quarter
reflecting a double-digit negative currency impact and the impact of structural
changes. The operating income decline reflected the net revenue decrease.

Financial Review

Operating Results

Net operating revenues for the first quarter decreased 3 percent, with a 7
percent increase in concentrate sales and a 2 percent favorable impact from
pricing and mix, offset by a 2 percent decrease from structural changes
primarily related to bottling divestitures and a 10 percent negative currency
impact. 

Cost of goods sold decreased 1 percent for the quarter. This reflects a 7
percent increase in concentrate sales as well as increases in commodity-based
input costs offset by a 6 percent decrease from currency and a 4 percent
decrease from structural changes primarily related to bottling divestitures. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 6 percent for the quarter
reflecting a 9 percent decrease from currency. The Company continued to realize
expense leverage by investing in marketing strategies to drive brand growth and
by more effectively managing general and administrative expenses. 

The Company had other operating charges in the first quarter totaling $92
million related to restructuring costs, productivity initiatives and asset
impairments. First quarter operating income decreased 1 percent versus 2008.
After considering items impacting comparability, operating income was even for
the quarter. Currency negatively impacted comparable operating income by 17
percent in the quarter. Based on the anticipated benefits of hedging coverage in
place, the Company currently expects currencies to have an estimated 14 to 16
percent negative impact on operating income in the second quarter of 2009. 

Effective Tax Rate

The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1 percent. The underlying
effective tax rate on operations for the quarter was 23.5 percent. The variance
between the reported rate and the underlying rate was due to the tax impact of
various separately disclosed items impacting comparability. 

The Company estimates that its underlying effective tax rate on operations for
the full year 2009 will be approximately 23.5 percent. The Company`s estimated
underlying effective tax rate reflects, among other items, our best estimates of
2009 operating results and foreign currency exchange rates. If actual results
are different than these estimates, the underlying effective tax rate could
change. This rate does not reflect the impact of discrete events, which, if and
when they occur, are separately recognized in the appropriate period. 

Items Impacting Prior Year Results

First quarter 2008 results included a net charge of $0.03 per share primarily
related to restructuring charges and asset write-downs. 

Conference Call

The Company will host a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss
the first quarter 2009 results today at 9:30 a.m. (EDT). The Company invites
investors to listen to the live audiocast of the conference call at the
Company`s website, www.thecoca-colacompany.com in the "Investors" section. A
replay in downloadable MP3 format will also be available within 24 hours after
the audiocast on the Company`s website. Further, the "Investors" section of the
Company`s website includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that
may be used periodically by management when discussing the Company`s financial
results with investors and analysts to our results as reported under GAAP.

 for Corporate, primarily as a result of restructuring costs, productivity initiatives and an asset impairment.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (3) Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended April 3, 2009, was reduced by approximately $51 million for Bottling Investments and $1 million for Corporate, primarily attributable to our proportionate                            
 share of asset impairment charges and restructuring costs recorded by equity method investees.

 million for Pacific and $22 million for Bottling Investments.                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (6) Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended March 28, 2008, were reduced by approximately $2 million for North America, $4 million for Bottling Investments and $79 million                           
 for Corporate, primarily attributable to restructuring costs, asset impairments and productivity initiatives.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (7) Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended March 28, 2008, benefited by approximately $5 million for Bottling Investments, primarily due to our proportionate share of a tax benefit recorded by an                              
 equity method investee, partially offset by our proportionate share of restructuring costs and asset impairment charges recorded by equity method investees.

non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of
these financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current
results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these
non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of
underlying trends of the business because they provide a comparison of
historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall
comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making
financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's
performance. See the Tables above for supplemental financial data and
corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months
ended April 3, 2009 and March 28, 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures should be
viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company`s reported
results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U. S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain
non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of
these financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current
results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these
non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of
underlying trends of the business because they provide a comparison of
historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall
comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making
financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's
performance. See the Tables above for supplemental financial data and
corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months
ended April 3, 2009 and March 28, 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures should be
viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company`s reported
results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights H.J.Heinz Co. (NYSE: HNZ) as the Bull of the
Day and Palm, Inc. (Nasdaq: PALM) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), Bank of America (NYSE:
BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Growth in Heinz's (NYSE: HNZ) domestic businesses, strengthening international
operations, and the reallocation of resources in favor of key brands are major
positive trends for the H. J. Heinz Company. 

Despite cost pressure from higher commodity costs, strong pricing of 3.5% to
4.5% has allowed the company to report positive earnings surprises in the last
eleven quarters. Management expects net sales to increase by 6% in fiscal 2009
driven by new product introductions and positive pricing. 

In addition, the stock's valuation is attractive. A Buy rating was initiated in
January. 

Bear of the Day: 

Palm, Inc. (Nasdaq: PALM) 3Q09 revenue declined by 71.0% y-o-y due to pricing
concessions and lower volume for its maturing legacy smartphone, weak consumer
spending, and delay in shipments of the Treo Pro in the U.S. 

Though Palm expects to launch its Palm Pre next gen phone by June 2009, we have
doubts on its success of given the current economic uncertainty that has
dampened demand for consumer products. We continue to believe that Palm badly
trails RIM and the iPhone in the smartphone market and will not be able to
effectively compete as an independent company. 

We have a low confidence in its ability to survive with a weak market share, so
we reiterate our Sell rating on Palm shares with our six-month price target of
$5.00. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Banks Don`t Need Gov`t Help&#8230;Really?

Some of the banks flexing their new profit muscles are showing extreme eagerness
to repay TARP money "as soon as possible." The managements' comments range from
"it is our duty to repay TARP," to TARP being "scarlet letter" or even
"destructive." Many clarify that they did not ask for government money, but were
forced by the government to take it. 

At the same time, there are reports that the government is planning to convert
the TARP preferred shares to common equity to shore up the banks' capital levels
without having to ask the Congress for more bailout money. 

The fact is that these same banks are enjoying tremendous benefits from some
other lesser-known programs that come without any attached strings. 

In October 2008, the FDIC had created a new program, TLGF (Temporary Liquidity
Guarantee Program) through which it provides insurance on debt issued by the
Banks, for a small fee. Banks have benefited a lot as they are able to borrow
cheaply and further the program was launched when the credit markets were
virtually frozen. 

During the last six months, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) has issued $28 billion in
debt under this program while Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase
(NYSE: JPM) have issued $40 billion each.

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Oracle Getting Burned by Sun Deal?

Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ: ORCL) has agreed to buy Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:
JAVA) for $7.4 billion ($9.50 a share) after IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) backed out of
its deal. Oracle is a software company (successful software companies become
"banks" because they generate so much cash) and so the antitrust problem that
existed for IBM is not a factor in the Oracle transaction. 

This is a departure for Oracle and, in my opinion, is an expensive foray into
uncharted territory. There is no reason to think that a software company can run
a hardware and service business. So Sun is likely to retain the unsuccessful
management that has failed to turn Sun back into a profitable company. 

The purchase price is too much; Sun having been shopped to all and sundry. This
is a major coup for the investment bankers who have maximized a fee from a deal
that few, if any, companies would buy at that price. 

BAC Beats Median Consensus

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) this morning reported its 1Q09 net
income at $4.2 billion and diluted earnings (after preferred dividends) of $0.44
per share, ahead of the median expectations of $0.04 per share. 

We may add that the range of analysts' expectations has been very wide for the
banks this quarter, due to uncertainties related to mark-to-market accounting
benefits, AIG (NYSE: AIG) payout benefits and numerous special items. In the
case of BAC, the estimates ranged from a loss of $0.22 per share to a gain of
$0.20 per share. 

Results for the quarter included Merrill Lynch (which Bank of America had
acquired in January) and Countrywide Financial (acquired in July of last year).
The results also included a $1.9 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of China
Construction Bank shares.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
BB Corp. (NYSE: BBT), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM), Werner
Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: WERN) and Amphenol Corp. (NYSE: APH). 

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

BB Better Than Expected

BB Corp. (NYSE: BBT) reported its 1Q09 financial results before market open,
with a conference call held later this morning. Operating earnings for the
quarter came in at $187 million or $0.33 per diluted share, two pennies ahead of
consensus. Though the company had a decent growth in loans and deposits and
increased production in mortgage banking operations, credit quality worsened
sharply, mainly due to deterioration in its housing loan portfolio in Florida,
Atlanta and Metro D.C. areas. 

BBT joined the group of banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and JP Morgan
(NYSE: JPM) waiting to be de-TARP-ed, as soon as possible. During the conference
call, the CEO said that the bank would pay back TARP funds as soon they get
government approval to do so, (presumably after the stress tests are completed),
as he considers it to be "destructive." 

Werner Reports Declines

After market close yesterday, Werner Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: WERN) posted
2009 first quarter diluted EPS of $0.10, down 18% year over year from the $0.12
reported in the prior-year quarter. While this beat consensus of $0.09 by a
penny, it was below our $0.12 estimate, largely due to lower gains on asset
sales hurt by lower volume and pricing, and worse-than-expected revenues. 

Revenues declined 23% year over year to $394.5 million on a 10.7% decrease in
total miles. Excluding fuel surcharges, revenues dropped 12% to $308.0 million.
This compare to revenue estimates for consensus of $445.5 million and our
estimate of $467 million. This performance largely reflected continued erosion
in freight shipments, particularly in the company`s largest market, the retail
sector, due to the slumping economy. 

Amphenol Rating Under Review

Shares of Amphenol Corp. (NYSE: APH, Buy) are seesawing in volatile trading
since yesterday following the company's release of fiscal Q1:2009 earnings
results. Although the company came comfortably ahead of our and consensus Q1
revenues estimates and beat our EPS estimate by a penny, forward guidance came
in weaker than expectations. The company also stated that it will not provide
guidance beyond Q2 owing to "significant uncertainty regarding future demand
levels" but expects to perform well given its leadership position in the
industry. 

Q1:FY2009 sales of $660.0 million were down 14% from a year ago and down 12.6%
sequentially. The revenue reported was in line with management's guidance of
revenues, between $650 million and $665 million. Currency translation effect
decreased sales by approximately 3% or by $23.1 million in the first quarter of
2009.

approach to cost and expense management giving us a strong financial position,"
said Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. 

"We are well-positioned to continue to move aggressively and leverage our strong
cash performance to make the most of the opportunities that arise, including

The company`s total gross profit margin was 43.4 percent in the 2009 first
quarter compared with 41.5 percent in the 2008 first-quarter period, led by
improving margins in services and software. 

Total expense and other income decreased 9 percent to $6.3 billion compared with
the prior-year period. SG expense decreased 6 percent to $5.3 billion
including workforce rebalancing charges of approximately $265 million. RD
expense of $1.5 billion decreased 6 percent compared with the year-ago period.
Intellectual property and custom development income decreased to $268 million

percent in the first quarter of 2008, a decline of 1.0 point. 

The weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding in the
first-quarter 2009 was 1.35 billion compared with 1.41 billion shares in the
same period of 2008. As of March 31, 2009, there were 1.32 billion basic common
shares outstanding. 

Debt, including Global Financing, totaled $31.0 billion, compared with $33.9
billion at year-end 2008. From a management segment view, Global Financing debt
decreased $1.0 billion from year-end 2008 to a total of $23.4 billion at March
31, 2009, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 7.0 to 1. Non-global financing
debt totaled $7.6 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion since year-end 2008,
resulting in a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 42.4 percent from 48.7 percent,
which reflects the adoption of SFAS No. 160 referenced in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position. 

IBM ended the first quarter of 2009 with $12.3 billion of cash on hand and
generated free cash flow of $1.0 billion, up $450 million year over year,
excluding Global Financing receivables. The company returned nearly $2.5 billion
to shareholders through $675 million in dividends and $1.8 billion of share
repurchases. The balance sheet remains strong, and the company is well
positioned to take advantage of opportunities.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Production Co (XOM.N) said Wednesday it has moved a drilling rig into place at the Point Thomson Project, responding to pressure from the state of Alaska to develop decades-old leases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are moving forward with drilling and development activities at Point Thomson for the mutual benefit of Alaskans and the Point Thomson Unit working interest owners," said Craig Haymes, Exxon Mobil's Alaska production manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haymes said plans call for production at Point Thomson to begin by the end of 2014. He said Exxon Mobil is working with the state to resolve remaining issues surrounding development of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field lies on the eastern North Slope, west of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has maintained that Exxon and its partners breached leases, some of which date back to the 1960s before the huge Prudhoe Bay North Slope oil discovery, by not developing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and its partners, including ConocoPhillips (COP.N), BP Plc (BP.L) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), say they have worked diligently to develop Point Thomson and deserve to keep the leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies see the field as mainly a natural gas producer critical to developing an Alaska gas pipeline, but the state has pushed for gas liquids production to begin sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point Thomson oil and gas was discovered in 1977 and the area organized into a unit for development, but the last well was drilled in 1982.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bruce Nichols; Editing by Christian Wiessner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At RSA Conference 2009, DeWalt Shares McAfee Vision of Intelligent,
Interconnected Security From Silicon to Satellite, Backed By McAfee Global
Threat Intelligence
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
McAfee, Inc. (NYSE:MFE) President and Chief Executive Officer Dave DeWalt in a
keynote address today unveiled McAfee`s vision for the future of digital
security. 

"The traditional approach to enterprise security simply doesn`t work - it leaves
security holes, its unmanageable and is too costly," said DeWalt. "Many
companies still wrestle with a patchwork of incompatible products from multiple
vendors, which leaves them exposed. To provide the best security in today`s
world of increased cybercrime, a myriad of compliance requirements and
staggeringly complex networks, we need to move to an approach where all security
products exchange intelligence and provide real time, all the time visibility." 

McAfee is innovating to provide predictive security. This approach comprises
interconnected security technology at multiple layers in the technology stack,
backed by global threat intelligence. Predictive security will allow security
products to intelligently block attacks much sooner than is currently possible
with traditional approaches. A real-time, in-the-cloud foundation will allow
multiple security products to communicate with each other, leading to new levels
of security. 

DeWalt drew a parallel with advances in meteorology as an example of where
digital security should move. Weather sensors everywhere, from oceans to
satellites, gather information that is brought together, analyzed and
distributed as a weather forecast, allowing people to know days or weeks ahead
to get ready to "hunker down for a storm," or "pack for the beach." 

Predictive Security Starts with Global Threat Intelligence

Security technology in the future should be embedded everywhere, from silicon to
satellite. All these security "sensors" would report threat data to a Global
Threat Intelligence system for analysis. Going beyond meteorology, the Global
Threat Intelligence system would then send back data to the sensors to provide
smarter security. Reputation management is a key part of global threat
intelligence, assigning reputation scores to Internet hosts, senders, domains,
URLs and messages based on behavior, much like a credit bureau assigns credit
ratings to consumers. 

As an example, DeWalt discussed how intelligence learned from a simple spam
e-mail can allow a threat intelligence system to update security protection
across an enterprise. For example, the firewall could block attacks emanating
from the IP address used to send the e-mail, a Web gateway can blacklist the Web
site advertised in the spam message and antimalware protection can be alert on
any potentially included pests. 

McAfee`s vision for predictive security is already becoming a reality. McAfee`s
Global Threat Intelligence today supports best in class protection across most
of the McAfee product portfolio. In the future, McAfee plans to invest in its
threat intelligence to boost the level of protection and fundamentally move from
proactive to predictive security.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Production Co (XOM.N) said Wednesday it has moved a drilling rig into place at the Point Thomson Project, responding to pressure from the state of Alaska to develop decades-old leases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company announced today that it has mobilized the drilling
rig for the Point Thomson Project. 

The rig, owned by Nabors Alaska, has been upgraded to drill the high pressure
wells at Point Thomson. It was moved from Deadhorse to the drilling site in
modules, some weighing more than one million pounds. 

As there are no permanent roads to Point Thomson, Fairweather E Services Inc.
and Nanuq/AFC constructed over 30 miles of ice road to enable the transport of
heavy equipment and materials while protecting the North Slope environment. Most
of the ice road follows the shore line along the Beaufort Sea. 

The Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR) authorized the ice-road permits
on January 27, allowing mobilization of the drilling rig and provided guidance
to other regulatory agencies to expedite permitting to allow drilling to begin. 

Craig Haymes, Alaska production manager for ExxonMobil, said, "We are moving
forward with drilling and development activities at Point Thomson, for the
mutual benefit of Alaskans and the Point Thomson Unit working interest owners.
DNR staff and other local, State and Federal agencies have worked tirelessly to
process permits necessary to allow drilling to begin. We are on schedule to
begin production at Point Thomson by year-end 2014 and look forward to working
with the State to resolve the remaining Point Thomson issues to ensure the
project schedule is not impacted. Construction crews recently completed the
final installation of camps and support facilities at the existing gravel pad to
accept the rig. Over 250 people will work on these drilling operations, with an
average of over 500 people at year-end 2014, when we expect to begin
production." 

The initial phase of the project will process approximately 200 million cubic
feet per day of Point Thomson gas in order to produce approximately 10,000
barrels per day of liquid condensate into the Trans Alaska Pipeline System by
year end 2014. The remaining gas will then be recycled into the Point Thomson
reservoir. The Point Thomson Unit working interest owners committed $120 million
to the drilling and development activities in 2008, with additional investments
of about $250 million expected in 2009. 

In addition to ExxonMobil, the other major Point Thomson owners participating in
the current drilling and development activity include BP Exploration (Alaska)
Inc. and ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans in this
release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including
resource recoveries, production rates, and project plans, schedules, and costs
could differ materially due to changes in market conditions affecting the oil
and gas industry or long-term oil and gas price levels; political or regulatory
developments; reservoir performance; timely completion of development projects;
technical or operating factors; and other factors discussed under the heading
"Factors Affecting Future Results" in the Investor Information section of our

References to hydrocarbon resources, gas, barrels of liquid condensate, and
similar terms include quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as
proved reserves but that we believe will be produced in the future.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, April 22 (Reuters) - A supertanker cargo of Alaska
North Slope crude ASW- is headed for the Louisiana Offshore
Oil Port, an unusual destination for crude from Alaska, a
spokesman for Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) shipping affiliate
confirmed Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Alaska crude is similar in gravity and sulfur content
to some Gulf Coast grades of oil, but there could be nonmarket
reasons for the voyage, including retiring the vessel from the
Alaska trade. It is the last single-hull ship on that service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said the cargo is being sold for $1.25 a barrel
over West Texas Intermediate CLc1, well above the discount of
$3 to $5 for which recent ANS cargoes have sold on the West
Coast. According to a maritime database, it is due to arrive
later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A LOOP spokeswoman declined comment. The spokesman for
SeaRiver Maritime Inc, a wholly owned affiliate of Exxon Mobil,
declined to comment on the price reported by traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alaska crude once flowed regularly to the United States,
traveling by tanker to Panama, crossing the Isthmus of Panama
by pipeline and then being tankered to U.S. refineries.
Supertankers are too big to transit the canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Alaska oil has flowed almost exclusively to the U.S.
West Coast in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The very large crude carrier SeaRiver Long Beach is a
sister ship to the Exxon Valdez, which in 1989 ran aground and
leaked millions of gallons oil in Alaska's Prince William Sound
in one of the world's largest oil spills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An official of the Washington State Department of Ecology
said the 985-foot-long (300-meter-long) SeaRiver Long Beach was
to stop hauling crude from Alaska to the U.S. West Coast by
January 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although it exceeds current regulatory standards for that
voyage, the SeaRiver Long Beach is the last single-hull tanker
on that service. Double-hull tankers have been adopted to
minimize the risk of spills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokesman Ray Botto of SeaRiver Maritime declined to say
what the ship's future holds after its latest voyage from
Valdez to the LOOP around Cape Horn.

&lt;p&gt; * No price revealed, Gazprom Neft unit pays own cash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * May consider other deals in Europe, Asia
 (Adds comment from interview, changes dateline to ROME)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Svetlana Kovalyova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROME, April 22 (Reuters) - Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM), the oil
arm of state-controlled gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM), extended
Russia's push into European refining and marketing on Wednesday
by buying some Italian assets from U.S. oil major Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom Neft's lubricants unit will buy a plant in Bari, in
southern Italy, which makes 36,000 tonnes of lubricants a year
for cars, trucks and other industrial uses, and marketing and
sales operations in Rome, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, and
Gazprom Neft, Russia's fifth-largest oil producer, did not
reveal the price of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexander Trukhan, general director of
Gazpromneft-Lubricants, told Reuters his company paid cash from
2008's profits and did not have to borrow other funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russian oil producers have been expanding their presence in
Western Europe in recent years, in a Kremlin-backed move to
extract more value from Russian crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Russian oil producer Surgutneftegaz (SNGS.MM)
agreed to buy 21 percent of Hungarian oil refiner MOL
MOLB.BU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rival LUKOIL (LKOH.MM) bought a 49 percent stake in ERG's
(ERG.MI) Isab di Priolo refinery on Sicily last year and held
talks to buy a large stake in Spanish oil company Repsol
(REP.MC), which has a large refining portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said last month it would push ahead with
streamlining its lubricants product line and would exit retail
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOCUS ON INTEGRATION, EYES ON NEW DEALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazpromneft-Lubricants may consider acquisitions in Europe
and Asia, but for now it will focus on integrating Chevron's
Italian business and refinery operations it bought in Serbia
earlier this year, Trukhan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In Italy we bought all that we wanted ... Now we need to
focus on integration and development of our assets in Italy and
Serbia," Trukhan told Reuters in an interview in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If there are new opportunities, we will look at them,
depending on market conditions ... European and Asian markets
are interesting," Trukhan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said expected production and marketing synergies between
the Chevron assets and the Serbian oil refiner NIS would come
from creating a full range of products -- from semi-finished to
high-quality finished lubricants -- which will be sold in
Italy, Russia and Serbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazpromneft-Lubricants will also get the right to use the
Texaco brand in the Italian market until 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trukhan said the company may boost capacity of Bari's
plant, which currently uses just one third of its potential, if
demand for its products increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to reveal investments, which his company
planned for the newly acquired Italian business, but said he
aimed to present a new strategy for the Italian operations in
about three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russian oil companies' push into downstream activities in
Europe reflects Gazprom's own effort to acquire gas
distribution and power-generation assets across the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move has boosted fears among European politicians that
Moscow will gain excessive influence over Europe's energy
supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Tom Bergin in London, editing by

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Today, The George Washington University (GW)Medical Center with support from
Pfizer and the Pfizer Foundation announced the launch of The Center for the
Advancement of Cancer Survivorship, Navigation, and Policy with a $1.2 million
commitment over three years. The new Center, a unique collaboration of the GW
Cancer Institute (GWCI) and the Department of Health Policy in the School of
Public Health and Health Services, will seek to advance patient navigation and
cancer survivorship efforts both locally and nationally through training,
research, policy analysis, outreach and education. 

"By creating this Center, GWCI`s resources will reach patients in our community,
as well as train other institutions to provide their own patients with the
resources and care they need after receiving a cancer diagnosis. This Center
will serve as a model for other organizations interested in implementing patient
navigation and survivorship programs that cover the continuum of cancer health
care from screening to cure or end-of-life," said Steven Patierno, PhD, GWCI
executive director. "Our goal is to put the tools in place to effectively meet
the needs of cancer survivors across the nation." 

"This is an important initiative for Pfizer as we highly recognize the value
that patient navigation and survivorship programs can bring in assisting cancer
patients as they manage their treatments," said Mace Rothenberg, MD, Pfizer`s
Vice President of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for its Oncology
Business Unit. "We are proud to be partnering with GW and look forward to
launching this important initiative." 

Patient navigation and survivorship care are key elements in helping patients
with their fight against cancer. Even well-educated patients with access to
resources often have difficulty navigating the labyrinth of medical care in the
face of cancer, and the challenges intensify for those who are uneducated, poor,
underinsured, or who face language barriers, creating disparities in quality of
care. 

Patient navigation has been shown to be effective in reducing cancer
disparities, as well as mortality rates. Likewise, cancer survivorship programs
have been shown to improve the quality of life for patients with a cancer
diagnosis. Nevertheless, health care providers have struggled to develop and
sustain successful and cost-effective patient navigation and survivorship
programs. Through the creation of The Center for the Advancement of Cancer
Survivorship, Navigation and Policy, GWCI seeks to fill both gaps. 

"The award to establish this Center offers an unprecedented opportunity to
consider the impact of national health reform on patients with cancer and on the
accessibility and quality of cancer treatment," said Sara Rosenbaum, Harold and
Jane Hirsh Professor of Health Law and Policy and chair of the Department of
Health Policy. 

Funds from the Pfizer grant will support important initiatives such as:

* Two one-week training programs, beginning in Fall 2009, where institutions
from across the nation, will learn how to advance the effectiveness of
navigation and survivorship programs and share best practices in the field.
Trainees-including navigators, nurses, social and community health workers, and
administrators--will learn about the barriers that affect their patients, be
trained to launch or improve programs, and gain tools to implement institutional
change. 
* Courses for GW medicine and public health students and a fellowship program
for MDs and PhDs in Cancer Health Policy, educating them about the policy
context in which they practice and in which patients receive care. 
* The development of a tool to evaluate national health reform proposals and
their potential to remove barriers to effective care including patient
navigation and survivorship practices, which will be distributed to policymakers
and the cancer community. 
* The Center will also conduct periodic assessments of pending reform
legislation. Policy analysis activities will be informed by a "Voices from the
Patients Navigation Field" initiative that will capture feedback from patients
and caregivers and document barriers to patient care, which will also capture
approaches to overcoming those barriers. 
* The organization of an expert roundtable to develop a health policy related
research agenda exploring the impact of cancer treatment and the effectiveness
of navigation and survivorship services on disparities in health and health
care. 
* The establishment of programs and activities to promote patient navigation and
survivorship research, as well as coordinated clinical care, and building an
informational tool called "The Cancer Survivor`s Roadmap," to assist survivors
in the steps that follow treatment.

"The Pfizer Foundation has a robust history as a pioneer in helping advance
effective programs to improve health care delivery and disease prevention," said
Caroline Roan, president of the Pfizer Foundation. "We are pleased to support
George Washington Cancer Institute`s innovative work in patient navigation and
survivorship as their efforts will have a measurable impact in advancing cancer
control and policy."

&lt;p&gt;-- Miley Cyrus is Youngest Ever Recording Artist with Four #1 Albums in Less
Than Three Years -
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
On the heels of a No. 1 film, Hannah Montana The Movie soundtrack soared to the
No. 1 position on the Billboard 200 chart in its fourth week of release,
scanning over 133,000 units according to Nielsen SoundScan. Since its release on
March 24, the soundtrack has scanned over 554,000 units. In addition to being
the #1 selling album in the U.S., it is also #1 on the Billboard Soundtrack
chart for the fourth consecutive week. 

Digital sales were strong during the past week with over 2 million digital
tracks sold to date. The album ranked #1 on the iTunes Music Store (and various
other digital retailers), with 3 singles in the Top 10 and 7 singles in the Top
100. The album debuted at No. 1 on Billboard`s Top Digital Album chart during
the week of its release and reclaimed the top position this week. 

The Miley Cyrus single "The Climb" currently has over 27 million in audience
this week across multiple formats, including Top 40 (#17), Hot AC (#20),
Mainstream AC (#14) and Country (#38). 

The soundtrack marks the fourth No. 1 album for 16-year-old singer/songwriter
Miley Cyrus, star of "Hannah Montana The Movie" and the hit Disney Channel
series "Hannah Montana." Cyrus is youngest ever recording artist with four #1
albums in less than 3 years. 

The Walt Disney Records soundtrack boasts plenty of pop gems, including "You`ll
Always Find Your Way Back Home" (co-written by Taylor Swift), "Let`s Get Crazy,"
"The Good Life," "Let`s Do This," "Spotlight," "What`s Not To Like" and a new
version of "The Best Of Both Worlds," all performed by Miley as Hannah Montana;
"The Climb" (Produced by John Shanks), "Don`t Walk Away," "Dream" and "Hoedown
Throwdown" by Miley Cyrus; and "Butterfly Fly Away," a tender and unforgettable
duet by Miley and Billy Ray produced by Glen Ballard. 

Also included, the hit single "Back To Tennessee" by Billy Ray Cyrus (it`s also
the title track from his new album); Rascal Flatts performing "Backwards" and an
acoustic version of their hit "Bless the Broken Road;" "Everything I Want" and
"Game Over" by Hollywood Records' U.K. sensation Steve Rushton; and "Crazier" by
singer/songwriter Taylor Swift. 

In 2006, Miley Cyrus landed the starring role in the Disney Channel`s "Hannah
Montana," which instantly became a ratings blockbuster. That year, the first
"Hannah Montana" CD came out on Walt Disney Records, becoming the first TV
soundtrack to debut at #1 on the Billboard Top 200. The album is now certified
triple-platinum. 

With her triple-platinum 2007 two-disc set, "Hannah Montana 2 / Meet Miley
Cyrus" Miley set the stage for her record-shattering "Best of Both Worlds" tour.
She also had the #1 film in the country with the Walt Disney Pictures 3-D
release, "Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert." Last
summer she released her platinum-certified "Breakout" album, for which she
co-wrote 8 of the 13 tracks. Currently, Cyrus is in the third season of her hit
television series "Hannah Montana" and recently published her first ever book
"Miles to Go." 

Walt Disney Records is part of the Disney Music Group, the recorded music and
music publishing arm of the Walt Disney Company.

&lt;p&gt;Simplified Two-factor authentication solution, CSSI (charismathics smart
security interface) showcased at RSA
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
charismathics today announced they are working with IBM through their Tivoli
Access Manager for Enterprise Single-Sign-On business partner network. This
relationship allows IBM to support Single Sign-On for end-users through the
Tivoli framework, by leveraging charismathics CSSI&#169; (charismathics Smart
Security Interface). 

"charismathics extends IBM`s commitment to enterprise security solutions that
provide the best value, and most flexibility to our customers. charismathics is
a leader in enabling enhanced unified security architectures to a range of
enterprise clients and individual users. We look forward to leveraging
charismathics proven expertise to provide the best solutions to IBM customers,"
said E.K. Koh, Program Director, Single Sign On, IBM Tivoli software. 

For the last three years charismathics and formerly Encentuate, (now part of
IBM) have partnered to support Singapore`s national government ID project. This
project utilized CSSI to address complex requirements for this local e-citizen
ID market. The deployment integrated IBM`s Tivoli Access Manager Enterprise
Single Sign On and charismathics` USB cryptographic tokens embedded with flash
memory to authenticate and store passwords. 

Additionally, both companies are developing a fully featured demo for IBM`s
field sales team to show their Tivoli Access Manager Enterprise Single Sign On
product integrated with charismathics` CSSI. This demo will allow IBM`s sales
team to demonstrate Tivoli Access Manager Enterprise Single Sign On with smart
cards and tokens in a PKI environment. The aim of this demonstration is to
educate the market on this solution`s ease of use. CSSI adds value and
flexibility by allowing a variety of tokens to be used in a PKI environment
without the installation and maintenance hassles of the past. This in turn
decreases the complexity of the overall system architecture and leverages a
horizontal integration long needed by the market. 

CSSI is a cost-effective, smart card independent middleware, which allows for
seamless integration with all major pre-boot authentication systems and all
major PKI and standard interfaces. CSSI is hardware agnostic and adds
flexibility to the procurement cycle by separating hardware decisions from the
software selections. 

"We are proud to collaborate with IBM, to deliver unprecedented flexibility to
enterprise security clients. Moving forward, our middleware will allow IBM
customers to easily support tokens, smart cards, and other authentication
devices in a PKI environment to support Single Sign-On." said Sven Gossel, CEO
of charismathics. "Our teaming together will result in reduced total cost of
ownership and optimized security infrastructures for both IBM and charismathics
customers."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MVV) have signed an agreement that
is designed to facilitate advancements in the battle against malaria, a disease
that afflicts vulnerable populations in the developing world each year. Under
the agreement, MMV will have access to the Pfizer library of novel chemical
entities, in order to screen it for compounds that have the potential to be
developed into new treatments for malaria. 

Malaria causes an estimated 881,000 deaths each year, of which over 90% are in
Africa and 85% are children under 5 years of age. 

"People are suffering in developing countries and we want to help by sharing
resources and boosting research against tropical diseases," said Dr. Rod
MacKenzie, senior vice president of Research, Pfizer Global Research &amp;
Development. "Although this is early-stage research, which means that effective
new treatments may only begin to be developed several years from now, it
improves the chances of identifying compounds that may lead to new drugs. We
believe public-private research collaborations are vital to tackling health
challenges in developing countries, and we are confident our collaboration with
MMV will further aid in the search for drugs with the potential to treat
malaria." 

Under the agreement, scientists in institutes affiliated with MMV will test
approximately 200,000 compounds in the Pfizer library against P. falciparum, the
parasite that causes acute malaria, including multi-drug resistant strains. In a
process called screening, researchers will seek to identify compounds that show
initial activity against P. falciparum, and thus might form the basis for novel
drug discovery programs to treat malaria. The screening will be undertaken at
the Eskitis Institute for Cell and Molecular Therapies at Griffith University in
Brisbane, Australia. 

Building on a strong R portfolio, a new business structure to be even closer
to the customer, a commitment to meeting the diverse medical needs of the world
in an innovative and socially responsible manner, and its decades of
philanthropic activities, Pfizer has committed valuable resources to the fight
against malaria and is dedicated to closing the malaria treatment gap. Pfizer's
existing malaria product portfolio may be augmented with the artemisinin
combination therapy Eurartesim* (in collaboration with sigma-tau), which is in
late-stage clinical trials. Pfizer also has an ongoing azithromycin/chloroquine
clinical program. "We are creating partnerships to improve the quality of
healthcare and access to medicines for patients in the developing world," stated
Jean-Michel Halfon, president &amp; general manager of Pfizer`s Emerging Markets
Business Unit. "We cannot solve the problem alone, but are stepping forward to
be a part of the solution." 

MMV has recently enlarged its mission to include the search for new antimalarial
medicines that will contribute to the ultimate eradication of malaria. "This
agreement with Pfizer will allow us to identify any promising compounds with
antimalarial activity from their unique and extensive library of new chemical
entities," said Dr. Chris Hentschel, president and CEO of MMV. "To eradicate
malaria the world needs new medicines that will not only treat and cure P.
falciparum malaria, but also P. vivax malaria, a rarer form of the disease that
is very difficult to cure. In addition, new drugs are needed to tackle emerging
resistance, and stop parasite transmission from infected individuals. Having the
opportunity to screen a wide array of compounds in the Pfizer library will help
MMV build a strong pipeline of potential new antimalarials." 

Pfizer Inc: Working together for a healthier world

Founded in 1849, Pfizer is the world's premier biopharmaceutical company taking
new approaches to better health. We discover, develop, manufacture and deliver
quality, safe and effective prescription medicines to treat and help prevent
disease for both people and animals. We also partner with healthcare providers,
governments and local communities around the world to expand access to our
medicines and to provide better quality health care and health system support.
At Pfizer, more than 80,000 colleagues in more than 90 countries work every day
to help people stay happier and healthier longer and to reduce the human and
economic burden of disease worldwide. 

Pfizer has a 25-year history in fighting malaria that includes four components:
a robust portfolio of malaria medicines, a Pfizer-owned manufacturing and
distribution facility in Dakar, Senegal which manufactures some of these
medicines, investments in R to develop needed drugs for pregnant women and
infants and the Mobilize Against Malaria philanthropy initiative where Pfizer is
working with a number of partners to help close gaps in malaria treatment and
education in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2008, Pfizer manufactured and shipped over
five million malaria treatments from its Dakar warehouse and plant for
distribution throughout Sub-Saharan Africa.

&lt;p&gt;April 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded the U.S. auto
sector to "neutral" from "cautious," citing the likelihood of a
bottom in auto sales, and also raised its rating on Ford Motor
Co (F.N) to "buy" as it expects the company to benefit the most
from structural changes within the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of Ford were up more than 9 percent to $4.15 in
trading before the bell Wednesday after Goldman said Ford
shares were worth $6, and added the stock to its Americas
conviction buy list. Goldman previously had a "neutral" rating
on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With General Motors Corp (GM.N) and Chrysler likely to
file for bankruptcy in coming weeks... we think the stage is
set for a sea change in the structure of the US auto industry,"
Goldman analysts, led by Patrick Archambault, wrote in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts expect this structural change in the sector
will significantly alter the competitive and economic landscape
by paring down industry capacity and retracing market shares
through a diminished presence from GM and Chrysler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the best way to capitalize on this upside
opportunity lies with Ford, which (we) think will avoid
bankruptcy," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ford is well positioned to capitalize on a more than 50
percent decline in Chrysler share and the reduction of GM's
product portfolio, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts said Ford, which has not asked for government
aid, has sufficient liquidity to make it through to 2010
without additional funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They raised their 2009 auto sales estimate to 11 million
units from 10 million units to reflect the likely impact of a
scrappage plan -- a program that offers incentives to owners
for turning in older vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The prospects for a scrappage plan endorsed by the Obama
administration has the potential to add between 750,000 to 1
million units to new vehicle sales," the analysts said. Shares
of Ford closed at $3.80 Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Apr 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
RSA Conference, Booth #1152 -- At the 2009 RSA Conference, Liquid
Machines, Inc. unveiled support for Microsoft Active Directory Federation
Services (AD FS). When used with Microsoft Active Directory Rights
Management Services (AD RMS) and Liquid Machines Document Control client
software, AD FS users can securely share intellectual property or
regulated information across more than 400 file formats with external
partners, suppliers and customers. Protected files can be securely
exchanged between trusted third-parties using file transfer protocol
(FTP), email, portable storage devices or, with the recently announced
version of the Liquid Machines Gateway for SharePoint, shared externally
leveraging the web-based, collaborative features of Microsoft SharePoint
and the persistent information protection of Liquid Machines and
Microsoft AD RMS.

    Corporate users that need to securely collaborate with trusted
third-parties outside of their enterprises look for ways to simplify the
protection and management of electronic information. For those trusted
relationships (e.g. partner, customer, supplier) in which regular
electronic information sharing occurs, identity federation software such
as AD FS provides a solution. Identity federation enables users of one
network domain to securely access applications or information from
another domain seamlessly, without redundant authentication or user
administration. With AD FS and AD RMS, these users can share
rights-protected content; for example, a corporate user can establish a
federated relationship with their customers whom only are required to
deploy AD FS. Once configured, the two organizations can easily share
rights-protected content without managing redundant identities and
passwords, or requiring costly infrastructure.

    "The robustness of the Liquid Machines solution enables our customers to
leverage significant advancements to the Microsoft platform such as AD FS
at no additional costs, making it easy for organizations to securely
collaborate with trusted partners, suppliers and customers," said Ed
Gaudet, senior vice president of corporate development and marketing at
Liquid Machines. "Extending the ability to share rights-protected content
in hundreds of file formats and using SharePoint provides our mutual
customers with the freedom of choice and removes previous technical
limitations which required redundant costs and administration."

    "One of the main issues with sharing rights-protected content outside of
your organization deals with authentication and identity management,"
stated Gartner analyst Eric Ouellet, Research VP. "Integrated federated
identity and rights management systems simplify the provisioning of users
into policy, enabling external trusted third parties to securely share and
persistently protect information such as supplier contracts, customer
data, and health care records with mandatory access controls."

    Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is a component in
Microsoft(R) Windows Server(TM) 2003 R2 and Windows Server 2008, which
enables Web single-sign-on (SSO) technologies to authenticate a user to
multiple Web applications over the life of a single online session. AD FS
accomplishes this by securely sharing digital identity and entitlement
rights, or "claims," across security and enterprise boundaries. When
deploying AD FS and AD RMS together, users can share rights-protected
content with trusted third-parties across security and enterprise
boundaries.

    The Liquid Machines Document Control client extends rights protection to
over 400 different file types including text, graphic, word processing,
spreadsheets, presentation, CAD, database and email. Examples of supported
file types include those from the following applications: Adobe Reader,
Microsoft Office, FrameMaker, Lotus AMI Pro, Corel WordPerfect,
StarOffice, WordStar, MacWrite, Paint Shop, Corel Draw, Photoshop,
Illustrator, Micrografx, OpenOffice, Visio, Lotus 123, Access, Paradox,
Outlook and Yahoo IM.

    The Liquid Machines Gateway for SharePoint is tightly integrated with
Microsoft AD RMS and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 to
persistently protect files opened or downloaded from SharePoint. The
Liquid Machines Gateway for SharePoint supports existing business
processes and workflows by extending persistent information protection to
a broader range of document and file types, and enables advanced
rights-managed workflows.

&lt;p&gt;Exinda Version 5.1 Provides Feature-Rich, User-Centric WAN Optimization That
Delivers High Value and Ease of Use
TORONTO--(Business Wire)--
Exinda Inc., a leading global provider of WAN optimization and application
acceleration solutions, today announced the availability of Exinda version 5.1
featuring Microsoft Active Directory integration. By leveraging the user
information stored in Active Directory, Exinda customers gain greater visibility
into network usage by relating an Active Directory username or user group to
each data conversation on the network. With this information readily available,
network administrators can take appropriate actions to ensure acceptable
application performance for users and user-groups and can easily trouble-shoot
network bottlenecks. 

"By integrating with Active Directory, Exinda delivers something unique to the
market," said Ed Ryan, Vice President of Products, Exinda. "Network
administrators have far more flexibility and control over network resources when
they can readily see and track resource usage at a granular level. Armed with
this information, the network can be fine-tuned to meet the business needs of
individual users and groups, network resources can be allocated more
appropriately and excessive users of network bandwidth can be quickly
identified." 

"We looked at several WAN optimization solutions and choose Exinda because of
its superior visibility, control and optimization functionality, particularly
with Active Directory integration," comments Jeff King, Systems Administrator,
The Expo Group. "Other products that we considered would monitor usage and
optimize applications by IP address. We use DHCP, making IP-centric WAN
optimization products valueless because our users and network devices are
assigned IP addresses dynamically. Exinda version 5.1 supports our environment
and makes WAN optimization very straight-forward." 

In addition to Microsoft Active Directory integration, Exinda 5.1 includes a
number of usability enhancements that make it ideal for organizations requiring
a comprehensive and tightly integrated WAN optimization solution. A Simplified
User Interface is now available as an option for appliance management and
reporting. This simplified view includes a performance dashboard, benefits
report and guided configuration wizard. 

"As a channel partner, we see the value that Exinda delivers to our customers
every day," said Kevan Paul, Senior Engineer, NLE. "The enhancements in version
5.1 show Exinda`s commitment to delivering a solution that is both feature-rich
and user-friendly. The Active Directory integration worked flawlessly and
expands the reporting to an even greater level of detail. We see significant
market opportunity with this new product release and look forward to delivering
this great value to our customers."

Scripps</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) as the Bull of the
Day and Regency Centers (NYSE: REG) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on The New York Times Co. (NYSE: NYT), The
McClatchy Company (NYSE: MNI) and The E. W. Scripps Company (NYSE: SSP). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

As a result of its large non-US revenue base, IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) has
been better insulated from recent weakness in the U.S. economy than many of its
peers. IBM`s Q109 results indicate its strong position in emerging markets,
which should continue to help drive growth. 

Moreover, the company has focused on driving its bottom line through cost
cutting efforts. It re-affirmed EPS guidance for the full year of 2009.
Although, revenue is not expected to grow much, we expect margin improvements in
2009. 

The company`s long-term prospects look brighter as it maintains a strong
position in the software and services market. We maintain our Buy rating on IBM
shares and maintain our price target of $120.00. 

Bear of the Day: 

Regency Centers (NYSE: REG) reported 4Q08 FFO of $0.72 per share vs. $1.16 in
4Q07. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges and deal write-offs
which totaled $0.62 in the quarter. In addition, the company reported $0.28 per
share of promote income. 

Operations are holding up relatively well at the company's centers, with stable
occupancy, and same-store NOI and rental growth. However, retail-focused REITs
will face a much more difficult operating environment in the coming quarters.
Consumer spending patterns are weakening across the country and large chains are
curtailing expansion plans. 

We would be careful of the strip retail sector, although we still rate REG a
Buy. We expect REG to hold up better than many retail competitors who are
saddled with more debt. REG has a diversified portfolio of retail centers in
strong long-term markets. The yield is over 13%, but a cut could be coming over
the next couple of quarters. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

NYT: Steeper Fall in Ad Revenues

The New York Times Co. (NYSE: NYT) threatened in early April to close the
137-year old Pulitzer prize-winning Boston Globe within a month unless it gets
$20 million in union concessions. The threatened closure follows a similar
action Hearst Corp. took in February to successfully obtain cuts in staff at the
San Francisco Chronicle. 

For 2Q09, management indicated that it expects a similar rate of ad revenue
decline. Relief depends on the economy stabilizing, which economists widely
agree is not likely to happen this year. 

Until there is some visibility to stabilization, we would not recommend buying
shares of publishing companies (remain underweight), including both newspaper
publishers such as The McClatchy Company (NYSE: MNI) and The E. W. Scripps
Company (NYSE: SSP).

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Glaxo Acquires Stiefel Labs

This morning, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) announced it will acquire privately
held Stiefel Laboratories for $2.9 billion in cash. Glaxo will also assume $400
million in debt and has agreed to pay $300 million in milestone payments
depending on the performance of key assets at Stiefel, bringing the total deal
size to potentially $3.6 billion. 

Stiefel Labs, located in Coral Cables, Florida, is the world's biggest
independent dermatology company, and makes prescription and over-the-counter
medications including acne treatments and other skin creams, lotions, washes and
vitamins. 

The company had reportedly been in talks early this year to be acquired by
Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS). Leading products at
Stiefel include Duac for acne, Olux E for dermatitis, and Soriatane for severe
psoriasis. Stiefel delivered approximately $900 million in sales in 2008. The
deal essentially triples Glaxo`s dermatology business, which delivered sales of
approximately $550 million in 2008. 

IBM Reports Below Consensus

IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) reported revenue and earnings that were below consensus.
However, the company reiterated its goal of $9.20 EPS for 2009. 

The largest error on the revenue forecast was the net effect of currency
fluctuations. Although net sales declined by just over 11%, the currency neutral
decline was only 4%. 

Most of the revenue shortfall was in the Systems &amp; Technology Group and the
Software Group. Gross margins improved by two percentage points, but some of the
improvement was due to currency translations from weak local currencies to the
US dollar. 

Schering-Plough Misses on ForEx

This morning Schering-Plough Corp. (NYSE: SGP) reported financial results for
the period ending March 31, 2009. Revenue of $4.4 billion was down 6% from the
first quarter 2008, and 5% below our estimate of $4.6 billion. The impact from
foreign exchange of 10% was higher than our forecast. Operational revenue growth
was 4% in the quarter. 

Operational sales growth of all major products were in-line with our
expectations. However, foreign exchange had greater-than-anticipated impact and
negatively affected reported results of a number of products.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China's central bank on Wednesday declared the economy to be on the road to recovery as Goldman Sachs joined a rush to upgrade growth forecasts on the back of aggressive government efforts to boost investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China's gross domestic product growth in the first quarter slowed to 6.1 percent from a year earlier, the lowest rate on record, from 6.8 percent in the final three months of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Yi Gang, a vice governor of the People's Bank of China, expressed confidence that expansion for the whole year would turn out to be close to the official target of 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of quarter-on-quarter data, actually the fourth quarter of last year was the bottom of this cycle in terms of industrial output, electricity use, transportation and so on and so forth," Yi told the annual meeting of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as rolling out a 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) two-year stimulus package, Beijing has successfully prompted state-owned banks to turn on the lending taps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New loans in the first quarter totaled 4.58 trillion yuan after a record leap of 1.89 trillion yuan ($276.6 billion) in March alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yi said the surge in lending had helped to quash deflationary expectations and to stabilize China's property and equity markets. It had prompted companies to speed up restocking and, more importantly, it had helped restore confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upshot had been some positive signs of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The economy is going forward as the stimulus package started working. And looking into the future, the second quarter and the remainder of this year will continue this recovery trend," said Yi, who was speaking in English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BULLISH GOLDMAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs on Wednesday became the latest bank to take a rosier view of prospects for the world's third-largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman marked up its projection for GDP growth this year to 8.3 percent from 6.0 percent and stuck its neck out with a forecast for 2010 of 10.9 percent, up from 9.0 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We acknowledge that policy stimulus has been more determined and persistent and the response from domestic demand has come in earlier and more strongly than we envisaged previously," Goldman economists Helen Qiao and Yu Song said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays Capital all raised their forecasts after last Thursday's first-quarter GDP figures and accompanying data for March, which showed a marked pick-up in growth in industrial output and fixed-asset investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Standard Chartered Bank on Wednesday reiterated its forecast of 6.8 percent growth this year, while a senior official said the foundations of China's recovery were shaky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lou Qinjian, deputy minister of industry and information technology, said overcapacity, including in the steel and auto sectors, was intensifying due to weak domestic and global demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can not easily conclude that the economy has bottomed out. The industrial situation remains serious," he told a forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOAN GROWTH WORRIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some economists are concerned that the jump in lending will add to the excess capacity that worries Lou, eventually saddling China's banks with a new crop of bad loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu Xiaoling, a former PBOC vice governor, told Reuters the lending surge would be no good for the economy if it continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the sidelines of the conference, she urged banks to recognize the risks they are taking and to apply the brakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yi said: "We realize the negative side and possible risks, but overall it's a positive development. For the remainder of this year, I hope that lending will stabilize at a sustainable rate. That is the best scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media reports of an outright decline in bank lending in early April weighed on the Shanghai stock market .SSEC, which dropped 2.9 percent, the second-steepest fall in six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paris-based Michala Marcussen, head of strategy and economic research at Societe Generale's asset management unit, said she shared concerns about a possible rise in sour loans and fretted that part of the 35 percent rally in Shanghai stocks so far this year had been fueled by breakneck credit growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having said that, I also believe Chinese equity market is attractively priced and I still believe that to be the case," Marcussen told reporters in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yi said Beijing was comfortable about a slowdown in the pace at which it is accumulating foreign exchange reserves, which grew just $7.7 billion in the first quarter to $1.9537 trillion. In all of 2008 the stockpile increased $417.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a 'take it easy' attitude. We already have enough reserves," Yi said. "We hope it will stabilize and that in the future we will have more or less balanced payments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yi said China, as a large holder of dollars, sees itself as a responsible long-term investor, not a short-term speculator. As such its reserve management policy follows the principles of safety, liquidity and investment returns, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is of course concerned about the outlook for the dollar and hopes the policies of the government in Washington and of the Federal Reserve will stabilize the U.S. currency, Yi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Eadie Chen, Alan Wheatley and Langi Chiang in Beijing; Additional reporting by Kevin Yao in Singapore)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * PBOC vice-governor upbeat on 8 percent 2009 growth target&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Yi Gang says economy touched bottom in fourth quarter 2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Goldman makes big upward revisions to China forecasts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Eadie Chen and Alan Wheatley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEIJING, April 22 (Reuters) - China's central bank on Wednesday declared the
economy to be on the road to recovery as Goldman Sachs joined a rush to upgrade
growth forecasts on the back of aggressive government efforts to boost
investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's gross domestic product growth in the first quarter slowed to 6.1
percent from a year earlier, the lowest rate on record, from 6.8 percent in the
final three months of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Yi Gang, a vice governor of the People's Bank of China, expressed
confidence that expansion for the whole year would turn out to be close to the
official target of 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In terms of quarter-on-quarter data, actually the fourth quarter of last
year was the bottom of this cycle in terms of industrial output, electricity
use, transportation and so on and so forth," Yi told the annual meeting of the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As well as rolling out a 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) two-year stimulus
package, Beijing has successfully prompted state-owned banks to turn on the
lending taps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New loans in the first quarter totalled 4.58 trillion yuan after a record
leap of 1.89 trillion yuan ($276.6 billion) in March alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yi said the surge in lending had helped to eradicate deflationary
expectations and to stabilise China's property and equity markets. It had
prompted companies to speed up restocking and, more importantly, it had helped
restore confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The upshot, he said, had been some positive signs of recovery in the first
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The economy is going forward as the stimulus package started working. And
looking into the future, the second quarter and the remainder of this year will
continue this recovery trend," said Yi, who was speaking in English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BULLISH GOLDMAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs on Wednesday became the latest bank to take a rosier view of
prospects for the world's third-largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman marked up its projection for GDP growth this year to 8.3 percent
from 6.0 percent and stuck its neck out with a forecast for 2010 of 10.9
percent, up from 9.0 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We acknowledge that policy stimulus has been more determined and persistent
and the response from domestic demand has come in earlier and more strongly than
we envisaged previously," Goldman economists Helen Qiao and Yu Song said in a
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays Capital all raised their forecasts
after last Thursday's first-quarter GDP figures and accompanying data for March,
which showed a marked pick-up in growth in industrial output and fixed-asset
investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By contrast, Standard Chartered Bank on Wednesday reiterated its forecast of
6.8 percent growth this year, while a senior government researcher cautioned
that the recovery would be bumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The possibility for China to have a steady and quick recovery is not big
due to the current external economic situation and structural problems with the
domestic economy," Fan Jianping, chief economist with the State Information
Center, a leading think-tank, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The impact of the global financial crisis is spreading and exerting an even
deeper effect on China," he wrote in the China Securities Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RELAXED ON FX RESERVES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some economists are concerned that the jump in lending will finance poor
investments that will eventually saddle China's banks with a new crop of bad
loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wu Xiaoling, a former PBOC vice governor, told Reuters the surge in lending
would be no good for the economy if it continued. Speaking on the sidelines of
the conference, she urged banks to recognise the risks they are taking and to
apply the brakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yi said the central bank was of course concerned whether the boom in credit
could be sustained and acknowledged that it might have some negative
repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We realise the negative side and possible risks, but overall it's a
positive development. For the remainder of this year, I hope that lending will
stabilise at a sustainable rate. That is the best scenario," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yi said Beijing was comfortable about a slowdown in the pace at which it is
accumulating foreign exchange reserves, which grew just $7.7 billion in the
first quarter to $1.9537 trillion. In all of 2008 the stockpile increased $417.8
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China was relaxed because it was undergoing a structural adjustment to its
economy that would lead to a more balanced external payments position, Yi said,
adding that the sharp rise in the balance of payments in recent years was not
sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have a 'take it easy' attitude. We already have enough reserves," Yi
said. "We hope it will stabilise and that in the future we will have more or
less balanced payments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yi reaffirmed China's stance that, as a large holder of dollars, it is a
responsible long-term investor, not a short-term speculator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As such its reserve management policy is dictated by the principles of
safety, liquidity and investment returns, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China is of course concerned about the outlook for the dollar and hopes the
policies of the government in Washington and of the Federal Reserve will
stabilise the U.S. currency, Yi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Reporting by Eadie Chen and Alan Wheatley; Editing by Ken Wills)

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's quarterly profit fell 32 percent, but its shares rose as investors welcomed continuing efforts to cut costs and news that the release of its Windows 7 operating system is on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's top software maker offered no profit forecast on Thursday, after withdrawing its outlook in January, but did say it expected the personal computer, server and hardware markets to remain weak for at least another quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we would all like to think that our recovery will be soon and painless, we unfortunately believe that it will be slow and gradual," Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't see any improvement at the end of the quarter that gives me encouragement that we are at a bottom and coming out of it," Liddell added, contesting comments last week from chip-maker Intel Corp that the PC market was over the worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's report, following strong earnings from Apple Inc and Google Inc this month, broadly pleased analysts, some of whom braced for worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the company reported a 6 percent drop in revenue for the March quarter, marking the first year-on-year decline in Microsoft's history as a public company, it also managed to cut operating expenses by a bigger 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's good to see that they are controlling their costs because that's within their sphere of control.

The stock has risen over 30 percent from a more than 10-year low of $14.87 in early March. However, it is still essentially flat for the year after ending 2008 at $19.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis Shauger, an analyst at Caris  Co, said Microsoft's stock has been "pretty cheap" and investors were expecting profit margins to be hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of the cost cuts they have done are having positive impact," he said. "People were fearing far worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it was targeting $26.7 billion to $26.9 billion in operating expenses for the fiscal year, which ends June 30. That is below the $27.4 billion target it gave three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January it said it would slash up to 5,000 jobs, or just over 5 percent of its 96,000 staff, over 18 months, in a bid to save $1.5 billion a year. It cut 1,400 staff right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, reported fiscal third-quarter profit of $2.98 billion, or 33 cents per share, compared with $4.39 billion, or 47 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding costs of the recent layoffs and charges for impaired investments, Microsoft reported profit of 39 cents per share. That met analysts' average estimate, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 6 percent to $13.65 billion.

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuit Seeks At Least $3 Billion in Damages for `Intentional and Malicious`
Misconduct

Failure to Fund Loan Would Further Damage Las Vegas Economy
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Fontainebleau Las Vegas, LLC filed a $3 billion lawsuit today against Bank of
America, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and certain
other lenders after they reneged on their contractual commitments to provide the
Company with almost $800 million in prearranged funding. The lawsuit notes that
Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and certain other lenders charged in the
lawsuit collectively received tens of billions of dollars in federal bailout
money that was meant to increase the flow of credit. 

"This case arises from the breach by a group of unscrupulous banks of their
clear and unequivocal written promise to Fontainebleau to finance the
construction of its multi-billion dollar casino-resort development project in
Las Vegas (the "Project") -- a promise in exchange for which the Banks have
already secured for themselves tens of millions of dollars in fees," according
to the lawsuit filed by Fontainebleau Las Vegas in the District Court of Clark
County, Nevada. The lenders` "misconduct here was calculated, intentional and
malicious. Defendants abandoned their lending commitments solely to try to
extricate themselves from a loan they no longer wish to make, notwithstanding
that those commitments are clear, unequivocal, and binding, and that Plaintiff
and thousands of employees and their families are relying on those commitments
to be performed." 

The complaint alleges that the lenders notified Fontainebleau Las Vegas on April
20, 2009 that they had purportedly "terminated" their commitments under an $800
million revolver loan, "ostensibly based on `one or more` unspecified `Events of
Default,`" but without outlining any detail or specifics of an Event of Default.
According to the lawsuit, "In fact, there has been no Event of Default, and
there is no contractual basis whatsoever for the Revolver Banks` breach of their
clear and unambiguous obligations. The purported termination is nothing more
than the Banks` baseless attempt to walk away from the Project and abandon their
obligations." 

The $800 million loan is in addition to more than $2 billion in debt and equity
that Fontainebleau Las Vegas has already borrowed and invested to build what is
expected to be a new landmark casino-resort on the Las Vegas Strip. 

"We are not asking for anything special, merely that the revolver banks fulfill
the commitment they made to fund this project," said Jeff Soffer, Executive
Chairman of Fontainebleau Resorts LLC. "We need them to live up to their
promises so that we can complete a landmark project that will help revitalize
tourist visitation to Las Vegas." 

The lawsuit says that the banks` "brazen breach of contract" jeopardizes
Fontainebleau Las Vegas` ability to complete its signature casino-resort on the
Las Vegas Strip. The project is more than 70 percent complete, with finish work
being undertaken in the resort's sleeping rooms and suites. Failure to provide
the funding will, according to the lawsuit, "cause enormous harm to the public
interest" by further damaging the local economy. 

"In addition to the approximately 3,300 construction workers on-site daily (plus
the additional 1,700 workers who would be needed to work on the final stages of
the Project) and hundreds of others presently employed by the Project, the
opening of the Fontainebleau Las Vegas is expected to result in over 6,000
full-time jobs at the facility, and approximately 2,000 additional jobs in Las
Vegas," according to the lawsuit. "All of these sources of employment will
vanish as a result of the Banks` breach -- a further blow to a local economy
that, in the words of the Las Vegas Sun, is in `freefall` and may be in for its
`longest recession since the Great Depression.`" Further damage will be caused
to the many suppliers and contractors from across the country that are supplying
materials and services to the project. 

The lawsuit also says that the wrongful termination of the loan "is all the more
egregious in light of the tens of billions of dollars that certain of the
Revolver Banks have received from the federal government`s Troubled Asset
Repurchase Program ("TARP"). Defendant Bank of America, N.A., has to date
received a total of $52.5 billion dollars in federal assistance (including funds
received in connection with its acquisition of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc., the
corporate parent of defendant Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation) and JPMorgan
Chase has received $25 billion dollars in federal assistance. These TARP and
other funds were provided to the Banks with one purpose: to ensure that these
Banks would begin lending again, and would continue to lend, rather than further
constricting the flow of credit that is absolutely critical for any economic
recovery. But instead of lending -- instead of standing by the contractual
commitments to which they already agreed and are legally bound -- the defendant
Banks have seized upon a false pretext -- a nonexistent unspecified "Event of
Default" -- in a vain attempt to escape their obligations." 

The lawsuit was filed against Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch Capital
Corporation, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas, The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corporation New York, Bank of Scotland, HSH Nordbank AG, New York Branch,
Camulos Master Fund LP, and MB Financial Bank, N.A. 

Fontainebleau Las Vegas is represented by Kasowitz, Benson, Torres &amp; Friedman
LLP of New York, and Morris Peterson of Las Vegas, Nevada. 

Fontainebleau Las Vegas is seeking specific performance of the Revolver Banks`
obligations, as well as recovery from the Revolver Banks of all of its damages
resulting from the lender`s bad faith breach of their obligations, including
consequential damages arising from their bad faith and wrongful conduct,
totaling in the billions of dollars, but in no event less than $3 billion. 

Neither the lawsuit nor the $800 million loan affect Fontainebleau Miami Beach,
which is a separate legal entity from Fontainebleau Las Vegas and which is
currently open and operating.

&lt;p&gt; * Cuts full-year operating expense forecast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says Windows 7 release on track for fiscal 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Fiscal Q3 EPS 33 cents, in line with Wall Street view&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * CFO sees no sign of bottom, recovery will be slow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares up 3 pct after hours
 (Adds CFO comment, updates share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, April 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O)
quarterly profit fell 32 percent, but its shares rose as
investors welcomed continuing efforts to cut costs and news
that the release of its Windows 7 operating system is on
track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's top software maker offered no profit forecast
on Thursday, after withdrawing its outlook in January, but did
say it expected the personal computer, server and hardware
markets to remain weak for at least another quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we would all like to think that our recovery will be
soon and painless, we unfortunately believe that it will be
slow and gradual," Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said
on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I didn't see any improvement at the end of the quarter
that gives me encouragement that we are at a bottom and coming
out of it," Liddell added, contesting comments last week from
chip-maker Intel Corp (INTC.O) that the PC market was over the
worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's report, following strong earnings from Apple
Inc (AAPL.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O) this month
[ID:nN23324310], broadly pleased analysts, some of whom braced
for worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the company reported a 6 percent drop in revenue for
the March quarter, marking the first year-on-year decline in
Microsoft's history as a public company, it also managed to cut
operating expenses by a bigger 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's good to see that they are controlling their costs
because that's within their sphere of control. They can't
really do a lot about demand," said Kim Caughey at money
manager Fort Pitt Capital Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have a nice product refresh cycle coming up, which
should allow them to maintain their market share," she added,
referring to the new Windows 7 that will help Microsoft put the
unpopular Vista operating system behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which released the beta test version of the new
Windows during the quarter, said it felt very good about the
testing and the system was on track for a fiscal 2010 launch,
which could mean as early as July this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The best of all possible worlds would be that it's ready
for back-to-school, which is the July-August time frame," said
Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CUTS EXPENSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose 3 percent in after-hours trading to
$19.48, after closing at $18.92 on Nasdaq. The stock has risen
over 30 percent from a more than 10-year low of $14.87 in early
March. However, it is still essentially flat for the year after
ending 2008 at $19.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Curtis Shauger, an analyst at Caris  Co, said Microsoft's
stock has been "pretty cheap" and investors were expecting
profit margins to be hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some of the cost cuts they have done are having positive
impact," he said. "People were fearing far worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it was targeting $26.7 billion to $26.9
billion in operating expenses for the fiscal year, which ends
June 30. That is below the $27.4 billion target it gave three
months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In January it said it would slash up to 5,000 jobs, or just
over 5 percent of its 96,000 staff, over 18 months, in a bid to
save $1.5 billion a year. It cut 1,400 staff right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, reported fiscal
third-quarter profit of $2.98 billion, or 33 cents per share,
compared with $4.39 billion, or 47 cents per share, in the
year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding costs of the recent layoffs and charges for
impaired investments, Microsoft reported profit of 39 cents per
share. That met analysts' average estimate, according to
Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales fell 6 percent to $13.65 billion. Analysts were
expecting $14.1 billion, on average.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp reported a lower quarterly profit that met Wall Street forecasts, as cost cuts helped to partly offset a sharper-than-expected decline in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker also said it was on track to release the next version of its operating system, Windows 7, during its 2010 fiscal year. Shares of Microsoft rose 4 percent in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CURTIS SHAUGER, ANALYST, CARIS  CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shauger said Microsoft's stock has been "pretty cheap" and investors were expecting lower margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So the fact that this is not negative and they saw some positive growth in one or two of their business lines (servers and Xbox) is providing a little bit of relief. Also, some of the cost cuts they have done is having positive impact. People were fearing far worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SID PARAKH, ANALYST, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN, SEATTLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers are lower than we were expecting ... they hit the earnings number but were ... lower on revenue than we expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On share move: "One of the things they said was operating expense guidance is lower, which might imply they are doing more on cost savings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said: we expect the weakness to continue through the next quarter. We don't know whether it means it's going to get better after that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP, PITTSBURGH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm kind of neutral. There's stuff to be happy with: they're controlling costs and getting that under control. The bad thing is demand and consumer preference seems to have affected their topline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The last couple of days tech earnings have shown an increasing weakness in enterprise spending. And more of a shift toward netbooks than notebooks, that would ultimately impact Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some areas of weakness that I can really see is their online services business....Client looks a little on the light side, and we expect that to have been impact by netbooks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Something that looks like it's holding up well is server and tools, and that's the more business-oriented software. We were probably expecting that to be stronger, but for Microsoft at least it's strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's good to see that they are controlling their costs, because that's within their sphere of control. They can't really do a lot about demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caughey attributed the share rise to Microsoft's comments that Windows 7 will be released in fiscal year 2010:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have a nice product refresh cycle coming up which should allow them to maintain their market share."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best of all possible worlds would be that it's ready for back-to-school, which is the July-August time frame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They really haven't had a scheduled release. We all thought it was sometime in calendar 2010."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vista was very delayed so this is a positive sign. that Microsoft said Windows 7 will be out in 2010."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIAN BARISH, PRESIDENT, CAMBIAR INVESTORS, DENVER, COLORADO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there's nothing really terribly surprising in them. What is moderately encouraging is a good deal more restraint on cost. Microsoft has not exactly been the tightest run ship on the cost side for a long time and they are actually doing something there and I think that's encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Quite honestly movement in the stock probably has more to do with what kind of short-term options various short-term oriented traders have than anything else. But it's nice to see pretty decent numbers coming out of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOAN TRAN, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft had a good quarter. I don't think anyone was expecting them to have a blowout quarter... they had another decent quarter and I think everyone is looking forward to the release of Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On implications for the tech sector or economy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think everyone knew the first quarter was not good for the economy and the tech sector. Microsoft said they don't expect things to pick up quickly. It was a pretty ho hum quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating in Los Angeles, Ellis Mnyandu in New York and Alexei Oreskovic in San Francisco, Compiled by Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM plans to launch several cloud computing services this year, taking on companies such as Amazon.com Inc, Google Inc, Microsoft Corp and Salesforce.com Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp spokeswoman Kelly Sims said on Thursday the first of these new services will enable developers to write software that works with the emerging, Web-based technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing systems run software and store information in remote, large-scale data centers that users and programmers access over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world's biggest technology services company, has lagged behind younger companies in rolling out cloud services. But it is still early days for the cloud industry, which Gartner Research estimates will ring up sales of about $3.4 billion this year. IBM, by comparison, reported revenue of $103 billion last year, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business interest in cloud computing has picked up since Amazon started offering storage and computing services over the Web about three years ago. Google and Salesforce.com are the other two early leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is this important to IBM? Yes," said Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett. "But what IBM is doing is not about suddenly grabbing gigantic new revenue streams. Honestly what IBM and others are doing is a lot of elbowing and throwing of guerrilla dust and trying to win perceived market leadership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM got its feet wet in the field last year when it launched an Internet-based data backup and recovery service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the new service for developers, IBM also plans to introduce clouds that let businesses run applications and to virtualize personal computers, Sims said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like IBM, Microsoft is viewed as having been slow to enter the field. It plans to launch its cloud services platform, dubbed Azure, late this year or early in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's technology was developed using some know-how obtained through a partnership with Google to develop cloud services for academic computing that dates back to 2007, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Science Foundation announced on Thursday it has awarded about $5 million in grants to universities that are developing applications on that IBM-Google academic cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM is applying those skills for the commercial offerings that will be launched in 2009," Sims said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
A l'occasion de la Journ&#233;e mondiale contre le paludisme du 25 avril, ExxonMobil
verse un million de dollars &#224; l'Agence Am&#233;ricaine pour le D&#233;veloppement
International 2 pour soutenir son combat contre le paludisme en Angola. Ce don
porte &#224; plus de 150 millions dollars l'engagement d'ExxonMobil aupr&#232;s des
organismes engag&#233;s dans des projets sociaux et communautaires d'envergure en
Afrique. Ce montant inclut les 55 millions de dollars qui financent les
programmes contre le paludisme &#224; travers l'"Initiative Sant&#233; en Afrique". 

Ce don soutiendra le President's Malaria Initiative (programme de lutte contre
le paludisme sous le patronage du Pr&#233;sident des Etats-Unis). Il contribuera &#224;
former du personnel soignant dans tous les domaines li&#233;s &#224; la pr&#233;vention et au
traitement du paludisme, avec une attention toute particuli&#232;re aux personnes les
plus vuln&#233;rables : les femmes enceintes et les enfants en bas &#226;ge. ExxonMobil a
contribu&#233; &#224; hauteur de quatre millions de dollars aux activit&#233;s de la
President's Malaria Initiative en Angola, depuis 2005, date de son lancement.

&#171; La Journ&#233;e mondiale contre le paludisme permet de faire prendre conscience des
ravages que cause cette maladie que l'on peut pourtant &#233;viter, et de s'engager
pour la combattre &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Rex W. Tillerson, le PDG du groupe ExxonMobil. &#171;
Je suis tr&#232;s heureux de notre participation &#224; cette Journ&#233;e et d'avoir pu
annoncer l'augmentation de notre engagement financier &#224; la President's Malaria
Initiative qui est un programme essentiel pour aider &#224; r&#233;duire le nombre de
victimes du paludisme. &#187; 

&#171; Chez ExxonMobil, nous sommes directement confront&#233;s &#224; l'impact d&#233;vastateur du
paludisme en Afrique, o&#249; se concentrent 90 % des cas recens&#233;s dans le monde, et
o&#249; cette maladie est la premi&#232;re cause de mortalit&#233; des enfants en bas &#226;ge.
C'est pourquoi nous nous engageons dans le combat contre le paludisme &#224; la
distribution aux communaut&#233;s qui en ont besoin de moustiquaires impr&#233;gn&#233;es
d`insecticide. &#187; 

&#171; Malgr&#233; l'environnement &#233;conomique difficile, il est important que les
entreprises adoptent une position &#224; long terme en r&#233;alisant des investissements
dans les communaut&#233;s. Dans le cadre de la semaine contre le paludisme, nous
esp&#233;rons que d'autres se joindront &#224; cette cause et soutiendront la Campagne de
souscription contre le paludisme, qui vise &#224; r&#233;colter 100 millions de dollars.
ExxonMobil s`est engag&#233; &#224; verser 10 millions de dollars pour aider &#224; lancer
cette campagne. &#187; 

Dans le cadre des efforts d'ExxonMobil pour renforcer la prise de conscience des
d&#233;cideurs politiques, des employ&#233;s participeront aux conf&#233;rences qui se
tiendront aux Etats-Unis et en Europe afin de mieux faire comprendre les
probl&#232;mes que pose le paludisme, de trouver des solutions pour l'&#233;viter et le
traiter et ainsi de ne plus mourir de cette maladie. Le directeur Sant&#233; Mondiale
d'ExxonMobil, le docteur Steven Phillips, interviendra au Sommet One World
Against Malaria &#224; Washington demain. 

Le docteur Phillips pr&#233;sentera certaines initiatives internationales d&#233;velopp&#233;es
pour lutter contre le paludisme, et en particulier l'effort sans pr&#233;c&#233;dent en
Afrique du Sud pour &#233;liminer ce fl&#233;au. Cette Strat&#233;gie pour l'Eradication du
Paludisme, dont le but est d'&#233;tendre les initiatives sant&#233; transfrontali&#232;res des
pays africains contre le paludisme, est mise en &#339;uvre par le Global Health Group
de l'Universit&#233; de Californie qui b&#233;n&#233;ficie du support du soutien financier
d`ExxonMobil d'un montant de 3,5 millions de dollars. 

Dans le cadre de la journ&#233;e mondiale contre le paludisme, ExxonMobil a &#233;galement
lanc&#233; un nouveau site Internet consacr&#233; &#224; cette maladie. Ce site pr&#233;sente les

transmissible &#224; l'homme par une piq&#251;re de moustique. Cette maladie entra&#238;ne
entre 1 million et 3 millions de d&#233;c&#232;s chaque ann&#233;e. 3 000 enfants en meurent
chaque jour. Il reste l'une des principales maladies infectieuses mortelles au
monde. La majorit&#233; de ses victimes sont des enfants de moins de cinq ans et des
femmes enceintes. 

ExxonMobil et le paludisme

ExxonMobil ne ha sostenuto le attivit&#224; in Angola con un contributo di 4 milioni

"Alla ExxonMobil conosciamo bene l`impatto devastante che la malaria sta avendo
in Africa, dove si riportano il 90 percento dei casi di malattia a livello
mondiale e dove la malaria rappresenta la causa principale di morte tra i
bambini. Per questo siamo impegnati attivamente in questa battaglia attraverso
varie iniziative che vanno dallo sviluppo di nuovi farmaci alla distribuzione di
zanzariere pre-trattate laddove ce ne sia pi&#249; bisogno." 

"Nonostante il difficile momento economico, &#232; importante che il mondo delle
imprese persegua una strategia di lungo termine per gli investimenti di natura
sociale. Ci auguriamo che, grazie a questa occasione di particolare attenzione
sul problema della malaria, altri si uniscano a noi nel sostenere la Malaria

meridionale le iniziative sanitarie per sconfiggere la malattia, &#232; sviluppata
dal Global Health Group della University of California, San Francisco - con il
sostegno della ExxonMobil attraverso un contributo di 3.5 milioni di dollari. 

Nell`ambito delle iniziative per la Giornata Mondiale contro la Malaria, la
ExxonMobil ha lanciato un nuovo sito internet sulla malaria,che raccoglie
informazioni sull`impegno della societ&#224; nello sconfiggere la malattia insieme a
interventi di esperti sul ruolo le imprese possono svolgere nel combatterla.
Inoltre, la ExxonMobil ha lanciato anche una campagna di sensibilizzazione per
sottolineare l`importanza di questo problema e alcune delle soluzioni oggi
adottate. 

La malaria &#232; una malattia che mette a rischio la vita degli individui, causata
da un parassita e trasmessa attraverso la puntura di una zanzara. Rimane oggi
una delle principali malattie infettive del pianeta che causa la morte da 1 a 3
milioni di persone all`anno e di 3.000 bambini al giorno. La maggior parte delle
vittime sono bimbi sotto i cinque anni e donne in gravidanza. 

L`impegno della ExxonMobil contro la Malaria

La Exxon Mobil Corporation e la ExxonMobil Foundation sono impegnate in un
insieme di iniziative filantropiche per migliorare l`istruzione e la salute
nelle comunit&#224; in cui la ExxonMobil svolge le proprie attivit&#224;. A livello
globale, la ExxonMobil eroga fondi per migliorare l`istruzione primaria,

a oggi, ha stanziato 130 milioni di dollari per programmi in favore delle
popolazioni in Africa, inclusi 55 milioni destinati a programmi per la lotta
alla malaria.

Dichiarazione di Abuja sul progetto Roll Back Malaria in Africa, il cui
obiettivo &#232; quello di dimezzare, entro il 2010, l`incidenza e le vittime della
malattia. Da allora, la ExxonMobil ha sviluppato in loco partnership
pubblico-private per combattere la malaria nelle comunit&#224; locali, ottenere
progressi nelle cure sanitarie e nella ricerca sui vaccini, promuovere la
conoscenza e il sostegno internazionale e contribuire allo sforzo contro la
malaria in pi&#249; di 20 paesi Africani.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
In commemoration of World Malaria Day on April 25, ExxonMobil announced today a
donation of an additional $1 million to help USAID in its ongoing efforts to
fight malaria in Angola. The new funding brings ExxonMobil`s commitment to
organizations engaged in important community and social development projects in
Africa to more than $150 million, which includes $55 million committed to
programs to fight malaria through the company`s Africa Health Initiative. 

The grant will support the President`s Malaria Initiative and will help train
health-care workers in all aspects of malaria prevention and treatment, with a
particular focus on the most vulnerable groups - pregnant women and young
children. Since the initiation of the President`s Malaria Initiative in 2005
ExxonMobil has contributed $4 million to support its activities in Angola. 

"World Malaria Day provides an opportunity to increase awareness and direct
engagement in fighting the devastating consequences of this preventable
disease," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of
ExxonMobil. "I am very pleased that we have been able to mark this day by
announcing our increased funding commitment for the President`s Malaria
Initiative, which is a critical program in helping to reduce the toll of
malaria. 

"At ExxonMobil we know first hand the devastating impact that malaria is having
in Africa, which suffers over 90 percent of global malaria cases and where it is
the number one killer of young children. That is why we are committed to the
fight and doing everything from helping to develop new drugs to distributing
insecticide-treated nets to places where they are desperately needed. 

"Despite the more difficult economic environment it is important that business
takes a long term view with its community investments. With malaria in focus
this week, we hope others will join us in supporting the Malaria Capital
Campaign, which aims to raise $100 million to continue the fight against
malaria. ExxonMobil has committed $10 million to help start the campaign." 

As a part of ExxonMobil`s ongoing goal to raise awareness about malaria with
policy makers, employees will participate in important malaria dialogues in the
US and Europe to improve understanding of the disease and find solutions on how
to prevent and ultimately end deaths from malaria. ExxonMobil`s Medical Director
for Global Health Issues, Dr. Steven Phillips, will address the One World
Against Malaria Summit in Washington D.C. tomorrow. 

Dr. Phillips will discuss some of the important international initiatives being
developed to address malaria including an unprecedented malaria elimination
effort in southern Africa. The Malaria Elimination Strategy, which seeks to
expand cross border health initiatives between southern African countries to
help fight malaria, is being pursued by the Global Health Group at the
University of California San Francisco with support and funding from a $3.5
million grant from ExxonMobil. 

As part of the World Malaria Day commemoration, ExxonMobil has also launched a
new malaria web site, which contains information about the company`s efforts to
stop malaria, as well as global experts talking about the role business can play
in combating the disease. In addition ExxonMobil has launched a global
advertising campaign to highlight the problem and some of the solutions we have
put in place today. 

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by a parasite and transmitted to
humans by the bite of a mosquito. With between 1 million and 3 million deaths
annually and 3,000 children deaths daily, it remains one of the globe's leading
infectious killers. The majority of its victims are children under the age of
five and pregnant women. 

ExxonMobil and Malaria

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and ExxonMobil Foundation engage in a range
of philanthropic activities that advance education, health and science in the
communities where ExxonMobil has significant operations. Globally, ExxonMobil
provides funding to improve basic education and combat malaria and other
infectious diseases in developing countries. ExxonMobil is the largest
non-pharmaceutical corporate donor to malaria research and development efforts
and since 2000 has committed $150 million to Africa community outreach programs,
including $55 million on programs to fight malaria. The company established its
Africa Health Initiative in 2000 in support of the Abuja Declaration on Roll
Back Malaria in Africa and its goal to halve malaria deaths by 2010. Since then,
ExxonMobil has developed on-the-ground public-private partnerships to fight
malaria at the community level, progress treatment and vaccine research and
raise awareness and international support, and contributes to anti-malaria
efforts in more than 20 African countries.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


The board of directors of Pfizer Inc today declared a 16-cent second-quarter
2009 dividend on the company`s common stock, payable June 2, 2009, to
shareholders of record at the close of business on May 8, 2009. 

The second-quarter 2009 cash dividend will be the 282nd consecutive quarterly
dividend paid by Pfizer. 

At the company`s Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Jeffrey B. Kindler said Pfizer has streamlined operations, reduced
bureaucracy, set clear expectations and increased accountability, which has
better positioned the company to combine with Wyeth. 

"The combination of Pfizer and Wyeth will allow us to advance each and every one
of the key growth strategies that will drive our success in the years ahead,"
Mr. Kindler said. "Pfizer plus Wyeth will help us extend our leadership in
global healthcare in both developed and developing markets. This includes
leadership in primary and specialty care; in vaccines, biologics and small
molecules; and in animal health, consumer health and nutritionals." 

At the meeting, the company`s 14 directors were re-elected to one-year terms. In
addition, shareholders ratified the selection of KPMG LLP as Pfizer`s
independent registered public accounting firm for the 2009 fiscal year and voted
in support of a revised company stock plan. 

In other voting, preliminary results indicate that shareholders approved
non-binding proposals requesting that they be provided the opportunity at each
annual shareholder meeting to vote on an advisory resolution about executive
compensation and that holders of 10% of common stock be provided the ability to
call a special shareholder meeting. In 2008, Pfizer amended its bylaws to give
holders of 25% or more of common stock the right to call a special meeting. 

Two other shareholder resolutions did not receive majority approval. 

The final results are subject to verification by the independent election
inspectors, which should not significantly change the preliminary results. The
final results will appear in Pfizer`s next 10-Q report.

everyone, and welcome the opportunity to meet new friends and associates in my
role with the CFA Institute", quoted from his informal announcement on last
Friday.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Lobbyists Misleading USTR Over Ecuador Environmental Case
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
A team of prominent Chevron lobbyists are again misleading the U.S. Trade
Representative as part of a campaign to retaliate against Ecuador`s government
for refusing to interfere in a private environmental lawsuit against the oil
giant, representatives of Amazonian communities say. 

The controversy concerns a petition recently submitted by Chevron to Ron Kirk,
the newly confirmed USTR ambassador and former Mayor of Dallas, asking that
trade preferences for Ecuador be canceled because Ecuador`s President has not
quashed a private class action lawsuit brought by 30,000 rainforest residents in
Ecuador`s courts. The 15-year-old case, which was transferred to Ecuador from
U.S. federal court in 2002 at Chevron`s request, is expected to conclude this
year with a multi-billion dollar judgment against the oil giant. 

A loss of trade preferences for Ecuador would cost the country 350,000 jobs in a
country with a total population of 12 million, according to Ecuador`s
government. 

A court-appointed team of technical experts in Ecuador recently assessed damages
against Chevron at up to $27 billion, a possible record for an environmental
case. Chevron is accused of dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into
Amazon waterways over a 26-year period, leading to a dramatic increase in
cancer, decimating indigenous groups, and despoiling an area of ecosystem the
size of Rhode Island. 

Chevron`s USTR lobbying campaign is "based on misrepresentations, is an affront
to the rule of law in two countries, and is a continuation of a decades-long
abuse of the people of Ecuador," said a letter sent to Kirk by Ecuadorian
advocates for dozens of communities and indigenous groups. Similar campaigns by
Chevron to cancel Ecuador`s trade preferences failed in 2006 and 2008. See
attachment for a copy of the letter. 

The Amazonian representatives asked Kirk to refer Chevron`s petition to
authorities to determine if the company is making false statements to the
executive branch in violation of federal law. 

"Chevron is asking the U.S. government to pressure Ecuador`s President to
interfere with his country`s independent judiciary to quash a private legal
case," said Steven Donziger, an American legal advisor to the plaintiffs. "Such
action would violate Ecuador`s Constitution and result in an impeachable offense
for Ecuador`s President. 

"This is a classic example of a large oil company trying to manipulate the U.S.
government`s foreign policy to protect its own ill-gotten profits in Ecuador,"
said Donziger. 

The letter pointed to two primary "misrepresentations" by Chevron to the USTR:

* Chevron claims it was released by Ecuador`s government in 1995 from any
clean-up obligations. In reality, the express language of the "release" does not
cover claims brought by private individuals against the company. No court in the
U.S. or Ecuador has ever accepted Chevron`s claims about the scope of the
release. 
* Chevron claims it "remediated" the environmental damage in the mid-1990s
despite the fact a team of court experts found the remediation was at best
ineffective, and at worst a fraud. Two Chevron lawyers and seven former
Ecuadorian government officials are under indictment for lying about the
remediation results.

"Chevron`s submission to the USTR is a key component of its lobbying and
political campaign to intervene in and undermine, a pending legal matter in
Ecuador," according to the letter sent to Kirk. "We ask your office to reject
this effort by Chevron as an inappropriate attack on the rule of law." 

Chevron spent $6.8 million lobbying in Washington in the first quarter of the
year - more than any other company in the country other than Exxon. 

Chevron`s high-powered lobbyists on the issue include Mack McLarty, former chief
of staff to President Bill Clinton; former Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott;
Wayne Berman, who served as the national finance chair for Sen. John McCain`s
presidential campaign; and several members of the company`s government relations
staff in Washington. 

Several months ago, a Chevron lobbyist created a major stir by being quoted
anonymously in Newsweek as saying, in regard to Chevron`s potential
environmental liability in Ecuador: "We can`t let little countries screw around
with big companies like this - companies that have made big investments around
the world."

&lt;p&gt;Security Industry Veteran to Offer Insights on Achieving Compliance through
Critical Privileged Account Management and Security Best Practices in MS System
Center Environments
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Lieberman Software today announced that President and CEO Philip Lieberman will
be a speaker at The Microsoft Management Summit (MMS). 

Held at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, April 27 through May 1, MMS is the
premier event of the year for IT professionals seeking deep technical
information and training on the latest IT management solutions from Microsoft,
partners, and industry experts. 

Lieberman will speak at 8:30 am, Thursday, April 30 as part of the Partner
Technical Showcase, on "Securely Managing Local Administrator and Cross-Platform
Root Accounts in Microsoft System Center for GRC Compliance." 

"The reality and the root of this problem is that most organizations have no
real control over sensitive privileged accounts," Lieberman said. "This is a
major issue when you consider that privileged user accounts are found in
virtually every application, database and infrastructure device throughout the
enterprise and are the most powerful accounts within an IT enterprise, posing
the greatest security and regulatory compliance risks." 

Many organizations set their systems` local privileged accounts to the same name
and password, or never change these critical accounts. In an environment of
internal and external threats, this decision can lead to the total compromise of
security if even one privileged password is decrypted. 

"Even experienced IT professionals may be surprised to learn how hackers crack
the local administrator account and gain peer-level access to every system. I'll
be showing this and will provide strategies and tactics on how to stop this
problem and securely manage these critical accounts from within the Microsoft
System Center environment," Lieberman added. 

At MMS, Lieberman Software will also announce new Microsoft System Center
integration capabilities in its Enterprise Random Password Manager and Random
Password Manager solutions. Lieberman Software will be exhibiting in booth 222.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks featured in this
week`s analysis include BB (NYSE: BBT), Citigroup (NYSE: C), Comerica (NYSE:
CMA), JPMorgan &amp; Chase (NYSE: JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Wells Fargo
(NYSE: WFC). 

Zacks Industry Rank Analysis is written by Charles Rotblut, CFA, Senior Market
Analyst for Zacks.com. 

This week: What Are Bank Stocks Really Worth?

Bank and "investment firm" earnings have been a mixed bag. Through yesterday
evening, 10 S 500 banking companies topped estimates and 7 missed. 

This morning, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) increased the number of disappointments
to 8, joining other firms such as Comerica (NYSE: CMA). 

To be fair, Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) beat by 18 cents, so we could change the
score to 11 beats and 8 misses. Even with the changes, it is still a mixed bag. 

Bank stocks had rallied over the past several weeks, due in part to speculation
that first-quarter earnings would be better than feared. Several banks
preannounced that they were enjoying good first quarters. Thanks to the Treasury
and the Fed, money was cheap. Changes to FASB rules allowed banks to adjust
their toxic assets. Not to mention that lenders were very choosy about their
borrowers. 

Yet, the realities of the current economic crisis and the mistakes of the past
continue to haunt the financial sector. And brokerage analysts remain fearful
about further quarters of poor earnings. 

Even Positive Surprises Are Not Leading To Higher Forecasts

Even for firms that topped expectations, changes to full-year forecast are not
optimistic. Though there have been some positive revisions, the majority of
covering analysts are keeping their forecasts unchanged or are cutting them
further. 

Consider these examples:

* BB (NYSE: BBT) earned 48 cents per share, 15 cents better than expected.
Since the positive surprise, the full-year consensus earnings estimate has
fallen 3 cents to $1.47 per share. Though 7 analysts have raised their
projections, 6 others cut. Nearly half of the covering analysts have left their
projections unchanged. 
* Citigroup (NYSE: C) generated a better-than-feared loss of 18 cents, 6 cents
narrower than the consensus estimate. Just 2 of the 15 covering analysts raised
their full-year forecasts during the last 7 days, whereas 4 lowered their
projections. (Eight others have not changed their forecasts.) The average
full-year projection now calls for a loss of 40 cents, 3 cents wider than a week
ago. 
* JPMorgan &amp; Chase (NYSE: JPM) beat by 9 cents with adjusted profits of 40 cents
per share. Despite the positive news, the full-year consensus earnings estimate
has since fallen by 2 cents to $1.51 per share. Though 5 analysts did raise
their projections, 4 others cut. More than half have not made any changes.

In all 3 cases, the positive earnings surprise did not result in higher earnings
estimates. This suggests that brokerage analysts do not view last quarter's
positive trends as sustainable. 

There is a reason for this. Even with the new FASB rules, the amount of
write-downs will increase. The ending of the temporary moratorium on
foreclosures, rising credit card default rates and higher unemployment will all
have a negative impact on earnings. Further, the ability to borrow at ultra low
interest rates will end at some point. 

To be fair, it is very possible that some of the covering analysts have yet to
adjust their full-year forecasts in response to the first-quarter earnings.
Nearly all of the bank results have been released within the past 7 days. 

On the other hand, there has been a sustained trend of negative estimate
revisions for the financial sector that has lasted more than a year. Given the
poor economic backdrop, the ongoing risk that an acceptable solution to the
toxic asset problem won't be found, the threat of further share dilution, and
the government's ever-evolving bailout plan, nobody really knows what banks will
earn this year. 

Nobody Knows What Banks Stocks Are Really Worth

The lack of a clear sense of what earnings will be combined with questionable
balance sheets have made it impossible to assign a value to banking stocks.
Brokerage analysts simply have no idea what a proper price target should be and
neither does anybody else. 

The fact that there isn't a clear exit plan out of TARP only adds to the
uncertainty.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, April 23 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola (KO.N) is holding
informal talks with China Huiyuan Juice (1886.HK) to weigh
partnership options after China blocked its takeover of the
company last month, a source with direct knowledge of the
situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In March, China rejected Coca-Cola's planned $2.4 billion
acquisition of Huiyuan, saying the deal would have been bad for
competition. The acquisition by Coca-Cola would have been the
largest-ever buyout of a Chinese company by a foreign rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After the deal collapsed there have been discussions in
Beijing," the source said. The source declined to be named due to
the sensitive nature of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola is in negotiations with Huiyuan that could include
taking a minority stake in the Chinese juice maker's assets, a
Wall Street Journal report citing unidentified sources said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Coca-Cola spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment when
contacted by Reuters. A Huiyuan spokeswoman in Beijing also
declined comment.

&lt;p&gt; * Firm will seek to raise $500 mln-$750 mln&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says shipping "in worse shape than real estate"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Strategy targets institutions, high net worth individuals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds further details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Claire Milhench&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, April 23 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Asset Management is
launching a maritime strategy this year which will invest in the
distressed shipping market, a senior manager at the firm said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The shipping business is in worse shape than real estate,"
said Joe Azelby, chief executive officer of JP Morgan Asset
Management's $50 billion global real assets group. "In some
cases ship values are down between 60 and 80 percent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Azelby -- who joined the firm after a brief period playing
professional American football for the Buffalo Bills -- told
Reuters the aim is to acquire vessels from distressed sellers,
with operating partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ship values are effectively a derivative of the freight
income, so prices have tumbled as the global recession has
intensified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shipping industry uses financing extensively, and Azelby
said that a handful of banks have tended to dominate. "But many
of these banks are now de facto government-owned in some shape
or form."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This means shipping owners are in need of third party
funding at a time when pricing is at an historic low. Azelby
sees continued downward pressure on pricing over the next 12 to
24 months and an opportunity to capitalise on this gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan is currently in fund-raising mode for the
strategy, seeking some $500 million to $750 million initially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPSIDE POTENTIAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Azelby expects to attract interest primarily from
institutions, and high net worth individuals, who might be
attracted due to the tax characteristics and good cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is also a lot of optionality in the pricing of
vessels, so if the economy comes back, ship prices can move
fairly quickly," Azelby explained. "If you can get in at a
relatively low price and put the vessels on short term charters,
there is potential for a lot of upside."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, this would also depend on the length of the
recession, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategy will focus on the three main types of vessel --
dry bulk carriers, oil tankers and container ships. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dry bulk carriers transport raw materials such as iron ore,
coal, grains, cocoa and timber, and so have been hit hard by the
global decline in world trade. Container ships, which carry
finished goods, have also been laid up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategy will be led by Andy Dacy who headed the
shipping practice at JP Morgan's investment bank. "He has an
unmatched knowledge of that industry," said Azelby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The aim is to build a team of between six and eight people,
with some shared resources on the marketing and financial side.

&lt;p&gt;Further M Deals within the Year Predicts URCH Publishing
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer`s merger with Wyeth will bring significant change to the pharmaceutical
industry and may result in more large deals before the end of the year, suggests
a new report. "Mergers and Acquisitions in the Pharmaceuticals Sector, 2009 -
Critical success factors for competing in a consolidating market" from URCH
Publishing, says that a number of major pharmaceutical players will follow in
the footsteps of Pfizer and enter into significant M transactions. 

"2009 is set to redefine the structure and dynamics of the pharmaceutical
industry in a way not seen since the year 2000, says Steve Seget, the report`s
author. 

The 111 page report study that it is likely that the `mega-M` wave started by
the three deals agreed in the first quarter of 2009 is not yet finished, with
possibly three more mega-deals to go, which will see movement in the top ten
pharmaceutical company list. 

"The two most likely deals appear to be the acquisitions of Bristol-Myers Squibb
and Bayer," commented Mr Seget. "Currently the best placed acquisitors appear to
be Sanofi-Aventis and Novartis, but we should not rule out Johnson &amp; Johnson or
GlaxoSmithKline, if its acquisition of Allergan does not come to fruition." 

The companies under most pressure to enter into a significant M are Eli Lilly,
GlaxoSmithKline and Takeda. Each company must actively review transformational
M opportunities in order to satisfy investors and continue to compete with
those companies who have already merged 

Significant pharmaceutical industry consolidation will lead to a fundamental
shift in the market dynamics across all major product categories. Key challenges
for all companies include managing the disruption caused by consolidation and
exploiting economies of scope and scale. Competing in a consolidated world will
require a balance between delivering scale and diversification while generating
innovation and flexibility, notes the report.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical is demonstrating its continued leadership in hydrocarbon
fluids by applying proprietary catalyst hydrogenation technology to introduce
its Ultra-Low Aromatic (ULA) product family. 

The technology enables the production of ULA fluids that comply with the most
stringent environmental and regulatory requirements. This capability ensures
that ExxonMobil customers will be able to access an ultra-low aromatic solution
for their markets as the need arises. 

"ExxonMobil Chemical is dedicated to the development of products that meet the
highest performance standards and comply with applicable regulations," said
Xavier Milcent, Global Hydrocarbon Fluids Marketing Manager, ExxonMobil
Chemical. "This novel family of ULA fluids exemplifies this by providing
customers an environmentally and cost effective solution." 

New products, established excellence

The first products of the ULA fluid family are Escaid 120 ULA for oil drilling
applications and Exxsol D100 ULA for water treatment. They are pre-registered
under REACH EU regulation. 

ExxonMobil Chemical has been supplying the oil exploration industry with Escaid
drilling fluids for decades. Long regarded as benchmark base oils for drilling
fluids around the world, the global Escaid fluid portfolio is designed for the
most demanding working temperature and pressure conditions. Escaid 120 ULA fluid
adds the advantage of ultra-low aromatic content meeting market needs where
preferred by users or by regulatory bodies. 

Exxsol D100 fluid has a long history in water treatment applications. With the
introduction of Exxsol D100 ULA fluid, users will benefit from similar
performance capabilities with the added advantages of ultra-low aromatic
content. 

Looking forward, the Ultra-Low Aromatic product family will be progressively
extended and made available to customers in all sectors of industry. 

Solutions for sustainable growth

This new proprietary hydrogenation process also demonstrates ExxonMobil`s
commitment to developing and deploying technology to help meet or exceed
increasingly stringent regulatory and environmental requirements. 

"Through the development of products such as ultra-low aromatic fluids,
ExxonMobil Chemical strengthens its commitment to the principles of sustainable
development that balance economic growth, social development and environmental
concerns," said Elissa Sterry, Vice President, Intermediates, ExxonMobil
Chemical. "We take our responsibilities under these principles very seriously
while working to meet rising global demand for energy resources."

&lt;p&gt;"I have said many times that we no longer are interested in acquiring Yahoo, but we'd see the potential to create real value by partnering with Yahoo," he said at an industry event in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have said many times that when the time is right I'm sure we will have such discussions and I've said many times I'm not going to tell you when the time is right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology blog All Things Digital reported this month the chief executives of Microsoft and Yahoo had met to discuss potential partnerships between the companies' Internet search and advertising operations. At the time, both companies declined to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Ballmer said Microsoft was not interested in buying a hardware company following Oracle Corp's proposed takeover of Sun Microsystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, speaking a day after Microsoft said third-quarter profit fell 32 percent, said integrating those two companies would be "very tough" given "a lot of overlap."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Dan Lalor)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New tracks for Smarter Planet campaign to air Thursday, April 9, 2009 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JSM Music, one of the country`s largest commercial music production company`s,
has created four dynamic, original tracks for IBM`s continuing "Smarter Planet"
campaign. Working with Ogilvy Worldwide, the new 30 second spots are entitled
"SmarterHealthcare," "SmarterCities," "SmarterConnections," and
"SmarterIntelligence." 

Capturing the forward momentum and excitement of IBM technology, the first two
spots, "Smarter Cities" and "Smarter Healthcare," aired Saturday, April 4,
during the NCAA Final Four tournament. 

"Smarter Connections" and "Smarter Intelligence" will go into rotation beginning
on Thursday, April 9, during the US Masters Golf Tournament. 

The four new spots will go into rotation with the 5 existing commercials of the
campaign, which began running in January during the NFL Play-offs. 

The "Healthcare" spot stands out for its unique combination of influences and
sensibility. Combining a classical string quartet, the spot is infused with a
rock n roll energy, giving it a sound wholly its own. 

Says its composer, John "Scrapper" Sneider, "We wanted to give the spot a
modern, quirky feel while still keeping it elegant. It had to have a strong
momentum to suggest the forward thinking of the technology. I think we achieved
that." 

"Connections" and "Intelligence" will go into rotation on Thursday, April 9,
during the US Masters. JSM composer Jordan Leib says, "With these two pieces we
wanted to convey a feeling of frenetic optimism. We wanted to capture the pace
of modern technology with the excitement consumers with each new advance." 

Says KarlWestman, Executive Music Producer for Ogilvy: "We couldn`t be more
pleased. These new tracks are exceptional and JSM worked tirelessly to create
them." 

With New York City`s largest and most comprehensive recording facility-20,000
square feet of studio space, encompassing 15 state-of-the-art studios-JSM can
A, write, compose, arrange, produce, record, master and distribute music
products, all under its own roof. 

JSM have been featured in Billboard, Creativity, New York Post, Adweek,
Advertising Age, New York Times, Brandweek and Crain`s New York Business, with
Joel Simon being included in their prestigious "40 Under 40" issue. Accumulating
over 1000 gold and platinum records, Grammys and Emmys, Over JSM has won every
advertising award in the industry..

&lt;p&gt; * Coke exec says $250 mln investment announced on track&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Have already put $1 billion in India ops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * India led Coke's Q1 international sales volume growth
 (Adds detail, quotes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Manoj Kumar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW DELHI, April 24 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) sees
India as one of its key markets and is committed to its planned
investment of $250 million announced last year, a company
official said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola and its smaller rival PepsiCo (PEP.N) are
increasingly relying on developing markets like China, India
and Russia for growth, as North American sales of traditional
soft drinks have slowed amid a growing consumer emphasis on
health and an economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola has so far invested $1 billion in its Indian
operations and last year announced a further $250 million to be
invested over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "India is a strategic market. We have our investment plans,
which are intact," Atul Singh, president for Coca-Cola's India
and Southwest Asia business unit, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All our investments are on track. We have added more
bottle lines, we have added trucks, we have added cold
equipment," he said. "We continue to invest in all the brands
that we market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola, which gets bulk of its revenue from abroad, saw
its India sales volume rise 31 percent in its fiscal first
quarter to April 3, leading its international sales growth,
while China grew 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our investments have been in infrastructure, people, cold
drink equipment, and behind brands... we have trained lot of
people, retailers, distributors, salesmen," Singh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whatever will be needed, we will do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola sells drinks including Diet Coke, Thums Up,
Fanta, Limca, and Georgia in India, the world's second-most
populous country, and growth in the market is important for the
firm at a time when it is facing roadblocks in its China
expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, China blocked Coca-Cola's planned $2.4 billion
takeover of the country's top juice maker, Huiyuan (1886.HK),
saying the deal would have been bad for competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PepsiCo has also invested $700 million in India and Chief
Executive Indra Nooyi said last September $500 million more
would be spent over three years to beef up operations with an
aim to triple revenue from the country.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects 14th paragraph to show GSAM sees investment
opportunities with private equity firms under refinancing
pressure)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * GSAM may put $1 bln-$1.5 bln in distressed assets in 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Leveraged loans could account for about a third&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Plans to tap private equity for co-investment deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds comment on private equity opportunities, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Claire Milhench&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, April 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Asset Management
may commit up to $1.5 billion for distressed investments this
year and use about a third of that sum to boost its exposure to
leveraged loans, an executive at the firm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charles Baillie, the co-head of alternative investments and
manager selection at GSAM, said he sees opportunities to make
private equity-like returns of some 20 percent by buying and
holding leveraged loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At 65-70 cents in the dollar we think the leveraged loan
market has tested the bottom," Baillie told Reuters. "We are
looking at ways we can increase our exposure, especially on an
unlevered basis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baillie did not give details of targets, but the boom years
of 2005 to 2007 created a class of highly leveraged loans (LBOs)
backing private equity buyouts, many of which are now being
restructured and are catching the eye of distressed investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The average price of the loans has rallied in the European
secondary trading market to 68.2 percent of face value from 59.8
percent in early 2009, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data,
bringing gains of about 8.5 percent for those brave enough to
have invested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's impossible to time the bottom so we need to start
putting money in slowly," Baillie said. Many leveraged loan
investors suffered when they piled in after prices fell to 94 to
95 cents in the dollar in the early days of the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They thought valuations would rebound quickly, but they
continued to fall -- in hindsight they made a big mistake," he
said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He believes the time is now right to go into the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Frequently we know the company well thanks to an indirect
equity exposure. When we believe that we can achieve equity-like
returns investing in the most senior part of the capital
structure, leveraged loans are the ideal entry point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FULCRUM SECURITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this economic cycle he believes the fulcrum security -
the asset that offers investors the best chance of gaining
control of a company entering bankruptcy - will be bank debt
rather than high-yield debt, as has been the case in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is because leveraged loan and bank debt issuance became
such a large portion of many companies' capital structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baillie said his team was seeing some interesting
opportunities in the energy, healthcare and industrials sectors.
 He was less keen on financials, because of continuing
uncertainty, and consumer cyclicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GSAM has a potential $1 billion to $1.5 billion to commit to
investment in distressed assets across the hedge fund and
private equity space this year, and expects firms worried about
refinancing in 2010 or 2011 to look to equitise some portion of
their investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A number of private equity firms are thinking about how
they will refinance some of their debt because they need to
bring their leverage multiples down,"Baillie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was looking at some investments in this area and
also saw joint opportunities in cases where the investment was
performing well but the private equity firm lacked the ability
to inject fresh capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are seeing about five of those a week, and that will
probably increase," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because banks are reluctant to lend money to private equity
firms, Goldman can negotiate good terms, and Baillie's team had
already done private equity co-investment deals in the energy
services space, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of Dec. 31, 2008, GSAM had 497 billion euros ($654.6
billion) of assets under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.7592 Euro)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tessa Walsh. Editing by Joel Dimmock

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) malaria infects approximately
250 million people per year throughout the developing world and results in a
grave loss of life of at least 880,000 per year. The region most severely
afflicted is Sub-Saharan Africa, but the disease is also present in Asia, Latin
America, the Middle East and some parts of Europe. 

Pfizer recognizes the important role a pharmaceutical company plays in the
global fight against malaria. In conjunction with World Malaria Day - "Counting
Malaria Out" - on April 25, Pfizer commemorates the work being done not only by
governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), but by its own employees
who have worked diligently over the last 25 years to combat the disease and
develop medicines for more effective treatment. Pfizer`s strategy is closely
aligned with the interventions in the WHOs Global Malaria Action Plan as well as
to the UN Millennium Development Goals. 

Pfizer`s existing portfolio of malaria-fighting treatments includes:
Camoquin-Plus (Artesunate-Amodiaquine) for the treatment of uncomplicated
malaria and Metakelfin, which covers treatment for pregnant women. "Pfizer is
uniquely positioned on the African continent with a solid medical and commercial
organization, including a manufacturing and distribution center in Dakar,
Senegal, which produces Camoquin-Plus," said Guy Lallemand, regional president
for Africa &amp; Middle East in Pfizer`s Emerging Markets Business Unit. "The Dakar
plant plays a vital role in the malaria treatment chain and the distribution
center ensures the supply of all Pfizer products registered and sold in West
Africa." 

"Although there have been significant advancements over the last five years,
including new money, medicines and increased energy towards fighting the
disease, critical gaps still exist in treating specific population groups and
delivering medicines," stated Dr. Sam Azoulay, senior vice president, Medical &amp;
Development in Pfizer`s Emerging Markets Business Unit. "Pfizer has created a
new malaria platform to address these gaps through its portfolio of products,
scientific efforts, and licensing activities. We expect this redefined focus to
advance our ongoing efforts and to support the global fight against malaria." 

As reported in December 2008, Pfizer Inc entered into a license and supply
agreement with sigma-tau, a privately owned Italian pharmaceutical company, to
market Eurartesim (dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine), a novel fixed dose
once-daily artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), in Africa. This Phase
III product candidate aims to treat uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in
adults and children, while reducing the potential for re-infection. The product
candidate, developed jointly by Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) and
sigma-tau, is expected be filed for registration with the European Medicines
Agency (EMEA) by the third quarter of 2009, with subsequent filing in Africa. 

This week Pfizer announced its collaboration with MMV to advance international
research efforts in the fight against malaria. MMV will have access to the
Pfizer library of chemical entities to screen approximately 200,000 compounds
that have the potential to be developed into new treatments against P.
falciparum, the parasite that causes acute malaria, including multi-drug
resistant strains. "This new partnership brings our valuable library of novel
chemical entities to the disease experts at the MMV, with the potential to
create exciting new starting points for novel discovery programs against this
significant health challenge," said Dr. Manos Perros, chief scientific officer,
Antivirals, Pfizer Global Research &amp; Development. "Our partnership with MMV
expands on the progress we have made in this area through our collaborations
with other NGOs and will further aid in the search for drugs with the potential
to treat malaria." 

Pfizer also has an ongoing azithromycin/chloroquine (AZ/CQ) clinical program.
Pfizer has identified that the greatest need for this combination is for
intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women (IPTp) in sub-Saharan
Africa. Malaria is the most common cause of preventable infant and maternal
deaths in Africa with some 200,000 and 10,000 deaths per year, respectively,
according to the WHO. In fact, approximately 36 million pregnant women are at
risk in endemic areas in Africa alone. Pfizer expects to work with several
research institutes to move the AZ/CQ clinical program forward. 

Pfizer Corporate Responsibility efforts support the fight against malaria
through its "Mobilize Against Malaria" initiative and expert contributions by
employees who are part of the Global Health Fellows program. "Mobilize Against
Malaria is a five-year, three-country initiative designed to close the gap on
malaria treatment and education in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, with a commitment
of USD 15 million," according to Caroline Roan, vice president of Corporate
Responsibility. "Pfizer is working with leading NGOs on the ground and the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the targeted countries to
improve access to prompt and effective treatment by improving malaria symptom
recognition, treatment and referral through robust training, education and
awareness efforts." 

Pfizer is a partner in the fight against this ravaging disease and continues to
work diligently with partners around the globe. "We recognize that there are
many individuals and organizations with varying expertise involved in the fight
against malaria and we commend them for their efforts," said Jean-Michel Halfon,
president &amp; general manager of Pfizer`s Emerging Markets Business Unit.
"However, we cannot stop there. Instead it is important that we align our
activities even closer to make a meaningful impact. Pfizer will carry on as a
partner in the fight against malaria and will strive to continue to deliver
effective and affordable treatment to individuals afflicted by the disease in
the developing world." 

Pfizer Inc: Working together for a healthier world

Founded in 1849, Pfizer is the world's premier biopharmaceutical company taking
new approaches to better health. We discover, develop, manufacture and deliver

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Aus Anlass des Welt-Malaria-Tages am 25. April gab ExxonMobil heute bekannt,
dass es die fortgesetzten Anstrengungen der USAID (United States Agency for
International Development) im Kampf gegen Malaria mit einer zus&#228;tzlichen Spende
von 1 Million US-Dollar unterst&#252;tzen wird. Infolge der neuen Finanzmittel
erh&#246;hen sich die Zuwendungen von ExxonMobil an Organisationen, die an wichtigen
kommunalen und sozialen Entwicklungsprojekten in Afrika beteiligt sind, auf
einen Betrag von mehr als 150 Millionen US-Dollar, davon 55 Millionen US-Dollar
f&#252;r Programme zur Malariabek&#228;mpfung durch die unternehmenseigene
Gesundheitsinitiative f&#252;r Afrika. 

Das Subventionsprogramm unterst&#252;tzt die Malaria-Initiative des US-Pr&#228;sidenten
und dient dazu, Gesundheitspfleger in allen die Pr&#228;vention und Behandlung von
Malaria betreffenden Bereichen auszubilden, wobei die besondere Aufmerksamkeit
schwangeren Frauen und Kleinkindern, den beiden am st&#228;rksten von der Krankheit
betroffenen Gruppen, gilt. Seit sie im Jahr 2005 ins Leben gerufen wurde, hat
ExxonMobil die Anstrengungen, die die Malaria-Initiative des US-Pr&#228;sidenten in
Angola unternimmt, mit 4 Millionen US-Dollar unterst&#252;tzt. 

&#8222;Der Welt-Malaria-Tag bietet uns die Gelegenheit, das Problembewusstsein und das
direkte Engagement im Kampf gegen die verheerenden Auswirkungen dieser
vermeidbaren Krankheit zu erh&#246;hen", so Rex W. Tillerson, Vorsitzender und
Gesch&#228;ftsf&#252;hrer von ExxonMobil. &#8222;Ich bin sehr froh, dass wir aus Anlass dieses
Tages unsere verst&#228;rkte finanzielle Unterst&#252;tzung f&#252;r die Malaria-Initiative des
Pr&#228;sidenten bekannt geben k&#246;nnen, denn sie tr&#228;gt entscheidend dazu bei, den
Tribut zu verringern, den die Malaria fordert." 

&#8222;Wir von ExxonMobil kennen die verheerenden Sch&#228;den, die Malaria in Afrika
anrichtet, aus erster Hand. Es handelt sich hier um mehr als 90% der
Malariainfektionen weltweit und Malaria ist hier f&#252;r Kinder die h&#228;ufigste
Todesursache. Deshalb sind wir entschlossen, den Kampf zu f&#252;hren und alles zu
tun, angefangen von der Unterst&#252;tzung bei der Entwicklung neuer Arzneimittel bis
hin zur Verteilung von mit Insektizid behandelten Netzen an den Orten, wo sie am
meisten gebraucht werden." 

&#8222;Trotz des schwierigeren wirtschaftlichen Umfelds ist es wichtig, dass
Unternehmen in puncto gemeinn&#252;tzige Investitionen eine Haltung einnehmen, die
auf lange Sicht angelegt ist. Da in dieser Woche Malaria im Mittelpunkt steht,
hoffen wir, dass andere sich uns anschlie&#223;en und mit uns die Malaria Capital
Campaign unterst&#252;tzen, die insgesamt 100 Millionen US-Dollar aufbringen will, um
den Kampf gegen Malaria fortzusetzen. ExxonMobil hat 10 Millionen US-Dollar
beigetragen, um diese Kampagne auf den Weg zu bringen." 

Teil der Anstrengungen, die ExxonMobil unternimmt, um das Problembewusstsein von
politischen Entscheidungstr&#228;gern f&#252;r Malaria zu sch&#228;rfen, ist die Teilnahme von
Mitarbeitern an wichtigen Gespr&#228;chsrunden, die zum Thema Malaria in den USA und
in Europa stattfinden und die dazu beitragen sollen, das Verst&#228;ndnis f&#252;r die
Krankheit zu verbessern und L&#246;sungsans&#228;tze zu entwickeln, mit denen Malaria
vorgebeugt und als Todesursache schlie&#223;lich ausgerottet wird. Der Medizinische
Direktor f&#252;r weltweite Gesundheitsfragen bei ExxonMobil, Dr. Steven Phillips,
wird morgen auf dem &#8222;One World Against Malaria"-Gipfeltreffen in Washington
dar&#252;ber sprechen. 

Dr. Phillips wird einige der wichtigen internationalen Initiativen er&#246;rtern, die
derzeit entwickelt werden, um gegen Malaria vorzugehen, darunter auch einen
bislang beispiellosen Versuch zur Beseitigung von Malaria im s&#252;dlichen Afrika.
Betrieben wird diese Malaria Elimination Strategy, die danach trachtet,
zwischenstaatliche Gesundheitsinitiativen zur Bek&#228;mpfung von Malaria zwischen
verschiedenen afrikanischen L&#228;ndern zu erweitern, von der Global Health Group an
der University of California in San Francisco. Von ExxonMobil erh&#228;lt sie eine
Unterst&#252;tzung und Finanzmittel in H&#246;he von 3,5 Millionen US-Dollar. 

Aus Anlass des Welt-Malaria-Tages hat ExxonMobil auch eine neue Malarai-Webseite
gestartet, mit Informationen zu den Anstrengungen des Unternehmens im Kampf
gegen Malaria sowie Expertenrunden zur Rolle, die Unternehmen bei der Bek&#228;mpfung
der Krankheit spielen k&#246;nnen. Dar&#252;ber hinaus hat ExxonMobil eine globale
Werbekampagne gestartet, die das Problem und einige der von uns umgesetzten
L&#246;sungsans&#228;tze beleuchtet. 

Malaria ist eine von einem Parasiten verursachte lebensbedrohliche Krankheit,
die durch Moskitostich auf Menschen &#252;bertragen wird. An ihr sterben j&#228;hrlich
zwischen einer und drei Millionen Menschen und t&#228;glich 3.000 Kinder, und sie ist
nach wie vor eine der weltweit f&#252;hrenden Todesursachen durch Ansteckung. Die
Mehrzahl ihrer Opfer sind Kinder unter f&#252;nf Jahren und schwangere Frauen. 

ExxonMobil und Malaria

Die Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) und die ExxonMobil Foundation sind an
einer Reihe wohlt&#228;tiger Aktionen beteiligt, die der F&#246;rderung von Erziehung,
Gesundheitswesen und Wissenschaft in den Gesellschaften dienen, in denen
ExxonMobil erhebliche Gesch&#228;ftst&#228;tigkeiten entwickelt. Weltweit stellt
ExxonMobil Geldmittel bereit, um in Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern die Grundbildung zu
verbessern und Malaria sowie andere ansteckenden Krankheiten zu bek&#228;mpfen.
ExxonMobil ist das gr&#246;&#223;te nicht-pharmazeutische Gro&#223;unternehmen, das mit
Geldmitteln die Malariaforschung und Entwicklungshilfe unterst&#252;tzt. Das
Unternehmen hat seit dem Jahr 2000 150 Millionen US-Dollar f&#252;r gemeinn&#252;tzige
Entwicklungsprogramme in Afrika ausgegeben, davon 55 Millionen US-Dollar f&#252;r
Malariabek&#228;mpfungsprogramme. Das Unternehmen gr&#252;ndete seine
Gesundheitsinitiative f&#252;r Afrika im Jahr 2000 zur Unterst&#252;tzung der Abuja
Deklaration &#252;ber die Bek&#228;mpfung von Malaria in Afrika (Abuja Declaration on Roll
Back Malaria in Africa) und deren Ziel, die Zahl der Malariaopfer bis zum Jahr
2010 um die H&#228;lfte zu senken. ExxonMobil hat inzwischen &#246;ffentlich-private
Partnerschaften vor Ort gegr&#252;ndet, die es sich zur Aufgabe machen, Malaria auf
kommunaler Ebene zu bek&#228;mpfen, die Behandlungsmethoden und die
Impfstoffforschung zu verbessern und das Problembewusstsein und die
internationale Unterst&#252;tzung zu erh&#246;hen. Das Unternehmen tr&#228;gt auf diese Weise
zur Malariabek&#228;mpfung in mehr als 20 afrikanischen L&#228;ndern bei.

&lt;p&gt;COLOGNE, Germany, April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. software company
Microsoft (MSFT.O) still sees value in a potential partnership
with Yahoo (YHOO.O) even though it is no longer wants to buy it,
chief executive Steve Ballmer said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "I have said many times that we no longer are interested in

by partnering with Yahoo," he said at an industry event in
Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I have said many times that when the time is right I'm sure
we will have such discussions and I've said many times I'm not
going to tell you when the time is right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology blog All Things Digital reported this month the
chief executives of Microsoft and Yahoo had met to discuss

to comment on the report. [ID:nN10327432]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, Ballmer said Microsoft was not interested
in buying a hardware company following Oracle Corp's ORCL.O
proposed takeover of Sun Microsystems JAVA.O. [ID:nLM323105]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer, speaking a day after Microsoft said third-quarter
profit fell 32 percent, said integrating those two companies
would be "very tough" given "a lot of overlap". [ID:nLO608452]

&lt;p&gt;Goal of Collaboration Between Pfizer Regenerative Medicine and UCL is the
Development of Treatment for Macular Degeneration
CAMBRIDGE, England--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Regenerative Medicine today announced that it has entered into a
collaboration and license agreement with University College London focused on
gaining better understanding into how to develop stem cell-based therapies for
certain ophthalmic conditions. 

The Pfizer/UCL collaboration brings together the pioneering work of university
researchers in the field of cell-based therapies and Pfizer`s expertise in the
design and delivery of therapeutics. Pfizer`s contributions will include
expertise in the design and execution of clinical studies and interaction with
global regulators as well as in product manufacturing techniques. The
collaboration will examine how human embryonic stem (hES) cells differentiate
into retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with the goal of developing stem
cell-based therapies primarily for wet and dry macular degeneration (AMD). 

"We are excited to be working with pioneers in the field of stem cell
ophthalmology from UCL," said Ruth McKernan, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of
Pfizer Regenerative Medicine. "While we have much to learn about how stem cells
can be used therapeutically, we are confident that this relationship will
increase that understanding and help us advance to a time when our work may
benefit patients worldwide." 

Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will provide funding to UCL to enable
research into the development of stem cell-based therapies for AMD as well as
other retinal diseases. Pfizer is granted exclusive worldwide rights to develop
and commercialize an RPE stem cell-based therapeutic in the ophthalmology field.
After the completion of preclinical safety studies, Pfizer will have the option
to conduct clinical trials to determine efficacy of treatment and commercialize
any resulting product. 

Pfizer is a leader in the development and marketing of medical therapies for
ophthalmologic disease and has active efforts in retinal diseases, glaucoma and
dry eye syndrome. The alliance with UCL will help Pfizer to remain at the
leading edge of research into new therapies for ophthalmic disease. 

"We have not only the benefit of Pfizer`s experience of the regulatory process
and their expertise in stem cell technology but the ability, if this works, to
produce on a much larger scale. It has huge implications, not only for our
project, but for the field of regenerative medicine as a whole. And it is great
that Britain is at the forefront of this research," said Professor Pete Coffey,
UCL Institute for Ophthalmology and Director of the London Project. 

In November 2008, Pfizer launched the Pfizer Regenerative Medicine research
unit. This independent research organization will build on Pfizer's years of
experience in this field and recent scientific progress in understanding the
biology of stem cells and the opportunity it provides to discover and develop a
new generation of medicines for major medical needs. Initial research in this
area by Pfizer was focused on the development in drug discovery tools and now
expands into developing a new generation of regenerative medicines for major
medical needs that could benefit millions of patients worldwide. 

The agreement with UCL adds to a range of collaborations and licenses with
public and private institutes involving experts in this emerging area of
biomedical research, of which Pfizer is at the forefront. These collaborations
support the evaluation of alternative cell sources, explore the control of stem
cells with small molecules and seek to optimize the production of certain cell
types for potential use as therapies. 

These collaborations place Pfizer at the cutting edge of efforts in the field of
regenerative medicines and support the company`s goal to be a leader in the
discovery and development of biotherapeutics and in bringing life-changing
medicines to patients in need.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with Exxon statement, adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, April 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
said on Sunday a hydrocracker and a flexicoker were back in
operation at its giant 567,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baytown,
Texas, refinery following Friday night malfunctions triggered
by heavy rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The heavy rain triggered a drop in steam pressure, causing
the units to malfunction, according to a notice filed by Exxon
with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Those units are back," said Exxon spokeswoman Neely Nelson
on Sunday. "There was no impact on supply."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) of rain fell on the
refinery, located 28 miles (45 km) east of downtown Houston,
Exxon said in the notice. Most of the rain, 3.4 inches (8.6
cm), fell in the first hour of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavy rain can rapidly and drastically cool refinery units
and piping, which operate at very high temperatures, affecting
production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A hydrocracker uses hydrogen under high heat and pressure
to increase the amount of motor fuel refined from a barrel of
oil. A coker increases the amount of material that can be
refined into motor fuel. Both increase a refinery's ability to
process cheaper, high-sulfur crude oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's Baytown refinery is the largest in the United
States.

Metro, Chevron Energy Solutions Unveil Nation's Largest Solar Panel Installation at a Transit Facility</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Apr 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro)
today unveiled a groundbreaking energy efficiency and renewable power
project with the installation of the nation's largest solar panel system
at a transit facility. It is also the largest solar panel installation
within the City of Los Angeles.

    The 6,720 individual solar panels at Metro's Support Services Center in
downtown Los Angeles -- Metro's central maintenance facility for buses --
will generate 1.2 megawatt, or 1,200 kilowatts of renewable, emission-free
power. Along with other energy-efficient improvements, the project is
expected to cut the facility's annual $1.1 million energy bill in half to
approximately $550,000. Metro will reduce its purchase of utility power,
which is anticipated to reduce carbon emissions by more than 3,700 metric
tons, equivalent to planting more than 550 acres of trees and taking more
than 600 cars off the road.

    "Los Angeles is now one step closer to becoming the solar capital of the
United States," said Los Angeles Mayor and Metro Board Chair Antonio
Villaraigosa. "Today's unveiling of the City's largest solar-powered
facility will not only generate clean, renewable energy, but will provide
the kinds of green jobs that this economy so desperately needs."

    The project is a public/private partnership between Metro and Chevron
Energy Solutions. The $16.5 million project will receive about $6.3
million in incentives from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
(LADWP), Southern California Gas Co., (SoCalGas), and the South Coast Air
Quality Management District. The project was financed by Bank of America.

     "We are pleased to have the opportunity to work with Metro to help it
achieve its sustainability goals," said John Mahoney, Chief Operating
Officer of Chevron Energy Solutions. "Metro is demonstrating how a transit
authority can reduce its energy consumption and use clean, renewable
power."

    California-based Chevron Energy Solutions, which designed and installed
the solar photovoltaic system, will provide long-term oversight of the
facility's solar panel array and related new equipment and, in addition,
will guarantee the energy savings and the level of energy generated by the
solar panel array for the next 10 years.

    Other energy conservation measures at the facility include the
installation of new Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
systems, compressed air systems, and the replacement of about 4,000
lighting fixtures, all controlled by a state-of-the-art energy management
system.

    "This is the kind of environmental responsibility we need to see more of
in Los Angeles," said L.A. City Councilmember and Metro Director Jose
Huizar. "This cleaner running facility tells us that we can and should
build greener industries in our city, particularly in areas prone to
higher pollutant levels. Today, Metro and its partners are setting a green
standard that others need to emulate."

    For completing this project, Metro expects to receive incentives of $4.9
million from LADWP, up to $633,000 from Southern California Gas Co. and
$807,000 from the South Coast Air Quality Management District. To date,
Metro has received $2.6 million in incentives from SoCalGas for its
previous installations of solar systems providing 851 kilowatts of
electricity.

    LADWP provided $4.1 million through its Solar Incentive Program as well as
nearly $800,000 in incentives for energy efficiency technologies such as
high efficiency air conditioning unit upgrades, installation of a cool
roof, lighting efficiency measures, compressed air system upgrades, energy
management systems, and others.

    "We applaud Metro for helping to lead a clean and green tech revolution in
Los Angeles. Metro's solar system and energy efficiency upgrades will
lower the city's carbon footprint and increase the amount of clean,
renewable energy produced here," said David Nahai, LADWP Chief Executive
Officer and General Manager.

    "We commend Metro for its leadership in the use of renewable energy and
energy-efficient equipment that will help the state meet its greenhouse
gas emissions-reduction goals, move us toward energy independence and
reduce energy costs," said Hal D. Snyder, Vice President of Customer
Solutions at SoCalGas.

    The Metro Support Services Center is used for the rebuilding of bus
engines, transmissions, and general bus repair. Spanning 27 acres, the
400,000-square-foot facility consists of five separate buildings where
highly trained and certified technicians and mechanics keep Metro's bus
fleet in all of the agency's 11 operating divisions in top condition.

     "Metro's Support Services Center uses a huge amount of electricity every
year," said Arthur T. Leahy, Metro CEO. "The facility's use of solar
energy sets a real benchmark for Metro to reach its goals of using new
technologies to reduce carbon emissions and operating costs."

    In 2006, Metro completed a massive solar energy project encompassing 1,648
solar panels at its Metro Bus Divisions 8 and 15 in the San Fernando
Valley, and two years later 1,632 solar panels were installed at its
Carson bus division.

    More recently, Metro's new "ecologically green" San Gabriel Valley Sector
office was built to the specifications of a GOLD rating by the leadership
in Energy and Enviromental Design (LEED). The San Gabriel building
consumes 33 percent less electricity than a conventional building and
surpasses the State of California's already strict standards for building
energy use by 25 percent and water consumption standards by 50 percent.

    Chevron Energy Solutions designs, constructs and operates facility
projects, including infrastructure and renewable power systems, that
increase energy efficiency, reduce energy costs, and ensure reliable power
for public institutions and businesses. Since 2000, Chevron Energy
Solutions has developed hundreds of projects involving energy efficiency
or renewable power for education, government and business customers in the
United States. For more information, visit www.chevronenergy.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's
commercial paper holding may fall near $200 billion, if some
issuers choose not to resell their debt to the Fed over the
next couple of weeks, J.P. Morgan analysts said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; About $140 billion of securities in the Fed's Commercial
Paper Funding Facility will mature over the next two weeks.
Roughly $40 billion will come due in the first week and the
rest in the second week, J.P. Morgan analysts Alex Roever and
Cie-Jai Brown wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed's CPFF is one of the programs created in the wake
of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which roiled the commercial
paper market last autumn. The program is a backstop for
companies who rely on commercial paper to raise short-term
funds to meet payrolls and finance their inventories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the ongoing decline in interbank borrowing costs, CP
issuers, especially banks, have more options to obtain
short-term cash, according to the J.P. Morgan analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, the CPFF program was recently extended to October
30 from April 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With the CPFF around long enough to provide funding
through year-end 2009, it is plausible that issuers will
reluctantly roll to the Fed and look for market alternatives,"
the analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, most asset-backed commercial paper in the CPFF
that will come due in the next two weeks will likely roll back
into the program given the changes to another Fed program that
helps to finance this type of securities, the J.P. Morgan
analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, the Fed said it held $242.43 billion in
three-month, top-rated commercial paper in its CPFF on April 1,
down from the some $334 billion at the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, the Fed announced it is buying top-rated,
3-month unsecured CP at 1.20 percent and top-rated, 3-month
asset-backed commercial paper at 3.20 percent for a fourth
straight session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the open market, issuers can sell top-notch, three-month
commercial paper at about 0.78 percent on Monday.

&lt;p&gt;Gold Finger 2.0 empowers organizations to efficiently and precisely assess,
audit, report and demonstrate regulatory compliance of administrative access
grants provisioned in Active Directory
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Paramount Defenses Inc today announced the availability of Gold Finger 2.0, an
innovative access assessment, security audit, regulatory compliance and
reporting solution that can instantly and precisely determine who is provisioned
what administrative access in Microsoft Windows Server-based IT infrastructures.


A GLOBAL NEED

Microsoft's Windows Server operating system powers a majority of IT
infrastructures worldwide. At the foundation of security and management in these
IT infrastructures lies Microsoft's enterprise directory service, Active
Directory, which is used to store, protect and manage vital organizational IT
assets such as employee user accounts, domain security groups and computer
management policies. 

Active Directory allows organizations to easily delegate administrative
responsibilities for IT management with high precision. However, frequently
changing IT management requirements driven by dynamic business needs make it
challenging for organizations to efficiently determine and control exactly who
has what administrative access on which IT assets. 

The inability to exactly determine who has what administrative access leaves IT
assets exposed and vulnerable to compromise from the threat of accidental,
coerced or maliciously acquired misuse of even minimal administrative privilege,
particularly from within the organization. 

AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION

Gold Finger 2.0's innovative patent-pending administrative access assessment
capabilities completely automate the assessment of administrative grants
provisioned on IT assets stored in Active Directory, helping organizations
efficiently determine, audit and control exactly who has what administrative
access on these assets, ensuring adequate protection. 

Automation improves efficiency by 90% and delivers 100% precision, eliminating
any possibility of human error. The ability to generate printable access reports
makes demonstrating regulatory compliance of and performing security audits of
administrative access provisioned in Active Directory as easy as touching one
button. 

"The ability to view, audit and lockdown administrative access rights to an
entire Active Directory network significantly improves the security of an IT
infrastructure," said Charles Coats, Senior Product Manager with the Identity
and Security Business Group at Microsoft Corporation. "We are very pleased to
see Paramount Defenses, a valued Microsoft partner, offer an innovative security
solution that helps enhance security and compliance in Active Directory
environments." 

Gold Finger's administrative access assessment capabilities perfectly complement
Active Directory's powerful administrative access delegation capabilities
letting organizations delegate administrative IT management responsibilities
natively in Active Directory with complete insight and assurance, leveraging
their investment in Windows Server to gain substantial cost efficiencies
resulting from the obviated need to procure additional administrative access
management solutions. 

"Organizations running on Windows Server have a mission-critical business need
to be able to precisely assess administrative access grants in Active
Directory," said Sanjay Tandon, Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Defenses
Inc, and formerly Microsoft Program Manager for Active Directory Security. "Gold
Finger 2.0 empowers organizations to precisely delegate, assess, audit, report
and manage administrative authority for IT management natively in Active
Directory, significantly enhancing security and substantially reducing IT
costs."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
said on Monday that it expects to see high commodity returns in
2010, as the economic as the economic contraction gives way to a
new expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We continue to expect that the global economy will bottom
sometime in the second half of 2009, which would imply strong
commodity returns to be realized in 2010 and 2011 as economic
growth increases back toward its trend pace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commodity markets have been hammered since last year as a
global downturn knocked demand for raw materials such as
industrial metals and oil and dampened investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said the second half of the year would be a good
entry point for commodity investments but warned that a
prolonged economic downturn remains a risk to the returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, oil fell below $49 while copper shed 4 percent,
as most commodity markets were hit by fear that a deadly flu
outbreak spreading from Mexico may become a pandemic and hurt
bids to stabilise the global economy.

&lt;p&gt; * Liquidation could help banks raise money&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Visa shares fall 2.2 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) said it had

&lt;p&gt;  RENO, NV, Apr 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
COMMON ANNUAL MEETING AND EXPO -- Aldon, the ALM company for IT
compliance, and BCD, a market leader in IBM i and multi-platform
application modernization solutions, today announced a strategic
technology partnership aimed at bringing new levels of process automation
and efficiency to web application development and modernization for the
IBM i platform covering PHP and RPG-CGI centric projects.

    The partnership marks the integration of Aldon's process-driven change
management solution, Aldon Lifecycle Manager(TM), with BCD's fast-paced,
intuitive tools for IBM i and multi-platform web development, WebSmart(R)
ILE and WebSmart PHP. The combined solution provides users with a host of
new benefits when building web applications or modernizing legacy ones,
including automated processes and deployment, inventory management,
project and compliance reporting, and new levels of visibility into what
team members are working on, where code lives, and project status. IT
managers will gain a crystal-clear view of all IT assets and projects at
any given time and ensure compliance standards are met, while developers
are free to focus on application innovation rather than administrative
tasks. Managers of web application development and modernization projects
should realize an immediate return from these improvements to their
process.

    Today, more and more IBM i shops are ensconced in web-centric development
or modernization to stay in line with the modern business' needs. As these
efforts grow, a comprehensive application lifecycle management solution
becomes imperative. IT shops will need defined process, structure and
automation to support rapid business change, stay agile, address
compliance, and keep projects on track.

    "As we watch the open source, multi-platform, and IBM i worlds merge, it's
important to make sure process doesn't fall by the wayside," said Matt
Scholl, CEO and president, Aldon. "The joint Aldon and BCD solution
ensures that process is flowing across every facet of development. Both
the business and IT sides of the house will benefit. We're excited to work
with BCD and look forward to a long-term partnership."

    The Joint Solution

    The BCD WebSmart ILE product helps developers produce native IBM i-centric
RPG CGI web applications that access DB2, MS SQL and MySQL databases.
WebSmart PHP helps developers produce PHP applications that run on
multiple platforms -- IBM i, Windows, Linux or Unix -- and access
databases such as DB2, MySQL and others. Both editions provide developers
with the necessary tools to quickly extend or develop new web
applications for any application from on-line ordering, inquiries and
maintenance programs, to browser-based or SOA (web services)
applications. Aldon Lifecycle Manager works behind the scenes, enforcing
processes at each and every stage of that application development,
putting teams on to the same system regardless of platform, language or
development environment. The following is a list of benefits that users
can expect with the joint solution:


--  Advanced Software Configuration Management (SCM) concepts such as
    concurrent development, multiple release management, emergency changes,
    conflict management and source comparison.
--  Advanced Deployment Management concepts such as scheduled deployments
    for after-hours, easy multi-platform and secure deployments, simple
    management of all deployments via a GUI console, and roll-back
    capabilities.
--  Audit compliance aids such as automatic historical tracking of all
    changes and deployments, advanced reporting, finely tuned security via role-
    based profiles, and separation of duties.
--  Centralized management of all software assets from all platforms to
    increase vision and team-work and easily comply with best-practice
    standards for centralized control and tracking.
--  Cross-referencing to tie database changes in other applications to
    WebSmart ILE programs that reference those files, thus preventing
    unexpected downtime of critical web applications.
    

    
The PHP Factor

    There is a rapidly growing list of companies who have turned to PHP to
modernize their applications and create web-based interfaces to RPG
programs and DB2 database files. BCD's WebSmart PHP tool helps developers
who write programs for the IBM i to quickly construct PHP programs and
applications. These programs are 100% native PHP, allowing a single
development effort to create IBM i and multi-platform applications that
also run on Linux, UNIX, and Windows servers. Aldon's integrated inventory
management will play a key role in delivering efficiency to this process,
ensuring that all facets of an enterprise-crossing PHP application are
fully tracked.

    "BCD is thrilled to work with Aldon and have this technology integration
between our leading products. We share the same commitment in developing
solutions the IBM i marketplace needs, from addressing PHP and ILE web
application development to SOA and compliance," said Eric Figura, Director
Sales and Marketing, BCD. "As a standalone solution, WebSmart allows IT
staffs to rapidly develop IBM i and multi-platform web applications faster
and easier using templates and other advancements, however when you add
Aldon to the mix, the impact is even more impressive. Together we can now
help IBM i IT departments better address today's business needs and be an
even greater asset to their organization."

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today announced a `refreshed` line-up of fountain and
bottle beverages that will be added to McDonald`s U.S. restaurants, beginning

"We`ve worked with our partners at Coca-Cola to bring our customers the exciting
new beverages they desire, while continuing to provide them the brands they have
enjoyed at our restaurants for more than half a century," said Karen Wells, vice
president, Strategy and Menu, McDonald`s USA. "Our relationship with Coca-Cola

&lt;p&gt;  CORNELIUS, NC, Apr 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Michael Waltrip Racing (MWR) reports that it has experienced dramatic
water jet cutting productivity gains and cost reductions since powering
its Jet Edge waterjet system with Jet Edge's 100hp 90,000 psi X-Stream
waterjet intensifier pump in January.

    "We've been seeing, across the board, a 35% improvement in cutting speed,
plus we are using about 25% less garnet abrasive, and we have reduced our
costs by 30%," said Nick Hughes, MWR's technical director. "As an example,
our spindles, which are one of our more complicated steering parts and cut
from 2" 4140 steel, used to take 50-55 minutes to cut at 60,000 psi. Now
we are cutting them in 30-44 minutes. Before we got the waterjet, it used
to take three or four hours to rough cut them on a bandsaw. I also should
note that about the same time we upgraded our pump, we changed suppliers
for our spindle blanks. They use a much harder material that requires a
slower cutting time. The X-Stream offset the increased cutting time.

    "Another good example of a reduction in machining time would be our upper
control arm plates that attach our front suspension arms to the chassis.
These are cut from 1.5" thick steel and took about 1 hour and 25 minutes
to cut two with the double heads and the old 60Kpsi pump. We can now cut
two in about one hour with the double heads and the 90Kpsi pump."

    Thanks to these increased cutting speeds, MWR has been able to reduce its
waterjet operating hours from 60 to 65 hours per week to 40 to 50 hours
per week, saving on labor and overhead, Hughes noted.

    "From a throughput standpoint, we're able to push a lot more product
through in the same period of time," he said. "This has freed up machine
time so we can cut jigs and fixturing in addition to racecar parts. We're
able to rough these out on the waterjet much faster than with conventional
cutting tools."

    By freeing up production time, Jet Edge's X-Stream waterjet pump also has
helped MWR develop a side business building cars for other race teams,
Hughes added.

    "The X-Stream has opened the door for more commercial opportunities," he
said. "It helps bring the cost down and we're able to pass that down to
the other teams. They are able to get a quality product at a lower price
plus they can leverage off of MWR's engineering and manufacturing
capabilities."

    According to Hughes, MWR waterjets 250 parts for each of its racecars. The
parts are cut from a wide variety of materials ranging from 1/4" Nomex(R)
to 1/2" steel, and include numerous panels, mounts and chassis components,
plus duct work, windows, splitter panels and much more. MWR builds about
56 cars per year, which include the #55 NAPA AUTO PARTS Toyota Camry
driven by Michael Waltrip and fielded by MWR, the #00 Aaron's Dream
Machine Toyota Camry driven by David Reutimann and fielded by MWR, the
#47 Little Debbie(R) Toyota Camry driven by Marcos Ambrose fielded by
JTG-Daugherty Racing through a technical alliance with MWR, and the NASCAR
Nationwide Series #99 Aaron's Dream Machine.

    Hughes said he has been very pleased with Jet Edge's X-Stream waterjet
pump and with Jet Edge's performance in general.

    "We would absolutely, definitely recommend the X-Stream pump to others.
The productivity improvements and cost savings are very measurable. Jet
Edge's service has been fantastic and any components we've needed to get
in have always been in stock. We have nothing to complain about."

&lt;p&gt;  WOBURN, MA, Apr 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Axceler, the global leader in administration software for collaborative
platforms, today announced ControlPoint 3, the newest version of the
fastest growing SharePoint administration product for Microsoft
SharePoint. ControlPoint 3 delivers new capabilities so you can be
proactive about your SharePoint administration, including alerting,
moving sites, policy management, and scheduled analysis. Experts say that
the best way to avoid future problems is by thinking ahead and putting a
solid, best-of-breed SharePoint infrastructure in place. ControlPoint 3,
as part of that infrastructure, can help you avoid the impact as well as
the costs of violating your governance policies. ControlPoint 3 is the
only administration software that seamlessly lets you analyze and enforce
SharePoint permissions, analyze activity storage and content, clean up
user accounts, move content within farms or between farms, enforce
policies and audit SharePoint environments.

    ControlPoint 3 automatically alerts you when any changes are made in your
environment, such as changing SharePoint permissions or adding and
deleting sites. "With ControlPoint, I feel better knowing about any
changes in my environment immediately," said Karen Floyd, City of
Charlotte, NC. "Now I can react appropriately before problems can fester."

    ControlPoint 3 also lets you move site collections, sites, and lists
within a farm or across farms. "The ability to move sites is critical for
us," said Mike Herrity, Twynham Schools. "We often move content across
departments or from test to production environments, so this will save us
a huge amount of SharePoint administration time."

    ControlPoint 3 also gives you control over your SharePoint configurations
to ensure they stay within your governance policies, including site
themes, search settings, and permissions. With ControlPoint 3, you can
also run any analysis on a pre-defined schedule and then distribute it,
proactively and regularly measuring results and sharing with others such
as compliance officers.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Citing new lobbying rules put into place by the Obama Administration, two
environmental groups are strongly criticizing Mickey Kantor for lobbying on
behalf of Chevron before the same trade agency he led for several years under
the Clinton Administration. 

Kantor, who headed the office of the United States Trade Representative from
1993 to 1997, has been lobbying the same office to quash a historic
environmental lawsuit brought by indigenous groups in Ecuador`s rainforest where
the oil giant faces a potential $27 billion liability for creating what some
experts have called the worst oil-related contamination on earth. Kantor`s role
was disclosed last week by the National Journal. 

The criticism of Kantor comes just one day before James McGovern (D-MA) convenes
the first Congressional hearing on the human rights aspect of Chevron`s
environmental contamination in Ecuador. Scheduled for Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. in
room 2200 of the Rayburn Building, the hearing will feature Steven Donziger, a
legal advisor to the Amazonian communities who have been battling Chevron in
court for more than 15 years. 

"Mickey Kantor is violating the spirit of lobbying rules put in place by the
Obama Administration to help a corporate polluter that has destroyed a large
portion of the rain forest," said Mitch Anderson, who monitors Chevron`s Ecuador
lawsuit for Amazon Watch, an environmental group in San Francisco. 

Luis Yanza, the internationally recognized leader of the Amazon Defense
Coalition in Ecuador, blasted Kantor for "betraying President Obama`s commitment
to protect the integrity of government by doing Chevron`s dirty work in his old
agency." 

"Chevron left an oil dump in the rainforest that has killed hundreds of people
with cancer and devastated indigenous groups, and now U.S. lobbyists are trying
to politicize and corrupt the trial process that Chevron wanted," said Luis
Yanza, a Goldman Award winner who coordinates the lawsuit for more than 80
farmer communities and indigenous groups. 

Under an executive order issued in January by President Obama, officials who
leave government are permanently barred from lobbying the Obama Administration.
When he issued the order, President Obama said: "We need to close the revolving
door that lets lobbyists &#8230; use their time in public service as a way to promote
their own interests over the interests of the American people when they leave." 

The legal case, brought on behalf of 30,000 people, originally was filed in U.S.
federal court in New York in 1993. After years of legal battles over
jurisdiction, the case was transferred to Ecuador in 2002 after Chevron
submitted 14 expert affidavits asserting the South American country would be the
most appropriate venue. 

When the trial started in 2003 and evidence pointed to Chevron`s culpability,
the oil giant shifted gears and started to attack Ecuador`s courts and launched
a lobbying campaign against Ecuador`s government. 

Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, was the exclusive operator of large oil
concession in Ecuador`s rainforest from 1964 to 1990. The company has admitted
to dumping 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways and
abandoning more than 900 toxic waste pits that are still leaching toxic sludge
into soils and groundwater, according to scientific evidence in the case. 

Kantor was quoted saying that the damages amount "doesn`t make any logical
sense" even though he offered no reason for the conclusion. Yet Anderson
explained the damages assessment ordered by the court - contained in a
4,000-page report prepared by 15 technical experts -- is consistent with other
large environmental clean-ups around the world, a fact confirmed by several
independent scientists. 

The damages report found 1,401 excess cancer deaths in the region due to
oil-related contamination. 

"I would bet Mickey Kantor has never been to Ecuador to see the damage caused by
Chevron," said Anderson. "He`s probably never talked to the victims, never read
the expert report, and never seen the cancer mortality data. 

"His work for Chevron is an example of Washington`s broken system of lobbying,"
added Anderson. 

Chevron failed in similar efforts to end Ecuador`s trade preferences in 2006 and
2008. In 2006, then Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Patrick Leahy wrote a letter to
the USTR requesting that the agency not intervene because the plaintiffs
"deserved their day in court". 

Chevron hopes the threat of cutting trade benefits will pressure Ecuador`s
President Rafael Correa to scuttle the lawsuit even though he is prohibited by
law from intervening in private legal matters. Ecuador stands to lose 350,000
jobs if the trade benefits are canceled, according to the government.

&lt;p&gt;Solution Adds Management Capability and Increased Flexibility When Using Quest
vWorkspace with Microsoft Windows Server 2008, App-V and System Center
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Quest Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: QSFT) today announced that Quest vWorkspace, a
platform-agnostic virtual desktop management solution, integrates with Microsoft
System Center Virtual Machine Manager and Microsoft Application Virtualization
(App-V). Through this integration, vWorkspace adds automation and improved
management-level support, enhanced user experience and flexibility throughout
the virtual desktop lifecycle. 

The solution will be featured this week during Microsoft Management Summit 2009
(MMS), in booth No. 209. Multiple webcasts and an eight-city road show are
planned for later in the year. For more information on the joint solution,
please visit www.vWorkspace.com/aWinningPartnership. 

"Organizations are evaluating desktop virtualization solutions because they can
provide their workers with more flexible access to data and applications, while
making it easier for IT departments to control assets and provision just the
right applications and data to the user," said Dai Vu, director of
virtualization marketing, Server and Tools Business at Microsoft Corp. "Quest
vWorkspace provides customers with a rich virtual desktop experience through
integrated management across existing physical and virtual desktops with
Microsoft System Center, and cost-effective virtualization with Windows Server
2008 Hyper-V." 

"We are happy to be able to leverage our existing investment with Quest
vWorkspace to roll out our virtual desktop infrastructure on Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V platform," said Robert Roos, senior IT infrastructure architect with ROC
West-Brabant, a leading educational institution in the Netherlands. "Having this
single desktop management framework support both our VDI and terminal services
infrastructures is crucial." 

Quest vWorkspace uses the native Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to add
significant user experience enhancements, creating an Experience Optimized
Protocol (EOP) that empowers graphics and multimedia acceleration,
bi-directional audio, local text echo, universal print driver, and USB device
support. 

Benefits of the integration of Quest vWorkspace with Microsoft System Center
Virtual Machine Manager include:

* Full management of the desktop lifecycle, including provisioning,
sys-prepping, intelligent placement and power management of virtual desktops, as
a result of management-level integration with System Center Virtual Machine
Manager, Microsoft App-V and Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V. 
* Dynamic computer group pooling with assignment-type flexibility for
pre-assigned desktops or assignments upon first use. Computer groups can also be
easily changed or mixed on demand and full group task automation, for actions
such as powering up or down complete groups based on policy, are also enabled. 
* Increased desktop management efficiency by enabling the flexibility to
administratively elevate power users or administrators within a pooled or
assigned desktop or provision desktops to any Active Directory Organizational
Unit. 
* Reduced management overhead through the integration of user profile management
within the single Quest vWorkspace management console.

"Successful VDI deployments are best driven by a tightly integrated delivery
platform and management stack," said Chris Wolf, senior analyst, Burton Group.
"Organizations that realize substantial TCO savings following VDI deployments do
so by rearchitecting business and IT processes in order to streamline all
aspects of desktop management: provisioning, application delivery, profile
management, and lifecycle management. Solutions that yield the TCO savings
required to fund VDI projects while providing the user experience expected by
many information workers are well positioned for rapid uptake." 

Where to Learn More

To learn more consider one of the following opportunities:

* Joint recorded webcast produced and hosted by TechTarget to air starting
today. 
* Four additional live VDI webcasts starting in June. 
* Eight in-person, half-day symposiums starting in September, which will visit
Irvine, Calif.; Silicon Valley, Calif.; Dallas; Chicago; Boston; New York;
Reston, Va.; and Atlanta. 
* A joint Microsoft/Quest whitepaper detailing the advantages of implementing
Quest vWorkspace with Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager.

&lt;p&gt;--(Business Wire)--
Amazon Defense Coalition: 

WHAT: Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission hearing on the link between
environmental degradation and human rights norms. 

WHO: Steven Donziger, attorney representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit
against Chevron and representatives of other indigenous and traditional people
in Nigeria and West Papua. 

WHERE: 2200 Rayburn House Office Building 

WHEN: April 28, 10:30 am 

BACKGROUND:

Exploring the specific examples of communities in Ecuador, Nigeria, and West
Papua, the Commission hearing will analyze the relationship between
environmental degradation and human rights, particularly in relation to
indigenous and traditional peoples around the globe. The historic Ecuadorian
environmental case -- Aguinda v. ChevronTexaco - deals with what many experts
consider the worst oil-related disaster on the planet. The lawsuit alleges that
Texaco, now owned by Chevron, used a variety of sub-standard production
practices in Ecuador that resulted in thousands of illnesses and deaths. The
plaintiffs assert that five indigenous groups have had their traditional
lifestyles decimated, and one group (the Tetetes) has disappeared. Chevron has
admitted that Texaco dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into
Amazon waterways, abandoned more than 900 waste pits, burned millions of cubic
meters of poisonous gases with no controls, and spilled more than 17 million
gallons of oil due to pipeline ruptures. Texaco never conducted a single health
evaluation or environmental impact study while it was the operator. Experts
estimate the damage is 30 times larger than that of the Exxon Valdez disaster.
The company`s own environmental consultants found oilfield practices used by
Texaco that were clearly sub-standard. Texaco fought for nine years to avoid
trial in U.S. and transfer the case to Ecuador, claiming Ecuador`s courts were a
fair and an adequate forum. In 2002, Texaco won that battle but was forced by
the U.S. court to submit to jurisdiction in Ecuador and be bound by any ruling
there. The Aguinda lawsuit was re-filed in May 2003 in Ecuador. The trial began
in October 2003. As scientific evidence began to demonstrate Chevron`s
culpability, the company initiated a campaign to attack the trial process as
unfair.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG), Theravance, Inc. (NASDAQ: THRX), GlaxoSmithKline
plc (NYSE: GSK), Alcon Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: ACL) and Atheros Communcations
(NASDAQ: ATHR).

the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

P Gets a Charge Out of Duracell

A major growth driver for Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG) has been the continual
expansion of the portfolio of brand-name products, both through internal
development and acquisition. Product innovation is strongly supported by
management, and the company has had a strong tradition of not only introducing
blockbuster new products but also creating entire new categories. 

Duracell, a division of Procter &amp; Gamble, just announced the availability of the
Duracell USB Charger, a USB charging port that plugs right into the car's DC
socket, aka lighter socket. In addition, the company announced three different
connectors (for mini USB, micro USB and iPhone ports) for the Duracell My Pocket
Charger. 

Theravance Loss Narrows

Theravance, Inc. (NASDAQ: THRX) reported 1Q09 results on April 22, 2009. 

Revenue increased 70% to $9.5 million for the quarter compared to $5.6 million
in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the recognition
of the remaining deferred revenue of the LAMA program since the program has been
returned to the company from GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE: GSK). In our model we
had projected higher revenue with the expectation of FDA approval of Telavancin,
which now seems to be possible during 2Q or 3Q 2009. 

Alcon Dealing with Challenges

Alcon Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: ACL) faces some challenges in the near future:
patent expirations, patent challenges, generic threats and softer pricing on
certain of its products as a result of Medicare rebates. Additional near-term
challenges come from slower top-line growth due to a weakening economy and
negative foreign currency affects as the U.S. dollar strengthens against other
currencies. 

The company also took significant losses on its investment portfolio which, by
our calculations, negatively impacted EPS by as much as $0.24 in the fourth
quarter and $1.22 for all of 2008. The company has subsequently begun redeeming
all investments and expects to be 90% invested in cash-equivalents by mid-2009.
This should help reduce or eliminate any further investment losses. 

Atheros Results Beat Guidance

Atheros Communcations (NASDAQ: ATHR, Hold), a major provider of communication
solutions for the personal computer, residential gateway and mobile device
markets, released its fiscal Q1 results yesterday. Both revenue and non-GAAP EPS
came ahead of our and consensus estimates and exceeded guidance. Revenues of
$87.9 million and proforma EPS of $0.06 exceeded our estimates of $80.0 million
and $0.03, respectively. 

Forward guidance also came ahead of our current expectation by a wide margin:
Revenues are expected to increase by 15%-20% sequentially, or $101.1 million -
$105.5 million (versus our $85.2 million) and non-GAAP EPS are expected in the
range of $0.12 - $0.14 (versus our estimate of $0.05).

 (Adds context on Dow)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday
as fresh worries that major banks may need to raise more money
offset more reassuring economic data that suggested the worst
may be over and a big dividend boost from IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worries also lingered over the economic impact from the
threat of a flu pandemic, as New Zealand and Israel were the
latest countries to confirm cases of a new strain of flu
linked to dozens of deaths in Mexico. (For details, see
[ID:nN27476506])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. regulators have told Citigroup Inc (C.N) it may need
to raise more capital, sources told Reuters. The Wall Street
Journal reported that Bank of America (BAC.N) also is talking
to the government about its capital condition and the
shortfall could amount to billions of dollars.
 [ID:nBNG118035]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But data showed the decline in U.S. house prices slowed in
February while consumer confidence in April had its biggest
jump in more than three years. [ID:nN28304426]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) gave the Dow
its biggest boost, up 2 percent at $101.94 after its board
approved a 10 percent increase in its dividend and authorized
a stock buyback, highlighting resilience in a tough economic
climate. [ID:nN28305761]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Wall Street closed out the session in negative
territory, the major indexes recovered from their session
lows, when they slid more than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Two days in a row, where you walked in with a pretty weak
pre-opening market largely driven by what's gone on overseas,
swine flu, etc and we managed to come back -- that's a sign of

capital levels after receiving early results of its stress
test, but if it needs more capital, the bank does not expect
to get it from the government, people familiar with the matter
told Reuters. [ID:nWEN7981]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America's stock tumbled 8.6 percent to $8.15 and
ranked among the top weights on the blue-chip Dow, while
Citigroup lost 5.9 percent to $2.89. The KBW Bank index .BKX
slid 2.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nasdaq, shares of Dendreon (DNDN.O) were halted, down
45.2 percent at $11.81, after a closely watched study showed
the company's experimental cancer vaccine improved three-year
survival of patients with advanced prostate cancer by 38
percent, compared with a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was light on the New York Stock Exchange, with
about 1.25 billion shares changing hands, below last year's
estimated daily average of 1.49 billion, while on Nasdaq,
about 2.10 billion shares traded, below last year's daily
average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though the major U.S. stock indexes slipped late and
finished slightly lower, the market's breadth was positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the NYSE, advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones
by 1,581 to 1,409, while on the Nasdaq, advancers beat
decliners by 1,547 to 1,110.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
In yesterday's edition of Options 101, we learned how options are priced using
the Black Scholes Formula. Today, we're going to make this lesson even more
tangible by analyzing the option prices on a cluster of credit card concerns,
including American Express, MasterCard, and Visa. (Looking for something more
advanced? Seasoned options speculators can check out a new sister column,
Advanced Options.) 

Briefly recapping what we learned yesterday, the Black Scholes formula values an
option as a function of the following elements: stock price and strike price
(intrinsic value), time until expiration, volatility, dividend status, and
interest rates. However, we're going to focus on the first 3 aspects, as these
are often the most important when determining an option's price. With that in
mind, let's examine how these variables affect the aforementioned securities'
front- and back-month call options.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded the ratings of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corp., pass-through certificates, series 2007-FL1 and
revised the Rating Outlooks as follows: 

--$243.1 million class A-2 to 'AA' from 'AAA' to Outlook Negative from Outlook
Stable; 

--$53.7 million class B to 'A+' from 'AA+'; to Outlook Negative from Outlook

--$44.1 million class E to 'BB' from 'A+', Outlook Negative; 

--$30.7 million class F to 'B' from 'A'; Outlook Negative;

--$42.2 million class H to 'CCC/RR1' from 'BBB+'; 

--$38.4 million class J to 'CC/RR3' from 'BBB-'; 

--$34.5 million class K to 'CC/RR5' from 'BB+';

--$13.2 million class RS-6 to 'C/RR6' from 'B-'; 

--$7.6 million class RS-7 to 'C/RR6' from 'B-'. 

In addition, Fitch affirms the following classes: 

--$873.6 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable. 

The downgrades and Negative Outlook revisions reflect the continuing negative
performance of the Resorts International Portfolio and Fitch's assessment of the
portfolio's decline in value, as well as the large percentage of Fitch loans of
concern (LOC). Fitch anticipates potentially significant losses on the Resorts
International Portfolio due to declining cash flows and distressed market
valuations for gaming properties, especially those located in Atlantic City. The
ratings also reflect the high percentage of hotel, gaming and retail loans in
addition to many transitional loans not meeting anticipated improvements in
operating performance due to economic conditions. The Outlooks reflect the
likely direction of rating changes over the next one to two years. 

One loan (0.60% of the pool) has transferred to the special servicer since
Fitch's last rating action. The Okee Square loan is secured by a 124,000 square
foot (sf) retail center located in West Palm Beach, FL. The property transferred
in March 2009 and has stabilized since converting vacant movie theater space to
anchor space and repositioning in-line tenants. The borrower has been unable to
extend their loan due to maximum loan-to-value restrictions being exceeded.
Vacancy has increased since to approximately 34% as of Jan. 31, 2009, compared
to 25% at issuance. Losses are possible upon disposition of the asset. 

Fitch has indentified 11 other loans of concern (60.2% of the senior trust
balance), including Resorts International Portfolio, PHOV Portfolio, Marriott
Waikiki, Felcor Hotel Portfolio, Loews Santa Monica, Sofitel Chicago, Stratford
Mall, Hilton Alexandria Mark Center, Sofitel Lafayette Square, San Paloma
Apartments, Sofitel Minneapolis, and 321 Ellis Street. These loans are in
sectors more dependant upon discretionary consumer spending, and whose
performance is below expectations at issuance or severely lagging their
competitive set. These 12 loans no longer maintain their investment-grade shadow
ratings. The downgrades also address the decline in performance and the
expectation that the anticipated increased or stabilized net cash flow (NCF)
will not be attained. 

Resorts International, the fourth-largest loan, consists of a $120.2 million
senior trust component and $87.7 million in subordinate rake (RS) classes. The
loan is secured by one casino/hotel property located in Atlantic City, NJ and
two casino/hotel properties located in Tunica, MS. The total debt on the
portfolio, including the trust portion, totals $506.3 million. In September
2007, the Resorts East Chicago property was released from the portfolio, paying
down the senior trust component by approximately 47%. The loan recently was
extended and matures on Nov. 9, 2009, with two one-year extension options
remaining. Current estimations of value based on lower net cash flow and
stressed market conditions indicate a significant drop in value since issuance. 

As of June 30, 2008, the Resorts International Portfolio's servicer reported
annualized NCF declined approximately 36% from year-end 2007 reported servicer
NCF, driven by the negative performance of the AC Hilton. The decrease in the AC
Hilton's cash flow is attributed to multiple factors: increased competition, a
smoking ban introduced throughout the entire Atlantic City gaming market, and
the overall negative performance of the gaming industry due to general
macro-economic conditions throughout the U.S. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2008,
the Atlantic City gaming market recorded a 24.6% decrease in gross operating
profit compared to 2007. In October 2008, the Atlantic City City Council voted
to extend the current smoking ban until October of 2009, continuing to allow
smoking within 25% of the gaming square footage. 

The second-largest loan is secured by the Marriott Waikiki (12.9%), a
full-service hotel located along Kalakaua Avenue, across from Waikiki Beach in
Honolulu, HI. The property completed a $28 million renovation that at issuance
was expected to increase net cash flow. As of February 2009, the trailing
12-month occupancy, average daily rate (ADR) and revenue per available room
(RevPAR) were 78%, $183 and $143, respectively, compared to issuance
expectations of 85.5%, $209 and $179, respectively. The loan matures on May 9,
2009, and has three one-year extension options. The ratings and Outlook reflect
the potential for further decline in performance given the expected stresses to
the property sector and location. 

The third-largest loan is secured by the PHOV Portfolio (11.4%), a portfolio of
11 full-service hotels located in Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, Illinois
and New Jersey. Four of the hotels were affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma
in 2006-2007, with the hotels coming back on line in late 2006 and mid-2007. As
of January 2009, the occupancy, ADR and RevPAR were approximately 66.1%, $129
and $86, respectively, and have improved from the last Fitch rating action. The
ratings and Outlook reflect the current expected economic stresses. 

As of the March 2009 remittance report, the transaction has paid down by
approximately 12.3% (including the subordinate rake classes). All of the
original 22 loans remain in the trust. In addition to the Resorts International
loan, the PHOV Portfolio (11.3%) has exercised a partial release, and as a
result has paid down by 17.6%. Fitch reviewed the most recent servicer provided
operating statement analysis reports for all of the loans. Nine of the senior
pooled notes that remain in the transaction maintain investment-grade shadow
ratings. 

The transaction consists of loans collateralized by hotel properties (72.1%),
retail (19.6%), office (5.6%), multifamily (1.6%) and industrial/warehouse
(1.1%). 

The largest loan is secured by the Walden Galleria (15.4% of the senior trust
components), a mall located in Buffalo, NY. The property completed the addition
of the 300,000 sf ThEATery in the fall of 2007, adding national retailers such
as Barnes &amp; Noble, Urban Outfitters and the Cheesecake Factory. As of December
2008, the mall was approximately 95% occupied. The sponsor is Pyramid. The loan
matures on May 9, 2009 and has three one-year extension options.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM's board on Tuesday raised its dividend by 10 percent and authorized an additional $3 billion worth of share buybacks, underscoring the technology company's relative strength even in a weak economy.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the 14th year in a row that the company has raised its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the latest increase, IBM -- which has a market value of over $130 billion -- had about $3.7 billion remaining from a previously authorized buyback plan at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares rose 2.5 percent to $102.46 at mid-afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the strengthening of our business, we're very comfortable continuing to return profits to our investors even in this difficult environment when others cannot," said Jesse Greene, IBM's vice president of financial management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's quarterly revenue fell by 11 percent in the first quarter, but cost-cuts helped limit the fall in net profit.

major banks may need to raise more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worries lingered over the economic impact from the threat
of a flu pandemic, as New Zealand and Israel were the latest
countries to confirm cases of a new strain of flu linked to
dozens of deaths in Mexico. (For details, see
[ID:nN27476506])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) gave the Dow
its biggest boost, up 1.9 percent at $101.80 after its board
approved a 10 percent increase in its dividend and authorized
a stock buyback, highlighting resilience in a tough economic
climate. For details see [ID:nN28305761]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators have
told Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) they
may need to raise more capital. The shortfall amounts to
billions of dollars at BofA, the newspaper said, citing people
familiar with the bank. The paper added it is likely the U.S.
Federal Reserve will have determined that other banks might
also need more capital. [ID:nBNG118035]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Two days in a row, where you walked in with a pretty weak
preopening market largely driven by what's gone on overseas,
swine flu, etc and we managed to come back -- that's a sign of
a healthy market," said Kevin Kruszenski, head of listed
trading at KeyBanc Capital Markets in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A lot of this (bank decline) has been telegraphed --
banks have started to retreat and digest a little bit of the
move that they've had, they've had a pretty nice move off the
bottom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 47.86
points, or 0.60 percent, to 8,072.86. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX rose 4.63 points, or 0.54 percent, to 862.14.
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 5.24 points, or 0.31
percent, to 1,684.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup is talking to the U.S. government about its
capital levels after receiving early results of its stress
test, but if it needs more capital, the bank does not expect
to get it from the government, people familiar with the matter
told Reuters. [ID:nWEN7981]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America shares tumbled 6.2 percent to $8.38 and
was the top weight on the blue-chip Dow, while Citigroup lost
5.2 percent to $2.91, but both were off session lows. The KBW
Bank index .BKX slid 0.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nasdaq, shares of Dendreon (DNDN.O) were halted, down
45.2 percent at $11.81, after a closely watched study showed
the company's experimental cancer vaccine improved three-year
survival of patients with advanced prostate cancer by 38
percent, compared with a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the economic front, a report showed prices of
single-family homes fell in February, but the rapid pace of
decline slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An April index of consumer confidence rose to its highest
this year with some expectations that the recession is
reaching a bottom. [ID:nNYS005024][ID:nN28301794]

&lt;p&gt;NEEDHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
The SOA Consortium today announced that a podcast and slide deck of the
presentation by IBM`s Sandy Carter, VP, SOA, BPM and WebSphere, on "Smart SOA
Approach Can Help in a Tough Economic Climate," recorded at the March 2009
meeting of the SOA Consortium in Washington, D.C. are now available. To access
the podcast, visit http://www.soa-consortium.org/pr-dc-sc. 

Sandy Carter began her presentation by sharing that customers are asking about,
and employing, service-orientation and business process management not only to
survive the economic crisis, but also to thrive and become more successful when
the economic crisis ends. To this point, CEOs are equally concerned with cost
optimization and agility. Carter was careful to distinguish cost optimization -
re-using services, optimizing processes - from non-sustainable cost cutting. 

In addition to the economic climate, Carter spoke of marketplace changes based
on technology location and proliferation. There are one billion transistors for
each person on earth. One trillion things connected to the Internet. And, by
2010, there will be 30 billion RFID tags embedded into our world. This pervasive
connectivity and instrumentation provides innumerable opportunities to smarten
our companies, countries and environment.

&lt;p&gt;CD Set for Release on July 21
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Kenny Loggins, one of pop music`s greatest hit makers with over 25 million
albums sold worldwide, is back with All Join In, a lovingly crafted, extremely
entertaining, up-tempo collection of songs - a musical gumbo to please long time
fans, parents and children alike. Commenting on the album Loggins says: "All
Join In...It`s like putting on an old sweater. I want everyone to feel
comfortable and have a sense they know what they`re getting." 

The album - produced by Loggins and Jesse Seidenberg - includes fresh, creative
takes of classics such as The Beatles' "All Together Now" and "Two Of Us" (the
latter being his first studio recording in decades with Jim Messina), Randy
Newman's "You`ve Got A Friend In Me," The Del Vikings' 1950's classic "Come Go
With Me," the heart-warming ballad "Ghandi/Buddha" (Cheryl Wheeler), Traffic`s
"You Can All Join In" (appropriately joined by the song`s writer and former
Traffic member Dave Mason) and Donovan`s 1960's classic "First There Is A
Mountain." Loggins` 11-year old daughter Hana contributes vocals on "First There
is A Mountain" and all five of his children provide backing vocals in various
tracks throughout the album. 

Loggins adds: "Even in a life that`s been so full of music, All Join In feels
unique and meaningful to me, both as a musician and - perhaps even more so - as
a parent myself." 

Loggins wrote two of the CD`s 13 tracks, "Long Tailed Cat" and "Moose `N Me,"
dedicated to Kenny`s pet dog of long ago - both songs were written more than 30
years ago. Also featured on All Join In is the song "Underneath the Same Sky,"
culled from the soundtrack to the Disney animated film, "My Friends Tigger &amp;
Pooh: And a Musical Too." 

TRACK LIST: 

1) "Underneath The Same Sky" 

2) "All Together Now" 

3) "You Got A Friend In Me" 

4) "2 Of Us" 

5) "Come Go With Me" 

6) "First There Is A Mountain" 

7) "Puppy Song" 

8) "You Can All Join In" 

9) "Gandhi/Buddha" 

10) "Long Tailed Cat" 

11) "Your Lollipop" 

12) "Moose `n Me" 

13) "1234" 

14) "Go Fish" 

After a string of successful singles and albums with Loggins &amp; Messina
(including "Your Mama Don't Dance," "Danny's Song" ), Kenny broke as a solo
artist, with such hits as ("Whenever I Call You Friend," "This Is It,"
"Celebrate Me Home" ). Throughout the years, he enjoyed hit after hit, many from
popular soundtracks like Footloose, Caddyshack ("I'm Alright") and Top Gun
("Danger Zone" ). He also co-wrote one of the great singles of all time, the
Song of the Year Grammy-winning "What a Fool Believes," which both he and the
Doobie Brothers recorded. Kenny also became the first major rock star to
dedicate himself to recording music for children. His album, Return To Pooh
Corner, is still the best-selling children's album of the last 20 years. 

Kenny continues to write and record, and will embark on a Loggins &amp; Messina tour
later this summer and throughout the fall. 

All Join In will be available on July 21, 2009 on Disney Pearl, a Walt Disney
Records imprint.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Apr 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Tripwire, the leading provider of configuration control solutions for
virtual and physical infrastructure, today announced its new Tripwire
Compliance Management Pack for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager
2007 R2. With this new data center management solution, for the first
time Microsoft System Center users will be able to understand and support
compliance just as they do performance and availability, without the need
to learn a new tool.

    Tripwire Enterprise contains a massive library of preconfigured IT
policies for physical and virtual data center infrastructure and each
policy has configurable severity and responses upon violation. When the
monitored infrastructure moves out of compliance based on pre-configured
monitors, Tripwire escalates the exception to Microsoft System Center
Operations Manager 2007. Specific recommendations for each exception are
offered, along with step-by-step instructions to correct non-compliant
settings. Customers have the choice of remediating manually or
automatically via System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM).

    With the combination of Tripwire Enterprise and Microsoft Systems Center
Operation Manager 2007, users will be able to monitor, manage and control
heterogeneous IT configurations for continuous security and compliance,
helping maintain established change management policies, and alerting
users to non-compliant configuration changes. Systems Center Operations
Manager users will be able to meet compliance objectives without having
to learn specific compliance details, as Tripwire Enterprise brings that
knowledge directly to Microsoft users. Instead, users can focus on
keeping systems available and healthy -- all while ensuring compliance.

    "System Center delivers broad management capabilities across the physical
and virtualized IT infrastructure, helping customers to drive down costs,
improve overall operational efficiency and have more control over their
entire environments," said Ryan O'Hara, director System Center Product
Management, Microsoft. "Tripwire's IT compliance solution, which
integrates with Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2,
delivers capabilities that enable enterprises to extend management
configuration control and compliance across physical and virtual
infrastructure."

    Tripwire released the Tripwire Compliance Management Pack for Microsoft
System Center Operations Manager 2007 in February 2009 to a select group
of customers and already has 25 customers using the integration
successfully within their environment. It is now available worldwide as
an integration add-on to customers using Tripwire Enterprise version 7.5V
or later. Additional details are available at
www.tripwire.com/solutions/TCMP-SCOM/.

    "Tripwire and Microsoft worked together to deliver its customers a single
destination for managing heterogeneous IT environments -- across vendors
and environments," said Dwayne Melancon, vice president of Corporate and
Business Development at Tripwire. "Through the System Center management
suite, Tripwire Enterprise allows customers to measure against their
security, compliance and operational policies, and maintain continuous
compliance across the data center."

    Tripwire is presenting and exhibiting at the Microsoft Management Summit
(MMS) 2009 as part of a group of "PRO-enabled" management packs, helping
enterprises maintain a secure, compliant, and consistent IT environment.
Mr. Melancon will be blogging and tweeting this year from the floor of the
MMS event. Customers can follow his communication missives by logging onto

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Apr 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Microsoft Management Summit - BridgeWays, a division of Xandros, today
launched an initial set of application management packs in the extensive
BridgeWays product line that enables system administrators to manage
business critical applications on Windows, Linux, and Unix from a single
console. The new line of management packs helps extend Microsoft System
Center Operations Manager 2007 R2 to additional business applications on
Windows and to the 85% of enterprise data centers with cross-platform
environments.

    An initial management pack released today extends System Center
capabilities to the management of VMware ESX/ESXi. Management packs for
Oracle Database, MySQL Database, and JBoss Application Server running on
Red Hat Enterprise Server, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Solaris, and
Windows, will be released in conjunction with the general availability of
the System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2. An Apache web server
management pack for Red Hat, SUSE and Solaris will also be released at
that time. The product line, which will continue to expand, was developed
under the broad technology and business collaboration agreement between
Microsoft and Xandros.

    "Customer IT environments are often times comprised of a complex software
and hardware mix and System Center delivers broad management capabilities
across the heterogeneous physical and virtual enterprise to address
these," said Larry Orecklin, General Manager, System Center Marketing,
Management and Services Division, Microsoft. "Our work with companies,
such as Xandros with their knowledge of open source software, commercial
LOB applications, and virtualization, expands our System Center
Operations Manager R2 cross platform capabilities and management benefits
deeper into the datacenter. The result is that customers can leverage
their existing knowledge of the System Center suite to manage across
their enterprise, in turn lowering complexity and costs."

    "Our clients are looking at technology differently, with an eye on cost
and efficiency. BridgeWays provides an opportunity for organizations to
enhance the efficiency of IT operations and lower their operating costs,"
said Doug Miller, Microsoft Practice Architect at CDW. "The increasing
number of control systems in data centers, each with its separate
console, monitoring techniques, and operator controls, has been a growing
source of pain over the years for nearly everyone. BridgeWays brings a
welcome change of simplified management and lower costs across a variety
of technologies in the data center."

    "This is the first installment of the extensive capabilities we are
bringing to System Center Operations Manager to help organizations reduce
costs and enhance efficiency during these stressful financial times. We
are very excited to roll out our new BridgeWays line that will give system
administrators centralized control of key enterprise applications on
Windows, Linux, and Unix," said Andreas Typaldos, CEO of Xandros. "Thanks
to the cross platform monitoring capabilities in the new System Center
Operations Manager, we are able to quickly go to market with these vital
administrative tools, tailored to our knowledge of real-world customer
experiences."

    Showcased at Microsoft Management Summit

    The BridgeWays Management Packs for Microsoft System Center are showcased
at the BridgeWays booth # 317 at the Microsoft Management Summit in Las
Vegas, Nevada, April 27-30, 2009. Free software downloads for testing and
review are available from the BridgeWays web site at www.bridgeways.ca.

Resource Efficiency
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV), a global leader in Application Delivery
Networking, today announced new F5 Management PackTM software for Microsoft
System Center Operations Manager 2007. Available as a software plug-in, the F5
Management Pack enables Microsoft and F5 customers to conveniently monitor and
automate responses to changing infrastructure conditions to efficiently allocate
dynamic network, application, and server resources. 

With F5 and Microsoft solutions working in concert, organizations gain
actionable visibility across the entire Application Delivery Networking
infrastructure. By giving joint customers essential insight into the performance
of network devices, application traffic, and other infrastructure variables, the
F5 Management Pack also enables customers to set policies ensuring rapid,
automated response to dynamic network conditions.

Highlights of the F5 Management Pack

As a plug-in to Microsoft`s System Center Operations Manager 2007, the F5
Management Pack enables organizations to:

* Simplify IT Management through Enhanced Visibility
By monitoring the performance of F5 and Microsoft devices, as well as the
surrounding infrastructure, F5 Management Pack helps administrators see a
clearer picture of present network and application traffic conditions. F5
Management Pack leverages System Center Operations Manager`s advanced health
modeling capabilities and sophisticated reporting structure, allowing
administrators to conveniently analyze performance data for trending and
forecasting, and enabling them to better plan and budget for IT initiatives.

* Adapt to Changing Application and Network Conditions to Improve IT Efficiency
F5 Management Pack works with Systems Center Operations Manager to ensure that
content and applications are continually optimized and securely delivered. F5`s
PowerShell-enabled iControl API and the customizable iRules scripting language
enable System Center to proactively modify network resources to ensure the best
end-user experience. By adapting to performance conditions, available
application resources, and user demand, the F5 Management Pack helps Microsoft
customers realize OpEx savings by reducing the time and personnel necessary to
manage application delivery environments.

* Support Microsoft`s Vision for a Dynamic, Virtualized Infrastructure
F5 Management Pack supports dynamic provisioning capabilities to bring
additional server and application resources online as user demand increases, as
well as taking these extended resources offline when demand returns to normal
levels. The F5 Management Pack includes capabilities that support an automated,
virtualized, and highly efficient data center through interoperability with
System Center Virtual Machine Manager, Hyper-V, and other Microsoft solutions.

 (Updates to midday, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose modestly on
Tuesday as a dividend hike at IBM and reassuring data that
could signal a bottom in the economic cycle offset concerns
that major banks may need to raise more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worries over the economic impact of the threat of a flu

stock buyback, underscoring strength amid a tough economic
climate. For details see [ID:nN28305761]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators have
told Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) they
may need to raise more capital. The shortfall amounts to
billions of dollars at BofA, the newspaper said, citing people
familiar with the bank. The paper added it is likely the U.S.
Federal Reserve will have determined other banks might also
need more capital. [ID:nBNG118035]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM is strong, and that is also helping the Dow, and some
tech stocks are a little firmer," said David Bellantonio, head
of trading at Instinet in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is not a ton of conviction, but considering the
negative news (on banks) it seems to be pretty good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bellantonio said the flu outbreak is a concern, adding that

the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 8.36 points,

Citigroup lost 5 percent to $2.92, but both were off session

single-family homes fell in February, but the rapid pace of
decline slowed. Consumer confidence rose to its highest this
year with some expectations the recession is reaching a bottom.

&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
HP (NYSE:HPQ) today announced HP Insight Control suite for Microsoft System
Center (HP ICE-SC), the industry`s first integrated management environment to
lower infrastructure costs and improve uptime of HP server and Microsoft
software environments. 

By integrating the server management features of HP ProLiant and HP BladeSystem
into Microsoft System Center consoles, administrators can gain increased
visibility into, and greater control of, their technology environments. This
enhanced visibility into the health of IT systems enables a faster response in
the event of server failure, reducing the risk of downtime. By automating server
deployments and updates, administrative productivity is also greatly improved. 

A crucial part of the HP Adaptive Infrastructure strategy is to provide the
strongest management experience for HP ProLiant and BladeSystem servers. The new
HP ICE-SC enables administrators to monitor and respond to software and hardware
events through the Microsoft System Center consoles. This includes:

* Server health warnings and prefailure condition alerts with Microsoft System
Center Operations Manager (SCOM) 2007; 
* Proactive virtual machine management using Microsoft System Center Virtual
Machine Manager (SCVMM) 2008; and 
* Enhanced configuration management via Microsoft System Center Configuration
Manager (SCCM) 2007.

HP ICE-SC also provides more than 25 performance and resource optimization tips
for Microsoft SCVMM, including recommended actions for host system alerts and
events. Greater insight into the relationship between host and virtual machines
allows administrators to resolve potential server performance problems to
maintain maximum uptime. 

With a simple-to-use wizard-based tool, HP ICE-SE enables administrators to
configure server hardware and deploy server operating systems via Microsoft SCCM
in a single operation. This transforms lengthy manual deployments into a highly
automated process that significantly reduces deployment time of HP ProLiant or
BladeSystem servers. 

"Now more than ever, customers need deeper insight and more precise management
control of their HP servers in a Microsoft environment," said Scott Farrand,
vice president, Infrastructure Software and BladeSystem, HP. "HP ICE-SC achieves
a new level of integration that will enable customers to maximize their HP and
Microsoft technology investments." 

HP ICE-SC customer benefits include:

* Increased uptime: Uptime is ensured through quick problem troubleshooting and
improved system recovery, even when the system is powered off or no longer
responding. Integration with leading remote management functionality from HP
Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) Advanced allows administrators to control HP servers
anytime, in any location - directly from the Microsoft SCOM console. 
* Reclaimed trapped power: Customers can increase the number of servers
threefold using the same power allocation and infrastructure with HP Dynamic
Power Capping capabilities.(1) This is done by safely capping power usage to fit
more servers within existing power envelopes. Access to historical power usage
for accurate budget and capacity planning is also provided. 
* Simplified virtualization: Businesses can quickly adapt to the changing
demands for business services through integration with Microsoft SCVMM. By
automatically migrating virtual machines based on the health of the underlying
host, the virtual infrastructure is more responsive to changes.

"HP has taken a significant step toward delivering seamless, comprehensive
hardware management integration across the Microsoft System Center suite,
helping companies maximize their existing technology investments," said Brad
Anderson, general manager, Management and Services Division, Microsoft. "For
customers with HP ProLiant and BladeSystem hardware, HP Insight Control suite
for Microsoft System Center extends deep control of their infrastructure
directly from System Center to more effectively manage across their enterprise,
lowering costs and improving performance." 

HP ICE-SC includes a full year of 24/7 phone support, providing unmatched
service levels. It will be available in June for download from www.hp.com as
well as from select partners. This solution also includes access to software
updates. Pricing starts at $549.(2)

HP and Microsoft have a 25-year-plus history of executive-level integration,
joint engineering, research and development, and joint solutions development.
The only worldwide Microsoft prime integrator, HP is one of Microsoft`s largest
partners and offers more than 30,000 technology services experts globally. More
information on HP ICE-SC is available at www.hp.com/go/ICESystemCenter.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb reported lower earnings that beat expectations on Tuesday, but the U.S. drugmakers relied on aggressive cost cuts to make up for disappointing sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer cholesterol fighter Lipitor, the company's biggest product, lost ground to cheaper generic forms of Merck  Co's Zocor. And Chantix, a new smoking-cessation drug Pfizer had hoped would become a blockbuster, crumbled on concerns that it causes suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many Bristol drugs scored revenue gains, sales of its Erbitux colon cancer medicine fell sharply on continued confusion about which patients it is most likely to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer and Bristol-Myers, in the face of a very challenging environment, continue to beat expectations and to maintain growing cash flows," said Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that they, like U.S. rivals that have already reported quarterly earnings, had cut costs sharply and were therefore able to beat forecasts despite the strengthening dollar, which hurts the value of overseas sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, said net profit fell 2 percent to $2.73 billion, or 40 cents per share, from a year earlier, when the company took acquisition-related charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 54 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 49 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global revenue fell 8 percent to $10.87 billion, about $180 million below expectations. It would have fallen only 3 percent if not for the stronger dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing and administrative expenses and the cost of goods fell significantly, bolstering results. But the tax rate rose 6 percentage points due to costs of financing Pfizer's planned purchase of Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's operating expenses were $1 billion lower than expected, according to Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor sales fell 13 percent to $2.72 billion. Chantix sales dropped 36 percent to $177 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Pfizer oncology drugs fell 13 percent to $552 million, as colon cancer treatment Camptosar faced generic competition. The drug's sales fell 43 percent to $109 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the few important Pfizer drugs posting higher revenue was Lyrica. Sales of the neuropathic pain treatment rose 17 percent to $684 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been one of the most poorly performing drugmakers over the past decade, its sales and shares ravaged by an inability to develop big-selling new medicines despite costly mergers with U.S. rivals Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is back on the megamerger trail, with plans later this year to scoop up Wyeth in a deal valued at $68 billion when announced in late January. It is hoping Wyeth's drugs will offset an anticipated drop in Lipitor sales when the product faces generic competition in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers said its quarterly profit slipped 3 percent as the strong dollar and lower sales of Erbitux more than offset higher revenue from other medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings fell to $638 million, or 32 cents per share, from $661 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, profit was 48 cents per share, a tad better than the 47 cents analysts had forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said sales rose 3 percent to $5.02 billion, about $125 million shy of Wall Street expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of blood clot preventer Plavix jumped 10 percent to $1.44 billion, while schizophrenia treatment Abilify soared 30 percent to $589 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Erbitux revenue fell 12 percent to $164 million, hurt by confusion over whether patients should first take a genetic test to better predict whether the medicine would be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers shares were down 62 cents, or 3 percent, at $19.92 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Pfizer slipped 28 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $13.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Derek Caney and Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc
WAMUQ.PK has filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) seeking the return of more than $4 billion in cash
deposits which it lost access to when its bank was sold last
year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Washington Mutual Bank was closed by the U.S. government in
September, in the largest bank failure in U.S. history. Its
banking assets were sold the same day to JPMorgan for $1.9
billion, and the parent holding company filed for bankruptcy
protection a day later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a lawsuit filed late Monday in U.S. bankruptcy court in
Delaware, WaMu said that JPMorgan has "wrongfully withheld" more
than $4 billion in cash that the parent company had on deposit
at Washington Mutual Bank at the time of the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WaMu said in the lawsuit that JPMorgan improperly claims it
acquired the deposits as part of the takeover transaction, when
they should have been treated like any other deposit at the
bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The cornerstone of the agreement by which JPMC acquired
the assets was that all Bank depositors would have immediate
and ready access to their cash on deposit," WaMu said in the
lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WaMu said it needs access to that cash to come up with its
Chapter 11 plan, and that by withholding the deposits, JPMorgan
could be earning as much as $200 million per year in interest on
those deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman in Chicago declined to comment
on the lawsuit, saying "we do not comment on ongoing
litigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit was filed as an adversary proceeding to WaMu's
main bankruptcy case. The bankruptcy case is In re: Washington
Mutual, Inc. U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No.
08-12229.

Mach IBM Board Approves 10 Percent Increase in Quarterly Cash Dividend; Board Authorizes $3.0 Billion for Stock Repurchase</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
The IBM (NYSE: IBM) board of directors today declared a regular quarterly cash
dividend of $0.55 per common share, payable June 10, 2009 to stockholders of
record May 8, 2009. 

Today`s dividend declaration represents an increase of $0.05, or 10 percent
higher than the prior quarterly dividend of $0.50 per common share. 

IBM has increased its quarterly dividend by 175 percent since 2006. This is the
14th year in a row that IBM has increased its quarterly cash dividend. 

With the payment of the June 10 dividend, IBM will have paid consecutive
quarterly dividends every year since 1916. 

The board today also authorized $3 billion in additional funds for use in the
company`s stock repurchase program. IBM said it will repurchase shares on the
open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market
conditions. 

This amount is in addition to approximately $3.7 billion remaining at the end of
March from a prior authorization. With this new authorization, IBM will have
approximately $6.7 billion for its stock repurchase program. 

"IBM`s model of profitable growth and strong cash flow enables the company to
continue to deliver value to our shareholders. We demonstrated this commitment
by returning $2.5 billion in the first quarter through dividends and share
repurchase, and our continued solid performance allows us to increase
shareholder return, as we are doing today" said Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM
chairman, president and chief executive officer.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Tuesday, as cost-cutting helped offset sharply lower sales of its Lipitor cholesterol fighter and its Chantix smoking-cessation drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lipitor sales were hurt by competition from inexpensive generic forms of Merck  Co's Zocor and AstraZeneca Plc's potent Crestor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Chantix, a relatively new drug that Pfizer had hoped would become an engine of profit growth, crumbled on concerns it causes agitation and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest drugmaker said net profit fell 2 percent to $2.73 billion, or 40 cents per share. That compared with $2.78 billion, or 41 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter, when Pfizer took acquisition-related charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 54 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 49 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company global revenue fell 8 percent to $10.87 billion, about $180 million below Wall Street expectations. Revenue would have fallen only 3 percent if not for the strengthening dollar, which lowers the value of overseas sales when converted back into U.S. currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted, selling, informational and administrative expenses and the cost of goods declined significantly, bolstering results. But taxes rose 6 percentage points due to costs of financing Pfizer's planned purchase of smaller U.S. rival Wyeth, crimping overall profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's operating expenses were $1 billion lower than expected, wrote Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor sales fell 13 percent to $2.72 billion. Chantix sales dropped 36 percent to $177 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of oncology drugs fell 13 percent to $552 million, as colon cancer treatment Camptosar began facing generic competition. The drug's sales plunged 43 percent to $109 million. Sutent, which treats kidney and stomach cancer, rose 7 percent to $202 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the few other important drugs posting higher revenue was Lyrica, a treatment for neuropathic pain which rose 17 percent to $684 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been one of the most poorly performing drugmakers over the past decade, its sales and shares ravaged by an inability to develop big-selling new medicines despite costly mergers with U.S. rivals Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The struggling giant is back on the mega-merger trail, with plans later this year to scoop up Wyeth in a deal valued at $68 billion when announced in late January. It is hoping Wyeth's drugs will offset expected plunging sales of Lipitor, when Pfizer's biggest product faces generic competition in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To complete the Wyeth deal, Pfizer said it would halve its dividend, effective with its second-quarter payout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, confronted with expected sharply lower 2009 earnings, has vowed to cut 15 percent of the combined company's workforce of about 130,000 employees and close some manufacturing sites. As with big past deals, that would provide huge cost savings that will prop up earnings for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is whether Pfizer's laboratories will be able to break out of their long funk, and deliver big-selling new products needed for long-term company growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer rose 19 cents to $13.69 in premarket activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Random Password Manager and Random Password Manager Integrate with
Microsoft System Center to Deliver World-class Privileged Account Password
Management Solutions


LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Lieberman Software today announced a software integration initiative that will
enable its privileged account management solutions, Enterprise Random Password
Manager and Random Password Manager, to tightly integrate with Microsoft System
Center to give enterprises the power to securely manage local administrator and
cross-platform root accounts for GRC compliance. 

Many organizations set their local privileged accounts to the same name and
password, or never change these critical accounts. In an environment of internal
and external threats, this decision can lead to the total compromise of security
and compliance. This integration gives enterprise organizations the ability to
securely manage powerful privileged accounts from within the System Center
environment. Specifically, Lieberman Software provides management packs for
Enterprise Random Password Manager and Random Password Manager, as well as
privileged account password management directly from the consoles of Microsoft
System Center Configuration Manager 2007 and Microsoft System Center Operations
Manager 2007. 

"We are extremely excited to take our relationship with Microsoft to the next
level," said Chris Stoneff, product manager at Lieberman Software. "The
management and control of shared and privileged account passwords of all type is
a demanding security and compliance concern for today`s enterprise. Integrating
our privileged account password solutions with Microsoft System Center will
provide our mutual customers with a world-class security solution that meets the
mandated password update and identity management standards of Sarbanes-Oxley,
PCI DSS and other regulatory compliance regulations." 

Lieberman Software`s privileged account password solutions extend the value of
the Microsoft System Center infrastructure in three key ways:

* Confirm Regulatory Compliance and Service Level Completion

Security compliance regulations - such as PCI DSS, Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA,
NERC/FERC - call for frequent changes to privileged account passwords to prevent
unauthorized personnel from being able to access mission-critical systems.
Enterprise Random Password Manager and Random Password Manager help
organizations accomplish this mandate by identifying and tracking where
credentials are used, and scheduling regular password changes that
comprehensively impact every system, application, and object affected by the
change. By enabling Enterprise Random Password Manager and Random Password
Manager to be managed and monitored by Microsoft System Center Operations
Manager through a management pack provided by Lieberman Software, customers will
receive real-time alerts should external factors, such as network or database
problems, cause disruptions to regulatory-based Service Level Agreements (SLA)
requirements.

* Alert Administrators to Privileged Account Activity

Lieberman products integrate seamlessly with Microsoft System Center Operations
Manager to alert administrators to what users and the Help Desk are doing with
privileged accounts from a single console. Enterprise Random Password Manager
and Random Password Manager feed events to Systems Center based on password
change, password verification, and password check-in/check-out job results.
These events can be used by customers to automatically open and close trouble
tickets based on end-user behavior and system responses to password management
tasks.

* Retrieve Administrator Passwords Directly from Microsoft System Center
Console

Regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley and PCI DSS require that privileged accounts
be secure and have limited and audited access. The users of Microsoft System
Center Operations Manager have a need for this information as part of their
operational duties. By integrating Enterprise Random Password Manager and Random
Password Manager into the GUI shell of System Center Operations Manager and
System Center Configuration Manager, without going outside of the System Center
environment, access to privileged accounts is quick and secure. 

"The System Center suite delivers the capabilities that customers need to
optimize their IT infrastructure from client to datacenter, while monitoring
operations and other critical activities such as those related to compliance,"
Ryan O`Hara, Director, System Center Product Management, Microsoft. "The
solutions that Lieberman Software delivers for extending password and
credentials management in System Center can benefit our mutual customers by
helping to better ensure their compliance with regulations." 

The announcement was made at Microsoft Management Summit 2009 where Lieberman
Software is exhibiting in booth 222.

&lt;p&gt;  SCHAUMBURG, IL and LAS VEGAS, NV, Apr 28 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
Acresso Software announced today at the Microsoft Management Summit (MMS)
that it has released a first to market capability: AdminStudio can now
directly convert existing physical application packages to the virtual
format for use with Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V), part of
the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack, the most broadly distributed
application virtualization technology. With the latest release of
AdminStudio, organizations can accelerate the creation, testing and
management of virtual applications being deployed through App-V, making
AdminStudio a beneficial component to enable customers to rapidly prepare
virtual applications and expedite App-V implementations.

    AdminStudio accelerates virtual deployments by converting applications
into the App-V format natively, without the use of the App-V Sequencer.
AdminStudio also speeds virtual application packaging and deployment above
and beyond the use of the native sequencing process, by offering vital
time and effort saving tools, including:

--  an automated process to migrate a single application, a few .EXEs, or
    an entire library of MSI-based applications to the App-V virtual format

--  editing and customization of virtual and traditional applications via
    the award-winning InstallShield(R) technology built into AdminStudio

--  a pre-virtualization scan which helps to determine which existing
    applications are the best candidates for virtualization before being
    deployed in a virtual environment

--  a combined application catalog to manage package-centric business
    practices, including updates for virtual applications deployed via App-V
    and traditional applications deployed through System Center Configuration
    Manager

--  a direct integration with Acresso Workflow Manager, the blueprint tool
    for managing application readiness, application virtualization, OS
    migrations, and other desktop management processes.
    

    
In beta use, AdminStudio users have seen physical to virtual
application conversion times reduced from weeks to just a few hours.
AdminStudio automated tools for converting applications, including batch
conversion functionality, have migrated application libraries of over 200
applications from the MSI format to the App-V format in less than two
hours.

    Acresso developed the AdminStudio support for App-V based on a long
history of working with Microsoft. As a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner
and a member of the System Center Alliance, Acresso has a unique
development focus on the needs of customers using Microsoft products.
Acresso, maker of InstallShield, has been the leader in creating software
installations for decades. Acresso leverages this expertise to develop
AdminStudio, a key tool for ensuring traditional and virtual deployments
run well in the entire enterprise and meet the needs of end users.

    "Windows customers realize significant time and cost savings by using
App-V. AdminStudio extends these benefits by accelerating the important
first step of preparing and a creating virtual application -- which helps
IT more quickly and reliably implement App-V," said Karri Alexion-Tiernan,
Director of Product Management for App-V, Microsoft Corporation.

    "AdminStudio's direct conversion of existing MSI packages to the App-V
format enables organizations to leverage the investment they have already
made in physical application packaging on their path to virtual
applications, and does so using a familiar and proven interface," said
Steve Schmidt, Vice President of Product Management for Acresso. "Acresso
is very proud to be first to market with this revolutionary technology."

    About AdminStudio

    Over 10,000 enterprises use AdminStudio, recognized as the most widely
utilized solution in the market for traditional and virtual application
readiness. AdminStudio hands off completed packages to all leading
distribution systems, including Microsoft's System Center Configuration
Manager, Novell's ZENworks, LANDesk's Management Suite, and many others.
When coupled with the Workflow Manager Web-based process management
solution, enterprises can quickly establish efficient processes around
application readiness.

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Silect Software, Inc., a leading provider of deployment and management solutions
for Microsoft System Center environments, today announced its latest releases of
MP Studio for System Center Operations Manager 2007 and CP Studio for System
Center Configuration Manager 2007 and its Desired Configuration Management
capabilities. Silect has enhanced its MP Studio product offering to include an
intuitive Management Pack development center and Workflow Automation. Silect`s
CP Studio solution will now include robust version management for Desired
Configuration Management (DCM) Configuration Packs. Together, these new products
further Silect`s commitment to helping customers simplify the deployment and
management of Microsoft System Center. 

Silect will be exhibiting its product solutions including MP Studio and CP
Studio at the Microsoft Management Summit (MMS) in Las Vegas through April 30th.
"Companies are searching for ways to reduce costs, increase efficiency and
improve the effectiveness of their IT infrastructure," said Harold Dyck,
President, Silect Software, Inc. "The offerings announced today bring extensive
improvements in the efficiency of managing IT environments with System Center
Operations Manager 2007 and Configuration Manager 2007 DCM environments, while
utilizing existing resources to perform tasks that would otherwise require more
in-depth skill sets regarding the internal structures of Management Packs and
Configuration Packs." 

"Microsoft System Center delivers broad management capabilities and partners,
such as System Center Alliance member Silect Software, are critical to deeply
extending those capabilities for IT environments," said Ryan O`Hara, Director,
System Center Product Management, Microsoft. "Silect`s product offerings can
help customers more quickly and easily author new System Center management packs
and configuration packs for deeper monitoring of their specific IT environment."


Included in this release, Silect`s new "MP Studio Development Center"
facilitates the simplified, yet rich authoring of new Management Packs using
intuitive wizards, as well as the editing of existing Management Packs in a
fraction of the time it would take if done manually. Limited availability of
knowledgeable IT professionals familiar with the complexity of Management Packs
can lead to storms of unwarranted alerts and delayed implementation time. MP
Studio greatly reduces the complexity of Management Pack authoring and
customization while maintaining flexibility and control through an intuitive,
easy-to-use interface. 

MP Studio then facilitates the management of these Management Pack changes
throughout the lifecycle, with extensive capabilities for testing, tuning,
version control, documentation and audit tracking. MP Studio`s new workflow
automation capabilities announced today provide integrated guidance on Silect`s
Best Practices Methodology for Management Pack workflow. These enhancements help
companies bring ITIL/MOF best practices to Management Pack implementation and
change management and achieve greater efficiency in managing Management Packs. 

For Configuration Manager/DCM environments, this new release of CP Studio will
include a primary repository of Configuration Packs for centralized version
management as well as backup and change history. These new capabilities help
companies bring ITIL/MOF best practices to Configuration Pack implementation and
change management and maintain a complete audit trail of all Configuration Pack
changes. 

Silect`s MP Studio and CP Studio enable a marked reduction in the deployment
time and ongoing maintenance of Operations Manager and Configuration Manager DCM
environments throughout their lifecycle. When looking at a standard deployment,
using MP Studio and CP Studio typically yields an annual savings of well over
50% of personnel time - allowing re-allocation of valuable IT staff to other
important tasks, thus greatly increasing the efficiency of IT teams as well as
the overall System Center deployment. 

"Silect`s MP Studio and CP Studio are key components of managing any System
Center environment," said Robert McBride, Managing Director of Dilignet Pty,
Ltd. "As an implementation services provider specializing in System Center
Operations Manager and Configuration Manager, we are very excited about the new
features of MP Studio and CP Studio. They will help us in the development and
management of custom Management Packs for our customers, as well as managing
Configuration Packs throughout their lifecycle, thus maximizing the time to
value in realizing the benefits of Microsoft System Center."

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
NetIQ Corporation, an Attachmate business, today announced the NetIQ Aegis
Adapter for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager to further integrate,
extend and apply greater automation to this popular management tool. A leader in
Microsoft management, NetIQ extends its IT process automation technology to
reduce the operational expense and event recovery times associated with
Operations Manager, driving immediate cost savings and improved system
availability. 

The demands for IT services continue to increase, yet IT organizations are
limited in their ability to respond accordingly. With this latest NetIQ Aegis
adapter, IT organizations using Operations Manager can integrate data from other
non-Microsoft tools and Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs) to extend its
event management capabilities, resulting in cross-platform event correlation,
problem isolation, hierarchical escalation, approval management and
auto-resolution. 

The automation capabilities of NetIQ Aegis intelligently orchestrate and execute
both basic and advanced features of Operations Manager along with other IT
management tools to reduce manual workloads, eliminate human error and increase
administrator productivity. 

Leveraging the latest features of NetIQ Aegis 2.1, this adapter enables IT
organizations to:

* Raise the priority of events based upon end-user impact in Operations Manager
or other tools, steering focus to high-impact events and reducing downtime. 
* Synchronize Operations Manager alert status, configurations or maintenance
mode with other tools such as ticketing systems or a CMDB, to reduce integration
costs and increase operational productivity. 
* Automate Operations Manager administration, such as agent integrity checks or
assigning the best management server to allocate an agent based on location and
load, reducing the total cost of ownership for Operations Manager. 
* Drive alert resolution through progressive escalations, state changes and
authorizations, reducing unplanned downtime due to missed alerts.

"Now more than ever, organizations are in need of tools that can have an
immediate cost-reduction impact, as opposed to vague efficiency gains - which is
increasingly difficult when various tools lack integration capabilities," said
Travis Greene, service management strategist at NetIQ. "As a long-time pioneer
in Microsoft management, extending the capabilities of NetIQ Aegis to Microsoft
System Center was a natural step. By extending, automating and eliminating
barriers between this management tool and others, IT can best ensure the
availability of business applications and drive cost out of operational
processes." 

Availability and Pricing

List pricing for NetIQ Aegis starts at $25,000 per base server with managed
objects and adapters licensed separately. The NetIQ Aegis Adapter for Microsoft
System Center Operations Manager will be available in May 2009. For more
information, visit www.netiq.com or call NetIQ at 888-323-6768.

&lt;p&gt;Continued Collaboration Offers Customers Choice and Flexibility in Networking
Solutions for Today and Tomorrow`s Data Center
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Juniper Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:JNPR), the leader in high-performance networking,
today announced that Juniper and International Business Machines Corporation
(IBM) are continuing to broaden their relationship. Since 2007, the two
companies have been working together on joint technology solutions, standards
development, network management and managed security services. Specifically in
the data center, IBM has included Juniper Networks switching, routing and
security products into their data center network portfolio with IBM playing an
invaluable role of systems integrator. 

"Juniper is an important supplier of networking products," said Jim Comfort, IBM
vice president, enterprise initiatives. "IBM is already a reseller of Juniper`s
Ethernet switches and routers, and we continue to look for opportunities to
expand this relationship to provide increasing choice for our customers and the
flexibility to support their dynamic infrastructure needs." Learn more about the
IBM and Juniper relationship.

"IBM and Juniper share a common vision to continually evolve information
infrastructures as a strategic element of business success, and together, we are
committed to delivering superior networking solutions to customers," said Hitesh
Sheth, executive vice president and general manager, Ethernet Platforms Business
Group, Juniper Networks. "We`ve been very pleased with our progress to-date with
IBM in our seven collaborative solutions and shared sales goals, especially in
the data center. As we look to the next phase of our relationship, we remain
focused on delivering optimal joint infrastructure solutions for our customers."


Bringing Cloud Computing to Earth

Most recently, the two companies jointly collaborated on a global technology
demonstration highlighting how enterprises can seamlessly extend their private
data center clouds. The demonstration between Silicon Valley and Shanghai showed
a use case where customers could take advantage of remote servers in a secure
public cloud to ensure high priority applications are given preference over the
lower priority ones when computing resources become constrained. IBM and Juniper
are installing these advanced networking capabilities into IBM`s nine worldwide
Cloud Labs for customer engagements. Once installed in the nine worldwide Cloud
Labs, IBM and Juniper will be able to seamlessly move client computing workloads
between private and publicly managed cloud environments, enabling customers to
reliably deliver on service level agreements. 

For the past year, IBM and Juniper have been working together on the Stratus
Project, Juniper`s initiative to create a single data center fabric that will
deliver a quantum jump in scale, performance and simplicity, with the
flexibility to support fully converged and virtualized data center environments.
The Stratus Project will address the modern mega data center`s pain points and
endeavors to enable cloud computing to fulfill its maximum potential. 

Addressing the Challenge of Securing the Cloud

Continued research and innovation in cloud computing security has been another
focus for IBM and Juniper. The companies are jointly researching cloud computing
security models to highlight how customers can mitigate attacks on corporate
data and computer systems.

&lt;p&gt;Global Agreement Diversifies Brocade Routes to Market for Its IP Networking
Portfolio 
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Brocade&#174; (Nasdaq:BRCD) today announced that IBM will rebrand and sell the
Brocade enterprise IP networking family of products through the IBM global sales
force and authorized IBM Business Partners. 

This original equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreement complements and extends the
existing relationship between Brocade and IBM for storage area networking (SAN)
products. Initially, IBM plans to sell the following Brocade IP networking
product families under the OEM agreement, with additional products to be added
over time. IBM will offer multiple models in each product family:

* Brocade NetIron MLX Series as IBM m-series Ethernet routers 
* Brocade NetIron CES 2000 Series as IBM c-series Ethernet switches 
* Brocade FastIron SX Series as IBM s-series Ethernet switches 
* Brocade FastIron GS Series as IBM g-series Ethernet switches

In support of this agreement, Brocade has been working with IBM to develop
customized programs across many key functional areas, including sales,
marketing, training/certification, and technical support/service. 

"This agreement supports IBM`s view of networking as an integral component of
our dynamic infrastructure initiative, which helps customers manage the
convergence of business and IT infrastructures," said Barry Rudolph, vice
president, IBM System Storage. "IBM is focused on providing its customers with
the best networking choices and options, which is why we`re pleased to expand
our relationship with Brocade." 

"This agreement with IBM underscores Brocade`s long-term commitment to its OEM
customers, a strategy we believe delivers the full promise of next-generation
enterprise networking solutions in a pragmatic, non-proprietary way to protect
customers` IT investments," said Mike Klayko, CEO of Brocade. "IBM`s selection
of the Brocade high-performance, high-volume networking product family provides
customers with a very competitive choice in their IT infrastructure. We look
forward to bringing these solutions to market through IBM`s global sales
channel." 

IBM currently rebrands and sells a broad portfolio of Brocade data center
networking products and technologies, including the multiprotocol Brocade DCX&#174;
Backbone along with Fibre Channel directors, standalone and embedded switches,
host bus adapters, and related software. Today`s amended agreement strengthens
and further diversifies Brocade go-to-market routes for its enterprise IP
networking portfolio. Customers will now be able to purchase Brocade networking
products and services through any combination of channels, including OEM
sellers, global resellers, and direct from Brocade. 

"The announcement of an OEM arrangement leverages the strengths of both IBM and
Brocade," said Zeus Kerravala, senior vice president, Global Enterprise Research
at the Yankee Group. "For Brocade specifically, it means that it has secured a
significant new go-to-market route for its enterprise IP networking portfolio
through a respected IT solution provider. This is one of the most tangible proof
points of the growth strategies for the enterprise networking business that
Brocade identified when it acquired Foundry Networks." 

Availability

IBM expects to make these products generally available to customers in May 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Offering Extends System Center Capabilities For Managing Physical, Virtual and
Cloud Computing Environments
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Opalis Software Inc., the market leader in IT Process Automation software,
announces that Opalis will deliver new offerings for System Center to enable
dynamic data center capabilities through the automation of IT operations. The
Opalis offerings include a set of solutions for Virtual Service Management,
Incident Response and Cloud Computing. 

Capabilities include:

* Automation and orchestration for Microsoft delivered private and hosted cloud
environments 
* Virtual lifecycle management to standardize, automate, and control virtual
servers 
* Power management to control energy consumption 
* Automated incident response for improved MTTR 
* Application and service provisioning to deliver on-demand business services 
* Seamless integration across physical, virtual and cloud environments

This partnership provides an integrated solution to orchestrate Microsoft System
Center technologies and automate best practices for infrastructure management.
Opalis is seamlessly integrated with System Center Operations Manager 2007 and
System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 consoles. This enables users to
dynamically respond to failure scenarios or poorly configured components in the
environment. The ability to automate IT operations across the physical, virtual
and cloud computing environments enables IT organizations to maximize resources
and achieve greater agility, while leveraging existing tools and skills. 

"Customers are demanding end to end closed loop orchestration of their physical
and virtual environments. With this announcement, Opalis delivers Microsoft
customers the automation fabric to accelerate the adoption of both
virtualization and cloud computing within the data center" says Yale Tankus, SVP
Marketing and Business Development, Opalis. "Our offering will provide Microsoft
customers with the integrated ease of use and quick time to value they have come
to expect" continued Tankus. 

Opalis Virtual Service Management (VSM)

The Virtual Service Management Solution from Opalis will be available as a fully
integrated component with Microsoft`s Virtual Machine Manager. The VSM solution
will provide virtual lifecycle management with the ability to automate approval,
provisioning, tear down, back up, and restore for virtual servers. The solution
will also enable users to dynamically power up or power down underlying physical
servers based on business need. 

Using System Center Virtual Machine Manager and Opalis customers are able to
apply automated IT operations across their entire virtualized environment
regardless of the platform they are using. The Virtual Service Management
Solution delivers the following key features for Microsoft Virtual Machine
Manager and VMware Vsphere:

* Self service provisioning, de-commissioning, back up and restore of virtual
machines 
* Intelligent power management for servers 
* Integration with Microsoft Systems Center Configuration Manager and Operations
Manager

"IT process automation is being used to enable IT organizations to reduce the
complexity and costs and increase agility and efficiencies for virtual
infrastructures", said David Williams, research VP IT Operations Management,
Gartner. "Mature IT operations process automation products provide a dynamic
capability by orchestrating the IT infrastructure, including operating systems,
IT operations management tools in support of applications and IT service needs.
This is a major step towards enabling the real-time infrastructure" continued
Williams.

Automated Incident Response

Opalis integrates directly with the System Center Operations Manager console and
provides users with a rich set of ITIL compliant actions that triage, diagnose
and remediate problems. During each step of incident handling, the Operations
Manager alert is updated with results, giving operators the insight they need to
repair problems. Automating incident response enforces compliance with best
practices, eliminates human error and can improve MTTR (mean time to repair) by
90%. 

Opalis for Microsoft Delivered Private and Hosted Cloud Computing Environments

Opalis automates and orchestrates Microsoft System Center tools and Microsoft
business applications to provide services on-demand. This enables users to move
resources intelligently and seamlessly between private and hosted environments
quickly, while adhering to best practices that enforce change and compliance. 

Capabilities of the solution include:

* Cloud bursting - Scale capacity up or down based on dynamic events 
* Disaster recovery - Automatically failover to cloud resources and avoid
service interruption 
* Seamlessly move servers and applications between private and hosted
environments

These solutions will be generally available in the third quarter of 2009. 

"Microsoft System Center delivers enterprise management capabilities across the
physical and virtual datacenter to help customers drive down cost and optimize
their infrastructure," said Ryan O`Hara - Director, System Center Product
Management, Microsoft. "Through the extensions that Opalis delivers for

&lt;p&gt;Company Further Distinguishes Itself by Earning a Microsoft Competency in
ISV/Software Solutions
WESTBOROUGH, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
RedTail Solutions, which delivers managed services for electronic data
interchange (EDI) and global data synchronization (GDS) to mid-market suppliers,
today announced that it has attained Gold Certified Partner status in the
Microsoft Partner Program with a competency in ISV/Software Solutions,
recognizing Redtail`s expertise and impact in the technology marketplace. 

As a Gold Certified Partner, RedTail has demonstrated expertise with Microsoft
technologies and a proven ability to meet customers` needs. Microsoft Gold
Certified partners receive a rich set of benefits, including access, training
and support, giving them a competitive advantage in the channel. 

RedTail`s managed EDI and GDS services solution implements Microsoft`s
Software-plus-Services approach, bringing the benefits of a service-based
solution to customers and partners alike. Its managed services solution
optimizes the order-to-cash cycle for mid-market manufacturers and distributors
selling to large trading partners like Wal-Mart and The Home Depot. Key to
RedTail`s success is the solution`s seamless integration with today`s most
popular mid-market business accounting solutions. 

According to Bob Gleason, RedTail`s president and CEO, "RedTail is delivering
today on Microsoft`s Software-plus-Services vision and this certification
reinforces our strategic commitment to that vision. Our customers are realizing
the benefits of a managed service solution every day - accelerated order to cash
cycles, improved accuracy and a reduction in cost and risk." 

"Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap between
their business demands and technology capabilities," said Allison Watson,
corporate vice president of the Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "They
need to trust in a company that can act as an expert adviser for their long-term
strategic technology plans. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners, which have
certified expertise and direct training and support from Microsoft, can build a
positive customer experience with our technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes
RedTail as a new Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its expertise in
providing customer satisfaction using Microsoft products and technology." 

Microsoft Competency Status

had to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft Competencies are designed to
help differentiate a partner`s capabilities with specific Microsoft technologies
to customers looking for a particular type of solution. Each competency has a
unique set of requirements and benefits, formulated to accurately represent the
specific skills and services that partners bring to the technology industry.
Within select Competencies, there are Specializations that focus on specific
solution areas that recognize deeper expertise within that Competency. Serving
as a specialized path to earning those Competencies, Specializations give direct
access to the tools and resources that support that specific area of focus. 

ISV/Software Solutions Competency

The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and focus partners
bring to a particular solution set. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners that have
obtained this competency have a successful record of developing and marketing
software and services based on Microsoft technologies. 

"Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to better enable ISVs
to meet customer needs," said Walid Abu-Hadba, corporate vice president of the
Developer and Platform Evangelism Group at Microsoft Corp. "They allow ISVs to
keep and win customers through their deep knowledge of solutions-based Microsoft
platform technologies. Microsoft has a long history of working closely with ISV
partners to help them deliver compelling solutions and applications to our
mutual customers, and the Microsoft Competencies are an important step in
continuing to enhance vital relationships with ISVs worldwide." 

The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and represents
Microsoft's ongoing commitment to the success of partners worldwide. The program
offers a single, integrated partnering framework that recognizes partner
expertise, rewards the total impact that partners have in the technology
marketplace, and delivers more value to help partners' businesses be successful.

&lt;p&gt;Work Accelerates and Optimizes System Center Configuration Manager 2007 and
Microsoft App-V Applications Streaming Over Wide Area Network
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Blue Coat Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:BCSI), the technology leader in Application
Delivery Networking, today announced that it has joined the Microsoft System
Center Alliance to enhance and support Microsoft System Center Configuration
Manager 2007 and Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V), part of the
Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack, solutions over the Wide Area Network (WAN)
to branch offices and over the Internet to remote workers. Blue Coat will also
participate in the Microsoft Management Summit 2009 from April 27-May 1, 2009 in
Las Vegas. 

In addition to accelerating enterprise applications and remote files across the
WAN, Blue Coat&#174; ProxySG&#174; appliances can now optimize and accelerate software
updates, configurations and patches that have been packaged by a company`s IT
department for distribution to its users using Configuration Manager and App-V.
For example, a 40 megabyte update file that previously required nearly four
minutes to cross the WAN can now be delivered in under five seconds1. A large
software installation package of 375 megabytes that previously required slightly
more than an hour to transfer across the WAN can now be transferred in a few
seconds1. As a result, the ProxySG appliances can also free up WAN bandwidth for
critical business applications. 

ProxySG appliances also optimize and accelerate the delivery of on-demand
applications using Microsoft App-V. In Blue Coat performance tests, Microsoft
Office Word 2007 delivered through App-V benefited from a 70 percent improvement
in the amount of time to launch the application remotely and a 98 percent
reduction in bandwidth consumption2. 

Blue Coat&#174; ProxyClient&#174; software, the first WAN optimization client with
integrated security and control for remote users, can also accelerate the
delivery of software and applications delivered by Configuration Manager or
App-V. ProxyClient software utilizes WAN optimization technologies, including
byte caching, to accelerate access to files, such as spreadsheets and
presentations, and to speed the response time of remote Web applications.
ProxyClient also uses the Blue Coat WebPulse service, a real-time cloud
computing security service, to enforce a company`s centrally managed Internet
usage policies and to protect against malware, spyware, mobile malicious code
and phishing exploits. 

"As Microsoft System Center and App-V continue to advance application
technologies for both servers and clients, we value the efforts of companies
such as Blue Coat Systems to optimize the Wide Area Network for delivering
distributed applications," said Karri Alexion-Tiernan, Director of Product
Management for App-V. "With centralized management and applications on one hand
and users distributed in branch offices on the other, the network and the
application must come together to meet the demands for remote response time." 

"Blue Coat ProxySG appliances can dramatically accelerate enterprise
applications and files across an enterprise`s Wide Area Network to branch
offices, while at the same time significantly reducing bandwidth consumption to
contain or reduce operational expenses," said Dave Asprey, vice president of
technology and corporate development, Blue Coat Systems. "We are pleased to be
part of the Microsoft System Center Alliance and to support and enhance the
delivery of software through Microsoft`s innovative Configuration Manager 2007
and App-V products." 

About Blue Coat Systems

Blue Coat Systems is the technology leader in Application Delivery Networking.
Blue Coat offers an Application Delivery Network Infrastructure that provides
the visibility, acceleration and security required to optimize and secure the
flow of information to any user, on any network, anywhere. This application
intelligence enables enterprises to tightly align network investments with
business requirements, speed decision making and secure business applications
for long-term competitive advantage. For additional information, please visit

Key operating factors in first quarter results include significantly improved
North American operating trends driven by strong revenue growth, and continued
strong growth in Europe. 

Total revenues for the quarter grew 3 percent after a negative currency impact
of 8 percent. Consolidated comparable volume declined &#189; percent and consolidated
comparable operating income increased 47 percent or $92 million. Operating
income grew $89 million in North America and $3 million in Europe, after a $40
million negative foreign currency impact. Comparable EPS results include a
negative currency impact of approximately 4 cents. Pages 9 through 11 of this
release provide a reconciliation of reported and comparable operating results. 

"Our first quarter results demonstrate the importance of our work to maximize
the value of our brands through diligent revenue management, to improve customer
service and to closely manage costs," said John F. Brock, chairman and chief
executive officer. "We remain cautious about the rest of the year, however, as
the first quarter is our smallest reporting period and general economic
conditions remain challenging, both in North America and Europe. 

"To achieve continued success in the face of this difficult operating
environment, we must continue to capture the value of our brands for our
customers, consumers, and shareowners with strong marketplace execution, and the
full benefits of our efficiency and operating programs," Mr. Brock said. "We
have revised full year guidance to reflect our strong first quarter results,
confidence in our business initiatives, and the current economic environment." 

In the first quarter, North American operating income improved with comparable
bottle and can volume down 3 percent, net pricing per case up 10 percent, and
cost of sales per case up 10 percent. Volume results include solid growth for
Coca-Cola Zero and the addition of Powerade Zero and Monster Energy drinks.
Growth in net pricing per case and cost of sales per case include the increased
sales of purchased finished goods. Both are comparable and exclude the effects
of currency translation. 

Europe achieved volume growth of 5&#189; percent, successfully lapping strong volume
growth of 7 percent from the same quarter a year ago and reflecting solid growth
in both sparkling and still beverages. On a comparable and currency neutral
basis, net pricing per case grew 2&#189; percent, and cost of sales per case
increased 1 percent. 

2009 OUTLOOK

The company today revised its guidance for 2009. On a comparable and
currency-neutral basis, consolidated financial results for 2009 will reflect mid
single-digit operating income growth. Diluted EPS is expected to be in a range
of $1.24 to $1.29 excluding items affecting comparability and including an
estimated 20 cent negative impact from foreign currency translations at current
rates. The company also expects strong free cash flow of approximately $600
million including an additional $100 million in increased pension contributions,
and capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. Free cash flow will
continue to be used primarily for debt reduction. The effective tax rate for
2009 is expected to be 26 percent to 28 percent. 

In North America, the company expects full-year 2009 revenue to increase in a
low to mid single-digit range. Volume will decline and cost of goods per case is
expected to increase in a high single-digit range, reflecting increased
commodities cost and the mix impact of increased sales of purchased finished
goods. North American operating income will increase in a low to mid
single-digit range. 

European revenue will grow in a mid single-digit range. Volume will grow in a
low single-digit range and cost of goods per case is expected to increase in a
low single-digit range, reflecting a continued moderate commodity cost
environment. Operating income will grow in a mid to high single-digit range.

 (a)                The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Net Pricing per Case" is used to more clearly evaluate bottle and can pricing trends in the marketplace. The measure excludes the impact of fountain gallon volume and other items that are not directly associated with bottle and can pricing in the retail environment. Our bottle and can sales accounted for approximately 91 percent of our net revenue during the   
                    first quarter of 2009.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                    
                    
                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (b)                The non-GAAP financial measures "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Net Pricing per Case" and "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Cost of Sales per Case" are used to separate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our operations.                                                                                                                                                                                  
                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (c)                The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Cost of Sales per Case" is used to more clearly evaluate cost trends for bottle and can products. The measure excludes the impact of fountain ingredient costs, and allows investors to gain an understanding of the change in bottle and can ingredient and packaging costs.

Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for first-quarter 2009.
Revenues were $10.9 billion, a decrease of 8% compared with the year-ago
quarter. Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $640
million or 5%. For first-quarter 2009, U.S. revenues were $5.0 billion, a
decrease of 10% compared with the year-ago quarter. International revenues were
$5.9 billion, a decrease of 7% compared with the prior-year quarter, and
reflected operational growth of 3%, which was more than offset by the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 10%. U.S. revenues represented 46%,
while international revenues represented 54%, of total revenues, comparable with
the year-ago quarter. In addition to foreign exchange, other factors that
negatively impacted first-quarter 2009 revenues in comparison with the year-ago
quarter included the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Zyrtec in January 2008 and
Camptosar in February 2008 as well as the revenue declines for Lipitor, as a
result of continued intense competition, and for Chantix, mainly due to label
changes. 

Business Revenues

Effective January 1, 2009, Pfizer expanded its new operating model within the
Pharmaceutical business, which is now comprised of five customer-focused units
with clear, single points of accountability to enable the Company to more
effectively anticipate and respond to the diverse needs of physicians, customers
and patients: Primary Care, Specialty Care, Oncology, Established Products and
Emerging Markets. In addition to the pharmaceutical business, the Company has a
significant Animal Health business.

Primary Care revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $5.3 billion, an 8% decline
compared with $5.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. In addition to the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, the decline in revenues compared with
the same period last year was primarily driven by continued pressure on Lipitor
from generic competition and by the negative impact of the Chantix label
changes, as well as by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Zyrtec in January 2008. 

Specialty Care revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $1.5 billion, a 7% increase
compared with $1.4 billion in the same period last year. Despite the unfavorable
impact of foreign exchange, revenues increased, primarily driven by the solid
operational performance in both the U.S. and international markets from certain
products, including Xalatan, Zyvox, Vfend and Revatio. 

Oncology revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $350 million, a 17% decrease
compared with $421 million in the prior-year quarter. In addition to the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues were unfavorably impacted by
the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Camptosar in February 2008, which was partially
offset by strong international performance, largely driven by Sutent. 

Established Products revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, a 12%
decline compared with $1.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Since the products
in this unit generally have lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity,
revenues have declined. This unit was created in 2008 with the goal of
recapturing value for these products in developed market geographies by
progressively slowing the erosion of, and ultimately stabilizing, revenue and
profit from established products. Supporting initiatives within the unit include
programs designed to expand patient and payor access to this portfolio, to
develop product enhancements, to expand the portfolio and to increase
promotional efforts for targeted products. 

Emerging Markets revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $1.4 billion, a 9%
decrease compared with $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2008. Revenues in Emerging
Markets, which also includes revenues from established products sold in these
geographies, were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, which was partially
offset by solid operational growth, led by expansion efforts in China. 

Animal Health revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $537 million, a 13% decline
compared with $619 million in the year-ago quarter. In addition to the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues were impacted by global
macroeconomic conditions, which negatively affected global spending on
veterinary care, as well as by a planned change in terms with U.S. distributors
resulting in an anticipated, one-time reduction in U.S. distributor inventories.


Reported Net Income(2)and Reported Diluted EPS(2)

For first-quarter 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(2) of $2.7 billion, a
decline of 2% compared with $2.8 billion in the prior-year quarter, and reported
diluted EPS(2) of $0.40, a decline of 2% compared with $0.41 in the prior-year
quarter. First-quarter 2009 results were unfavorably impacted by the decrease in
total revenues and other income, the increase in the effective tax rate as well
as costs incurred in connection with the pending Wyeth acquisition. These
factors were partially offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives and the
elimination of in-process research and development charges in 2009. The increase
in the effective tax rate on reported results to 28% from 22% in the year-ago
quarter was primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain
business decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition. 

Adjusted Income(1) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(1)

First-quarter 2009 adjusted income(1) was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 11%
compared with $4.1 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(1)
was $0.54, a decrease of 11% compared with $0.61 in the year-ago quarter. Both
adjusted income(1) and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were negatively impacted by the
decrease in total revenues and the increase in the effective tax rate on
adjusted income(1) to approximately 30% from 22% in the prior-year quarter,
which were partially offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives. 

In first-quarter 2009, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of revenues was
12.1% compared with 15.3% in first-quarter 2008. This improvement reflects the
benefits from cost-reduction initiatives and foreign exchange. Excluding the
impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of
revenues was 14.4% in first-quarter 2009. 

Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI) expenses(1) were $2.8
billion in first-quarter 2009, a decrease of 17% compared with $3.4 billion in
the prior-year quarter. The decrease was due to the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives and, to a lesser extent, certain insurance
recoveries. Also, foreign exchange reduced first-quarter 2009 adjusted SI
expenses(1) by approximately $140 million compared with the year-ago quarter. 

Adjusted research and development (R) expenses(1) were $1.7 billion in
first-quarter 2009, an increase of 2% compared with $1.6 billion in the
prior-year period. The increase was due to a $150 million milestone payment to
Bristol-Myers Squibb in this year`s first quarter in connection with the
collaboration on apixaban, partially offset by the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives. Foreign exchange reduced first-quarter 2009 adjusted
R expenses(1) by approximately $60 million compared with the year-ago quarter.


Overall, operational improvements resulting from cost-reduction initiatives and,
to a much lesser extent, certain insurance recoveries decreased adjusted total
costs(10) by approximately $500 million or 7% in first-quarter 2009 compared
with the prior-year period, and foreign exchange decreased adjusted total
costs(10) by approximately $540 million or 8%. The operational improvements were
driven partially by the reduction in workforce to approximately 80,250
colleagues at the end of first-quarter 2009, a decline of 1,650 compared with
year-end 2008, and a decline of 6,350 since the beginning of 2008, as well as
manufacturing and research and development site exits. The decline of 1,650
colleagues in first-quarter 2009 was net of new colleagues hired in expanding
areas across the Company, primarily in emerging markets. 

Executive Commentary

"During the quarter, we continued our ongoing efforts to reshape our operating
model, made substantial progress in planning for the Wyeth integration, and
faced a challenging and dynamic economic and competitive environment. Yet, we
remained focused on meeting our commitments - generating revenues consistent
with our expectations and continuing to streamline our cost structure. We remain
on-track to deliver on our full-year 2009 guidance for revenues and adjusted
results(1)," stated Jeff Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

Kindler continued, "Even as we achieve our short-term objectives, we continue to
lay the groundwork to increase long-term shareholder value through the pending
combination with Wyeth. Our recent announcement on the planned leadership and
organizational structure for the company`s combined research and commercial
operations demonstrates our intention to advance strong scientific capabilities
and to retain top scientific and commercial talent from both organizations as we
build the world`s premier biopharmaceutical company." 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "We achieved several
significant milestones in this quarter in planning for the Wyeth acquisition,
making substantial progress in a short period of time. We remain committed to a
rapid and successful integration, while at the same time delivering on our 2009
financial goals, which remains a top priority. Today, we`re reaffirming our
full-year 2009 financial guidance for revenues and adjusted results(1), and
updating our reported diluted EPS(2) guidance to include certain costs
associated with the pending acquisition of Wyeth." 

Financial Guidance

For full-year 2009, Pfizer`s financial guidance, at current exchange rates(11)
is summarized below. This guidance is unchanged from the guidance provided on
January 26, 2009, except for reported diluted EPS(2), which has been reduced to
a range of $1.20 to $1.35 from $1.34 to $1.49 to reflect certain costs incurred
and expected to be incurred in connection with the pending Wyeth acquisition.
These costs include, but are not limited to, transaction costs, pre-integration
costs and financing costs. We also continue to expect to achieve net savings
compared to 2008 adjusted total costs(10) of $2 billion by the end of 2011 at
2008 foreign exchange rates.

         -related costs,

         Adjusted R expenses and  
         Adjusted Other             
         (Income)/Deductions are    
         income statement line items 
         prepared on the same basis, 
         and therefore, components  
         of the overall adjusted    
         income measure. As         
         described under Adjusted   
         Income in the Management`s

         management uses adjusted   
         income, among other        
         factors, to set performance 
         goals and to measure the   
         performance of the overall 
         company. We believe that   
         investors' understanding of 
         our performance is enhanced 
         by disclosing this measure.

 1.    The above financial        
       statements present the     
       three-month periods ended  
       March 29, 2009 and March   
       30, 2008. Subsidiaries     
       operating outside the      
       United States are included 
       for the three-month periods 
       ended February 22, 2009 and 
       February 24, 2008.         
 2.    The financial results for  
       the three-month period     
       ended March 29, 2009, are  
       not necessarily indicative 
       of the results which could 
       ultimately be achieved for 
       the current year.          
 3.    On January 1, 2009, we     
       adopted Financial          
       Accounting Standards Board 
       (FASB) Statement of        
       Financial Accounting       
       Standards (SFAS) No. 160,  
       Noncontrolling Interests in 
       Consolidated Financial     
       Statements. SFAS 160       
       provides guidance for the  
       accounting, reporting and  
       disclosure of              
       noncontrolling interests,  
       previously referred to as  
       minority interests. The    
       adoption of SFAS 160       
       resulted in                
       reclassifications of prior 
       -period amounts to conform 
       to the first-quarter 2009  
       presentation, primarily    
       related to the presentation 
       of noncontrolling          
       interests.                 
 4.    Included in Restructuring  
       charges and acquisition    
       -related costs for first   
       -quarter 2009are $369      
       million of transaction     
       costs, such as banking,    
       legal, accounting and other 
       costs, directly related to 
       our pending acquisition of 
       Wyeth.                     
 5.    In prior years, as         
       required, the estimated    
       value of Acquisition       
       -related in-process        
       research and development   
       charges (IPR) was        
       expensed at acquisition    
       date. In the first quarter 
       of 2008, we expensed $398  
       million of IPR, primarily 
       related to our acquisitions 
       of CovX and Coley          
       Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. 
       As a result of adopting    
       SFAS No. 141R, Business    
       Combinations, beginning    
       January 1, 2009, IPR     
       related to future          
       acquisitions will be       
       recorded on our            
       consolidated balance sheet 
       as indefinite-lived        
       intangible assets. We made 
       no acquisitions in the     
       first quarter of 2009.     
 6.    Amortization expense       
       related to acquired        
       intangible assets that     
       contribute to our ability  
       to sell, manufacture,      
       research, market and       
       distribute our products are 
       included in Amortization of 
       intangible assets as they  
       benefit multiple business  
       functions. Amortization    
       expense related to acquired 
       intangible assets that are 
       associated with a single   
       function are included in   
       Cost of sales, Selling,    
       informational and          
       administrative expenses or 
       Research and development   
       expenses, as appropriate.

PFIZER INC

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

1) Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues

The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the
euro, UK pound and Canadian dollar, unfavorably impacted our revenues by
approximately $640 million, or 5%, in first-quarter 2009, compared to the same
period in 2008. 

2) Change in Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales decreased 29% in first-quarter 2009, compared to the same
period in 2008. The decrease primarily reflects the favorable impact of foreign
exchange, the savings impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and lower
implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives. 

Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $76 million for the first quarter of 2009 and $138
million for the first quarter of 2008. 

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 3.8 percentage
points to 13.0% in first-quarter 2009, reflecting the favorable impact of our
cost-reduction initiatives, the impact of foreign exchange, as well as lower
implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, compared to
first-quarter 2008. 

3) Change in Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses, Research &amp;
Development (R) Expenses and In-Process R Charges (IPR)

Reported SI expenses in first-quarter 2009 decreased 18% compared to the same
period in 2008, reflecting the savings associated with our cost-reduction
initiatives, the favorable impact of foreign exchange, lower implementation
costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and certain insurance
recoveries related to legal defense costs. 

Reported SI expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $46 million for first quarter 2009 and $75 million
for first-quarter 2008. 

Reported R expenses, excluding IPR, decreased 5% in first-quarter 2009,
compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease is primarily due to the
favorable impact of foreign exchange on expenses, the realization of savings
associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and lower implementation costs
associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by a $150
million milestone payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb in first-quarter 2009 in
connection with the collaboration on apixaban. 

Reported R expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $41 million for first-quarter 2009 and $146
million for first-quarter 2008. 

IPR charges in first-quarter 2008 of $398 million primarily related to the
acquisitions of CovX and Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. As a result of
adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141R, Business Combinations, beginning January 1, 2009, IPR
related to future acquisitions will be recorded on our consolidated balance
sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets. We made no acquisitions in the
first quarter of 2009.

(a) The decrease in net interest income in first-quarter 2009 compared to the
same period in 2008 was due primarily to lower interest rates, partially offset
by higher cash balances in first-quarter 2009, and $23 million of net interest
expense in first-quarter 2009 associated with our issuance of $13.5 billion of
senior unsecured notes related to the pending Wyeth acquisition. 

5) Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income for first-quarter 2009 was 28.2% compared to 21.5%
in first-quarter 2008. The higher tax rate in the first quarter of 2009 is
primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain business
decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition, partially offset by
the change in geographic mix of expenses incurred to execute our cost-reduction
initiatives, as well as the elimination of IPR charges, which generally are
not deductible for tax purposes. 

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was 29.7% in first-quarter 2009
compared to 21.9% in first-quarter 2008. The higher tax rate in the first
quarter of 2009 is primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with
certain business decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition.

________________ 

(1) "Adjusted income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are
defined as reported net income attributable to Pfizer Inc and reported diluted
EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc common shareholders excluding purchase-accounting
adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain
significant items. As described under Adjusted Income in the Management`s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section
of Pfizer`s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, management
uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to
measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors`
understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. The
adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be
viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS. 

DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information contained in this earnings release and the
attachments is as of April 28, 2009. The Company assumes no obligation to update
any forward-looking statements contained in this earnings release or the
attachments as a result of new information or future events or developments.

This earnings release and the attachments contain forward-looking information
about the Company`s financial results and estimates, business plans and
prospects, in-line products and product candidates that involve substantial
risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the fact that they
use words such as "will," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project,"
"intend," "plan," "believe," "target," "forecast" and other words and terms of
similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or
financial performance or business plans and prospects.Among the factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: the success
of research and development activities; decisions by regulatory authorities
regarding whether and when to approve our drug applications as well as their
decisions regarding labeling and other matters that could affect the
availability or commercial potential of our products; the speed with which
regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product launches may be
achieved; the success of external business-development activities; competitive
developments, including with respect to competitor drugs and drug candidates
that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs
and drug candidates; the ability to successfully market both new and existing
products domestically and internationally; difficulties or delays in
manufacturing; trade buying patterns; the ability to meet generic and branded
competition after the loss of patent protection for our products and competitor
products; the impact of existing and future legislation and regulatory
provisions on product exclusivity; trends toward managed care and healthcare
cost containment; U.S. legislation or regulatory action affecting, among other
things, pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including under
Medicaid, Medicare and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, the
importation of prescription drugs from outside the U.S. at prices that are
regulated by governments of various foreign countries, direct-to-consumer
advertising and interactions with healthcare professionals, and the use of
comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner
that focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic
differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative
medicines; the impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003; legislation or regulatory action in markets outside
the U.S. affecting pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access;
contingencies related to actual or alleged environmental contamination; claims
and concerns that may arise regarding the safety or efficacy of in-line products
and product candidates; significant breakdown, infiltration or interruption of

Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for first-quarter 2009.
Revenues were $10.9 billion, a decrease of 8% compared with the year-ago
quarter. Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $640
million or 5%. For first-quarter 2009, U.S. revenues were $5.0 billion, a
decrease of 10% compared with the year-ago quarter. International revenues were
$5.9 billion, a decrease of 7% compared with the prior-year quarter, and
reflected operational growth of 3%, which was more than offset by the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 10%. U.S. revenues represented 46%,
while international revenues represented 54%, of total revenues, comparable with
the year-ago quarter. In addition to foreign exchange, other factors that
negatively impacted first-quarter 2009 revenues in comparison with the year-ago
quarter included the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Zyrtec in January 2008 and
Camptosar in February 2008 as well as the revenue declines for Lipitor, as a
result of continued intense competition, and for Chantix, mainly due to label
changes. 

Business Revenues

Effective January 1, 2009, Pfizer expanded its new operating model within the
Pharmaceutical business, which is now comprised of five customer-focused units
with clear, single points of accountability to enable the Company to more
effectively anticipate and respond to the diverse needs of physicians, customers
and patients: Primary Care, Specialty Care, Oncology, Established Products and
Emerging Markets. In addition to the pharmaceutical business, the Company has a
significant Animal Health business.

Primary Care revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $5.3 billion, an 8% decline
compared with $5.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. In addition to the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, the decline in revenues compared with
the same period last year was primarily driven by continued pressure on Lipitor
from generic competition and by the negative impact of the Chantix label
changes, as well as by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Zyrtec in January 2008. 

Specialty Care revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $1.5 billion, a 7% increase
compared with $1.4 billion in the same period last year. Despite the unfavorable
impact of foreign exchange, revenues increased, primarily driven by the solid
operational performance in both the U.S. and international markets from certain
products, including Xalatan, Zyvox, Vfend and Revatio. 

Oncology revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $350 million, a 17% decrease
compared with $421 million in the prior-year quarter. In addition to the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues were unfavorably impacted by
the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Camptosar in February 2008, which was partially
offset by strong international performance, largely driven by Sutent. 

Established Products revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, a 12%
decline compared with $1.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Since the products
in this unit generally have lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity,
revenues have declined. This unit was created in 2008 with the goal of
recapturing value for these products in developed market geographies by
progressively slowing the erosion of, and ultimately stabilizing, revenue and
profit from established products. Supporting initiatives within the unit include
programs designed to expand patient and payor access to this portfolio, to
develop product enhancements, to expand the portfolio and to increase
promotional efforts for targeted products. 

Emerging Markets revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $1.4 billion, a 9%
decrease compared with $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2008. Revenues in Emerging
Markets, which also includes revenues from established products sold in these
geographies, were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, which was partially
offset by solid operational growth, led by expansion efforts in China. 

Animal Health revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $537 million, a 13% decline
compared with $619 million in the year-ago quarter. In addition to the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues were impacted by global
macroeconomic conditions, which negatively affected global spending on
veterinary care, as well as by a planned change in terms with U.S. distributors
resulting in an anticipated, one-time reduction in U.S. distributor inventories.


Reported Net Income(2)and Reported Diluted EPS(2)

For first-quarter 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(2) of $2.7 billion, a
decline of 2% compared with $2.8 billion in the prior-year quarter, and reported
diluted EPS(2) of $0.40, a decline of 2% compared with $0.41 in the prior-year
quarter. First-quarter 2009 results were unfavorably impacted by the decrease in
total revenues and other income, the increase in the effective tax rate as well
as costs incurred in connection with the pending Wyeth acquisition. These
factors were partially offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives and the
elimination of in-process research and development charges in 2009. The increase
in the effective tax rate on reported results to 28% from 22% in the year-ago
quarter was primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain
business decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition. 

Adjusted Income(1) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(1)

First-quarter 2009 adjusted income(1) was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 11%
compared with $4.1 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(1)
was $0.54, a decrease of 11% compared with $0.61 in the year-ago quarter. Both
adjusted income(1) and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were negatively impacted by the
decrease in total revenues and the increase in the effective tax rate on
adjusted income(1) to approximately 30% from 22% in the prior-year quarter,
which were partially offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives. 

In first-quarter 2009, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of revenues was
12.1% compared with 15.3% in first-quarter 2008. This improvement reflects the
benefits from cost-reduction initiatives and foreign exchange. Excluding the
impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of
revenues was 14.4% in first-quarter 2009. 

Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI) expenses(1) were $2.8
billion in first-quarter 2009, a decrease of 17% compared with $3.4 billion in
the prior-year quarter. The decrease was due to the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives and, to a lesser extent, certain insurance
recoveries. Also, foreign exchange reduced first-quarter 2009 adjusted SI
expenses(1) by approximately $140 million compared with the year-ago quarter. 

Adjusted research and development (R) expenses(1) were $1.7 billion in
first-quarter 2009, an increase of 2% compared with $1.6 billion in the
prior-year period. The increase was due to a $150 million milestone payment to
Bristol-Myers Squibb in this year`s first quarter in connection with the
collaboration on apixaban, partially offset by the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives. Foreign exchange reduced first-quarter 2009 adjusted
R expenses(1) by approximately $60 million compared with the year-ago quarter.


Overall, operational improvements resulting from cost-reduction initiatives and,
to a much lesser extent, certain insurance recoveries decreased adjusted total
costs(10) by approximately $500 million or 7% in first-quarter 2009 compared
with the prior-year period, and foreign exchange decreased adjusted total
costs(10) by approximately $540 million or 8%. The operational improvements were
driven partially by the reduction in workforce to approximately 80,250
colleagues at the end of first-quarter 2009, a decline of 1,650 compared with
year-end 2008, and a decline of 6,350 since the beginning of 2008, as well as
manufacturing and research and development site exits. The decline of 1,650
colleagues in first-quarter 2009 was net of new colleagues hired in expanding
areas across the Company, primarily in emerging markets. 

Executive Commentary

"During the quarter, we continued our ongoing efforts to reshape our operating
model, made substantial progress in planning for the Wyeth integration, and
faced a challenging and dynamic economic and competitive environment. Yet, we
remained focused on meeting our commitments - generating revenues consistent
with our expectations and continuing to streamline our cost structure. We remain
on-track to deliver on our full-year 2009 guidance for revenues and adjusted
results(1)," stated Jeff Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

Kindler continued, "Even as we achieve our short-term objectives, we continue to
lay the groundwork to increase long-term shareholder value through the pending
combination with Wyeth. Our recent announcement on the planned leadership and
organizational structure for the company`s combined research and commercial
operations demonstrates our intention to advance strong scientific capabilities
and to retain top scientific and commercial talent from both organizations as we
build the world`s premier biopharmaceutical company." 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "We achieved several
significant milestones in this quarter in planning for the Wyeth acquisition,
making substantial progress in a short period of time. We remain committed to a
rapid and successful integration, while at the same time delivering on our 2009
financial goals, which remains a top priority. Today, we`re reaffirming our
full-year 2009 financial guidance for revenues and adjusted results(1), and
updating our reported diluted EPS(2) guidance to include certain costs
associated with the pending acquisition of Wyeth." 

Financial Guidance

For full-year 2009, Pfizer`s financial guidance, at current exchange rates(11)
is summarized below. This guidance is unchanged from the guidance provided on
January 26, 2009, except for reported diluted EPS(2), which has been reduced to
a range of $1.20 to $1.35 from $1.34 to $1.49 to reflect certain costs incurred
and expected to be incurred in connection with the pending Wyeth acquisition.
These costs include, but are not limited to, transaction costs, pre-integration
costs and financing costs. We also continue to expect to achieve net savings
compared to 2008 adjusted total costs(10) of $2 billion by the end of 2011 at
2008 foreign exchange rates.

 1.    The above financial        
       statements present the     
       three-month periods ended  
       March 29, 2009 and March   
       30, 2008. Subsidiaries     
       operating outside the      
       United States are included 
       for the three-month periods 
       ended February 22, 2009 and 
       February 24, 2008.         
 2.    The financial results for  
       the three-month period     
       ended March 29, 2009, are  
       not necessarily indicative 
       of the results which could 
       ultimately be achieved for 
       the current year.          
 3.    On January 1, 2009, we     
       adopted Financial          
       Accounting Standards Board 
       (FASB) Statement of        
       Financial Accounting       
       Standards (SFAS) No. 160,  
       Noncontrolling Interests in 
       Consolidated Financial     
       Statements. SFAS 160       
       provides guidance for the  
       accounting, reporting and  
       disclosure of              
       noncontrolling interests,  
       previously referred to as  
       minority interests. The    
       adoption of SFAS 160       
       resulted in                
       reclassifications of prior 
       -period amounts to conform 
       to the first-quarter 2009  
       presentation, primarily    
       related to the presentation 
       of noncontrolling          
       interests.                 
 4.    Included in Restructuring  
       charges and acquisition    
       -related costs for first   
       -quarter 2009are $369      
       million of transaction     
       costs, such as banking,    
       legal, accounting and other 
       costs, directly related to 
       our pending acquisition of 
       Wyeth.                     
 5.    In prior years, as         
       required, the estimated    
       value of Acquisition       
       -related in-process        
       research and development   
       charges (IPR) was        
       expensed at acquisition    
       date. In the first quarter 
       of 2008, we expensed $398  
       million of IPR, primarily 
       related to our acquisitions 
       of CovX and Coley          
       Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. 
       As a result of adopting    
       SFAS No. 141R, Business    
       Combinations, beginning    
       January 1, 2009, IPR     
       related to future          
       acquisitions will be       
       recorded on our            
       consolidated balance sheet 
       as indefinite-lived        
       intangible assets. We made 
       no acquisitions in the     
       first quarter of 2009.     
 6.    Amortization expense       
       related to acquired        
       intangible assets that     
       contribute to our ability  
       to sell, manufacture,      
       research, market and       
       distribute our products are 
       included in Amortization of 
       intangible assets as they  
       benefit multiple business  
       functions. Amortization    
       expense related to acquired 
       intangible assets that are 
       associated with a single   
       function are included in   
       Cost of sales, Selling,    
       informational and          
       administrative expenses or 
       Research and development   
       expenses, as appropriate.

PFIZER INC

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

1) Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues

The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the
euro, UK pound and Canadian dollar, unfavorably impacted our revenues by
approximately $640 million, or 5%, in first-quarter 2009, compared to the same
period in 2008. 

2) Change in Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales decreased 29% in first-quarter 2009, compared to the same
period in 2008. The decrease primarily reflects the favorable impact of foreign
exchange, the savings impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and lower
implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives. 

Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $76 million for the first quarter of 2009 and $138
million for the first quarter of 2008. 

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 3.8 percentage
points to 13.0% in first-quarter 2009, reflecting the favorable impact of our
cost-reduction initiatives, the impact of foreign exchange, as well as lower
implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, compared to
first-quarter 2008. 

3) Change in Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses, Research &amp;
Development (R) Expenses and In-Process R Charges (IPR)

Reported SI expenses in first-quarter 2009 decreased 18% compared to the same
period in 2008, reflecting the savings associated with our cost-reduction
initiatives, the favorable impact of foreign exchange, lower implementation
costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and certain insurance
recoveries related to legal defense costs. 

Reported SI expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $46 million for first quarter 2009 and $75 million
for first-quarter 2008. 

Reported R expenses, excluding IPR, decreased 5% in first-quarter 2009,
compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease is primarily due to the
favorable impact of foreign exchange on expenses, the realization of savings
associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and lower implementation costs
associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by a $150
million milestone payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb in first-quarter 2009 in
connection with the collaboration on apixaban. 

Reported R expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $41 million for first-quarter 2009 and $146
million for first-quarter 2008. 

IPR charges in first-quarter 2008 of $398 million primarily related to the
acquisitions of CovX and Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. As a result of
adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141R, Business Combinations, beginning January 1, 2009, IPR
related to future acquisitions will be recorded on our consolidated balance
sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets. We made no acquisitions in the
first quarter of 2009.

(a) The decrease in net interest income in first-quarter 2009 compared to the
same period in 2008 was due primarily to lower interest rates, partially offset
by higher cash balances in first-quarter 2009, and $23 million of net interest
expense in first-quarter 2009 associated with our issuance of $13.5 billion of
senior unsecured notes related to the pending Wyeth acquisition. 

5) Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income for first-quarter 2009 was 28.2% compared to 21.5%
in first-quarter 2008. The higher tax rate in the first quarter of 2009 is
primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain business
decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition, partially offset by
the change in geographic mix of expenses incurred to execute our cost-reduction
initiatives, as well as the elimination of IPR charges, which generally are
not deductible for tax purposes. 

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was 29.7% in first-quarter 2009
compared to 21.9% in first-quarter 2008. The higher tax rate in the first
quarter of 2009 is primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with
certain business decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition.

________________ 

(1) "Adjusted income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are
defined as reported net income attributable to Pfizer Inc and reported diluted
EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc common shareholders excluding purchase-accounting
adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain
significant items. As described under Adjusted Income in the Management`s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section
of Pfizer`s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, management
uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to
measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors`
understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. The
adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be
viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS.

Amazon Defense Coalition: 

WHAT: Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission hearing on the link between
environmental degradation and human rights norms. 

WHO: Steven Donziger, attorney representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit
against Chevron and representatives of other indigenous and traditional people
in Nigeria and West Papua. 

WHERE: 2200 Rayburn House Office Building 

WHEN: April 28, 10:30 am 

BACKGROUND:

Exploring the specific examples of communities in Ecuador, Nigeria, and West
Papua, the Commission hearing will analyze the relationship between
environmental degradation and human rights, particularly in relation to
indigenous and traditional peoples around the globe. The historic Ecuadorian
environmental case -- Aguinda v. ChevronTexaco - deals with what many experts
consider the worst oil-related disaster on the planet. The lawsuit alleges that
Texaco, now owned by Chevron, used a variety of sub-standard production
practices in Ecuador that resulted in thousands of illnesses and deaths. The
plaintiffs assert that five indigenous groups have had their traditional
lifestyles decimated, and one group (the Tetetes) has disappeared. Chevron has
admitted that Texaco dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into
Amazon waterways, abandoned more than 900 waste pits, burned millions of cubic
meters of poisonous gases with no controls, and spilled more than 17 million
gallons of oil due to pipeline ruptures. Texaco never conducted a single health
evaluation or environmental impact study while it was the operator. Experts
estimate the damage is 30 times larger than that of the Exxon Valdez disaster.
The company`s own environmental consultants found oilfield practices used by
Texaco that were clearly sub-standard. Texaco fought for nine years to avoid
trial in U.S. and transfer the case to Ecuador, claiming Ecuador`s courts were a
fair and an adequate forum. In 2002, Texaco won that battle but was forced by
the U.S. court to submit to jurisdiction in Ecuador and be bound by any ruling
there. The Aguinda lawsuit was re-filed in May 2003 in Ecuador. The trial began
in October 2003. As scientific evidence began to demonstrate Chevron`s
culpability, the company initiated a campaign to attack the trial process as
unfair.

&lt;p&gt;Enables IT Administrators to Seamlessly Transition PC Power States Within
Microsoft Configuration Manager to Ensure Reliable Software Distribution and
Patch Management While Reducing PC Energy Costs Up To 60 Percent
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Today at the Microsoft Management Summit 2009, Verdiem, the leading provider of
enterprise PC power management software solutions, released its Power Management
Pack for Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007. Utilizing Verdiem`s
Power Management Pack, IT administrators can seamlessly integrate Verdiem`s
Surveyor PC Power Management Software with Configuration Manager to both reduce
PC energy consumption while gaining insight and control over IT processes
related to PC administration and management. 

According to Gartner, Inc., in its March 2009 report, "When to Consider
Commercial PC Power Management Tools," by Terrence Cosgrove, PCs and peripherals
consume more energy than any other information and communications technology
group, and by 2012, more than 50% of midsize and large organizations will
centrally manage desktop power states, up from less than 10% today.
"Increasingly organizations are turning to PC power management solutions to
reduce PC energy costs and meet the requirements of their Green IT initiatives,"
said Terrence Cosgrove, Senior Research Analyst, Gartner, Inc. "As adoption of
PC power management continues, organizations should consider comprehensive
solutions to best meet enterprise requirements for software distribution,

Configuration Manager 2007 for out-of-band management of systems that conform to
the DASH standard, developed by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). 

"Our participation in the Microsoft System Center Alliance demonstrates AMD`s
commitment to supporting our partners with efficient system management tools,"
said Earl Stahl, vice president of Software Development, AMD. "Our promise to
deliver a DASH plug-in builds on the value of AMD Business Class technology to
deliver the essential manageability, security, energy efficiency and stability
that IT professionals require to accomplish tasks quickly, easily and
cost-effectively." 

"As part of the Microsoft System Center suite, Configuration Manager 2007
delivers a more efficient IT infrastructure with comprehensive tools for
deploying, managing and updating servers and client PCs, across both physical
and virtual networks," said Larry Orecklin, general manager, System Center and
Virtualization Marketing, Microsoft. "The DASH plug-in from AMD will extend our
Configuration Manager 2007 capabilities, helping to provide IT pros the power to
enhance the remote management of their DASH-enabled and non-DASH client PCs for
a more stable, secure and manageable computing environment." 

AMD, along with its development partner GNHSoft, will be showing the DASH
plug-in for Microsoft System Center Manager 2007 on the show floor (Booth # 517)
at the Microsoft Management Summit in Las Vegas April 27 - May 1, 2009,
demonstrating its key benefits including a remote wake on DASH secure power on,
capability to diagnose and troubleshoot system problems even when the Operating
System is unavailable and capability to remotely apply critical patches even to
system that are powered off.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday as the world's largest credit card network increased prices, slashed expenses and consumers used debit cards more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 70 percent to $536 million, or 71 cents per diluted class A share, for the second quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $314 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an adjusted basis, reflecting a normalized tax rate, restructuring and purchase amortizations, quarterly net income rose 38 percent to $553 million, or 73 cents per diluted class A common share. On that basis, analysts expected earnings of 64 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What caught my attention most was the expense control they had. For instance, advertising falling from $210 million to $196 million. Their ability to cut costs in this environment is surprising," said Ken Crawford, senior portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It speaks of the flexibility and profitability of card processor companies. MasterCard Inc (MA.N) reports on Friday morning and it sets a stage," Crawford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted operating expenses fell 5 percent to $745 million, as the company cut personnel, advertising and marketing, as well as consulting fees, and administrative costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net operating revenue rose 13 percent to $1.6 billion, while total processed transactions -- which represent transactions processed by VisaNet -- increased 6 percent to 9.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said payments volume fell 1 percent for the quarter ended December 31, which translates to revenue in the following quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results turned out to be pretty good," said Robert Dodd, an analyst at Morgan, Keenan  Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEBIT OFFSETS IMPACT OF CREDIT CRISIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa is partially insulated from the credit crisis because it processes transactions rather than lends funds. However, the company has seen a slowdown in the growth of revenue and transaction volumes as battered consumers used their credit cards less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, debt-burdened consumers have been increasing the use of their debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The continued strength of debit is attributable in part to that product's strong correlation with non-discretionary spend categories, which are holding up relatively well in the face of a tough economy," Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said in a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In fact, in the quarter ending December, for the first time in Visa's history, U.S. debit payment volumes eclipsed that of credit," Pollitt added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payments volume fell 7 percent in credit in the United States to $203 billion, while debit volumes grew 5.5 percent to $206 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Visa said debit grew in the first four months of 2009, while credit shrank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa forecast further pressure on its revenue in the second half of its 2009 fiscal year, which ends in September, hurt by foreign exchange headwinds as the U.S. dollar strengthened in recent months and lower cross-border transactions given the global economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company anticipated a recovery from October helped by more favorable year-over-year gas prices and foreign exchange rates, if the global economy shows signs of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa increased its forecast for its annual adjusted operating margin to the low 50 percent range from a range of the high 40 percent to the low 50 percent range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO IMPACT FROM SWINE FLU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm said it did not expect a significant impact on its revenue growth from the swine influenza -- which has already killed 159 people in Mexico and is threatening to become a pandemic flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company affirmed its forecast of an annual net revenue growth of high single digits in 2009 and at the lower end of the 11 to 15 percent range in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa also reiterated its annual adjusted diluted class A common stock earnings per share will grow over 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa shares were slightly lower after closing up 4.6 percent at $63.51 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 20 percent in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) welcomes today`s recommendation by the Western
Australian Environmental Protection Authority`s (EPA) that the revised and
expanded Chevron-operated Gorgon Project could meet the EPA`s environmental
objectives. 

The revised and expanded proposal adds a third 5 million metric-tons-per-year
(MTPY) liquefied natural gas (LNG) train to the original two-train proposal
already approved for Barrow Island. 

The EPA`s decision is an important step in the regulatory process. Chevron can
now continue to assess the conditions as it works toward a final investment
decision in the second half of this year. 

Gorgon is Australia`s single largest resource project and is set to deliver
significant economic benefits and create thousands of jobs. 

Chevron is currently reviewing and assessing the EPA`s proposed conditions. The
company acknowledges that under the state`s process the government provides
final approval for the project. 

The Joint Venture participants - Chevron (operator), Shell and ExxonMobil - are
committed to moving the project forward on Barrow Island and believe the
environmental impacts of the project can be minimized and effectively managed in
accordance with environmental best practices. 

Chevron has a 40-year track record of protecting biodiversity on Barrow Island.
With proper management and planning, the company has demonstrated that
development and conservation can coexist. 

The environmental assessment for the Gorgon project has been the most
comprehensive in Australia. It is the result of six years of preparation,
including the research and contributions of numerous independent experts, and
extensive community consultation. 

The Gorgon project is expected to boost gross domestic product, generate
significant government revenue and create local opportunities through goods and
services. It also includes a domestic natural gas capability which will provide
more energy security for Western Australians. 

Chevron (50%) operates the Gorgon Project with joint venture participants
ExxonMobil (25%) and Shell (25%). 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) is offering $2
billion in financing to customers seeking to invest in
broadband and healthcare technologies and are waiting to
receive government stimulus funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The move comes as a weak economy and tighter credit make it
difficult for companies to invest in large technology projects.
U.S. President Barack Obama in February signed a $787 billion
stimulus plan that included support for investments in energy
and healthcare technologies, but not all funds were available
yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp said on Wednesday that
its lending and leasing business, IBM Global Financing, would
offer financing to clients investing in areas likely to receive
stimulus spending, like smart grid technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A lot of the government funding won't get to our clients
until 2010 or later," said Richard Dicks, general manager of
IBM Global Financing's North America business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a way to, if you will, jump-start those
investments and jump-start the benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM over the past decade has been shifting from hardware to
high-margin software and services, including consulting and
analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dicks said applicants for financing could include utilities
firms adopting "smart meter" systems, hospitals switching to
electronic medical records, or municipalities seeking IBM's
consulting services to adopt broadband over power lines -- a
technology that uses radio signals to connect Internet service
over electric power lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $2 billion in financing will be offered through plans
including low interest rates, flexible payment options and
deferred payment plans, IBM said. IBM Global Financing's assets
in 2008 totaled $36 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company added that it would be prudent in vetting the
credit of customers.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday as the world's largest credit card network increased prices, slashed expenses and consumers used debit cards more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 70 percent to $536 million, or 71 cents per diluted class A share, for the second quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $314 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an adjusted basis, reflecting a normalized tax rate, restructuring and purchase amortizations, quarterly net income rose 38 percent to $553 million, or 73 cents per diluted class A common share. On that basis, analysts expected earnings of 64 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What caught my attention most was the expense control they had. For instance, advertising falling from $210 million to $196 million. Their ability to cut costs in this environment is surprising," said Ken Crawford, senior portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It speaks of the flexibility and profitability of card processor companies. MasterCard Inc (MA.N) reports on Friday morning and it sets a stage," Crawford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted operating expenses fell 5 percent to $745 million, as the company cut personnel, advertising and marketing, as well as consulting fees, and administrative costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net operating revenue rose 13 percent to $1.6 billion, while total processed transactions -- which represent transactions processed by VisaNet -- increased 6 percent to 9.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said payments volume fell 1 percent for the quarter ended December 31, which translates to revenue in the following quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results turned out to be pretty good," said Robert Dodd, an analyst at Morgan, Keenan  Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEBIT OFFSETS IMPACT OF CREDIT CRISIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa is partially insulated from the credit crisis because it processes transactions rather than lends funds.

that product's strong correlation with non-discretionary spend

of 2009, while credit shrank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa forecast further pressure on its revenue in the second
half of its 2009 fiscal year, which ends in September, hurt by
foreign exchange headwinds as the U.S. dollar strengthened in

&lt;p&gt;Company Reports $1.36 of Earnings Per Diluted Share on Net Income of $73.1
Million 

Metallurgical Coal Revenues Increased 86 Percent on Strong Volumes and Pricing 
TAMPA, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Walter Energy (NYSE:WLT), a leading U.S. producer and exporter of premium
metallurgical coal for the global steel industry, today reported net income of
$73.1 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2009,
compared to net income of $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share in the first
quarter 2008. Financial results include the operations of the Financing and
Homebuilding segments, which the Company expects to classify as discontinued
operations by the end of the second quarter. 

"Walter Energy posted strong financial results in the first quarter, driven by
higher volumes and pricing from our metallurgical coal operation," said Company
Chairman Michael T. Tokarz. "We have completed our transformation into a `pure
play` natural resources and energy company, and this quarter demonstrates the
potential of this portfolio of businesses to deliver substantial value." 

First Quarter 2009 Financial Results

Net sales and revenues for the first quarter 2009 totaled $343.0 million,
compared to $292.6 million in the prior-year period. The growth in revenues was
primarily driven by a 57 percent increase in realized metallurgical coal prices
and higher coal sales volumes, partially offset by lower metallurgical coke
volumes and prices. Revenues in our core natural resources and energy businesses
increased 41 percent. 

Operating income totaled $108.1 million for the quarter, up $97.7 million versus
the prior-year period. Results for the quarter reflect the revenue impacts
above, including an $80.5 million increase in operating income from our
underground mining operations, partially offset by lower results at the
metallurgical coke business. Prior-year results included the impact of a $17.0
million charge at Financing. 

Segment Results

The Company has revised its reporting segments to separate "Natural Resources"
into "Underground Mining" and "Surface Mining" operations. Underground Mining
includes the Company`s underground metallurgical coal mining and natural gas
operations. Surface Mining includes the operating results for United Land (to be
renamed Walter Minerals) and its subsidiaries Tuscaloosa Resources and Taft Coal
Sales. Kodiak Mining has been classified as discontinued operations. 

Underground Mining

Metallurgical coal sales were 1.8 million tons in the first quarter at an
average selling price of $133.24 per short ton FOB Port, versus 1.5 million tons
at an average price of $84.86 in the prior-year period. Realized prices
increased significantly, reflecting favorable contract pricing in the current
period versus the prior year. 

"Our metallurgical coal mines ran well during the quarter, with production
totaling nearly two million tons," said Jim Walter Resources Chief Executive
Officer George R. Richmond. "In addition, we overcame infrastructure challenges
to achieve significantly better-than-expected sales in the quarter." 

Metallurgical coal production at Mine No. 4 totaled 0.8 million tons in the
first quarter, down 0.2 million tons versus the prior year. The current period
included a longwall move which reduced volumes and, as a result, Mine No. 4`s
costs per ton in the quarter were $49.36, an increase of $13.33 per ton over the
prior year. 

Mine No. 7 produced 1.2 million tons in the first quarter, reflecting the
operation of two longwalls during the current period versus 1.0 million tons in
the prior year. Primarily as a result of this volume increase, production costs
at Mine No. 7 were $53.38 per ton compared to $67.36 per ton in the prior-year
period. 

Natural Gas

The natural gas business sold 1.7 billion cubic feet of gas, slightly higher
than the prior year, at an average hedged price of $6.05 per thousand cubic feet
in the first quarter 2009 compared to an average hedged price of $7.96 per
thousand cubic feet in the prior-year period. The Company currently has no
hedges on future natural gas sales. 

Surface Mining

Steam and industrial coal sales were 329,000 tons during the first quarter
compared to sales of 200,000 tons in the prior-year period. Average selling
price increased by 18.6 percent due to higher 2009 contract pricing. Production
totaled 294,000 tons in the first quarter versus prior-year production of
213,000 tons. Sales and production increases resulted from the acquisition of
Taft Coal Sales in the third quarter 2008. However, sales volumes during the
quarter were impacted by shipping delays. 

Sloss (to be renamed Walter Coke)

The Company`s metallurgical coke business sold 45,200 tons of metallurgical coke
at an average price of $308.26 per ton compared to 104,024 tons at $388.51 per
ton in the prior-year period. Metallurgical coke revenue and operating income
decreased $29.0 million and $17.1 million, respectively. Operating results were
primarily driven by 58,824 fewer tons sold and a 20.7 percent decline in pricing
versus the prior-year period, as the Company continues to face the challenges of
the significant downturn in the global steel industry. 

Other Operations

The Financing business reported first quarter revenues of $49.2 million, down
$2.9 million versus the prior-year period, on lower payment income. Financing
reported operating income of $12.2 million in the first quarter 2009 compared to
an operating loss of $6.7 million in the prior year, which included a $17.0
million charge for interest rate hedge ineffectiveness. The Company completed
the spin-off of this business on April 17, 2009 and it is now operating as
Walter Investment Management Corp. (NYSE Amex: WAC). 

The Homebuilding business reported an operating loss of $2.6 million in the
first quarter 2009, as the Company continues the process of winding down this
business. At March 31, 2009, there were 90 units remaining under construction. 

Corporate and Other

As of March 31, 2009, the Company had available liquidity of $383.7 million,
including cash of $93.0 million and $290.7 million available under its credit
facility. Total net debt outstanding at March 31, 2009 was $115.5 million
compared to $107.7 million at the end of 2008. 

Business Outlook

Given the continued uncertainty in the outlook for the global steel industry,
the Company will communicate detailed operating expectations only for the second
quarter 2009, as shown in the following schedule:

                                                                        
 Metallurgical Coal Sales                 Q1-2009 A  Q2-2009 E          
 Tons Sold (short tons, in millions)      1.8        0.9 - 1.0          
 Average Operating Margin Per Ton         $54.55     $8 - $11           
                                                                        
 Steam &amp; Industrial Coal Sales            Q1-2009 A  Q2-2009 E          
 Tons Sold (short tons)                   329,000    330,000 - 370,000  
 Average Operating Margin Per Ton         $6.55      $7 - $16           
                                                                        
 Coke Sales                               Q1-2009 A  Q2-2009 E          
 Tons Sold                                45,200     34,000 - 40,000    
 Average Operating Margin (Loss) Per Ton  $35.25     $(80) - $(50)      
                                                                          
 Quarter-to-quarter variability in timing, availability and pricing of shipments 
 may result in significant shifts in income between quarters.             
                                                                          


Second quarter 2009 metallurgical coal sales expectations are based on shipments
to date and expected shipping schedules for the rest of the quarter.
Expectations also take into account shipments at the end of the first quarter
originally expected to be delivered in the second quarter. The operating margin
range assumes the deferral of higher priced tons until a later date and higher
per-ton costs on lower production volumes. 

Metallurgical coal production is expected to be approximately 1.2 million tons
in the second quarter. The Company is matching production to current demand with
a production schedule which includes fewer operating days. Based on current
market conditions, the Company now expects to defer the startup of its Mine No.
7 East longwall until January 2010. 

Second quarter projected results for the metallurgical coke operation reflect
the dramatic decline in coke demand driven by the depressed global market for
steel. In response to a decline in demand, the Company will reduce coke
production to approximately 50 percent of capacity and may have to make further
reductions going forward. 

Capital expenditures were $37.0 million in the first quarter. The Company
expects to reduce capital expenditures to about $50 million for the remainder of
the year. Full-year 2009 capital expenditures are expected to be down
approximately $55 million from 2008.

quarter results, its outlook and other general business matters during a

 (1)     During the quarter ended March 31, 2008, the Company recognized a loss of $17.0 million for the ineffectiveness of interest rate hedges held by Financing that were intended to hedge an April 2008 securitization of instalment notes receivable. Unfavorable market conditions precluded an April 2008 securitization and management could not predict when such securitization might occur. These hedges were settled on April 1,  
         2008 and no similar hedges remain outstanding at March 31, 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Search Technologies Further Distinguishes Itself by Earning a Microsoft
Competency in SOA and Business Process
HERNDON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Search Technologies Corporation, a leading international provider and integrator
of enterprise-search software and services, today announced it has attained Gold
Certified Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program with a competency in
SOA and Business Process, recognizing Search Technologies expertise and impact
in the technology marketplace. As a Gold Certified Partner, Search Technologies
has demonstrated expertise with Microsoft technologies and a proven ability to
meet customers` needs. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners receive a rich set of
benefits, including access, training and support, giving them a competitive
advantage in the channel. 

Search Technologies is the expert at making search software and systems work
better and faster, increasing revenue for e-Commerce sites, enhancing customer
productivity and improving returns on information-technology investments. An
active Microsoft partner, Search Technologies was one of the first companies to
achieve the Information Workers Solution Search Specialization by leveraging
their experience with FAST ESP. A 60-person firm founded in the U.S. in 2005,
Search Technologies serves commercial, and government clients in the U.S.,
Europe and Asia from offices in North and Central America and the U.K. 

"Gold Partner certification is a symbol of our deep technical expertise in the
latest Microsoft platforms, including FAST ESP and SharePoint," said Kamran
Khan, Search Technologies President and Chief Executive Officer. "Gold Partner
status is especially meaningful to us because an important part of the
certification process is references from satisfied customers. The benefits
provided through our Gold Partner status, such as access, training and support,

"Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap between
their business demands and technology capabilities," said Allison Watson,
Corporate Vice President of the Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "They

Search Technologies as a new Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its
expertise in providing customer satisfaction using Microsoft products and

As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status, Search
Technologieshad to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft Competencies are

technologies to customers looking for a particular type of solution. 

Each Competency has a unique set of requirements and benefits, formulated to
accurately represent the specific skills and services that partners bring to the
technology industry. Within select Competencies, there are Specializations that
focus on specific solution areas that recognize deeper expertise within that
Competency. Serving as a specialized path to earning those Competencies,
Specializations give direct access to the tools and resources that support that
specific area of focus. 

The SOA and Business Process Competency is for systems integrators, solutions
and services providers, and software developers with proven proficiency in
implementing and deploying integrated, interoperable, and agile solutions that

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE: KO) ratings as
follows: 

--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; 

--Bank credit facility at 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1'; 

--Commercial paper (CP) at 'F1'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. This rating action affects approximately $12.2
billion of debt. 

The affirmation reflects Coca-Cola's substantial cash flow generation, which is
due to its high operating margins, its leading position in the global market for
non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages, and its strengthening
non-carbonated portfolio. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs)
in Coca-Cola's beverage portfolio, the ratings consider the multi-year decline
in CSD volume in the U.S. and modest CSD growth in other developed countries.
Additionally, the ratings recognize Coca-Cola's market strength in developing,
high-growth countries. 

On a reported basis, Coca-Cola's first quarter net revenues were down 3% versus
the prior year period, and the company's first quarter operating income declined
1% versus the prior year period. However, Coca-Cola's reported numbers were
affected by currency translations which had a negative 17% effect on operating
income. While Fitch expects currency to continue to affect Coca-Cola's results
in 2009, these effects are expected to moderate. Although negative currency
effects will weaken Coca-Cola's credit metrics, Fitch analyzes Coca-Cola on a
currency neutral basis. 

For the 12 months ended April 3, 2009, the company's credit statistics were in
line with Fitch's expectations. Total debt-to-operating earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was approximately 1.2
times (x), and operating EBITDA-to-gross interest expense was roughly 24.8x.
Coca-Cola generated over $2 billion of free cash flow for the year ended Dec.
31, 2008. While Coca-Cola's credit profile is slightly stronger than similarly
rated food and beverage companies, Coca-Cola's ratings are reflective of the
credit metrics of the Coca-Cola system, which comprises the Coca-Cola Company
and its significant and/or strategic bottlers. The company's strong credit
metrics are counter-balanced by the more highly levered credit metrics of
Coca-Cola's bottlers. 

The credit metrics of the Coca-Cola system improved from 2007 to 2008. On Dec.
31, 2008, total debt-to-operating EBITDA on an aggregated basis was 1.6x for the
Coca-Cola system. The system's Funds Flow from Operations (FFO) fixed charge
coverage on an aggregated basis was 7.1x for the year ended Dec. 31, 2008. For
the prior year, the system's total debt-to-operating EBITDA was 1.8x, and the
system's FFO fixed charge coverage was 6.8x. The modest decrease in leverage is
largely attributable to the increase in Coca-Cola's operating EBITDA from 2007
to 2008. 

With approximately $2.6 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities and $4.7
billion in cash on Dec. 31, 2008, Coca-Cola has sufficient liquidity to meet its
near-term debt obligations. Coca-Cola has $465 million of debt coming due in
2009, primarily comprised of $400 million 5.75% notes due April 30, 2009.
Additionally, Coca-Cola had approximately $5.4 billion of commercial paper on
Dec. 31, 2008. Fitch expects Coca-Cola to maintain adequate coverage of its
commercial paper through committed credit facilities and cash. 

The Coca-Cola Company is the largest manufacturer and marketer of non-alcoholic
beverage concentrates and syrups in the world. The company's most famous brand,
Coca-Cola, one of the world's most valuable brands, and its Diet Coke, Sprite,
and Fanta brands, are four of the five best-selling brands in the CSD beverage
category. The company owns or licenses nearly 500 brands in a variety of NARTD
categories, including water, enhanced water, juices and juice drinks, teas,
coffees, energy, and sports drinks, and its products are sold in more than 200
countries. Coca-Cola Company branded and licensed brand drinks total
approximately 1.6 billion of the estimated 54 billion worldwide beverage
servings consumed daily. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

disappointed some investors on Wednesday as the second-largest
U.S. oil company held its second-quarter dividend steady at 65
cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts had been expecting a 4-cent rise in the dividend
this year, according to Reuters Estimates. Chevron increased
its quarterly payout by 7 cents in April last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Wednesday it
would increase its dividend by 2 cents to 42 cents per share in
the second quarter, though analysts had been looking for 44
cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon is due to report first-quarter results on Thursday,
followed by Chevron on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (NYSE: CCE)
and its indirect wholly owned subsidiaries Coca-Cola Enterprises Finance LT 1
Commandite S.C.A. and Bottling Holdings (Luxembourg) Commandite S.C.A.
Furthermore, Fitch has assigned a long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A'
to Coca-Cola Enterprises (Canada) Bottling Finance Company, also an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of CCE, and assigned an 'A' rating to Coca-Cola
Enterprises (Canada) Bottling Finance Company's 200 million Swiss franc notes
due 2013, which are guaranteed by CCE. The ratings for CCE and its subsidiaries
are as follows: 

Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.: 

--Long-term IDR 'A'; 

--Bank credit facility 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'; 

--Short-term IDR 'F1'; 

--Commercial paper (CP) 'F1'. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises Finance LT 1 Commandite S.C.A.: 

--Long-term IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'. 

Bottling Holdings (Luxembourg) Commandite S.C.A.: 

--Short-term IDR 'F1'; 

--CP 'F1'. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises (Canada) Bottling Finance Company: 

--Long-term IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. This rating action affects approximately $9.0
billion of debt. 

The affirmation reflects CCE's continued importance within the Coca-Cola
bottling system, its ongoing debt reduction and its strengthening non-carbonated
beverage portfolio. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in
CCE's beverage portfolio, the ratings acknowledge the declining CSD volumes in
the U.S. and modest CSD growth in CCE's European territories. CCE continues to
generate substantial discretionary cash flow, averaging over $575 million in
free cash flow annually the past five years. 

While CCE is cycling through higher input costs from the heightened commodity
cost environment in 2008, the company did report improved margins in the first
quarter. The company recorded a 37.2% gross margin in the first quarter of 2009
versus a 36.5% gross margin in the prior year period. CCE also reported cost
savings in the first quarter from initiatives undertaken in late 2008. Fitch
expects CCE's margins to continue to improve in the latter half of 2009 as hedge
contracts from 2008 expire and cost cutting programs continue to yield positive
results. 

For the 12 months ended April 3, 2009, the company's credit statistics were in
line with Fitch's expectations. Total debt-to-operating earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was approximately 3.4
times (x) and operating EBITDA-to-gross interest expense was roughly 4.4x. While
CCE's credit metrics are weaker than similarly rated food and beverage
companies, CCE's ratings are reflective of the credit metrics of the Coca-Cola
system and CCE's relative importance in the Coca-Cola system, which comprises
The Coca-Cola Company and its significant and/or strategic bottlers. 

The Coca-Cola system's credit metrics improved from 2007 to 2008. At Dec. 31,
2008, total debt-to-operating EBITDA was 1.6x for the Coca-Cola system, of which
CCE is the largest bottler. The system's Funds Flow from Operations (FFO) fixed
charge coverage on an aggregated basis was 7.1x for the year ended Dec. 31,
2008. For the prior year, the system's total debt-to-operating EBITDA was 1.8x,
and the system's FFO fixed charge coverage was 6.8x. The modest decrease in
leverage is largely attributable to the increase in The Coca-Cola Company's
operating EBITDA from 2007 to 2008. 

CCE has adequate liquidity to meet its 2009 debt obligations. At Dec. 31, 2008,
the company had $2.2 billion available under $2.5 billion its five-year
committed revolving credit facility which expires 2012. Additionally, CCE had
$498 million in cash at April 3, 2009. CCE has several maturities remaining in
2009, with 175 million pound sterling 5.25% notes due May 19, 2009, $450 million
floating rate notes due Aug. 3, 2009, and $131.3 million 7.125% notes due Sept.
30, 2009. 

CCE is the Coca-Cola Company's largest bottler, accounting for 18% of the
Coca-Cola Company's volume in 2008. CCE's North American bottling territory
includes 46 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and
the 10 provinces of Canada. As of Dec. 31, 2008, the company's bottling
agreements covered a population of approximately 270 million people comprising
78% of the population of the U.S. and 98% of Canada. CCE's European bottling
agreements govern the following territory: Belgium, continental France, Great
Britain, Luxembourg, Monaco, and the Netherlands. As of Dec. 31, 2008, CCE's
European bottling agreements covered a population of approximately 149 million
people. During 2008, North American operations contributed 70% of the company's
revenues and European operations accounted for 30%.

&lt;p&gt; By John Parry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N)
on Wednesday sold $2 billion of notes not backed by a
government guarantee in a sign of an incipient thaw in credit
markets, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's a good sign for the banking sector," said William
Larkin, portfolio manager with Cabot Money Management in
Boston. Both Goldman and JPMorgan are starting to issue bonds
that are not backed by the U.S. government after a virtual
drought of such issues, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even so, with investors still wary about the fragile
banking system, it is much more expensive for banks to issue
debt outside the umbrella of government protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman sold the five-year, dollar-denominated global issue
at about 410 basis points over comparable government Treasury
yields, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters service. That was
broadly in line with initial price talk earlier on Wednesday of
412.5 basis points over Treasuries, IFR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon after the issue was priced, it was trading about 30
basis points tighter, or about 380 basis points over equivalent
Treasuries, said Bob Gorham, managing director and head of
investment-grade bond trading at Broadpoint Capital in New
York. Gorham said demand was quite brisk for new corporate bond
issues on Wednesday as the market's tone firmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An uptick in new debt sales after a two-week lull for
earnings season is also lending support to the strong sentiment
in the market, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Goldman had to offer investors much higher
compensation for the risk of holding its stand-alone debt by
selling the Wednesday issue for much higher yields than its
government-backed notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's FDIC-backed notes maturing in December 2012 were
trading at a spread of about 47 basis points over equivalent
Treasuries according to Tradeweb data, compared with about 410
basis points for the bank's Wednesday issue when it was first
sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the panic in the financial markets in the fourth
quarter of 2008, investors have generally shunned U.S. bank
bonds that are not backed by government regulator the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's five-year senior global notes were the bank's
first issue since January that were not backed by the
government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On April 16, JPMorgan made a stand-alone issue, selling $3
billion in debt without U.S. government backing for the first
time since August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's issue represents the latest inroad into a sector
of the corporate bond market that investors have mostly avoided
for months, hinting the market for this type of debt is
starting to open up again, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, bond investors generally view Goldman and JPMorgan
as among the strongest major U.S. banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both have signaled they now have the resources to repay
bailout funds which the government injected into the banking
system late last year to save it from implosion.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) is expected to take the earnings reins in
less than a week, and options players are betting the firm's first-quarter
figures will be anything but magical. According to data from WhatsTrading.com,
the cartoon king saw more than 11,000 puts change hands on Tuesday, nearly
quintupling its average single-day volume of fewer than 2,300 bearish bets. 

Most active yesterday was the security's July 20 put, which saw roughly 4,400
contracts cross the tape. The round-number 20 strike is popular among near-term
traders, as it's home to peak put open interest of about 4,600 contracts in the
front-month May series of options.

Microsoft is a great company that produces great productivity software.
DataInfoCom is also a very innovative company with software and know-how to
provide customers with ongoing predictive visibility - coupled logically with a

join the Board of Directors last year to help the company grow, I signed on
happily", said Chris.

DataInfoCom. 

"We are confident that Chris can help us. He is also great to work with. In
addition to being experienced and skilled, Chris is really intelligent and
brings a fresh perspective to most discussions", says Atanu Basu, CEO &amp;

&lt;p&gt;NEWARK, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
BioNeutral Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BONU), a chemical technology-based Life Science
company that intends to commercialize a novel combinational chemistry-based
technology, today announced that the Company has appointed Dr. Donald Goldmann,
M.D. to the Scientific Advisory Board. BioNeutral Group will be focusing its
attention in areas which Dr. Goldmann has considerable expertise including
hospital borne infections and bio-preparedness. 

Dr. Goldmann is Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and Professor
of Immunology and Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of
Public Health. He teaches a Harvard College Freshman Seminar, "The Impact of
Infectious Diseases on History and Society." Dr. Goldmann's work has focused on
preventing and controlling hospital-acquired infections. His applied research in
the health services arena focuses on quality measurement and improvement,
clinical practice guideline development and evaluation, assessment of parental
perceptions of care, and patient safety. 

Dr. Goldmann served on CDC`s Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory
Committee and chaired the taskforce that developed national guidelines for the
use of a glycopeptide antibiotic, vancomycin. He and his colleagues used
infection control as a model for quality assessment and improvement in
developing countries including Brazil, Thailand, and Indonesia (development of
validated methods to assess the structure, processes, and outcomes of infection
control programs), Hungary and Poland (training of multidisciplinary QI teams
and national surveillance), Colombia (reduction in C-section infections using QI
interventions), Russia (national infection control training initiative and
center-specific interventions), Ukraine (hospital assessments and microbiology
laboratory capacity), Mexico, (use of QI methods to prevent pediatric nosocomial
infection) and the Philippines (infection prevention collaborative and a
clinical trial of interventions to reduce antibiotic resistance in academic
NICUs). 

Dr. Donald Goldmann is a graduate of Harvard Medical School. He completed an
internship, residency, and fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital. He
served as an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer of the Centers for Disease
Control. 

"I am looking forward to working with other members of the Scientific Advisory
Board on Ygiene, which has very interesting and promising properties," said Dr.
Goldmann. "Based on my experience in combating hospital infections, we certainly
need compounds with sporicidal activity." 

Dr. Andrew Kielbania, Chief Scientist for BioNeutral Group, Inc. stated "The
addition of Dr. Goldmann to our Scientific Advisory Board is an important step
for BioNeutral. With his expertise and understanding of the unmet needs in the
healthcare arena, Dr. Goldmann will provide us invaluable insight as we launch
our new products into the healthcare market." 

"We are extremely pleased to welcome Dr. Goldmann as the newest member of our
multi-talented and highly credentialed advisory board. He brings with him many
years of hands on expert field experience both at the CDC level and from
numerous third world countries where the greatest threat of a pandemic would
originate. I am confident that he will bring tremendous added value to our
already ground breaking technology platforms," said Stephen J. Browand,
President and CEO of BioNeutral Group, Inc.

&lt;p&gt;  SOUTH BURLINGTON, VT, Apr 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Johnson &amp; Perkinson hereby announces the filing of a class action lawsuit
naming General Electric Company ("GE" or the "Company") (NYSE: GE). The
action, docket numbered 09-CIV-4152, was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. Individuals,
families, trusts or other entities that purchased GE common stock between
January 23, 2009 and February 27, 2009 (the Class Period) inclusive, and
have substantial losses, have the opportunity to participate as Lead
Plaintiffs in the currently pending class action litigation against the
Company. To do so, you must apply to serve in that capacity by May 4,
2009.

    The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants issued
numerous materially false and misleading statements regarding the safety
of the GE dividend, a priority to maintain the dividend, and that the
dividend represented a good shareholder return, which caused GE's
securities to trade at artificially inflated prices. The statements and
omissions were materially false and misleading in that they assured
investors that the dividend could be maintained without straining the
company, and failed to timely disclose the material adverse facts that
Defendants would need to cut the common stock dividend in 2009 in light
of GE's financial condition.

    Johnson &amp; Perkinson, a law firm based in South Burlington, Vermont, has
extensive experience prosecuting investor class actions and actions
involving financial fraud. Attorneys Johnson and Perkinson are both former
employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Dedicated to
maximizing shareholder return, members of Johnson &amp; Perkinson have
prosecuted complex class actions alleging securities or consumer
fraud/deception on behalf of investors/consumers against numerous public
companies since 1985, resulting in the recovery of many hundreds of
millions of dollars, and have been singled out for excellence by various
courts. The firm is litigating, or has recently resolved litigation, as
Lead or Co-Lead Counsel in securities class actions against Xerox,
Priceline, Wireless Facilities, i2 and Xchange, and served on the
Executive Committee in the Global Crossing case.

&lt;p&gt;  MEXICO CITY, Apr 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV: KOFL) (NYSE: KOF) ("Coca-Cola
FEMSA" or the "Company"), the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America
and the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world in terms of sales
volume, announces results for the first quarter of
2009.


--  Total revenues reached Ps. 22,526 million in the first quarter of
    2009, an increase of 30.5% compared to the first quarter of 2008; the
    acquisition of Refrigerantes Minas Gerais ("REMIL") contributed more than
    25% of this growth.
--  Consolidated operating income grew 17.3% to Ps. 3,305 million for the
    first quarter of 2009, mainly driven by double-digit operating income
    growth recorded in our Mercosur and Latincentro divisions. Our operating
    margin reached 14.7% for the first quarter of 2009.
--  Consolidated majority net income decreased 18.1% to Ps. 1,327 million
    in the first quarter of 2009, mainly reflecting the devaluation of the
    Mexican peso as applied to our U.S. dollar-denominated net debt, resulting
    in earnings per share of Ps. 0.72 in the first quarter of 2009.
    

    
"Our Company achieved healthy top- and bottom-line results for the
quarter, growing volumes, revenues and EBITDA by 7, 30 and 20 percent
respectively. Among other factors, we benefited from the consolidation of
our REMIL franchise territory in Brazil, the continued successful rollout
of the Jugos del Valle line of juice-based beverages in Mexico, Colombia
and Central America, and organic growth. We have the flexibility to adapt
our business through initiatives that sustain our cash flow and meet our
strategic objectives. Importantly, our company is in a very strong
financial position as exemplified by the dividends of more than 1.3
billion Mexican pesos that we paid our shareholders in the month of
April," said Carlos Salazar Lomelin, Chief Executive Officer of the
Company.

&lt;p&gt;Certeon`s aCelera Optimizes Microsoft System Center's Deployment and Management
of Applications throughout Large Distributed Enterprises
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Certeon Inc., a Microsoft Certified Partner, announced today a new Application
Acceleration Blueprint for both Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 4.5
and System Center Configuration Manager 2007 R2 (SCCM) on its aCelera Virtual
Appliance for Application Acceleration. aCelera significantly reduces the time
to deployment and simplifies the management of locally installed and virtualized
desktop applications for distributed users across an enterprise. aCelera
delivers these capabilities as a virtualized appliance running on Microsoft
Hyper-V and managed through Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager
(SCVMM). With this announcement of Certeon`s Application Acceleration Blueprints
for Microsoft App-V and SCCM, aCelera now optimizes and accelerates Microsoft
application distribution and software configuration management environments. 

Microsoft Application Management Infrastructure

Microsoft App-V is an application virtualization technology within the Microsoft
Desktop Optimization Pack which has sold over 14.1 million licenses. Microsoft
App-V transforms applications into centrally managed services that are
automatically delivered over the network to users, without installing the
application on client systems. SCCM works with the MDOP suite of products to
comprehensively assess, deploy, and update applications for servers and clients.
Certeon aCelera optimizes Microsoft App-V and SCCM by allowing branch servers to
be consolidated into an easily configured virtual appliance and dramatically
reducing the amount of traffic needed to be transmitted over the network. 

Certeon aCelera Virtualizes, Simplifies, and Accelerates Application Deployment

aCelera Virtual Appliance software is the perfect union of virtualization and
application acceleration technology and provides businesses with a combination
of cost-effective performance, scalability, and ease of management. aCelera,
with its embedded Application Acceleration Blueprints, significantly optimizes
and reduces application and file data traffic over the WAN by more than 95
percent. aCelera`s Application Acceleration Blueprints enable the efficient and
fast identification of redundant application data as it moves over the network.
By identifying and de-duplicating data, aCelera is able to only send data
changes between server and client systems, significantly reducing network
traffic and application deployment times. This capability helps overcome
possible network issues such as low bandwidth, high latency, packet loss, and
network contention, essentially mitigating the impact of the network on
application and update distribution. 

aCelera runs on Microsoft Hyper-V and, when combined with App-V and SCCM,
consolidates branch server roles into a virtualized distribution infrastructure
that is software based and therefore easily and rapidly deployed to remote
branch locations. aCelera identifies and significantly reduces Microsoft App-V
and SCCM network traffic going between the data center and the distributed sites
resulting in dramatically accelerated time to move a locally installed or
virtualized application or update into production. 

"Microsoft SCCM and App-V play a large part in lowering the TCO of delivering,
managing, and maintaining the growing number of applications used by desktops
throughout distributed enterprises," states David Greschler, Director,
Integrated Virtualization &amp; Management Strategy, Microsoft Corporation.
"Certeon`s aCelera Virtual Appliance maximizes the performance benefits which
Microsoft App-V and SCCM bring to these environments, while at the same time
directly contributing to lower application management labor costs." 

Lowest TCO

aCelera delivers a significantly lower total cost of ownership (TCO) when
compared to proprietary hardware appliances. aCelera software has been proven to
save up to 60 percent in capital and operations costs over the competition.
Along with its support of App-V and SCCM, aCelera supports Application
Acceleration Blueprints for line of business applications such as Microsoft
Office, SharePoint/MOSS, and Exchange. 

"Microsoft SCCM and App-V enable globally distributed enterprises to simplify
and accelerate their application delivery infrastructures, realize
infrastructure cost reduction benefits, and scale their delivery of applications
to a growing number of users," states Peter Dougherty, CEO and Co-founder,
Certeon Inc. "aCelera enables those optimized environments to realize their true
potential by eliminating network roadblocks, simplifying management, and
leveraging the cost saving benefits that only Certeon`s virtualized network
acceleration can deliver." 

About Certeon

Certeon`s aCelera software is the first and only application acceleration
virtual appliance to deliver acceleration, virtualization, and manageability
when remotely accessing applications throughout a distributed enterprise.
aCelera software reduces application response time over the WAN by more than 95
percent without proprietary hardware appliances. aCelera is optimized for
mission-critical applications such as: application virtualization and
management, software configuration management, enterprise content management,
Web-based collaboration, and wide area file services. aCelera is flexible and
easy to deploy, delivering faster, more scalable application acceleration to
more users. Certeon enables distributed enterprises to dramatically reduce their
TCO and gain a faster ROI when compared to proprietary hardware appliances.

WHAT:    Antenna Software, delivering real business mobility to the
         world's most demanding enterprises, today announced that its
         customer, Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE), is speaking at next week's
         Wireless Enterprise Symposium (WES) in Orlando, Fla.  CCE will
         discuss its corporate mobility strategies at WES 2009.

         Sunil Vishnubhotla, senior manager for mobile development at CCE,
         will lead a session entitled, "Mobility as a Strategic Driver at
         Coca-Cola Enterprises."  The presentation will focus on the
         crucial role mobility played in turning CCE's business into a
         real-time, event-driven enterprise.  Vishnubhotla will discuss
         how CCE has refined its business and IT processes through
         mobility to make its merchandisers, distribution workers and
         sales force function as a mobile extension of the business.

         objectives and realize the dividends of increased productivity,
         cost savings and real-time responsiveness.  During his session,
         Vishnubhotla will describe how CCE used AMP to design, build,
         deploy and manage the mobile merchandising and timekeeping
         applications on field workers' BlackBerry(R) smartphones.  He
         will also explain how the initiative served as a catalyst for
         deploying further next-generation, real-time mobile applications
         at CCE.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical has introduced Santoprene TPV 8211-85 M350, a high-flow
thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) providing a unique "comfort touch" and excellent
surface qualities for automotive interiors while offering significant cost
reduction opportunities. The "comfort touch" provided by Santoprene TPV M350
prevents the cushion-like indentation that is often associated with alternative
foamed material structures when pressed. 

Santoprene TPV M350 meets the needs of automotive original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs) and Tier 1 suppliers looking for cost-effective solutions
to enhance the appearance, style and feel of a range of automotive interiors. It
offers a range of benefits including high "comfort touch", low and stable gloss
level, high scratch and mar resistance, good abrasion and chemical resistance,
low fogging and odor emission. Also colorable, Santoprene TPV M350 is ideal for
door panels, center consoles, B-C pillars, lower instrument panels and the back
cover of seats. 

"Automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers are looking for value-added, high quality
interiors with the opportunity for significant system cost savings. Santoprene
TPV M350 can help them meet this challenge through part/function integration,
production flexibility and supply chain optimization," said Hermann-Josef Holz,
market developer, global automotive marketing, ExxonMobil Chemical. "It also
provides sustainability opportunities because less labor and time is required,
scrap can be reduced and recycling improved." 

Santoprene TPV M350 can be processed using two-component injection molding or
mono-sandwich molding onto a rigid PP substrate to produce an unfoamed structure
that does not indent. Either process provides an over-molded TPV skin with a
high "comfort-touch". 

Providing an excellent cost/performance balance, Santoprene TPV M350 is an ideal
alternative to materials currently being used such as rigid polypropylene (PP),
PP with soft-touch paint, and in some cases PVC or TPO skins. 

"Producing automotive interior parts which feel and look good, Santoprene TPV
M350 provides excellent perceived customer value. Offering a matrix of benefits,
Santoprene TPV M350 provides automotive customers with a genuine alternative to
conventional materials, enabling them to choose the cost/performance balance
needed for their application," said Holz.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Reduces Environmental Footprint through Green Innovations, Recycling
Program with National Parks Service
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola is going green in Washington, D.C. The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola
Enterprises will demonstrate their environmental leadership through a series of
innovations designed to reduce the Coca-Cola system`s environmental footprint at
each step in the manufacturing, distribution and sales processes. These efforts
include climate-friendly beverage coolers, hybrid electric delivery trucks and
trailers, and a recycling program for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. 

"With more than six million visitors each year, there is no better place to
launch a comprehensive greening effort than here in the nation`s capital where
people from all walks of life celebrate our country`s rich history and enjoy our
beverages," said Sandy Douglas, president, Coca-Cola North America. "We are
exploring new ways to protect the environment, and Washington, D.C., is a
visible demonstration of the innovation that Coca-Cola is implementing around
the country." 

"From hybrid delivery trucks to climate-friendly coolers to support for
recycling at our National Parks, we are showcasing our innovative approach to
going to market in an environmentally responsible way," said Steve Cahillane,
president, Coca-Cola Enterprises North America. "Our work in Washington, D.C.
and across the United States demonstrates our commitment to supporting
sustainable communities." 

New Climate Friendly Coolers

The House of Representatives will be among the first locations in the country to
test new climate-friendly, HFC-free, energy-efficient Coca-Cola coolers. Four
beverage coolers will be installed at the House of Representatives in the coming
weeks, and up to 1,800 Coca-Cola coolers and vending machines will be deployed
throughout the U.S. and Canada later this year. These include 1,400
climate-friendly coolers and vending machines that will be deployed at the
venues during the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games. 

The new climate-friendly Coca-Cola coolers use carbon dioxide (CO2), a natural
refrigerant gas and HFC-Free insulation, eliminating 99 percent of the direct
green house gas (GHG) emissions. The coolers include an intelligent energy
management system (EMS-55) that cuts energy use by an average of 26 percent.
CO2-based cooling technology ensures a natural, climate-friendly alternative to
HFCs and reduces energy use. CO2 has 1,400 times less global warming impact than
R-134a, the most typical HFC refrigerant gas, and will reduce indirect green
house gas emissions by more than three tons over the lifetime of the machine. 

Hybrid Electric Delivery Trucks

Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world`s largest bottler of Coca-Cola products, has
deployed 20 hybrid electric delivery trucks and tractor trailers throughout the
Washington D.C. area in the last year. CCE`s hybrid electric trucks use about 30
percent less fuel and produce about 30 percent fewer emissions than standard
trucks, and use technology to drastically reduce emissions when they`re idling
or in traffic. 

CCE will deploy 327 hybrid delivery vehicles throughout the United States and
Canada by later this year, the largest heavy-duty hybrid electric delivery fleet
in North America. The fleet will include more than 150 hybrid electric tractor
trailers, the largest hybrid vehicles in North America, and more than 170 hybrid
electric 12-bay delivery trucks. 

Support for National Parks

Building on more than 75 years of support for America`s National Parks,
Coca-Cola, the National Park Service (NPS), the National Park Foundation (NPF),
and the Trust for the National Mall (TNM) today launched a partnership to create
a recycling program for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. Coca-Cola
Recycling will work with NPS and TNM to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
the waste stream at the National Mall and develop a sustainable recycling
program. The program will be designed to suit the needs of special events and
include recycling education for visitors to the parks. 

"As one of our valued `Proud Partners`, Coca-Cola is stepping up to help us
preserve, enhance and ensure the sustainability of our country`s beautiful
National Parks and recreation areas for generations to come," said Peggy O'Dell,
Region Director, National Capital Region, National Parks Service. "Through
Coca-Cola`s support for the new recycling program, we hope to achieve the
Interior Department`s goal of diverting 50 percent of solid waste from landfills
through recycling by 2010." 

Coca-Cola also announced the year two, $600,000 expansion of the National Parks`
Active Trails program which targets an additional nine parks during 2009. In
2008, Coca-Cola committed $1.2 million in funding to promote and preserve
National Parks trails for active recreation, community volunteerism and
environmental education. Through this program more than 100 miles of trails in
seven parks have been restored or enhanced and used to engage urban youth and
local communities in active recreation at the National Parks.

approximately 80 percent of The Coca-Cola Company`s bottle and can volume in

cents per diluted share. 

Pfizer Reports, Ests Trimmed

This morning, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) reported financial results for the period
ending March 31, 2009. Revenue came in at $10,845 million, compared to our and
the Street estimates of $10,885 million and $11,080 million, respectively.
Revenue fell 8% from the first quarter 2008 and was down 3% excluding the
negative impact from foreign exchange. 

U.S. sales fell 10% to $5.0 billion while international sales of $5.9 billion
were down 7%, but increased by 3% on an operational basis. 

Lipitor sales fell 13% in the quarter and were down 17% in the U.S. This was
significantly below our estimate. It appears the weak economy is accelerating a
shift to lower-cost generic statins, including simvastatin (generic Zocor).
Sales of Celebrex and Geodon were also weaker than expected.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

BP Beats on Better Cost Controls

London-based BP`s (NYSE: BP) first-quarter results came in better than expected
on the back of stronger cost controls. Compared to the year-earlier level, weak
commodity prices offset the impact of increased oil and natural gas production
and lower costs. 

BP`s strong performance sets the stage for earnings releases by Exxon (NYSE:
XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX), which are scheduled to report their results on
Thursday and Friday this week, respectively. 

BP reiterated their 2% production growth guidance and lowered their capex budget
to under $20 billion from around $22 billion. The company`s attractive dividend
(currently yielding around 7%) remains unchanged from the fourth-quarter level,
but is up 3.5% from the year-earlier level. We believe that BP`s dividend is
safe as long as oil prices don not remain depressed (say, in the $30`s) for an
extended period of time -- an unlikely scenario in our view. 

Ardea Lands Bayer Partnership

Early this morning in a news release, Ardea Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: RDEA)
announced that it has entered into a global agreement with Bayer HealthCare
(NASDAQ: BAYRY) to develop Ardea`s small molecule mitogen-activated ERK kinase
(MEK) inhibitors for the treatment of cancer or other indications. The current
focus will be on cancers. 

Pursuant to the agreement, Ardea will grant Bayer a worldwide, exclusive license
to develop and commercialize Ardea`s MEK inhibitors for all indications. The
agreement is valued at $407 million, not including royalties. This amount
includes an upfront cash payment to Ardea of $35 million, as well as additional
cash payments upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and
sales-based milestones. Ardea is also eligible to receive low double-digit
royalties on sales of products under the agreement.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

CREE: The Lights Are On

The global movement to energy-efficient lighting is prompting lighting companies
and consumers to look at other options. Therefore, lighting will be the
strongest end market for Cree, Inc. (NASDAQ: CREE), likely followed by video
displays and notebooks. Yield improvements, higher capacity utilization, larger
wafers and offshore production will increasingly offset new product ramp up
costs. The LED market is hot in our opinion, and the LLF acquisition opens up
new opportunity. 

With the signing of the energy bill in December 2007, the U.S. government has
decided to ban inefficient light bulbs by 2012. The energy efficiency standards
set by the government effectively do away with incandescent light bulbs as we
know them today. Although General Electric (NYSE: GE) has stated that it is
developing a more efficient bulb that will meet the efficiency standards, a
delay in development may actually put it out of the running. 

B/E Aerospace Hits Turbulence

B/E Aerospace (NASDAQ: BEAV) reported Q1-09 results. Overall Sales of $523.7
million were up by 10.7% because of the July 28, 2008 acquisition of Honeywell`s
(NYSE: HON) Consumable Solutions (HCS) distribution business. However, on a
pro-forma basis (i.e., assuming HCS had been on-board last year), Overall Sales
were down 15.6%. 

Further, on the same pro-forma basis, sales were down in all of BEAV`s Segments:
Consumables Management (the segment in which HCS is parked) was off 11.1% to
$239.4 million; Commercial Aircraft declined by 18.9% to $225.9 million; and
Business Jet was down 19.7 % to $58.4 million. However, it should be noted that
Consumables Management was up by 96.2% on an as-reported basis. 

Anadys: Too Early for HCV Drug

ANA598 is Anadys` (NASDAQ: ANDS) lead anti-HCV (hepatitis C Virus) drug
candidate currently under phase I studies. The company`s share price got a boost
recently on its strong efficacy data from a phase Ib study. 

Anadys presented the final antiviral and safety data from all three dose levels
(200, 400 and 800 mg bid) at the 44th annual meeting of the European Association
for the Study of the Liver (EASL) on April 23, 2009. The trial enrolled total 35
subjects. ANA598 treatment resulted in rapid and sustained reductions in HCV RNA
with median reductions at end of treatment (day 4) exceeding 2 log10 (&gt;99%) at
all dose levels.

&lt;p&gt; * EU Commission to study Microsoft response&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft browser had 67.4 pct global market share in Feb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRUSSELS, April 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has
responded to EU antitrust charges that it sought to thwart
rivals by bundling its Web browser with its Windows PC operating
system, the European Commission said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will study it carefully," a spokesman for the
Commission, the European Union's top antitrust authority, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the Commission had received the company's reply by
an April 28 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU's executive arm charged the U.S. software giant on
Jan. 15 with infringing EU rules by abusing its dominant
position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By bundling its Internet Explorer to Windows, Microsoft
shielded its browser from head-to-head competition with rival
products, harming innovation and reducing customer choice, the
Commission had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Internet Explorer had a 67.4 percent share of the global
market in February, with the Mozilla foundation's Firefox
browser a distant second at about 22 percent, according to
market research firm Net Applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has said the Commission may order the company and
equipment makers to obligate users to choose a particular
browser when buying a computer or that multiple browsers be made
available on new Windows-based computers. This could come on top
of a possible hefty fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft was fined 899 million euros ($1.19 billion) in
February on charges it used high prices to thwart rivals and for
not complying with a previous antitrust decision by the
Commission.

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Mickey Mouse, Pluto, the Fairy Godmother and other Walt Disney favorites were still dishing out kisses, handshakes and high-fives at the Magic Kingdom on Thursday, despite the flu virus alert gripping the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the world famous Florida theme park, which is run by Walt Disney Co and visited by millions each year, enthusiastic crowds filled the avenues and rides, apparently unworried by the warnings of a possible pandemic of a new strain of influenza A (H1N1) virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has declared a health emergency and in Mexico, where up to 176 people have died following the outbreak there of the virus originally termed "swine flu," the government has ordered a five-day partial shutdown of nonessential government offices and businesses. The Mexican Health Ministry also warned people against touching or kissing while greeting each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in the United States, who have reported 109 confirmed swine flu infections but only one death, are recommending that people sick with flu symptoms seek treatment and stay home. Florida is testing a number of suspected cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Magic Kingdom on Thursday, one mother pressed her baby's face into the costumed character Pluto's furry snout for a kiss. Other youngsters continued to snuggle up to various other Disney characters and share "high-fives," while fidgety kids slid their hands along the rope lines while waiting to get on the rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the crowds were the Jansens from Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

Fitch Ratings assigns a rating of 'AAA/F1+' to the puttable tax-exempt receipts,

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp disappointed investors who in the past week had grown accustomed to energy companies reporting better-than-expected profits despite the collapse in crude oil prices since July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British gas producer BG Group Plc earlier on Thursday reported a smaller-than-expected drop in first-quarter profit, just as BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc did this week and ConocoPhillips did last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Exxon, the world's largest listed company and the oil sector leader, said Thursday that profit fell 58 percent to $4.55 billion, missing forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares fell 2.0 percent while shares of Marathon Oil Corp, which also reported earnings short of estimates, fell 2.3 percent. Other U.S. oil companies dropped in sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Coffelt, head portfolio manager at Empiric Advisors in Austin, Texas, said Exxon offered a glimpse of what to expect generally from Chevron Corp when it reports on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they probably stack up pretty similarly," he said, adding that none of them could avoid the $100 drop in the price of a barrel of oil since July to about $50 now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache Corp, currently the top U.S. independent oil and natural gas producer by value, reported better-than-expected operating earnings, but had to take a $2 billion writedown due to a collapse in natural gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and BG's core oil and gas production units suffered big profit falls due to lower prices. BG's performance was compounded by a 5 percent fall in oil and gas production, while Exxon said output rose 2 percent to 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"International upstream (exploration and production) did not see the level of cost reduction that some of the other oil companies did," Jason Gammel, oil analyst at Macquarie Research, said of Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BG's first-quarter profit, excluding one-time items, fell 13 percent to 690 million pounds ($1 billion), but was ahead of a forecast of 613 million pounds from a Reuters Estimates analysts poll. BG shares rose 1.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its relatively strong results were largely driven by a big jump in profits from shipping liquefied natural gas around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BG Group's integrated gas business is reflected in the distinctive resilience of our profits and cash flow in this challenging economic environment," Chief Executive Frank Chapman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BG's strategy to hedge and protect its LNG profits has paid off," said Richard Griffith, analyst at Evolution Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for companies that serve the producers, Norwegian oil industry suppliers Aker Solutions ASA and Fred. Olsen Energy posted bigger-than-expected profit rises, despite investors' fears that the oil services sector would be hardest hit by the drop in oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France's Technip, which builds oil rigs and deepwater pipelines, also reported a forecast-beating rise in first-quarter profit and confirmed its 2009 outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Wojciech Moskwa in Oslo, Matt Daily in New York, Anna Driver in Houston; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter, Rupert Winchester and Gerald E.

 (Recasts first paragraph, updates share prices, adds analyst
comment, detail from conference call)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Anna Driver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, April 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the
world's largest publicly traded company, posted a 58 percent
drop in quarterly profit Thursday, missing Wall Street
estimates, as the global recession sliced into demand for crude
oil and natural gas and depressed prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon were down 2 percent, compared with a 1
percent decline in the Chicago Board Options Exchange Index of
oil companies .OIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil and gas prices have dropped sharply from peaks last
summer as consumption has waned and supplies have swelled.
Crude oil averaged just over $43 per barrel in the first
quarter, down 56 percent from a year earlier; the average price
of natural gas in the United States slid 44 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Exxon, unlike rivals that have cut budgets or delayed
big projects, is still spending more on oil and gas
development. In the first quarter it spent $5.8 billion, up 5
percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In spite of the dramatic changes to the global economic
environment, Exxon Mobil is maintaining its long-term focus and
disciplined approach to capital investment," Rex Tillerson,
Exxon's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon is sticking to its projected 2009 budget of $29
billion, but executives said on a conference call that spending
could rise if the right opportunity came along. They did not
clarify what type of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The oil major is reducing the amount of money it spends on
share buybacks to $5 billion in the second quarter, about 28
percent lower than in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COST REDUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fred Burke, president of Johnston Lemon Asset Management in
Washington, D.C., sees Exxon shares as a stake in the eventual
turnaround in the world's leading economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They're going to need energy, and Exxon is the best," he
said. "There's people who are going to be buying the stock."
Burke forecast the shares -- which stood at $67.07 in afternoon
trading -- could reach $85 within six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net profit in the first quarter was $4.55 billion, or 92
cents per share, compared with $10.89 billion, or $2.02 per
share, in the same quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average had expected 95 cents per share,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "International upstream (exploration and production) did
not see the level of cost reduction that some of the other oil
companies did," said Jason Gammel, oil analyst at Macquarie
Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil and gas production in the quarter rose slightly from a
year earlier to 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day,
in line with analysts' projections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Upstream earnings slid 60 percent to $3.5 billion, while
profit at the company's refining and marketing operations fell
3 percent to $1.13 billion.

&lt;p&gt;  PARAMUS, NJ, Apr 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
NetWrix Corporation, a provider of systems management and compliance
solutions, announced today that it will introduce its  unified auditing
and compliance platform for IT environments at Microsoft Tech-Ed '09
North America, which takes place on May 11-15 at the Los Angeles
Convention Center in Los Angeles, California. NetWrix plans to
demonstrate the advantages of having a single point of management for all
auditing processes in one integrated solution at the conference, which is
expected to draw more than 5,000 IT industry professionals. The new
product has already been nominated for the Best of Tech-Ed award.

    "We're excited to be introducing our unified auditing platform at the MS
Tech-Ed Conference because we strongly believe that this new approach to 
auditing and compliance will significantly benefit our customers," said
NetWrix President and CEO Michael Fimin. "The ability to standardize on
one platform is of great value to CIOs and IT managers, since security and
compliance issues are now more critical than ever. With this solution,
NetWrix customers will no longer need separate products from different
vendors to answer questions about who changed what, when, and where in
their systems. And the good news here is that, as with most of our tools,
we're going to have a freeware version of this new product with a basic
set of features that can be used in production environments with zero
investment."

    NetWrix's new platform combines all auditing processes in one integrated
console in order to deliver a solution that streamlines compliance audits
of Active Directory, VMware, MS Exchange, SharePoint, Group Policy,
System Center, file servers, and other systems. By developing a solution
that unifies all auditing procedures, NetWrix has made the entire process
easier for organizations that want a higher level of internal governance
or need to stay compliant with SOX, HIPAA, PCI, FISMA and other
regulations. And because all systems are covered in one management
console, NetWrix customers no longer have to own different products and
manage them separately -- nor do they have the burden of maintaining
multiple tools for similar tasks. Instead, NetWrix customers can now
focus on a single product -- which can be customized to fit their
environments and, in order to fit the tightest budgets, to include only
required options, in a mix of free and paid options in any proportion.
With the unified platform, information is also consolidated into a single
data store with enhanced reporting capabilities and dashboards. Through
the standardization, NetWrix customers now have the ability to purchase
new auditing options (or even download them for free) to add as modules
into the existing set with a minimal learning curve and significantly
reduced deployment efforts.

    NetWrix representatives will be available at booth #229 at Microsoft
Tech-Ed '09 in the Los Angeles Convention Center, May 11-15. All visitors
to the NetWrix booth can register for a drawing to win a laptop.

&lt;p&gt; * Net falls 7.2 pct hurt by costs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Revenue jumps 19 pct driven by cable, satellite&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * More programming for China&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Sees limited impact from flu outbreak
 (Recasts; adds China, flu, dividend details, quotes, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cyntia Barrera Diaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, April 30 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa posted a 7.2 percent drop in first-quarter net profit
Thursday, hit by higher legal and debt servicing costs, but its
cable television business saw sizzling sales growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company expects core businesses to weather the flu
outbreak hitting the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grupo Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) said it earned 978
million pesos ($69 million), down from 1.054 billion pesos a
year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts' average forecast was 1.056 billion pesos,
according to a Reuters poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's financing costs increased sharply in the period
as the company had to pay higher interest on long-term debt. It
also had equity losses in La Sexta, the Spanish television
channel in which it holds a 40 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also paid more to lawyers representing it in a
long-standing legal battle with U.S. partner Univision. Most of
the differences between the two have been settled, but they
remain at odds over a smaller U.S. Internet distribution rights
case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First-quarter revenue was 11.4 billion pesos, up 19 percent
and driven by its cable and satellite television units, which
now contribute more to overall sales than Televisa's core
broadcast television business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fast-paced growth of Televisa's cable unit, Cablevision
(CABLECPO.MX), which last year absorbed operations from a
rival, was responsible for a 110 percent jump in this segment's
sales in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its satellite operation, SKY, posted a nearly 11 percent
increase in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's core operation, broadcast television, had more
modest revenue growth of 4.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is also proposing a 1.75 pesos per share
dividend to be voted on by shareholders later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FLU IMPACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alfonso de Angoitia, Televisa's executive vice president,
said the flu outbreak -- which has killed up to 176 people in
Mexico -- will hit some units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We may experience a slowdown in our gaming business ...
and we may also experience a decrease in magazine circulation,"
Angoitia told analysts during a conference call on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we don't expect at this point that any of our
core businesses will be directly impacted by the flu," he
stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Felipe Calderon urged people to stay home through
May 5 in a first-ever economic shutdown to contain the virus,
which has also spread to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schools, cinemas, movie theaters, restaurants and other
gathering centers have been asked to close for the next few
days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jose Baston, president of television and content, also told
analysts that Televisa is producing a third season of a popular
soap opera in Chinese for China audiences, and has kicked off
production of another series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa shares fell 1.27 percent to 43.40 pesos. On the
New York Stock Exchange, the stock fell 3 percent to $15.57
early Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1 = 14.21 pesos as of end March)

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and revises the Rating Outlooks on J.P. Morgan Chase
Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates, series 2004-PNC1, as follows: 

--$16.5 million class F to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$11 million class G to 'BB+' from 'BBB'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$20.6 million class H to 'CCC/RR1' from 'BBB-'; 

--$2.7 million class J to 'C/RR6' from 'BB+'; 

--$6.9 million class K to 'C/RR6' from 'BB-'; 

--$4.1 million class L to 'C/RR6' from 'B+'; 

--$5.5 million class M to 'C/RR6' from 'B-'; 

--$2.7 million class N to 'C/RR6' from 'CCC/DR1'. 

In addition, Fitch affirms and revises the Rating Outlook on the following
class: 

--$11 million class E at 'A-'; Outlook to Negative from Stable. 

Fitch also affirms and maintains the Rating Outlooks on the following classes,
as indicated: 

--$228 million class A-1A at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$78.9 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$98 million class A-3 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$426.2 million class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$28.8 million class B at 'AA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$13.7 million class C at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$17.8 million class D at 'A'; Outlook Stable; 

--$2.7 million class P at 'C/RR6'. 

Fitch does not rate the $11.5 million class NR certificates. Class A-1 has paid
in full. 

The downgrades are due to the expected losses on the four specially serviced
loans (12.6%). One loan (3.3%) has transferred to special servicing since
Fitch's last rating action in November 2008. The Rating Outlooks reflect the
likely direction of any rating changes over the next one to two years. 

Fitch has identified 15 Loans of Concern (20.3%), which include the four
specially serviced loans, as well as other loans with weak performance. The
largest specially serviced loan (5.1%) was originally collateralized by a
portfolio of six retail centers encompassing a total of 683,846 square feet (sf)
located in four states. The loan transferred to special servicing in July 2008
when the borrower, a subsidiary of Centro Properties Group, indicated an
inability to refinance before the February 2009 maturity date. A loan
modification was approved, extending the maturity date to February 2010 and
allowing for the partial release of collateral. Two of the six retail centers
have been sold, and the proceeds applied to pay down the loan amount. The
remaining four properties are currently listed for sale. Fitch expects that the
sale process could be prolonged in light of the restricted lending environment
and losses are possible. 

The second largest specially serviced loan (3.3%) is secured by a portfolio of
four office buildings and one industrial property located in New Hampshire and
Massachusetts. The loan transferred to special servicing in March 2009 after the
borrower indicated an inability to make the debt service payments due to the
loss of three large tenants at the properties. The special servicer is currently
exploring workout options. 

The third largest specially serviced loan, (2.5%), is secured by a 182,322 sf
office in Melville, NY. The principal of the borrower, which is also a major
tenant at the property (American Home Mortgage, 59% of net rentable area), filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The borrowing entity has not filed Chapter 11 and has
not been consolidated into the bankruptcy filing. The loan is currently 90+ days
delinquent and the property is 95% physically vacant. An updated appraisal value
has been received for the property and the value indicates significant losses
upon disposition. 

The largest loan in the pool, Centro Retail Portfolio (13.7%), maintains its
investment-grade shadow rating. The loan is secured by seven anchored retail
properties, 54% located in southern CA, and 46 % in northern CA. The
weighted-average year-end (YE) 2008 occupancy was 93%, in-line with occupancy at
issuance (95%). The properties are occupied by a diverse tenant base with
minimal exposure to currently bankrupt tenants. Major tenants at the properties
include Wal-Mart, Target, and Marshall's. The loan has a coupon of 4.85% and
matures in 2014. Though collateral performance has been stable to date, Fitch is
concerned about the declining financial condition of the loan sponsor, Centro
Properties Group. Fitch will continue to monitor the loan. 

As of the April 2009 distribution date, the pool's collateral balance has
decreased 10.1% to $986.6 million from $1.10 billion at issuance. Eighteen loans
(24.9%) have defeased, including three (12.2%) of the top 10 loans. 

Two non-defeased loans (1.5%) are scheduled to mature in 2009, and both loans
have a YE 2008 debt service coverage ratio above 3.45 times (x). The weighted
average coupon for all of the transaction's non-defeased loans is 5.72% and the
range is 4.44% to 9.50%.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Options players from both sides of the Street centered on credit card concerns
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) on Wednesday. The
former of the duo reported stronger-than-expected earnings yesterday, while the
latter is slated to report its quarterly figures before the market opens
tomorrow. 

According to data from WhatsTrading.com, V saw roughly 37,500 calls change hands
yesterday, more than twice its average single-day volume of fewer than 15,700
bullish bets. Most active was its May 65 call, which saw nearly 11,500 contracts
cross the tape. However, in late morning trading, the equity's June 70 call has
seen about 12,750 calls change hands, while its June 60 call has seen intraday
volume of nearly 10,500 contracts. In addition, Visa's May 65 and 70 calls have
each seen more than 7,000 contracts cross the tape so far today. Echoing this
trend, during the past couple of weeks, speculators on the International
Securities Exchange (ISE) have bought to open nearly three times more calls than
puts on the stock.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with turnout, blast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Shilpa Jamkhandikar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI, April 30 (Reuters) - Millions of Indians voted in
the third round of a general election on Thursday in several
states seen as key to the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party's bid to win power from the Congress-led ruling coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial hub Mumbai voted just months after an attack
by Islamist gunmen that killed 166 people and inflamed tensions
with nuclear-armed Pakistan, a security issue the BJP has used
to criticise the government for being soft on terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BJP appears to be trailing its main rival in a
staggered, month-long election that could produce a weak
coalition government as India grapples with the global economic
slowdown and a spate of militant attacks in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many middle-class voters in Mumbai said anger over the
attacks pushed them to vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would have never voted if it hadn't been for 26/11. I
think it's shaken all of us and the performance by our MPs has
been dismal." said Devang Vyas, a 39-year-old manager. "I'm
voting for change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say the BJP hopes anger over the Mumbai attacks may
help garner more support among 144 million eligible voters in
Thursday's round that covers Hindu nationalist strongholds in
western and central India, as well as insurgency-hit Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BJP will hope to get a big haul in the western state of
Gujarat where one of the party's biggest stars, the
controversial chief minister Narendra Modi, has been touted as
an exemplar of the party's campaign of development and good
governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both main parties may need the support of regional players
to form a government after the world's largest democratic
exercise, in which 714 million people from a myriad of castes,
religions and ethnicities can vote, ends on May 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While India's main vote battle is between Congress and the
BJP, a coalition of smaller parties known as the Third Front has
an outside chance. That worries many investors who see the bloc
as an unknown quantity if it comes to power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BJP needs to fulfil its potential in stronghold states
such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka on Thursday to
boost its chances of forging a winning coalition, said Swapan
Dasgupta, a political analyst with links to the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All in all, it's a big day for the BJP. They're fighting in
their strongholds or places where they feel they can make
inroads," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BJP scored a narrow victory over Congress in Gujarat,
which counts for 26 out of 543 seats in the national parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Modi, tipped to eventually take over from the party's
candidate for prime minister, the 81-year-old L.K. Advani, is
seen as the driving force behind Gujarat's economic success
story and appeals to the party's large Hindu vote bank
nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BJP will hope to build on what the business-friendly
Modi achieved at the state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Modi's image -- and the BJP's -- may be tarnished as he
is under investigation for allegedly turning a blind eye to some
of India's worst religious riots, in which around 2,500 people,
mainly Muslims, died in Gujarat in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Election officials estimated Thursday's voter turnout at
49-50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maoist violence hit the first two rounds of voting in the
April-May general election, killing at least 21 people when 
rebels targeted police and polling officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; West Bengal state has deployed more than 19,000 paramilitary
troops. But as polls opened, a blast at a school in Maoist-hit
Purulia district wounded one paramilitary man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A suspected Maoist blast later killed two election officials
returning from duty in a jungle area of the state, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parts of the restive Kashmir valley voted despite a boycott
call by separatists who do not want New Delhi to present a
healthy turnout as Kashmiris' acceptance of Indian rule. The
turnout was a low 21 percent, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday government troops locked down Kashmir's main
city, Srinagar, the focus of a 20-year insurgency.

&lt;p&gt;More than 1,400 Cancer Deaths Reported by Experts
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron is responsible for creating a "humanitarian crisis of epic proportions"
in Ecuador`s rainforest where more than 1,400 people reportedly have died of
cancer and indigenous groups are struggling to survive the dumping of billions
of gallons of toxic waste, a representative of the local communities testified
this week before the U.S. Congress. 

"The environmental degradation of this area, done intentionally by Texaco [now
Chevron] to lower production costs, has today produced a humanitarian crisis of
epic proportions," testified Steven Donziger, a lawyer for the affected
Amazonian communities, before the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, named
after the former representative from California and Holocaust survivor. 

Donziger charged that Texaco used a variety of sub-standard practices that
decimated six indigenous groups and caused more than 1,400 deaths from cancer. A
court-appointed expert in a 15-year civil trial in Ecuador recently estimated
that damages to Chevron could be as high as $27 billion - an amount that would
wipe out more than a year of profits for the oil giant. 

"The human rights of these vulnerable peoples have been violated by
intentionally reckless operational practices used to extract oil," added
Donziger. "It is important that the Congress and the American people know about
this crisis and its connection to our country." 

The number of cancer deaths comes from a court report prepared by 15 technical
experts and is based on survey information and demographic data. Local residents
believe the number is conservative because most people in the isolated region
die without receiving medical care, and therefore are never included in the
nation`s cancer database or associated mortality reports. 

A decision in the case, where Chevron has told U.S. government officials that it
expects a "significant adverse" judgment, is expected later this year. The
damages stem from Texaco`s role from 1964 to 1990 as the sole operator of oil
concession in a large swath of the Amazon river basin in Ecuador. 

Donziger, who has been working on the case for more than 15 years, described
Chevron`s operation in Ecuador as an environmental "pump and dump" operation. 

"Texaco pumped the oil of the ground, separated the crude and sold it on the
commercial market, and then dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste into the
Amazon," said Donziger. "In this area of Ecuador the water, soil, and air on
which thousands of people depend for almost every aspect of their daily
sustenance is for the most part poisoned." 

The lawsuit charges that Texaco systematically discharged billions of gallons of
"formation water" into the rainforest and abandoned more than 900 toxic waste
pits gouged out of the jungle, which are still leaking toxins into soils and
groundwater on which the local population relies for drinking water. 

Formation water is a mixture of harmful hydrocarbons that includes the
carcinogen benzene and is highly saline. In the U.S. and most other countries,
"formation waters" almost always are re-injected into deep wells to avoid
contamination of fresh water. 

Donziger also charged that there were three additional rights violations of the
Amazonian communities in Ecuador:

* The Ecuadorian leaders of the lawsuit have been victimized by deaths threats,
robberies, and in one case, an attempted assault. 
* The legal rights of the victims have been undermined by Chevron`s "abuse of
the judicial process" used to obstruct and delay the trial, making it impossible
to resolve the claims in an expeditious manner. 
* Chevron practices "environmental racism" in Ecuador in that it contaminated
the environment in the ancestral lands of indigenous groups while at the same
time adhering to safe operating practices in the U.S.

Donziger pointed out that 100% of the 94 former Texaco sites inspected during
the trial have high levels of soil contamination. 

"In our opinion, the evidence points overwhelming to Chevron`s culpability," he
added. "The only issue is whether Chevron`s legal maneuvers and violations of
fundamental human rights will continue to delay the end of the trial."

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded company, posted a 58 percent drop in quarterly profit, missing Wall Street estimates, as the global recession sliced into demand for crude oil and depressed prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon and other energy companies have seen oil and gas prices fall sharply from peaks last summer as consumption wanes and supplies swell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil in the first quarter averaged just over $43 per barrel, down 56 percent from the same quarter a year before, while the average price of natural gas in the United States slid 44 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still Exxon, unlike other peers that have cut budgets or delayed big projects, is still spending more on oil and gas development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon spent $5.8 billion on exploration and development in the first quarter, up 5 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In spite of the dramatic changes to the global economic environment, Exxon Mobil is maintaining its long-term focus and disciplined approach to capital investment," Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred Burke, president of Johnston Lemon Asset Management in Washington, D.C., sees Exxon shares as a stake in the eventual turnaround in the world's leading economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're going to need energy, and Exxon is the best," he said. "There's people who are going to be buying the stock." Burke predicted Exxon could reach $85 a share within six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net profit in the first-quarter was $4.55 billion, or 92 cents per share, compared with $10.89 billion, or $2.02 per share in the same quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had Exxon to report a profit of 95 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas production in the quarter rose slightly from a year ago to 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, in line with analysts' projections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upstream earnings slid 60 percent to $3.5 billion, while profit at the company's refining and marketing fell 3 percent to $1.13 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon purchased 107 million shares of its stock in the first quarter, for a gross cost of $7.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon edged up a few cents in premarket trading from Wednesday's New York Stock Exchange close of $68.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco, editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED: 

"ExxonMobil posted solid first quarter results despite the slowdown in the
global marketplace and sharply lower commodity prices.ExxonMobil`s first quarter
earnings were $4.6 billion, down 58% from the first quarter of last
year.Earnings per share were down 54% reflecting lower earnings and the benefit
of the share purchase program.

"In spite of the dramatic changes to the global economic environment, ExxonMobil
is maintaining its long-term focus and disciplined approach to capital
investment.In the first quarter, capital and exploration project spending
increased to $5.8 billion, up 5% from last year. We are committed to investing
in our world-class inventory of projects to develop new energy supplies which
are vital to economic growth.

"The Corporation returned significant cash to shareholders in the first quarter,
distributing a total of $9.0 billion through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding."

FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

* Earnings were $4,550 million, a decrease of 58% or $6,340 million from the
first quarter of 2008. 
* Earnings per share were $0.92, a decrease of 54%. 
* Capital and exploration expenditures were $5.8 billion, up 5% from the first
quarter of 2008. 
* Oil-equivalent production of 4.2 million barrels per day was up slightly from
the first quarter of 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC
quota effects and divestments, production was up 2%. 
* Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately $9.1 billion,
including asset sales of $0.1 billion. 
* Share purchases of $7.0 billion reduced shares outstanding by 1.9%. 
* ExxonMobil announced the arrival of the first Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
cargo at the South Hook LNG receiving terminal in Wales. The terminal adds to
the United Kingdom`s LNG import capacity and energy diversity, with the ability
to deliver up to 2 billion cubic feet of gas daily into the U.K. market. The
terminal forms part of the Qatargas II joint venture which will supply gas to
the U.K. from Qatar`s North Field. 
* ExxonMobil inaugurated its newest high efficiency cogeneration plant at its
Antwerp refinery in Belgium. In addition to generating 125 megawatts, the new
plant will reduce Belgium`s carbon dioxide emissions by an amount equivalent to
removing 90,000 cars from Europe`s roads. 
* ExxonMobil Chemical announced it will build a technology center in Shanghai,
China to provide product applications support for its growing business in the
Chinese and Asian markets. The technology center is expected to be operational
in 2010.

First Quarter 2009 vs. First Quarter 2008

Upstream earnings were $3,503 million, down $5,282 million from the first
quarter of 2008. Lower crude oil realizations reduced earnings approximately
$4.4 billion while lower natural gas prices decreased earnings about $500
million. Higher operating expenses reduced earnings about $300 million. 

On an oil-equivalent basis, production was up slightly from the first quarter of
2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production was up 2%. 

Liquids production totaled 2,475 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), up 7 kbd
from the first quarter of 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes,
OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was up 3%, as increased
production from projects in west Africa, the United States and the North Sea,
and lower maintenance activity more than offset natural field decline. 

First quarter natural gas production was 10,195 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per
day), down 34 mcfd from 2008. New production volumes from project additions in
Qatar, the North Sea, and Malaysia were offset by natural field decline and
lower European demand. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $360 million, $1,271 million lower
than the first quarter of 2008. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $3,143 million,
down $4,011 million from last year. 

Downstream earnings of $1,133 million were down $33 million from the first
quarter of 2008. Volume and mix effects reduced earnings about $400 million,
while unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and higher operating expenses
decreased earnings about $300 million. Higher margins increased earnings about
$700 million. Petroleum product sales of 6,434 kbd were 387 kbd lower than last
year's first quarter, mainly reflecting asset sales and lower demand. 

U.S. Downstream earnings were $352 million, down $46 million from the first
quarter of 2008. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $781 million were $13 million
higher than last year. 

Chemical earnings of $350 million were $678 million lower than the first quarter
of 2008. Lower volumes and lower margins each reduced earnings approximately
$300 million. Unfavorable foreign exchange effects also reduced earnings. First
quarter prime product sales of 5,527 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 1,051 kt
lower than the prior year due to lower demand. 

Corporate and financing expenses of $436 million increased by $347 million due
overall to net lower interest income. 

During the first quarter of 2009, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 107 million
shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $7.9 billion.
These purchases included $7.0 billion to reduce the number of shares
outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with
the company's benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from
4,976 million at the end of the fourth quarter to 4,880 million at the end of
the first quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently
anticipated to equal $5.0 billion through the second quarter of 2009. Purchases
may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may
be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 

ExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters on a
webcast at 10 a.m. Central time on April 30, 2009.To listen to the event live or

Cautionary statement

Statements in this release relating to future plans, projections, events or
conditions are forward-looking statements.Actual results, including project
plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital expenditures; and share purchase
levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in long-term
oil or gas prices or other market conditions affecting the oil and gas industry;
completion of repair projects as planned; unforeseen technical difficulties;
political events or disturbances; reservoir performance; the outcome of
commercial negotiations; wars and acts of terrorism or sabotage; changes in
technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading
"Factors Affecting Future Results" on our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's
2008 Form 10-K.We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future
date.References to quantities of oil expected to be developed may include
amounts not yet classified as proved reserves but that we believe will
ultimately be produced.

Frequently used terms

Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both earnings
excluding special items and earnings per share excluding special items.Both are
non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of
base business performance across periods.A reconciliation to net income
attributable to ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.The release also includes
cash flow from operations and asset sales.Because of the regular nature of our
asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors
to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities
when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing
activities.A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is
shown in Attachment II.Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used
financial and operating measures and other terms is contained under the heading
"Frequently Used Terms" available through the Investors section of our website
at exxonmobil.com.

Accounting standards adopted in first quarter 2009

Effective January 1, 2009, ExxonMobil adopted the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's (FASB) Statement No. 160 (FAS 160), "Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements - an Amendment of ARB No. 51". FAS 160 changed
the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be
recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of
equity.FAS 160 required retrospective adoption of the presentation and
disclosure requirements for existing minority interests.All other requirements
of FAS 160 will be applied prospectively. The adoption of FAS 160 did not have a
material impact on the Corporation`s financial statements.

References to total corporate earnings mean net income attributable to
ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the income statement.Unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, special items, earnings excluding special items,
Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and
earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable
to noncontrolling interests.

Effective January 1, 2009, ExxonMobil adopted the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's Staff Position (FSP) on the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.
03-6-1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
Transactions are Participating Securities".The FSP required that all unvested
share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends
should be included in the basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) calculation. Prior-year
EPS numbers have been adjusted retrospectively on a consistent basis with 2009
reporting. This standard did not affect the consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) plans to
temporarily shut, starting Thursday, a gasoline-making fluid
catalytic cracker CO boiler at its 348,000-barrel-per-day
refinery in Beaumont, Texas, to install a unit, it said in an
environmental filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The FCCU normally operates in partial-burn mode, producing
CO (carbon monoxide) that is combusted in the CO Boiler. During
the CO Boiler shutdown, the FCCU will be operated in full-burn
mode to minimize the CO emissions," Exxon said in a filing with
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, traders said Exxon plans to work on an FCC unit
at Beaumont for 30 to 40 days in early May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CO boiler will be temporarily shut down in order to
complete the installation of the Selective Catalytic Reduction
(SCR) Unit, Exxon said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The work is seen done May 1, the filing added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery, the third largest in Texas, has 117,000 bpd
of catalytic cracking capacity. A refinery spokesperson was not
immediately available for comment.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, April 30 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) on Thursday
announced plans to strengthen its equities franchise in India,
appointing a vice chairperson and naming five other new hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While JPMorgan did not say where the six new hires came
from, all arrived from Merrill Lynch's Indian unit, sources with
direct knowledge of the matter said. The sources were not
authorised to speak about the hires because of their sensitive
nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said that Kaku Nakhate, who was head of global
markets for India at DSP Merrill Lynch, will become vice
chairperson of JPMorgan's Indian operations. Nakhate will lead
its cash equities, equity derivatives and futures and options
group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan also said it appointed Manish Prasad and Avinash
Gupta as co-heads of equities and futures and options in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources said three other bankers from Merrill's Indian unit
were hired by JPMorgan: Aditya Khansaheb and Sachin Parekh will
join the cash equities and FO team, while Manish Tawde will
become head of equity derivatives and structured products in
India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's poach is yet another blow to Bank of America
(BAC.N), Merrill Lynch's new owner, which has suffered a wave of
defections from its bankers, worried about pay and the future of
the struggling bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The moves also underscore the strength of JPMorgan by
comparison. The commercial bank has so far avoided the major
troubles that have plagued its U.S. rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters reported last week that JPMorgan was set to hire
Nakhate and other members of the equity sales trading team at
DSP Merrill. [ID:nBOM49602]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined to comment about where the new team came
from. A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

What Could Kill Apple-Verizon Deal?

In the continuing saga of the iPhone and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) the press has
written about a liaison between Verizon and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to sell a
Microsoft-designed iPhone killer. 

There is a cultural divide between Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft with rabid
Apple devotees denigrating anything Microsoft. The popular opinion is that it
takes three tries before Microsoft gets anything right (this goes back to the
introduction of Windows where version 3.1 was the first version that worked). 

There is also the notion that Microsoft is a software company. However,
Microsoft has a very successful business selling mice and keyboards. Apple is
known for its better operating systems. 

NAL Beats, but Credit Deteriorates

NewAlliance Bancshares, Inc. (NYSE: NAL) reported its 1Q09 financial results
after market close yesterday. A conference call to discuss the results was held
this morning. 

Diluted earnings for the quarter came in at $0.12 per share, four cents ahead of
our estimate. An almost-stable NIM, strong organic loan originations, growth in
core deposits, reduced deposit costs, continued diligent expense control and a
strong capital position were the key positives for the quarter. 

Anadigics Hurt by Lower Guidance

Shares of Anadigics Inc. (NASDAQ: ANAD, Hold) are off nearly 8% in early trading
today following the company`s better-than-expected Q1 results released
yesterday. Apparently, the stock is discounting ANAD`s forward guidance, which
is lower than our and consensus expectations. 

The company saw continued weakness in the Broadband area as directly related to
the current economic downturn, impacting its wireless and cable segments. ANAD
sees this weakness well into Q2 and clearly does not expect an upturn until Q3.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters Life!) - Hong Kong's top financial official will meet Walt Disney Co. management in Los Angeles later this week to discuss the stalled expansion of the struggling Hong Kong theme park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney and the Hong Kong government have been embroiled in protracted discussions over financing for a second phase of the world's smallest Disneyland which could cost a reported HK$3 billion ($387 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opened in 2005, Hong Kong Disneyland has been criticized for being far too small to attract repeat visitors despite its proximity to mainland China. Visitor number projections failed to reach initial bullish predictions, and the Chinese tourist market has since been hit by the economic slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney meanwhile has signed a framework agreement with authorities in Shanghai to build a park there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting between Hong Kong Financial Secretary John Tsang and Disney on Friday in Los Angeles follows Disney's decision last month to put the expansion on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The involvement of such a senior Hong Kong official underscores the importance the government sets on getting negotiations back on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope we can maintain positive engagement with Disney on the matter, but it's hard to predict whether there'll be a breakthrough after the meeting," said a government source cited in a report by the South China Morning Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Disney said it would put the expansion plans on ice and fire about 30 staff dubbed "Imagineers" who had helped conceptualize and plan the Hong Kong expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney wants the (Hong Kong) government to put in some of the (financing) loan, but the government can't do it. It's a very sensitive issue," a well-placed source close to officials involved in the talks told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney's trying to drive a hard bargain (with Hong Kong) and Shanghai's an ace in the hole."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by James Pomfret; Editing by Nick Macfie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Amount of funds raised not disclosed
 (Adds more details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Samuel Shen and Helen Ding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI, April 30 (Reuters) - Three former executives at
JPMorgan Asset Management plan to launch a Greater China hedge
fund via a start-up in Hong Kong, tapping rising investor demand
for Asian equities amid the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Greater China may be the first region to recover from the
global economic crisis, and will certainly attract global fund
flows," Lu Jun, one of the co-founders said in a telephone
interview. "I think it's good timing to launch the new fund."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lu, previously a star fund manager at JPMorgan's (JPM.N)
China fund venture, has teamed up with Man Wing Chung, former
head of JPMorgan's Greater China team, and Joseph Tang, who
focused on Taiwan investment, to co-found JTM Capital Partners.
The partners will start running a hedge fund in mid-June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lu declined to say how much money had been raised for the
Greater China Opportunity Fund, which would use hedging
strategies to reduce volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) stimulus package and a
slew of encouraging data in recent weeks have lured global
investors to bet that the world's third-largest economy might
have bottomed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asian equity funds saw $1.6 billion in inflows in the seven
weeks to April 22, compared with $8.1 billion in outflows during
the same period last year. Most of the money went to
China-focused funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chinese government, companies and individuals have sound
balance sheets and adequate cash, so the economy can weather the
crisis through increased lending and consumption, Lu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2007, Lu resigned from JPMorgan's venture, China
International Fund Management Co and started his own fund house
Shanghai Congrong Investment Management Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chung, who also worked for HSBC Asset Management HK Ltd, set
up fund management firm HindSight after leaving JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A growing number of top bankers and fund managers from
Merrill Lynch to Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are leaving big banks to
start new, Asia-focused firms, as the global financial crisis
crippled several western institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Morse, a former top executive of Citigroup (C.N) in
Asia, announced on Wednesday the launch of a new financial
services firm in partnership with two former colleagues after
raising $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(US$1=6.832 Yuan)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Patients suffering from post-traumatic peripheral nerve pain treated with Lyrica
(pregabalin) capsules CV experienced significantly reduced pain compared to
those taking placebo, according to new data presented today at the American
Academy of Neurology annual meeting. The data also showed that patients treated
with Lyrica reported less pain interference with sleep and were significantly
more likely to report feeling better overall at the end of the study compared
with placebo. 

Post-traumatic peripheral nerve pain is a difficult to treat condition that
occurs after nerve damage due to trauma from accidental injury or surgery. It
can be a chronic condition, affecting the injured area with pain persisting long
after the initial injury has healed. Traumatic injury causing long-lasting
changes to the peripheral nervous system - the communications network that
transmits information to and from the central nervous system (the brain and
spinal cord) and every other part of the body - is believed to be the cause of
this persistent pain. Post-traumatic peripheral nerve pain can have a wide array
of symptoms, including numbness, tingling and prickling sensations, sensitivity
to touch or more extreme symptoms including burning pain. 

"The findings of the study are good news for the many patients who suffer from
this painful and debilitating condition," said Robert van Seventer, MD, Chair of
the Department of Anesthesiology and Director of Amphia Pain Clinic and Research
Centre, Amphia Hospital, the Netherlands. "Post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic
pain has historically been a challenging condition to treat so this data
demonstrating the ability of pregabalin to provide relief for patients is
encouraging." 

The study found patients treated with Lyrica experienced significantly reduced
pain compared to those taking placebo. At the end of the study, patients
receiving Lyrica had, on average, a pain score that was 0.62 points lower on an
11-point scale compared to placebo. Patients receiving Lyrica reported less pain
interference with sleep compared to placebo. At the end of the study, patients
receiving Lyrica had an average self-reported weekly pain-related sleep
interference score of 2.73 (from a baseline of 4.1) on an 11-point scale
measuring how much pain had interfered with sleep during the past 24 hours,
compared to 4.13 for placebo (from a baseline of 4.8). Additionally, at the end
of the study, significantly more patients receiving Lyrica (64 percent) reported
feeling "improved" compared to placebo (41 percent). 

About the Study

The multi-center, double-blind, placebo controlled study of Lyrica in 254 adult
patients with post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain randomized patients to
receive flexible dose Lyrica 150 mg to 600 mg daily for four weeks of dose
optimization, followed by fixed dosing for four weeks. The study was conducted
at 60 sites across Canada and Europe. The average Lyrica dose was 326 mg daily.
Patients had to experience persisting, neuropathic pain for at least three
months following a traumatic event such as an accident, surgery, amputation or a
nerve injury and have a pain score greater than or equal to 4 on an 11-point
scale. Patients remained on existing treatments during the study. 

Patients were asked to measure their pain on a scale of zero to 10; the average
baseline scores for study participants were 6.0 in the pregabalin group and 6.3
in the placebo group on this 11-point scale. A score of 4.0 to 7.0 is considered
moderate pain and a score of greater than 7.0 is considered severe pain. 

The primary endpoint was the difference in average self-reported pain score at
the study`s conclusion between patients treated with Lyrica and placebo.
Secondary endpoints included the effects of Lyrica compared to placebo on
co-morbid symptoms of post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain including
anxiety, patients` self-reported pain-related sleep and patients` self-reported
overall improvements. 

The most common side effects in the study versus placebo were dizziness (43.3
percent vs. 9.4%) and somnolence (15.7 percent vs. 6.3%), followed by headache
(11.8 percent vs. 11.0%), fatigue (11.8 percent vs. 7.9%) and dry mouth (11.0
percent vs. 4.7%). 

The study was funded by Pfizer Inc. 

About Lyrica

In the United States, Lyrica is approved for the management of fibromyalgia.
Lyrica is also indicated for the management of painful diabetic peripheral
neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia (pain after shingles), and for the adjunctive
treatment of partial onset seizures (a type of epilepsy) in adults. Outside of
the United States, Lyrica is indicated in adults for the management of
peripheral and central neuropathic pain (NeP), treatment of generalized anxiety
disorder, and adjunctive therapy for partial seizures with or without secondary
generalization. 

Important Safety Information

Treatment with Lyrica may cause dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema or
blurred vision. Other most common adverse reactions include dry mouth, weight
gain, constipation, euphoric mood, balance disorder, increased appetite and
thinking abnormally. There have been post-marketing reports of angioedema and
hypersensitivity.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's top financial official will meet Walt Disney Co. management in Los Angeles later this week to discuss the stalled expansion of the struggling Hong Kong theme park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney and the Hong Kong government have been embroiled in protracted discussions over financing for a second phase of the world's smallest Disneyland which could cost a reported HK$3 billion ($387 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opened in 2005, Hong Kong Disneyland has been criticized for being far too small to attract repeat visitors despite its proximity to mainland China. Visitor number projections failed to reach initial bullish predictions, and the Chinese tourist market has since been hit by the economic slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney meanwhile has signed a framework agreement with authorities in Shanghai to build a park there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting between Hong Kong Financial Secretary John Tsang and Disney on Friday in Los Angeles follows Disney's decision last month to put the expansion on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The involvement of such a senior Hong Kong official underscores the importance the government sets on getting negotiations back on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope we can maintain positive engagement with Disney on the matter, but it's hard to predict whether there'll be a breakthrough after the meeting," said a government source cited in a report by the South China Morning Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Disney said it would put the expansion plans on ice and fire about 30 staff dubbed "Imagineers" who had helped conceptualize and plan the Hong Kong expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney wants the (Hong Kong) government to put in some of the (financing) loan, but the government can't do it. It's a very sensitive issue," a well-placed source close to officials involved in the talks told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney's trying to drive a hard bargain (with Hong Kong) and Shanghai's an ace in the hole."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by James Pomfret; Editing by Nick Macfie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERTH (Reuters) - Chevron Corp on Thursday won conditional approval from an Australian environmental regular for the multi-billion dollar Gorgon gas project, bringing a final investment decision closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Western Australia said that although it was still opposed to the building of the Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility on a nature reserve, the plan could pass with strict conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The EPA considers that the current proposal could only meet the EPA's environmental objectives if, and only if, stringent conditions were applied to it," the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendations are subject to a two-week public appeal process, after which the state government will make a final decision on whether to allow the project and on any conditions to be imposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. oil major, partnered with Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp, wants to increase the size of Gorgon to 15 million tons per annum (mtpa), after having received state approval for a 10 mtpa project in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPA approval clears one of the key regulatory hurdles and paves the way for Chevron to make a final investment decision on the project, which the Western Australian government has estimated would cost about A$50 billion ($35 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in a separate statement that it was working toward a final investment decision in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Reuters, Chevron Australia's Gorgon General Manager Colin Beckett said first LNG cargoes are expected in 2014, confirming several years of speculation that production would be far delayed from the original 2010-2011 target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beckett declined to forecast the project's cost, saying the venture is in the process of seeking and assessing bids for work contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're getting contractors to update their costs with 2009 prices. This is to make sure we'll get the best prices and take advantage of lower construction costs in this downturn," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has for several years avoided committing to a final investment target date for Gorgon, after saying in 2006 that it was not likely that year. Chevron's most recent cost update for Gorgon of A$11 billion was given five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which owns 50 percent of Gorgon, said it may expand Gorgon to 25 mtpa in the future and that it was continuing to talk to a range of potential LNG customers for its share of uncontracted gas of about 3 mtpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about potential regions Chevron was eyeing to sell the Gorgon gas, Beckett said: "Asia is obviously the most promising market and one that is the most buoyant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental concerns center on the potential damage to a protected nature reserve on Barrow Island, the site of the proposed plant to process estimated gas reserves of 40 trillion cubic feet, around a quarter of Australia's known gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPA said the impact on flatback turtle nesting on the island, introduction of non-indigenous species to the island's ecosystem, and the potential damage inflicted by seabed dredging would need to be managed and closely monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency has made its recommendations to Western Australian Environment Minister Donna Faragher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=1.424 Australian Dollar)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Fayen Wong)&lt;/p&gt;

meet the EPA's environmental objectives if, and only if,
stringent conditions were applied to it," the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The recommendations are subject to a two-week public appeal
process, after which the state government will make a final
decision on whether to allow the project and on any conditions
to be imposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. oil major, partnered with Royal Dutch Shell Plc
(RDSa.L) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), wants to increase the
size of Gorgon to 15 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), after
having received state approval for a 10 mtpa project in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EPA approval clears one of the key regulatory hurdles and
paves the way for Chevron to make a final investment decision
on the project, which the Western Australian government has
estimated would cost about A$50 billion ($35 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in a separate statement that it was working
towards a final investment decision in the second half of this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview with Reuters, Chevron Australia's Gorgon
General Manager Colin Beckett said first LNG cargoes are
expected in 2014, confirming several years of speculation that
production would be far delayed from the original 2010-2011
target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beckett declined to forecast the project's cost, saying the
venture is in the process of seeking and assessing bids for
work contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're getting contractors to update their costs with 2009
prices. This is to make sure we'll get the best prices and take
advantage of lower construction costs in this downturn," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has for several years avoided committing to a final
investment target date for Gorgon, after saying in 2006 that it
was not likely that year. Chevron's most recent cost update for
Gorgon of A$11 billion was given five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which owns 50 percent of Gorgon, said it may
expand Gorgon to 25 mtpa in the future and that it was
continuing to talk to a range of potential LNG customers for
its share of uncontracted gas of about 3 mtpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked about potential regions Chevron was eyeing to
sell the Gorgon gas, Beckett said: "Asia is obviously the most
promising market and one that is the most buoyant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Environmental concerns centre on the potential damage to a
protected nature reserve on Barrow Island, the site of the
proposed plant to process estimated gas reserves of 40 trillion
cubic feet, around a quarter of Australia's known gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EPA said the impact on flatback turtle nesting on the
island, introduction of non-indigenous species to the island's
ecosystem, and the potential damage inflicted by seabed
dredging would need to be managed and closely monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency has made its recommendations to Western
Australian Environment Minister Donna Faragher.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - Millions of Indians began voting in the third round of a general election on Thursday in several states seen as key to the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's bid to win power from the Congress-led ruling coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Mumbai voting, blast in east India) By Shilpa Jamkhandikar MUMBAI, April 30 (Reuters) - Millions of Indians began voting in the third round of a general election on Thursday in several states seen as key to the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's bid to win power from the Congress-led ruling coalition. The financial hub Mumbai began voting just months after an attack by Islamist gunmen that killed 166 people and inflamed tensions with nuclear-armed Pakistan, a security issue the BJP has used to criticise the government for being soft on terrorism. The BJP appears to be trailing its main rival in a staggered, month-long election that could produce a weak coalition government as India grapples with the global economic slowdown and a spate of militant attacks in the past year. More than 144 million people were eligible to vote on Thursday in a round that covers BJP strongholds in western and central India, as well as the insurgency-hit Kashmir valley.  The BJP will hope to get a big haul in the western state of Gujarat where one of the party's biggest stars, the controversial chief minister Narendra Modi, has been touted as an exemplar of the party's campaign of development and good governance. Both main parties may need the support of regional players to form a government after the world's largest democratic exercise, in which 714 million people from a myriad of castes, religions and ethnicities can vote, ends on May 13. While India's main vote battle is between Congress and the BJP, a coalition of smaller parties known as the Third Front has an outside chance. That worries many investors who see the bloc as an unknown quantity if it comes to power. The BJP needs to fulfil its potential in stronghold states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka on Thursday to boost its chances of forging a winning coalition, said Swapan Dasgupta, a political analyst with links to the party. OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS All in all, it's a big day for the BJP. They're fighting in their strongholds or places where they feel they can make inroads, he said. The BJP scored a narrow victory over Congress in Gujarat, which counts for 26 out of 543 seats in the national parliament. Modi, tipped to eventually take over from the party's candidate for prime minister, the 81-year-old L.K. Advani, is seen as the driving force behind Gujarat's economic success story and appeals to the party's large Hindu vote bank nationwide. The BJP will hope to build on what the business-friendly Modi achieved at state level. But Modi's image -- and the BJP's -- may be tarnished as he is under investigation for allegedly turning a blind eye to some of India's worst religious riots, in which around 2,500 people, mainly Muslims, died in Gujarat in 2002. Advani is running in his constituency in Gujarat, which is among nine states voting on Thursday. Others include the populous states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal along with insurgency-hit Jammu and Kashmir.  A steady trickle of voters arrived as booths opened in the posh southern tip of Mumbai, many of whom incorporated the election into their morning jogging or walking routines. Dressed in sweats, billionaire Anil Ambani, chairman of India's Reliance Communications Ltd, voted just a few streets away from where militants struck some of the city's most famous landmarks on Nov. 26 last year In the affluent Cuffe Parade area, the attacks could drive historically unenthusiastic upper-class voters to join the queues, unlike millions living in the teeming slums who will likely vote for issues such as development.
