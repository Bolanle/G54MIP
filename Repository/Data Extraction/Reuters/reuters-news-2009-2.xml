&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - A common stimulant drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can cause brain changes in mice similar to those seen in cocaine addiction, U.S. researchers said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said healthy mice exposed to daily injections of the Novartis drug Ritalin, or methylphenidate, developed changes in the reward centers of their brains, and some of these changes resembled those in mice given cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Methylphenidate, which is thought to be a fairly innocuous compound, can have structural and biochemical effects in some regions of the brain that can be even greater than those of cocaine," Dr. Yong Kim of Rockefeller University in New York, whose study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, follows a number of studies in humans that have found the drugs to be safe when used to treat ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was prompted by reports suggesting that more than 7 million people in the United States have abused methylphenidate, using it to get high or to improve academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in a telephone interview that very little is known about the effects of these drugs when used to improve concentration in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What this study shows was in these animals exposure of two weeks to methylphenidate actually produced changes that are comparable to what is seen with chronic exposure to cocaine," Volkow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of children take stimulants such as Ritalin and Shire Plc's Adderall to treat ADHD, a condition marked by restlessness, impulsiveness, inattention and distractibility that can interfere with a child's ability to pay attention in school and maintain social relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volkow stressed that studies in adolescents show methylphenidate does not increase the risk for later addiction, and several have found adolescents with ADHD are far more likely to smoke or abuse drugs, and treatment with stimulants such as Ritalin can lower this risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you don't treat them as adolescents, actually you may be seeing more abuse of substances," Volkow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she said nonmedical use of methylphenidate and other stimulants may lead to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason there has been an increase in the abuse of stimulant medications has to do with the notion that they are less dangerous than illicit substances, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is wrong.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO Feb 2 (Reuters) - A common stimulant drug used to
treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can cause brain
changes in mice similar to those seen in cocaine addiction,
U.S. researchers said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; They said healthy mice exposed to daily injections of the
Novartis (NOVN.VX) drug Ritalin, or methylphenidate, developed
changes in the reward centers of their brains, and some of
these changes resembled those in mice given cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Methylphenidate, which is thought to be a fairly innocuous
compound, can have structural and biochemical effects in some
regions of the brain that can be even greater than those of
cocaine," Dr. Yong Kim of Rockefeller University in New York,
whose study was published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
follows a number of studies in humans that have found the drugs
to be safe when used to treat ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was prompted by reports suggesting that more than 7
million people in the United States have abused
methylphenidate, using it to get high or to improve academic
performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, said in a telephone interview that very little is known
about the effects of these drugs when used to improve
concentration in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What this study shows was in these animals exposure of two
weeks to methylphenidate actually produced changes that are
comparable to what is seen with chronic exposure to cocaine,"
Volkow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Millions of children take stimulants such as Ritalin and
Shire Plc's (SHP.L) Adderall to treat ADHD, a condition marked
by restlessness, impulsiveness, inattention and distractibility
that can interfere with a child's ability to pay attention in
school and maintain social relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volkow stressed that studies in adolescents show
methylphenidate does not increase the risk for later addiction,
and several have found adolescents with ADHD are far more
likely to smoke or abuse drugs, and treatment with stimulants
such as Ritalin can lower this risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you don't treat them as adolescents, actually you may
be seeing more abuse of substances," Volkow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she said nonmedical use of methylphenidate and other
stimulants may lead to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of the reason there has been an increase in the abuse
of stimulant medications has to do with the notion that they
are less dangerous than illicit substances, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is wrong. They can be as dangerous as illicit
substances when used inappropriately."

&lt;p&gt;Outstanding field of American-born Division One hockey players includes five
repeat nominees, three players from Northeastern and two from Boston University
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Gridiron Club of Greater Boston president Tim Whelan announced today that
sixteen NCAA Division One players are semi-finalists for thefifty-seventh Walter
Brown Award, presented annually to the best American-born college hockey player
in New England. 

The candidates include eleven players from Hockey East, four from the ECAC
Hockey League, and one from Atlantic Hockey. The slate comprises 12 forwards,
one goalie, and three defensemen. Northeastern University, which did not have a
semifinalist last year, boasts three in 2009 while Boston University has two.
Boston College senior forward Benn Ferriero, Providence senior defenseman Matt
Taormina, New Hampshire sophomore forward James van Riemsdyk, and Massachusetts
sophomore forward James Marcou, were all semifinalists for last year`s award,
which was won by New Hampshire goalie Kevin Regan. 

The only goaltender on the 2009 semifinalists` list is Brown University junior
Dan Rosen, who was a semifinalist as a freshman two years ago. Defensemen in
addition to Taormina are Boston University senior Matt Gilroy and Northeastern
senior Louis Liotti.

The remaining forwards from Hockey East schools are Northeastern seniors Ryan
Ginand and Joe Vitale; BU senior Chris Higgins; UMass-Lowell junior Kory Falite;
and Vermont senior Peter Lenes. 

ECAC Hockey League forwards are Yale junior Sean Backman; Dartmouth sophomore
Adam Estoclet; and Quinnipiac senior David Marshall. 

The lone nominee from Atlantic Hockey and the first ever from Bentley College is
senior forward Dain Prewitt. 

"This has been an interesting season in Eastern hockey, with more teams in
contention for the respective league titles and home ice playoff berths than
we`ve seen in previous years," said Gridiron Club Hockey Awards Committee
chairman Tim Costello. 

"That has made drawing up a list of leading candidates for this year`s Walter
Brown Award even more difficult than usual. Not everyone who received serious
consideration could make the cut. We look forward to tracking the semifinalists
closely through the stretch run." 

The Gridiron Club will announce the winner of the 57th Walter Brown Award in
March, following league playoffs and before the start of NCAA Tournament play.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 2 (Reuters) - Scientific Games Corp's (SGMS.O) renewed
focus on existing investments rather than expansion could help
it stage a turnaround after missing analysts' estimates in
eight of the past 12 quarters, said Goldman Sachs, which
upgraded the lottery operator to "buy" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company rose to a high of $13.91, before
paring some gains to trade up $1.27 at $13.84 Monday morning on
Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has hired a new chief executive, Joe Wright, to
lead the transition to a cash flow, return-driven company from
one that was more focused on expansion, analysts Betsy Gorton
and Steven Kent said in a research note dated Jan. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Recent meetings with him highlight that his primary focus
is reducing costs and cutting capex," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the company's retail lottery sales might be under
pressure in the near term on economic woes, the brokerage
expects the segment to fare better than the other consumer
discretionary sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs also expects the New York-based company's
retail lottery segment to benefit further from its Chinese
operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also downgraded hotel operator Wyndham
Worldwide (WYN.N) and casino operator Pinnacle Entertainment
(PNK.N) to "neutral" from "buy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Wyndham were down almost 6 percent at $5.79
Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. Pinnacle shares
were down 2 percent at $6.64.

&lt;p&gt;  BANGALORE, INDIA, Feb 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it is deploying three
energy-efficient and green Scalable Modular Data Centers (SMDCs) in a
US$3.1 million IT infrastructure services agreement with Religare
Enterprises Limited (REL), which is one of the leading integrated
financial services groups of India.

    IBM is designing, building and will be maintaining highly scalable,
modular and energy-efficient green data centers in Delhi, Noida and
Mumbai for REL. In addition, IBM will put in place the networking
infrastructure and a disaster recovery solution for the company. The
solution implemented by IBM will help REL reduce annual power costs by
30-35% and enable them to effectively meet technology requirements of the
company's expanding business.

    REL is a key financial services provider and a major player in the Indian
equity and securities market. To increase its market share while handling
the increasing volumes of trading, the company needed to put in place a
highly scalable yet resilient data center infrastructure. At the same
time, REL needed to ensure high operational cost-efficiency, given that
power consumption is a major factor in any company's operational cost.
IBM's SMDC design, which leverages high density computing and precision
air-conditioning, ensures a saving of more than 3600 units (KWH) per day
in power consumption alone as compared to an 8,000 sq ft conventional data
center. In a year, this represents a saving of nearly US$250,000 (nearly
Rs one crore).

    "Religare is a financial services powerhouse and we have ambitious growth
plans. We are confident that our partnership with IBM will provide us with
a distinct competitive edge in the market," said Shachindra Nath, Group
Chief Operating Officer, Religare Enterprises Limited.

    "IBM engaged with us from the very beginning to understand our critical
business needs and design appropriate solutions. IBM's unmatched expertise
to design and build a globally benchmarked, standardized, scalable and
energy-efficient facility will certainly support our dynamic growth plans
effectively."

    Nipun Mehrotra, Vice President &amp; General Manager, Global Technology
Services, IBM India/S Asia, said, "In these economically difficult times,
companies across the board want solutions that can help them achieve
greater operational efficiency and save costs. Religare's choice of IBM as
its preferred IT infrastructure services partner re-affirms our undisputed
leadership in the green data center space and commitment to help clients
'Do more with Less.' IBM's consultative approach helped Religare with the
process of design finalization &amp; product selection, and ensured the final
solution was miles ahead of those offered by the other large competitors
in India."

    To bring greater value to its customers, REL has been relying on
best-in-class technology solutions. The partnership with IBM will help REL
further strengthen its position as one of the leading integrated financial
services groups of India. The data center solution deployed by IBM would
support all of REL's current applications as well many others that are
scheduled for future roll-out.

    IBM continues to command a strong leadership in the data center space and
has built over 300,000 sq ft raised floor of data center space in the
country. The company has already deployed green data centers for over a
dozen clients in the country.

REX W. TILLERSON, VORSTANDSVORSITZENDER VON EXXONMOBIL, ERKL&#196;RTE: 

&#8222;ExxonMobils Ertr&#228;ge f&#252;r das Gesamtjahr 2008 beliefen sich ohne Sonderposten auf
eine Rekordsumme von USD 44.060 Millionen, das ist ein Plus von 8 % gegen&#252;ber
2007.Der Gewinn pro Aktie ohne Sonderposten stieg um 16 %, was den Einfluss des
Aktienbezugsplans widerspiegelt.Der Nettogewinn von USD 45.220 Millionen im Jahr
2008 war ebenfalls ein Rekordhoch, ein Plus von 11 % gegen&#252;ber 2007.Der
Nettogewinn umfasste einen au&#223;erordentlichen Gewinn von USD 1.620 Millionen nach
Steuern aus dem Verkauf eines Erdgastransportunternehmens in Deutschland und
Sonderkosten nach Steuer von USD 460 Millionen im Zusammenhang mit dem
Valdez-Prozess.

&#8222;Die Finanzst&#228;rke von ExxonMobil erm&#246;glichte weiterhin das disziplinierte
Herangehen an Kapitalanlagen inmitten der wachsenden weltweiten wirtschaftlichen
Verlangsamung.Die Ausgaben f&#252;r Kapital- und Explorationsprojekte stieg 2008 um
USD 26,1 Milliarden, was einem Plus von 25 % gegen&#252;ber 2007 entspricht.Durch
diese Investitionen konnten wir weiterhin unseren langfristigen Fokus auf den
gesamten Konjunkturzyklus unter Beweis stellen.

Das Unternehmen sch&#252;ttete 2008 eine Gesamtsumme von USD 40,1 Milliarden an die
Aktion&#228;re aus, ein Plus von 12 % bzw. USD 4,4 Milliarden gegen&#252;ber 2007.Dies
bedeutet eine Erh&#246;hung der Dividenden pro Aktie um 13 % gegen&#252;ber 2007 und eine
allgemeine Reduzierung der im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien um 7,5 %.

ExxonMobils Ertr&#228;ge im vierten Quartal beliefen sich ohne Sonderposten auf USD
7.820 Millionen, was einem R&#252;ckgang um 33 % gegen&#252;ber dem vierten Quartal 2007
entspricht.Schw&#228;chere Roh&#246;lpreise, h&#246;here Betriebsaufwendungen, geringere
Chemikalienmengen und die Auswirkungen der Hurrikans an der Golfk&#252;ste wurden
teilweise durch h&#246;here Downstream-Margen ausgeglichen."

HIGHLIGHTS DES VIERTEN QUARTALS

* Der Nettogewinn betrug USD 7.820 Millionen, was einem R&#252;ckgang um 33 % bzw.
USD 3.840 Millionen gegen&#252;ber dem vierten Quartal 2007 entspricht. Die Ertr&#228;ge
waren aufgrund von Schadensbeseitigungen und geringerer Volumen im Zusammenhang
mit den Hurrikanen Gustav und Ike um USD 570 Millionen geringer. 
* Der Gewinn pro Aktie betrug USD 1,55. Dies ist ein R&#252;ckgang um 27 %. 
* Die Kapital- und Explorationsaufwendungen lagen bei USD 6,8 Milliarden, was
einer Erh&#246;hung um 11 % gegen&#252;ber dem vierten Quartal 2007 entspricht. 
* In &#214;leinheiten gemessen sank die Produktion um 3 % gegen&#252;ber dem vierten
Quartal 2007. Die Belastungen durch geringere F&#246;rderquoten, die Auswirkungen der
OPEC-Quoten und Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen nicht eingerechnet, ging die Produktion um etwa 1
% zur&#252;ck. 
* Aktienk&#228;ufe in H&#246;he von USD 8,0 Milliarden reduzierten die Menge der im Umlauf
befindlichen Aktien um 2,2 %. 
* Der Cashflow aus Gesch&#228;ftst&#228;tigkeiten und dem Verkauf von Aktivposten lag bei
etwa USD 12,2 Milliarden, was den Verkauf von Aktivposten in H&#246;he von USD 1,8
Milliarden beinhaltete. 
* ExxonMobil nahm die Offshore-Anlagen f&#252;r das Qatargas-II-Train-4-LNG-Projekt
in Katar in Betrieb. Die Inbetriebnahmeaktivit&#228;ten Onshore gehen weiter und das
erste Fl&#252;ssigerdgas (LNG) aus dem Projekt wird f&#252;r das erste Quartal 2009
erwartet. 
* Die Inbetriebnahme von ExxonMobils South Hook LNG Terminal in Gro&#223;britannien
schritt im vierten Quartal fort, sodass eine erste LNG-F&#246;rderung und
-Verarbeitung f&#252;r das erste Quartal zu erwarten ist. 
* ExxonMobil hat angek&#252;ndigt, mehr als eine Milliarde US-Dollar in die drei
Raffinerien in den USA und in Europa zu investieren, um die Versorgung mit
sauberer verbrennendem Diesel um etwa sechs Millionen Gallonen (22,7 Millionen
Liter) pro Tag zu erh&#246;hen. Die erh&#246;hte Dieselproduktion an diesen drei
Standorten wird der Dieselproduktion von etwa vier durchschnittlich gro&#223;en
Raffinerien entsprechen und unterstreicht das anhaltende Engagement des
Unternehmens, dem wachsenden Bedarf am Markt nachzukommen und den Konsumenten
gleichzeitig sauberer verbrennende Kraftstoffe zu liefern.

Das vierte Quartal 2008 im Vergleich zum vierten Quartal 2007

Der Gewinn im Bereich Upstream betrug USD 5.634 Millionen, was einem R&#252;ckgang um
USD 2.570 Millionen gegen&#252;ber dem vierten Quartal 2007 entspricht. Geringere
Roh&#246;lumsetzungen reduzierten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa USD 3,2 Milliarden, w&#228;hrend
h&#246;here Erdgaspreise die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa USD 500 Millionen anwachsen lie&#223;en. 

Gemessen in &#214;leinheiten sank die Produktion um 3 % gegen&#252;ber dem vierten Quartal
2007. Die Belastungen geringerer F&#246;rderquoten sowie die Auswirkungen der
OPEC-Quoten und Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen nicht eingerechnet, ging die Produktion um etwa 1
% zur&#252;ck. 

Die Liquid-Produktion belief sich auf insgesamt 2.472 kbd (Tausend Barrel pro
Tag), was einem R&#252;ckgang um 45 kbd gegen&#252;ber dem vierten Quartal 2007
entspricht. Die Belastungen durch geringere F&#246;rderquoten sowie die Auswirkungen
der OPEC-Quoten und Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen nicht eingerechnet, stieg die
Liquid-Produktion um etwa 1 %, da die erh&#246;hte Produktion der Projekte in
Westafrika und in der Nordsee sowie geringere Wartungsarbeiten den R&#252;ckgang auf
den Feldern mehr als ausglichen. 

Die Erdgasproduktion im vierten Quartal lag bei 9.849 mcfd (Millionen Kubikfu&#223;
pro Tag), was einem Minus von 565 mcfd gegen&#252;ber 2007 entspricht. Neue
Produktionsvolumina aus Projekterweiterungen in der Nordsee, in Katar und in
Malaysia wurden durch den R&#252;ckgang auf den Feldern und die geringere Nachfrage
in Europa mehr als aufgewogen. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge aus Upstream-Arbeiten in den USA betrugen USD 699 Millionen und
lagen damit USD 576 Millionen unter denen des vierten Quartals 2007. Die
Upstream-Ertr&#228;ge au&#223;erhalb der USA betrugen USD 4.935 Millionen, was einem
R&#252;ckgang um USD 1.994 Millionen gegen&#252;ber dem letzten Jahr entspricht. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge im Bereich Downstream von USD 2.414 Millionen entsprechen einem
Anstieg um USD 147 Millionen gegen&#252;ber dem vierten Quartal 2007. Gr&#246;&#223;ere Margen
erh&#246;hten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa USD 900 Millionen. Ung&#252;nstige Wechselkurse,
Volumen- und Mix-Effekte sowie h&#246;here Betriebsaufwendungen, einschlie&#223;lich der
Reparaturkosten nach den Hurrikanen, minderten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa USD 800
Millionen. Die Ums&#228;tze mit Erd&#246;lerzeugnissen von 6.761 kbd waren 364 kbd
niedriger als im vierten Quartal des letzten Jahres, was haupts&#228;chlich auf den
Verkauf von Aktivposten und geringere Nachfrage zur&#252;ckgeht. 

Der Downstream-Bereich in den USA verzeichnete Verluste in H&#246;he von USD 20
Millionen, was einem Minus von USD 642 Millionen gegen&#252;ber dem vierten Quartal
2007 entspricht. Die Downstream-Ertr&#228;ge au&#223;erhalb der USA von USD 2.434
Millionen waren USD 789 Millionen h&#246;her als im letzten Jahr. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge im Chemie-Bereich von USD 155 Millionen waren USD 957 Millionen
niedriger als im vierten Quartal 2007. Geringere Volumina reduzierten die
Ertr&#228;ge um etwa USD 350 Millionen, w&#228;hrend geringere Margen die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa
USD 300 Millionen schrumpfen lie&#223;en. Die Reparaturkosten nach den Hurrikans und
ung&#252;nstige Wechselkurse trugen weiterhin zum R&#252;ckgang der Ertr&#228;ge bei. Der
Verkauf der Premium-Produkte im vierten Quartal von 5.626 kt (Kilotonnen) lag
aufgrund der geringeren Nachfrage und der Hurrikan-Auswirkungen 1.423 kt unter
jenem des Vorjahres. 

Die Konzern- und Finanzierungsaufwendungen von USD 383 Millionen erh&#246;hten sich
aufgrund h&#246;herer Nettosteuern und geringerer Zinsertr&#228;ge um USD 460 Millionen. 

W&#228;hrend des vierten Quartals 2008 erwarb die Exxon Mobil Corporation 119
Millionen ihrer Stammaktien f&#252;r den Eigenbestand zu einem Bruttogesamtpreis von
USD 8,8 Milliarden. Diese K&#228;ufe beinhalteten USD 8,0 Milliarden zur Reduzierung
der Zahl der im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien, wobei die Differenz dazu zum
Ausgleich von Aktien verwendet wurde, die im Zusammenhang mit den
Unternehmungsleistungspl&#228;nen und -programmen ausgegeben wurden. Die Zahl der im
Umlauf befindlichen Aktien wurde von 5.087 Millionen am Ende des dritten
Quartals auf 4.976 Millionen am Ende des vierten Quartals reduziert. Gegenw&#228;rtig
wird erwartet, dass die Aktienk&#228;ufe zur Reduzierung der Zahl der im Umlauf
befindlichen Aktien bis zum Ende des ersten Quartals 2009 bei einem Gegenwert
von USD 7,0 Milliarden liegen werden. Die K&#228;ufe k&#246;nnen sowohl auf dem freien
Markt als auch durch ausgehandelte Transaktionen erfolgen und k&#246;nnen jederzeit
ohne Ank&#252;ndigung erh&#246;ht, gemindert oder im Wert herabgesetzt werden. 

Das Gesamtjahr 2008 im Vergleich zum Gesamtjahr 2007

Der Nettogewinn von USD 45.220 Millionen (USD 8,69 pro Aktie) war ein Rekordhoch
und entsprach einem Plus von USD 4.610 gegen&#252;ber 2007. Der Nettogewinn im Jahr
2008 umfasste einen au&#223;erordentlichen Gewinn von USD 1.620 Millionen nach
Steuern aus dem Verkauf eines Erdgastransportunternehmens in Deutschland und
Sonderkosten nach Steuer von USD 460 Millionen im Zusammenhang mit dem
Valdez-Prozess. Ohne diese Einwirkungen stiegen die Ertr&#228;ge 2008 um USD 3.450
Millionen. 

HIGHLIGHTS DES GESAMTJAHRES

* Die Ertr&#228;ge ohne Sonderposten beliefen sich auf eine Rekordsumme von USD
44.060 Millionen, das ist ein Plus von 8 %. 
* Der Gewinn pro Aktie ohne Sonderposten stieg um 16 % auf USD 8,47 und
spiegelte so die starken Gesch&#228;ftsergebnisse und die fortschreitende Reduzierung
der Zahl der im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien wider. 
* Der Nettogewinn stieg um 11 % gegen&#252;ber 2007. Der Nettogewinn im Jahr 2008
umfasste einen au&#223;erordentlichen Gewinn von USD 1.620 Millionen nach Steuern aus
dem Verkauf eines Erdgastransportunternehmens in Deutschland und Sonderkosten
nach Steuer von USD 460 Millionen im Zusammenhang mit dem Valdez-Prozess. Der
Nettogewinn des Jahres 2007 enthielt keine Sonderposten. 
* Der effektive Einkommensteuersatz stieg von 44 % im Jahr 2007 auf 47 %. 
* In &#214;leinheiten gemessen sank die Produktion um 6 % gegen&#252;ber 2007. Unter
Ausschluss der Auswirkungen durch geringere F&#246;rderquoten sowie der Enteignung
und den Entziehungen in Venezuela, ging die Produktion um etwa 3 % zur&#252;ck. 
* Der Cashflow aus Gesch&#228;ftst&#228;tigkeiten und dem Verkauf von Aktivposten lag bei
etwa USD 65,6 Milliarden, was den Verkauf von Aktivposten in H&#246;he von USD 6,0
Milliarden beinhaltete. 
* Das Unternehmen sch&#252;ttete 2008 eine Gesamtsumme von USD 40,1 Milliarden an die
Aktion&#228;re aus, ein Plus von 12 % bzw. USD 4,4 Milliarden gegen&#252;ber 2007. Dies
bedeutet eine Erh&#246;hung der Dividenden pro Aktie um 13 % gegen&#252;ber 2007 und eine
allgemeine Reduzierung der im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien um 7,5 %. 
* Die Dividende pro Aktie von USD 1,55 stieg um 13 %. 
* Die Kapital- und Explorationsaufwendungen lagen bei USD 26,1 Milliarden, was
einer Erh&#246;hung um 25 % gegen&#252;ber dem Jahr 2007 entspricht.

Die Ertr&#228;ge aus dem Upstream-Bereich ohne Einrechnung des Gewinns im
Zusammenhang mit dem Verkauf des deutschen Erdgastransportunternehmens lagen bei
einer Rekordsumme von USD 33.782 Millionen, was einem Plus von USD 7.285
Millionen gegen&#252;ber 2007 entspricht. Roh&#246;l- und Erdgasumsetzungen in Rekordh&#246;he
steigerten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa USD 11,8 Milliarden. Geringere Umsatzvolumina
minderten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa USD 3,7 Milliarden. H&#246;here Steuern und gestiegene
Betriebskosten minderten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa USD 1,5 Milliarden, was teilweise
durch g&#252;nstige Wechselkurse ausgeglichen wurde. 

Gemessen in &#214;leinheiten sank die Produktion um 6 % gegen&#252;ber dem letzten Jahr.
Unter Ausschluss der Auswirkungen durch geringere F&#246;rderquoten sowie der
Enteignung und der Entziehungen in Venezuela, ging die Produktion um etwa 3 %
zur&#252;ck. 

Die Liquid-Produktion von 2.405 kbd sank gegen&#252;ber 2007 um 211 kbd. Unter
Ausschluss der Auswirkungen durch geringere F&#246;rderquoten sowie der Enteignung
und der Entziehungen in Venezuela, ging die Liquid-Produktion um etwa 3 %
zur&#252;ck, wobei neue Volumina durch Projekterweiterungen, haupts&#228;chlich in Afrika,
durch den R&#252;ckgang auf den Feldern mehr als aufgewogen wurden. 

Die Erdgasproduktion von 9.095 mcfd sank gegen&#252;ber 2007 um 289 mcfd. H&#246;here
Volumina aus Projekten in der Nordsee, in Malaysia und in Katar sowie eine
st&#228;rkere Nachfrage in Europa wurden durch den R&#252;ckgang auf den Feldern mehr als
aufgewogen. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge aus Upstream-Arbeiten in den USA betrugen im Jahr 2008 USD 6.243
Millionen, was einem Anstieg von USD 1.373 Millionen entspricht. Die Ertr&#228;ge
au&#223;erhalb der USA ohne Einrechnung des Gewinns im Zusammenhang mit dem Verkauf
des deutschen Erdgastransportunternehmens betrugen USD 27.539 Millionen, waren
also um USD 5.912 Millionen h&#246;her als im Jahr 2007. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge im Downstream-Bereich von USD 8,151 Millionen waren um USD 1,422
Millionen niedriger als im Jahr 2007. Kleinere Margen reduzierten die Ertr&#228;ge um
etwa USD 900 Millionen, wobei kleinere Raffinerie-Margen durch gr&#246;&#223;ere
Marketingmargen mehr als aufgewogen wurden. H&#246;here Betriebskosten, die prim&#228;r im
Zusammenhang mit geplanten Arbeiten standen, minderten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa USD
700 Millionen, w&#228;hrend die Einfl&#252;sse ung&#252;nstiger Wechselkurse die Ertr&#228;ge um
etwa USD 600 Millionen minderten. Verbesserte Raffinerie-Abl&#228;ufe brachten einen
partiellen Ausgleich und erh&#246;hten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa USD 800 Millionen. Die
Ums&#228;tze mit Erd&#246;lerzeugnissen von 6.761 kbd sanken von 7,099 kbd im Jahr 2007,
was haupts&#228;chlich auf den Verkauf von Aktivposten und geringere Nachfrage
zur&#252;ckgeht. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge im Downstream-Bereich in den USA betrugen USD 1,649 Millionen und
waren damit um USD 2,471 Millionen niedriger. Die Downstream-Ertr&#228;ge au&#223;erhalb
der USA betrugen USD 6.502 Millionen und waren damit um USD 1,049 Millionen
h&#246;her als im letzten Jahr. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge im Chemie-Bereich von USD 2,957 Millionen waren um USD 1,606
Millionen niedriger als im vierten Quartal 2007. Kleinere Margen reduzierten die
Ertr&#228;ge um etwa USD 1,2 Milliarden, w&#228;hrend kleinere Volumina die Ertr&#228;ge um
etwa USD 500 Millionen schrumpfen lie&#223;en. Die Verk&#228;ufe der Premium-Produkte von
24.982 kt sanken gegen&#252;ber 2007 um 2.498 kt. 

Die Konzern- und Finanzierungsaufwendungen von USD 830 Millionen ohne
Einrechnung der Kosten im Zusammenhang mit dem Valdez-Prozess erh&#246;hten sich
prim&#228;r aufgrund h&#246;herer Nettosteuern und geringerer Zinsertr&#228;ge um USD 807
Millionen. 

Im Jahr 2008 erwarb die Exxon Mobil Corporation 434 Millionen ihrer Stammaktien
f&#252;r den Eigenbestand zu einem Bruttogesamtpreis von USD 35,7 Milliarden. Diese
K&#228;ufe beinhalteten USD 32,0 Milliarden zur Reduzierung der Zahl der im Umlauf
befindlichen Aktien, wobei die Differenz dazu zum Ausgleich von Aktien verwendet
wurde, die im Zusammenhang mit den Unternehmungsleistungspl&#228;nen und -programmen
ausgegeben wurden. Die Zahl der im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien wurde von 5.382
Millionen am Ende des Jahres 2007 auf 4.976 Millionen am Ende des Jahres 2008
reduziert, was einer Reduzierung von 7,5 % entspricht.

COMMENTAIRES DU PR&#201;SIDENT DU CONSEIL D`ADMINISTRATION D`EXXONMOBIL, REX W.
TILLERSON: 

&#171; Les b&#233;n&#233;fices d`ExxonMobil pour l`exercice 2008, hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels,
ont atteint la somme record de 44 060 millions de dollars, soit une progression
de 8 % par rapport &#224; 2007.Le b&#233;n&#233;fice par action hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels a
progress&#233; de 16 %, refl&#233;tant l`avantage du programme de rachat d`actions.Le
r&#233;sultat net de 45 220 millions de dollars en 2008 a &#233;galement atteint un
record, en progression de 11 % par rapport &#224; 2007.Le r&#233;sultat net a compris des
gains exceptionnels apr&#232;s imp&#244;ts de 1 620 millions de dollars d&#233;coulant de la
vente d`une entreprise de transport de gaz naturel en Allemagne et des charges
exceptionnelles apr&#232;s imp&#244;ts de 460 millions de dollars associ&#233;es au proc&#232;s
Exxon Valdez. &#187;

&#171; La solidit&#233; financi&#232;re d`ExxonMobil a continu&#233; &#224; soutenir sa d&#233;marche
disciplin&#233;e en mati&#232;re d`investissement financier alors que le ralentissement
mondial de l`&#233;conomie s`&#233;tend.Les d&#233;penses en projets d`investissement et les
d&#233;penses d`exploration sont pass&#233;es &#224; 26,1 milliards de dollars en 2008, soit
une progression de 25 % par rapport &#224; 2007.Gr&#226;ce &#224; ces investissements nous
avons pu continuer &#224; d&#233;montrer notre focalisation &#224; long terme sur l`ensemble du
cycle &#233;conomique. &#187;

&#171; L`entreprise a distribu&#233; un total de 40,1 milliards de dollars aux
actionnaires en 2008, soit une progression de 12 % ou de 4,4 milliards de
dollars par rapport &#224; 2007.Ceci refl&#232;te une augmentation de 13 % des dividendes
par action par rapport &#224; 2007 et une diminution globale du nombre d`actions en
circulation de 7,5 %. &#187;

&#171; Les b&#233;n&#233;fices d`ExxonMobil hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels pour le quatri&#232;me
trimestre ont atteint 7 820 millions de dollars, soit une baisse de 33 % par
rapport au quatri&#232;me trimestre 2007.Les prix plus faibles du p&#233;trole brut, des
charges d`exploitation plus &#233;lev&#233;es, des volumes plus bas de produits chimiques
et l`impact des ouragans sur la c&#244;te du golfe du Mexique ont partiellement &#233;t&#233;
compens&#233;s par des marges plus &#233;lev&#233;es des op&#233;rations en aval. &#187;

FAITS MARQUANTS DU QUATRI&#200;ME TRIMESTRE

* Le r&#233;sultat net a atteint 7 820 millions de dollars, soit une baisse de 33 %
ou de 3 840 millions de dollars par rapport au quatri&#232;me trimestre 2007. Les
b&#233;n&#233;fices ont diminu&#233; de 570 millions de dollars en raison de la r&#233;paration des
d&#233;g&#226;ts et de volumes plus bas associ&#233;s aux ouragans Gustav et Ike. 
* Le b&#233;n&#233;fice par action est ressorti &#224; 1,55 dollar, soit une diminution de 27
%. 
* Les d&#233;penses en investissement et les d&#233;penses d`exploration se sont &#233;lev&#233;es &#224;
6,8 milliards de dollars, soit une progression de 11 % par rapport au quatri&#232;me
trimestre 2007. 
* La production sur une base d`&#233;quivalent-p&#233;trole a diminu&#233; de 3 % par rapport
au quatri&#232;me trimestre 2007. Hors l`impact des volumes admissibles plus faibles,
des effets des quotas de l`OPEP et des d&#233;sinvestissements, la production a
diminu&#233; d`&#224; peu pr&#232;s 1 %. 
* Les achats d`action de 8 milliards de dollars ont r&#233;duit le nombre d`actions
en circulation de 2,2 %. 
* Le flux de tr&#233;sorerie issu de l`exploitation et des cessions d`actifs a &#233;t&#233;
d`environ 12,2 milliards de dollars, dont 1,8 milliard de dollars en cessions
d`actifs. 
* ExxonMobil a mis en route les installations offshore pour le projet de GNL
Qatargas II Train 4 au Qatar. Des activit&#233;s de mise en service se poursuivent &#224;
terre et le premier GNL issu du projet est pr&#233;vu au cours du premier trimestre
2009. 
* La mise en service du terminal GNL de South Hook d`ExxonMobil au Royaume-Uni a

* ExxonMobil a annonc&#233; que la soci&#233;t&#233; allait investir plus d`un milliard de
dollars dans trois raffineries aux &#201;tats-Unis et en Europe pour accro&#238;tre
l`approvisionnement en diesel br&#251;lant avec moins d`&#233;missions de plus de
vingt-deux millions de litres par jour. L`augmentation de notre production de
diesel sur ces trois sites &#233;quivaudra au diesel produit dans environ quatre
raffineries de taille moyenne et souligne la volont&#233; de la soci&#233;t&#233; de r&#233;pondre
aux besoins croissants du march&#233;, tout en fournissant en m&#234;me temps des
combustibles plus propres aux consommateurs.

Quatri&#232;me trimestre 2008 par rapport au quatri&#232;me trimestre 2007

Les b&#233;n&#233;fices en amont ont atteint 5 634 millions de dollars, soit une
diminution de 2 570 millions de dollars par rapport au quatri&#232;me trimestre 2007.
Des r&#233;alisations plus faibles en p&#233;trole brut ont fait baisser les b&#233;n&#233;fices
d`environ 3,2 milliards de dollars tandis que les prix plus &#233;lev&#233;s du gaz
naturel les ont fait augmenter d`environ 500 millions de dollars. 

Sur une base d`&#233;quivalent-p&#233;trole, la production a diminu&#233; de 3 % par rapport au
quatri&#232;me trimestre 2007. Hors l`impact des volumes admissibles plus faibles,
des effets des quotas de l`OPEP et des d&#233;sinvestissements, la production a
diminu&#233; d`&#224; peu pr&#232;s 1 %. 

La production de liquides a atteint 2 472 kbj (milliers de barils par jour),
soit une diminution de 45 kbj par rapport au quatri&#232;me trimestre 2007. Hors
l`impact des volumes admissibles plus bas, des effets des quotas de l`OPEP et
des d&#233;sinvestissements, la production de liquides a augment&#233; de 1 %, la
production plus &#233;lev&#233;e des projets en Afrique occidentale et en mer du Nord et
des activit&#233;s d`entretien moins importantes ayant largement compens&#233; le d&#233;clin
des champs. 

La production de gaz naturel au quatri&#232;me trimestre s`est &#233;lev&#233;e &#224; 9 849 mpcj
(millions de pieds cubes par jour), soit une diminution de 565 mpcj par rapport
&#224; 2007. Des nouveaux volumes de production dus &#224; l`ajout de projets en mer du
Nord, au Qatar et en Malaisie ont &#233;t&#233; largement contrebalanc&#233;s par le d&#233;clin des
champs et une demande europ&#233;enne moins importante. 

Les b&#233;n&#233;fices issus des op&#233;rations en amont aux &#201;tats-Unis ont atteint 699
millions de dollars, 576 millions de dollars de moins qu`au quatri&#232;me trimestre
2007. Les b&#233;n&#233;fices en amont en dehors des &#201;tats-Unis ont atteint 4 935 millions
de dollars, soit une diminution de 1 994 millions de dollars par rapport &#224;
l`ann&#233;e derni&#232;re. 

Les b&#233;n&#233;fices en aval de 2 414 millions de dollars ont progress&#233; de 147 millions
de dollars par rapport au quatri&#232;me trimestre 2007. Des marges plus &#233;lev&#233;es ont
fait progresser les b&#233;n&#233;fices d`environ 900 millions de dollars. Un taux de
change d&#233;favorable, les effets des volumes et de la composition et des charges
d`exploitation plus &#233;lev&#233;es, notamment les co&#251;ts des r&#233;parations associ&#233;es aux
ouragans, ont fait diminuer les b&#233;n&#233;fices d`environ 800 millions de dollars. Les
ventes de produits p&#233;troliers de 6 761 kbj ont diminu&#233; de 364 kbj par rapport au
quatri&#232;me trimestre de l`ann&#233;e pr&#233;c&#233;dente, refl&#233;tant essentiellement des
cessions d`actifs et une demande moins importante. 

Les op&#233;rations en aval aux &#201;tats-Unis ont enregistr&#233; une perte de 20 millions de
dollars, soit une diminution de 642 millions de dollars par rapport au quatri&#232;me
trimestre 2007. Les b&#233;n&#233;fices en aval en dehors des &#201;tats-Unis de 2 434 millions
de dollars ont progress&#233; de 789 millions de dollars par rapport &#224; l`ann&#233;e
pr&#233;c&#233;dente. 

Les b&#233;n&#233;fices des produits chimiques de 155 millions de dollars ont diminu&#233; de
957 millions de dollars par rapport au quatri&#232;me trimestre 2007. Des volumes
plus bas ont fait diminuer les b&#233;n&#233;fices d`environ 350 millions de dollars,
alors que des marges moins &#233;lev&#233;es les ont fait diminuer de 300 millions de
dollars environ. Les co&#251;ts des r&#233;parations li&#233;es aux ouragans et les effets d`un
taux de change d&#233;favorable ont &#233;galement fait diminuer les b&#233;n&#233;fices. Les ventes
de produits de base de 5 626 kt (milliers de tonnes m&#233;triques) au quatri&#232;me
trimestre ont diminu&#233; de 1 423 kt par rapport &#224; l`ann&#233;e pr&#233;c&#233;dente du fait d`une
demande moins importante et des effets des ouragans. 

Les charges d`entreprise et les charges de financement de 383 millions de
dollars ont progress&#233; de 460 millions de dollars du fait d`imp&#244;ts nets plus
&#233;lev&#233;s et d`int&#233;r&#234;ts cr&#233;diteurs plus faibles. 

Au cours du quatri&#232;me trimestre 2008, Exxon Mobil Corporation a achet&#233; 119
millions de ses actions ordinaires pour la tr&#233;sorerie &#224; un co&#251;t brut de 8,8
milliards de dollars. Ces achats incluaient 8 milliards de dollars afin de
r&#233;duire le nombre d`actions en circulation, le solde ayant &#233;t&#233; utilis&#233; pour
compenser les actions &#233;mises en rapport aux plans et aux programmes de
prestations de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Les actions en circulation ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;duites de 5 087
millions &#224; la fin du troisi&#232;me trimestre &#224; 4 976 millions &#224; la fin du quatri&#232;me
trimestre. On estime actuellement que les achats d`actions afin de r&#233;duire le
nombre d`actions en circulation atteindront in total de 7 milliards de dollars &#224;
la fin du premier trimestre 2009. Les achats peuvent &#234;tre faits sur le march&#233;
libre et par transactions n&#233;goci&#233;es et peuvent &#234;tre augment&#233;s, diminu&#233;s ou
interrompus &#224; tout moment sans pr&#233;avis.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Feb 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today results from its annual 2008 X-Force
Trend and Risk report, which found that corporations are unwittingly
putting their own customers at risk for cybercriminal activity. With an
alarming increase in attacks using legitimate business sites as launching
pads for attacks against consumers, cybercriminals are literally turning
businesses against their own customers in the ongoing effort to steal
consumers' personal data.

    The new X-Force report identifies two main trends from 2008 that show how
criminals are targeting the masses through Web site attacks:

    First, Web sites have become the Achilles' heel for corporate IT security.
Attackers are intensely focused on attacking Web applications so they can
infect end-user machines. Meanwhile, corporations are using off-the-shelf
applications that are riddled with vulnerabilities or even worse, custom
applications that can host numerous unknown vulnerabilities that can't be
patched. Last year more than half of all vulnerabilities disclosed were
related to Web applications, and of these, more than 74 percent had no
patch. Thus, the large scale, automated SQL injection vulnerabilities that
emerged in early 2008 have continued unabated. By the end of 2008, the
volume of attacks jumped to 30 times the number of attacks initially seen
this summer.

    "The purpose of these automated attacks is to deceive and redirect Web
surfers to Web browser exploit toolkits," said Kris Lamb, senior
operations manager, X-Force Research and Development for IBM Internet
Security Systems. "This is one of the oldest forms of mass attack still
in existence today. It is staggering that we still see SQL injection
attacks in widespread use without adequate patching almost 10 years after
they were first disclosed. Cybercriminals target businesses because they
provide an easy target to launch attacks against anyone that visits the
Web."

    The second major trend IBM X-Force revealed is that although attackers
continue to focus on the browser and ActiveX controls as a way to
compromise end-user machines, they are turning their focus to incorporate
new types of exploits that link to malicious movies (for example, Flash)
and documents (for example, PDFs). In the fourth quarter of 2008 alone,
IBM X-Force traced more than a 50 percent increase in the number of
malicious URLs hosting exploits than were found in all of 2007. Even
spammers are turning to known Web sites for expanded reach. The technique
of hosting Spam messages on popular blogs and news-related websites more
than doubled in the second half of this year.

    Another major observation in the X-Force report is that a number of the
critical vulnerabilities that were disclosed in 2008 did not see
widespread exploitation in the field. IBM X-Force believes that the
security industry can better prioritize its response to vulnerability
disclosures. Currently, that prioritization is done through the
industry-standard Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
focuses on the technical aspects of a vulnerability, such as severity and
ease-of-exploitation. While these factors are extremely important, they
do not fully capture the primary motivator of computer crime: the
economic opportunity.

    "The CVSS provides an essential base that the security industry
desperately needs to measure security threats," said Lamb. "But we also
realize that cybercriminals are motivated by money, and we need to fully
consider how attackers balance the economic opportunity of a
vulnerability against the costs of exploitation. If the security industry
can better understand the motivations of computer criminals, it can do a
better job of determining when emergency patching is most needed in the
face of immediate threats. We can also be more precise about determining
when widespread exploitation of a vulnerability will take a long time to
emerge, and when it is unlikely to ever emerge. This analysis could
result in more efficient use of time and resources."

    The X-Force has been cataloguing, analyzing and researching vulnerability
disclosures since 1997. With nearly 40,000 security vulnerabilities
catalogued, it has the largest vulnerability database in the world. This
unique database helps X-Force researchers to understand the dynamics that
make up vulnerability discovery and disclosure.

    The new X-Force report from IBM also reveals that:

    2008 was the busiest year for discovering vulnerabilities with a 13.5
percent increase over 2007. At the end of 2008, 53 percent of all
vulnerabilities disclosed during the year had no vendor-supplied patches.
Further, 46 percent of vulnerabilities from 2006 and 44 percent from 2007
were still left with no available patch at the end of 2008. The McColo
shutdown had the most impact on spam activity in 2008, not only affecting
quantity but also affecting the type of spam sent and countries that
frequently sent it. China emerged as top spam sender directly after the
McColo shutdown, but was replaced by Brazil by the end of the year. For
many years before the shutdown, the US had claimed the number one spot.
Main countries of origin of spam throughout 2008 were Russia with 12
percent, the United States with 9.6 percent and Turkey with 7.8 percent.
Although the origins of spam do not necessarily correlate with where
spammers reside. China surpassed the US as the number one country of
hosted malicious Web sites for the first time in 2008. Phishers continue
to attack financial institutions. Nearly 90 percent of phishing attacks
were targeted to financial institutions, with the majority targeting
those in North America. 46 percent of all malware in 2008 were Trojans
targeting users of online games and online banking. The X-Force report
predicts that these specific user groups will likely remain targets in
2009.

&lt;p&gt;Intensive Lipitor Therapy Significantly Reduced hsCRP Levels Further Than
Low-Dose Lipitor
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Patients treated with Lipitor&#174; (atorvastatin calcium) 80 mg had a significant 55
percent reduction in levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP),
while those taking Lipitor 10 mg had a significant 21 percent reduction in hsCRP
levels at the end of 26 weeks compared to baseline, according to the results
from the primary endpoint of a new study. Patients in this study had stable
coronary artery disease, normal to mildly elevated cholesterol levels and
chronic low-grade inflammation as indicated by elevated levels of hsCRP, which
studies suggest may play a role in determining cardiovascular risk. The
findings, from the Comparative Atorvastatin Pleiotropic effects (CAP) study,
were recently published in Clinical Therapeutics. 

"These findings support results from prior clinical trials suggesting that, in
addition to lowering LDL cholesterol levels, Lipitor may help reduce hsCRP,
which reflects the systemic inflammation that might contribute to increased risk
for cardiovascular events," said Dr. Jean Davignon, director of the
hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis research group at the Clinical Research
Institute of Montreal and a principal investigator of the trial. "Even more
encouraging was the fact that further reductions in hsCRP were observed with
intensive Lipitor therapy versus a lower dose." 

The CAP trial was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, 26-week study
designed to examine the effects of low-dose versus high-dose Lipitor on hsCRP
levels in men and women under the age of 80 with stable coronary artery disease,
normal to mildly elevated cholesterol levels and chronic low-grade inflammation
as indicated by elevated levels of hsCRP. The mean baseline hsCRP concentration
was 3.1 mg/L and 3.6 mg/L in the Lipitor 10 mg and Lipitor 80 mg treatment
groups, respectively. Coronary artery disease was defined by at least one of the
following: history of heart attack, stable angina, coronary narrowing of at
least 50 percent, history of unstable angina and history of coronary artery
bypass grafting or coronary angioplasty. 

A total of 340 patients were treated with either low-dose Lipitor 10 mg or
intensive Lipitor 80 mg therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was the
percent change in hsCRP after 26 weeks of treatment with Lipitor 10 mg or 80 mg.
Comparisons of hsCRP levels at five weeks were pre-determined secondary
endpoints. 

After five weeks of therapy, patients treated with Lipitor 10 mg had a
significant 25 percent reduction in hsCRP levels compared to baseline, and hsCRP
levels remained stable at study end (21 percent reduction). Patients treated
with Lipitor 80 mg for five weeks had a significant 36 percent reduction in
hsCRP levels compared to baseline. These levels were reduced further at study
end to a total reduction of 55 percent. The effects of Lipitor on changes in
hsCRP levels were dose dependent; high-dose Lipitor was associated with
significantly greater reductions. 

Reductions in hsCRP were largely independent of the significant reductions in
LDL cholesterol that were also observed in both treatment groups. At 26 weeks,
those treated with Lipitor 80 mg had significantly greater reductions in LDL
cholesterol compared to those who received Lipitor 10 mg (51 percent versus 35
percent, respectively). 

Both doses of Lipitor (10 mg and 80 mg) were generally well tolerated. 

The prevalence of adverse events considered by the investigators to be
treatment-related was 8.2 percent in the 10 mg group and 11.8 percent in the 80
mg group. The most common adverse events, reported with an incidence greater
than 1 percent in either the 10 mg or 80 mg group, were asthenia (1.8 percent
and 1.8 percent, respectively), increased creatinine kinase (1.8 percent and 0.6
percent), myalgia (1.2 percent and 2.4 percent), constipation (1.2 percent and
1.8 percent), increased aspartate aminotransferase (0 percent and 1.2 percent)
and insomnia (0 percent and 1.2 percent). The majority of adverse events in both
treatment groups were mild to moderate in intensity, with only 1.2 percent of
patients in each group reporting severe side effects. 

The study was sponsored by Pfizer and led by a joint Canadian/French steering
committee. Patients were recruited from 65 sites in seven countries. 

Important U.S. Prescribing Information

Lipitor is a prescription medication. It is used in patients with multiple risk
factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, age, low
HDL ("good" cholesterol) or smoking to reduce the risk of a heart attack,
stroke, certain types of heart surgery and chest pain. 

Lipitor is also used in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least one other
risk factor for heart disease such as high blood pressure, smoking or
complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce
the risk of heart attack and stroke. 

Lipitor is used in patients with existing coronary heart disease to reduce the
risk of heart attack, stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery, hospitalization
for heart failure, and chest pain. 

When diet and exercise alone are not enough, Lipitor is used along with a
low-fat diet and exercise to lower cholesterol. 

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is
not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant. 

Patients taking Lipitor should tell their doctors if they feel any new muscle
pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
Patients should tell their doctors about all medications they take. This may
help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check
liver function before and during treatment and may adjust the dose. The most
common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain and heartburn. They tend
to be mild and often go away.

&lt;p&gt;Includes Support for Microsoft Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel in Addition
to PDF and TIFF Files


SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(Business Wire)--
At LegalTech New York 2009 (Feb. 2-4), Informative Graphics Corporation (IGC), a
leader in content visualization, collaboration and redaction technology, today
officially releases Redact-It Desktop 1.1 for removal of sensitive content and
privacy information such as social security numbers, names and phone numbers
before making documents more widely available. The software dramatically reduces
the time it takes to redact, review and release documents for public access,
eDiscovery and other processes. Redact-It Desktop 1.1 applies powerful redaction
capabilities to Microsoft Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Excel, the most widely
used software programs in the world, while providing OCR (Optical Character
Recognition) processing of documents to convert PDFs and TIFFs into
text-searchable files. Redact-It never alters source files, saving the redacted
renditions as easily distributable TIFF or PDF files. 

"Extending the power of Redact-It to popular Microsoft programs people use
across every industry was critically important," said Gary Heath, President and
CEO of IGC. "Privacy and attorney-client privilege laws mandate that attorneys,
government officials and health care professionals ensure confidential
information is not inadvertently released. With Redact-It Desktop 1.1, we've
made it easy for them to securely remove information in documents they create
and share every day." 

Redact-It Desktop is the first low-cost desktop application using pattern
recognition to find and redact information within a document. It includes many
built-in macros to redact privacy information such as names, phone numbers,
social security numbers, driver license numbers, credit card numbers, birth
dates and more. Users can also create custom search macros and scripts for
specific needs like account or ID numbers. Redact-It also includes "Defined Area
Redaction" (drawing a box around the area to be redacted), adding the ability to
redact an entire page or range of pages. Combined with Redact-It`s "peek
through" feature, this makes it easy to select limited areas to remain visible. 

Key features of Redact-It 1.1 include:

* Microsoft Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint support. Not only can the
documents be opened natively, Redact-It can install a plug-in into these
applications to launch of the current document in Redact-It. For Outlook,
Redact-It supports the message body and attachments. 
* Ability to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) when opening TIFF
documents, creating searchable text. 
* Scripting capability. Users can record redaction actions to create a reusable
script that can be run on other documents. 
* Ability to create a draft version of the redacted document for review by
others before finalizing redactions. 
* Redact a full page, range of pages or the entire document. 
* Ability to filter redactions during the Verify step. For example, users can
filter all redactions by reason code or search pattern. 
* Ability to redact "all but..." For example, a user can redact all social
security numbers, but leave the last four digits, or redact all phone numbers or
email addresses except those specifically stated. 
* Extensive logging of search terms used, who performed each redaction and when,
scripts run and redaction templates applied, creating a useful audit trail of
redactions. 
* Ability to delete all redactions. Users can now delete all redactions, or only
those of a particular color or reason code, making modifying redactions easier. 
* "Entire document validated" feature that walks users through the document in a
very focused way and creates a specific log entry when the reviewer has
completed this visual verification of the entire document.

A 15-day trial version is available at: www.redact-it.com/download/. The base
version of Redact-It Desktop 1.1 is available immediately and priced at $195
with the OCR option available for an additional $49 USD. 

Other members of the Redact-It family include Redact-It Enterprise Server for
batch and automated redaction as part of workflow processes, and Redact-It for
Kofax&#174; Ascent Capture&#174;, which works directly within the Kofax batch process to
remove the data from selected redaction zones with associated OCR text,
typically as files are bulk loaded into a document repository. For more
information, visit www.redact-it.com.

&lt;p&gt;  MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, Feb 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Adaptive Planning, the worldwide leader in on-demand financial planning
and reporting solutions for companies of all sizes, today announced a
rescue package for companies using Microsoft performance management
products including PerformancePoint, FRx and Forecaster. The program is
designed to provide an affordable alternative to customers adversely
affected by Microsoft's announcement that they are discontinuing sales
and development of PerformancePoint, their financial planning solution.
The program features a 75 percent discount off Adaptive Planning's
subscription fees for existing Microsoft customers and is available on
the Intel(R) Business Exchange (bx.intel.com), a platform built for small
and medium businesses featuring innovative software and Intel(R)
technology.

    On January 23, 2009, Microsoft announced an update to its Microsoft
Business Intelligence roadmap which revealed that their planning solution,
PerformancePoint Server 2007, will no longer be a standalone item on their
price list after April 1, 2009, and that they will not make further
investments in the solution after mid-2009. According to media reports,
Microsoft will now continue to offer planning and reporting capabilities
through its Microsoft Dynamics business unit, via legacy Forecaster and
FRx products that were previously being phased out.

    The rescue package is designed to provide Microsoft PerformancePoint, FRx,
and Forecaster customers an easy and affordable migration path away from
discontinued and under-invested products, and to the powerful, innovative,
next generation financial planning and reporting solutions offered by
Adaptive Planning. With a 75 percent discount for the duration of the
contract, Adaptive Planning's solution is available for as little as $150
per seat per year, which can be less than the annual cost of maintenance
for existing PerformancePoint customers. In addition, because the solution
is available as an on-demand application, it can be deployed rapidly, with
implementations averaging just two weeks of consulting.

    "We are pleased to provide a new alternative -- a lifeline -- to Microsoft
customers and partners who are concerned with Microsoft's commitment to
financial planning solutions," said William A. Soward, CEO of Adaptive
Planning. "Microsoft's exit from the planning space illustrates the
challenges of selling costly, complex software in a down economy, and
underscores that developing and selling applications to business users --
finance organizations -- requires a much different set of skills than
selling technology tools to IT. We believe the advantages of our on-demand
business solution will be a highly attractive alternative for Microsoft
customers and partners that have been abandoned, and we look forward to
welcoming them to the Adaptive Planning community going forward."

    Adaptive Planning's budgeting, forecasting, and reporting solution
represents an alternative to both manual, Excel-based processes and
costly, complex enterprise software. Because the solution is offered via
the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, it is extremely affordable; does
not require any new hardware, software, or IT support; and averages just
two weeks for implementations.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), Smith International Inc. (NYSE: SII), Amazon.com
(NASDAQ: AMZN), Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM)and AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN).

the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Exxon's Earnings Peak in 2008

Earlier today, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) reported better-than-expected
fourth-quarter 2008 earnings of $1.55 per share or $7.8 billion, down from $2.13
per share or $11.7 billion in the year-earlier quarter. The steep fall in oil
prices caused a more than 47% drop in earnings from the preceding quarter. For
the full-year 2008, total earnings were a record $44.1 billion, up from $40.6
billion in 2007. 

Exxon`s earnings follow oil prices. And since the price of oil is not expected
to get anywhere close to its summer 2008 peak anytime soon, we can safely say
the same about Exxon`s earnings as well. Exxon`s earnings and cash flows peaked
in 2008, but will most likely bottom in 2009. Given the unfavorable macro
backdrop, Exxon`s total 2009 earnings could be about half of its 2008 record,
with the outlook improving in the following years. 

Smith Int'l Adjusted, Still a Buy

Smith International Inc.'s (NYSE: SII) 4th quarter earnings, though
weaker-than-expected, were above year-earlier levels, driven by gains from its
August acquisition of W-H Energy's operations. Revenue and earnings grew 33% and
31%, respectively, on the back of improved performance from all three segments. 

Looking ahead, the company's strong cash flows, low capital needs, and diverse
product portfolio with a growing international presence should help it weather
the current downturn better than most of its peers. Our Buy recommendation
remains unchanged, though we have lowered our estimates, and our current target
price is $45.00 per share. 

AMZN Impresses, But Don't Chase

Last night, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported surprisingly strong results for
the 4th quarter. The company reported revenue of $6.7 billion and earnings per
share of $0.52, easily beating the Zacks consensus estimates of $6.5 billion in
revenue and EPS of $0.42. This upside surprise is pushing the AMZN shares higher
by about 20% today, which is impressive given the weakness in the rest of the
market. 

Fourth quarter revenue was up 18% year-over-year, with North American revenue up
18% and International revenue up 19%. Free cash flow grew 16% year-over-year to
$1.36 billion. 

Humana a Buy Pre-Earnings

Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) is one of the largest publicly traded health benefit
companies in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We expect HUM to report 4Q08 financial
results on February 2, 2009. 

Our current revenue and EPS estimates are $7,262M and $1.05 respectively versus
consensus estimates of $7,370M and $1.07. Our Buy recommendation remains intact
at current levels pending the 4Q08 earnings release. 

AutoNation Mkt Stuck in Reverse

AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN) is the largest automotive retailer in the U.S. and
is about twice the size of its nearest competitor. As of September 2008, the
company owned and operated 311 new vehicle franchises from 238 dealerships
located in major metropolitan markets in 16 states. 

We expect AutoNation to be hurt by a continuing weak new car market. The company
is disproportionately exposed to Florida and California, states that will be hit
the most by a slowing car market. AutoNation's higher debts and interest charges
are also major causes of concern.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) as Bull of the Day and Sony
Corporation (NYSE: SNE) as Bear of the Day. In addition, the analysts at Zacks
Equity Research discuss the latest on Fair Isaac Corp. (NYSE: FIC), Citigroup
(NYSE: C) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) remains better positioned, operationally as well as
financially, than any other integrated oil company to navigate the current
choppy waters. Its capital discipline, cost controls, and operating efficiencies
are legendary, to say the least. Exxon stuck to its conservative project
selection criteria through the boom years, using very low oil prices to
determine hurdle rates. 

Exxon generated almost $60 billion in operating cash flows in 2008 (it raised an
additional $6 billion through asset sales) and distributed a little over $40
billion to shareholders ($32 billion in buybacks and $8 billion in dividends)
and spent over $26 billion in capital expenditures. It has paid a growing
dividend in each of the last 26 years. 

We continue to rate Exxon shares a Buy. We believe that Exxon shares not only
provide investors with a strong defensive shield in the current turbulent
environment, but also enable them to get full exposure to the all-important
energy sector. 

Bear of the Day

Sony Corporation (NYSE: SNE) is one of the world's leading players in both the
electronics and entertainment industries. Established in 1946 in Tokyo, Japan,
the company manufactures and globally markets a diversified range of products
from video and audio equipment to computer games, CDs and movies. 

We believe Sony will continue to struggle as it faces competition from other
innovative digital products and from low-cost Asian manufacturers as the
consumer market slows. Sony posted lackluster Q3 results, hurt by sluggish sales
in its core electronics segment due to the ongoing recession. 

A strong yen, weak consumer demand, sliding consumer spending and an
intensifying price competition are eating into its profits. Sony Corp. trimmed
its forecast for 2008 and expects to record its first net loss in 14 years with
much lower operating income. We therefore maintain a Sell recommendation on Sony
shares and cut our six-month price target to $16.50. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

How Fair is Fair Isaac`s Latest?

Fair Isaac Corp. (NYSE: FIC), which operates the nation's major credit scoring
system has unveiled a new system called FICO 08. 

The traditional FICO credit score of 300-850, was devised to allow lenders the
ability to better predict the likelihood of a borrower's default propensity. The
new FICO 08 still uses the 300-850 scoring range and does include familiar
credit history factors in its calculation, and is viewed as a routine update of
the coring model, not a response to the current economic crisis. 

While the new credit score penalizes people who have a habitual history of late
payments, those with an isolated financial incident potential could see some
improvement in their credit score. This is Fair Isaac's attempt to address
issues that lenders are struggling with, consumers with blemished credit
histories. 

If the new score could help financial institutions be more willing to lend, with
would benefit companies such as but not limited to Citigroup (NYSE: C) and Bank
of America (NYSE: BAC).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today the discontinuation of a Phase III study of its
investigational agent axitinib for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.
Based on an interim analysis, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
found no evidence of improvement in the primary endpoint of survival in patients
treated with axitinib and gemcitabine, compared to gemcitabine alone, the
current standard of care for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. 

"These results were disappointing, given the trend towards prolonged survival
seen in a Phase II study of axitinib in this extremely difficult-to-treat
patient population," said Mace L. Rothenberg, M.D., senior vice president,
clinical development and medical affairs, Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit.
"However, we remain steadfastly committed to continued investigation of axitinib
in renal cell carcinoma where it is currently in Phase III for 2nd line
treatment." 

The Company has notified all clinical trial investigators involved in the study
and regulatory agencies of these interim findings and recommends patients
discontinue treatment with axitinib. Pfizer encourages investigators to
determine the best course of action for their patients. The full data set from
this study is being analyzed and more details will be presented at an upcoming
medical meeting. 

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United
States. In the past 20 years, there have been only 2 widely approved treatments,
with many other drugs failing in Phase III trials. 

"We have a robust pipeline of compounds in clinical development and will
determine if one or more of those compounds can move forward in pancreatic
cancer," said Dr. Rothenberg. "We also are continuing to evaluate axitinib in
Phase II trials in other tumor types, including advanced non-small cell lung
cancer and colorectal cancer." 

Axitinib is an oral and selective inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1, 2 and 3.
Axitinib is an investigational agent and has not yet been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration or other global regulatory agencies.

 (Adds forecasts, analyst comments, new share price, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating and Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
reported a sharply lower-than-expected quarterly profit as the
global downturn hurt its TV advertising, DVD sales and theme
parks, and its shares fell more than 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The performance by Disney, the first of the major U.S.
media companies to report quarterly results this season, bode
ill for Time Warner (TWX.N) and News Corp NWSa.O, which are
also set to report this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What it would say is that most entertainment conference
calls are going to bring gloomy news of an increasingly
challenged advertising environment," Barclays Capital
entertainment analyst Anthony DiClemente said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney continues to see softness in ad sales at its ABC
broadcast network and ESPN cable sports network, though advance
bookings at its domestic theme parks are up slightly this
quarter, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs told analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger warned, however, that in
addition to economic pressures, the company was "experiencing
secular changes" in consumer behavior that could have long-term
impact on its broadcast television and DVD sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger told analysts that the company was still looking at
"very significant" overall cost reductions, including "reducing
costs of distribution, production (and) marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said last month that it was cutting hundreds of
jobs at its theme parks, ABC Media Group and ESPN, and
consolidating ABC's production and network businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'SLIGHTLY ENCOURAGING'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's fiscal first-quarter net profit fell 32 percent to
$845 million, or 45 cents per share, from $1.25 billion, or 63
cents per share, in last year's first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding gains from the sale of investments in Latin
American pay-TV services, earnings fell to 41 cents per share
versus a comparable consensus estimate of 50 cents, according
to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue fell 8 percent to $9.6 billion from $10.45 billion
a year earlier, short of a Wall Street forecasts for $10.04
billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a bad miss but the problems that led to this miss are
fixable -- the economy... and they have work to do on the cost
side of the equation," Caris  Co analyst David Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Operating income at Disney's theme parks fell 24 percent to
$382 million in the quarter, buffeted by slowing U.S. consumer
spending and a $40 million accounting charge on fuel hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue at the parks fell 4 percent to $2.67 billion,
despite deep discounts for park stays and tickets instituted
last fall. But the discounts, extended on Tuesday through March

the second and third quarters over 2008, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edward Jones consumer analyst Robin Diedrich said the
January park trends were "slightly encouraging" and in line
with those of other consumer-facing companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Slowly, very slowly, things have been... coming off of
what appears to be a really low period," Diedrich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At media networks, operating profit fell 29 percent to $655

sales at ESPN and lower ratings at ABC, as well as tough
comparisons with "High School Musical 2" DVD sales in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pace of ad sales is down slightly at ABC and ESPN and
"significantly" at Disney owned and operated TV stations in the
current quarter versus 2008, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spot ad sales at ABC are fetching slightly higher prices
than advance sales in the current quarter, but advertisers have
been slower to pick up options for time in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DVD sales for Disney Studios' "Prince Caspian" were no
match for 2008's "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End",
bringing the unit's operating profit down 64 percent to $187
million, and revenue down 26 percent to $1.95 billion in the
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Operating profit at the Consumer Products unit fell 8
percent to $265 million, squeezed by flat royalties and retail
store costs. Revenue rose 18 percent to $773 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares fell 7.4 percent to $19.09 in after-hours
electronic trade from a close of $20.62 on Tuesday on the New

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Walt Disney Pictures:

Humpback Whales

The humpback whales in the film migrate 4,000 miles from the warm waters of the
tropics to the waters off Antarctica where they feed on krill and small fish. 

To avoid getting separated and losing track of each other, mother grey whale and
calf keep in contact by slapping their fins on the surface of the water. 

Humpbacks sometimes feed on krill cooperatively using a method call "bubble
netting." A group of whales emit bubbles in a circle, which herds the krill
together and forces them towards the surface at the center of the circle, making
it easy for the whales to feed. 

Humpback whales' very small eyes help them withstand the pressure of a deep sea
dive. 

Instead of teeth, a humpback whale has approximately 330 pairs of baleen plates,
or fine brush-like structures, which strain krill from the water. 

Humpback whale calves are able to swim within 30 minutes of being born. Calves
drink about 160 gallons of milk a day. 

Humpback whales are singers: their songs can last up to 10 minutes. Why or how
humpback's sing is unknown, though it is possible it is related to communication
and, in breeding season, to mating. 

Polar Bears

The polar bear gets all the liquid it needs from its food -- its main source
being the ringed seal -- so it has no need to drink water. 

Polar bears will travel hundreds of miles in search of food and can swim 12
miles a day. 

The polar bear is so well adapted to retaining heat that it can't run long
distances because it would be in danger of overheating. 

Polar bears are the largest land predator in the world. Males can grow up to
about 8 feet and weigh up to 1,800 pounds. 

Even with their mother's care, only 50% of the polar bear cubs survive their
first year, and more are lost when they first leave their mother to make their
way alone. 

While waiting to catch seals, a polar bear will cover its black nose with its
paw to make its white camouflage perfect. 

The polar bears were filmed on Kong Karls Land, a group of islands between the
Barents Sea and the Artic Ocean. Part of Norway, it is a land where the midnight
sun lasts from April 20 to August 23, and the polar night lasts from October 26
to February 15. 

Elephants

An adult elephant can eat over 300 pounds of food and drink 50 gallons of water
a day. 

Elephants' ears act as a cooling system. By holding them out in the wind or
flapping them, the elephant can increase the movement of air over its ears and
cool the blood running through them, thereby regulating its body heat. 

It can take up to six months for an elephant calf to learn how to use its trunk
to bring water up to its mouth. 

In times of danger the adult elephants in a herd will form a ring around the
young, facing out to protect them. 

In the film the elephants spend weeks traveling across the Kalahari Desert to
reach the abundant waters of the Okavango Delta, the world's largest inland
delta, where the Okavango River empties into the desert. 

Other Cast Members

Millions of caribou undertake the world's longest land migration: some 2,000
miles. 

Grey wolves travel greater distances than any other land mammal except the
caribou. 

Thousands of demoiselle cranes migrate from Mongolia to the warmer climates of
India, over the highest mountain range on earth: the Himalayas. They can fly at
altitudes up to 25,000 feet. 

Lions are the only cats to live socially in prides, and it is the lionesses in a
pride that do most of the hunting. 

The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal. It can accelerate from zero to
40 miles per hour in three strides and to its full speed of 70 miles per hour in
seconds. 

A Great White shark is the world's largest predatory fish. It can have around
3,000 teeth in its mouth at any one time. It is one of the few sharks that can
jump fully out of the water. 

In the film, a troop of Chacma baboons can be seen delicately wading through the
flooded Okavango Delta, where the Okavango River empties into the Kalahari
Desert, as though they can't stand getting wet. They do, however, enjoy eating
the tubors of aquatic plants. An average troop of baboons can consist of 20 to
80 individuals. 

Mandarin ducks build their nests in a hole in a tree up to 30 feet from the
ground. When the eggs hatch, the mother calls the chicks from the ground. Each
chick crawls out of the hole and launches itself into a free fall. Astonishingly
all the chicks land - and sometimes bounce - unhurt and head for the nearest
feeding ground. 

There are approximately 40 different Bird of Paradise species in Papua New
Guinea, each with a different mating display. For his mating display, the male
Six Plumed Bird of Paradise builds his dance floor, clearing a small patch of
forest floor of leaves and twigs and pruning the surrounding branches of leaves.
He wants all the visiting females to get a good look at his performance. 

During the approximately five years of filming the "earth," the production
captured 42 animal species on film. 

The earth is tilted at an angle of exactly 23.5 degrees to the sun. Without this
tilt, the earth would be a very different planet. While there would still be
climatic variations north to south caused by the varying concentration of solar
energy reaching the planet's surface, there would be no seasons and no variation
in the hours of daylight and darkness during the year. 

Tropical rainforests cover less than 3% of the planet's surface but are home to
more than 50% of the world's species.

&lt;p&gt;NICE Decision Expands Treatment Choices for Patients
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc said today that the United Kingdom`s National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued its final appraisal document (FAD)
recommending the use of Sutent (sunitinib malate) as a first-line treatment for
patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma mRCC (advanced kidney cancer).
According to NICE, "Sutent provided a step-change in the first-line treatment of
advanced and/or metastatic RCC and [NICE] noted that more than 20% of the public
and patients that responded in consultation highlighted this impressive benefit
from sunitinib." 

Sutent demonstrated a significant improvement in progression- free survival vs.
IFN-&#945;. The median survival of patients treated with Sutent exceeded two years.
In September 2008, NICE had issued an appraisal consultation document (ACD)
which advised against the use of all four medicines for the treatment of mRCC.
Today`s announcement reverses their previous recommendation regarding the
coverage of Sutent, and makes Sutent the only one of the four medicines, under
review, that is recommended for coverage to date. 

"Today`s recommendation is an important step forward for kidney cancer patients
and also for physicians in the U.K. who now have a proven treatment option for
this difficult-to treat cancer," said Garry Nicholson, president and general
manager, Oncology Business Unit at Pfizer. "We appreciate this recommendation by
NICE on behalf of patients." 

It is estimated that more than 7,000 people are diagnosed with kidney cancer in
the UK each year and approximately 3,600 people die from the disease. Worldwide,
approximately 210,000 new cases will be diagnosed worldwide, and at diagnosis,
approximately 25 percent to 35 percent of RCC patients will have advanced
disease. Metastatic, recurrent or relapsed renal cancer has a very poor
prognosis. The historic median survival for patients treated for metastatic
disease was 10 to 13 months. 

Sutent, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, was first approved in January 2006 for
advanced RCC. Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in
the growth, proliferation and spread of cancer. 

Note: Sunitinib is recommended as a first-line treatment option for people with
advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma who are suitable for
immunotherapy and have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status of 0 or 1 (patients without symptoms or only mildly symptomatic from
their cancer). 

Important SUTENT&#174; (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. CBCs with platelet count and serum
chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle for
patients receiving treatment with SUTENT. 

The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials were fatigue, asthenia,
diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspensia, abdominal pain,
constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration,
altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings assigns an 'A+' rating to City of Fresno Joint Powers Financing
Authority (JPFA), California's approximately $47.7 million lease revenue bonds
(police and fire master lease projects) series 2009A. The bonds will be sold on
or about Feb. 23, 2009. Proceeds from the new issues will fund improvements and
additions to police and fire department facilities. The financing is a standard
lease-leaseback structure, subject to abatement. Leased assets include several
fire stations as well as the new police regional training center being
constructed. The leased assets are essential and their value approximates the
value of the improvements, providing sufficient collateral. 

Fitch also affirms the following ratings: 

--$153.4 million in various Fresno JPFA outstanding lease revenue bonds at 'A+';


--City of Fresno (the city) implied general obligation (GO) bonds at 'AA-'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

The 'A+' rating reflects Fresno's stable financial position, including solid
reserves and moderate debt, as well as the housing-led contracting economy which
will likely result in reduced operating revenues (such as property and sales
taxes) over the next one to two years. Fitch believes the city's reserves,
including the emergency reserve fund, and timely response to the slowing economy
will aid in retaining a sound financial position as revenues weaken. However, if
the economic downturn is more severe or prolonged than anticipated, resulting in
multiple years of assessed valuation (AV) contraction, or if the city reduces
its emergency fund below its 5% of spending policy there may be negative rating
pressure. 

Like much of California, Fresno's economy is experiencing weakness after several
years of very strong gains, largely the result of severe distress in the housing
sector. Mortgage delinquencies (60 days or more) and home foreclosures have
risen rapidly, and construction and financial services employment have been
falling since 2006. However, overall employment increased 1.3% in 2007 before
declining year over year in October 2008 by about 0.3% as most of the losses in
the real estate related sectors were offset by gains in the education and
healthcare and government sectors. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate increased
to a high 10.8% in October 2008 compared to 7.7% a year prior. Meanwhile, the
city's assessed valuation (AV) for fiscal 2009 increased just 1.5% compared to
the previous five year average growth rate of 11.1%. Early indications for
fiscal 2010 are for a decline in AV of up to 5% as the county assessor reduces
AV to market values. The median home price in the Fresno metropolitan
statistical area has declined about 24% since peaking in 2006. 

Fresno's financial operations are well managed with conservative revenue
forecasting and cost control measures contributing to stable year-end results.
The city's general fund has run break-even or operating surpluses for several
years, but declined by a modest $1.5 million in fiscal 2008, bringing the 2008
unreserved fund balance to $30.6 million, a strong 12% of expenditures and
transfers out. Within its unreserved fund, the city has been prudently building
its emergency reserve since 2002, which ended fiscal 2008 with a balance of $16
million, or 6.1% of spending. The emergency reserve can only be used during
times of extreme financial distress or natural disasters; the mayor must make a
declaration which must be approved by city council. Given the economic outlook,
the city added to this amount in fiscal 2008 and has budgeted an addition of $1
million in fiscal 2009 despite budget pressures, in order to keep the fund in
excess of the council-adopted 5% policy. Fitch views these balances as prudent
given the area's economic volatility and the fiscal strain foreseen in the next
few years. 

The city's economic growth has kept the debt burden to moderate levels despite
recent issuances. Direct debt is $1,034 per capita and 1.7% of market value
while overall debt is $2,915 per capita and 4.7% of taxable market value. Future
debt needs appear manageable, with the city working to identify revenue sources
to be used to pay some or all of the future debt service. 

Note: Fitch issued an exposure draft on July 31, 2008 proposing a recalibration
of tax-supported and water/sewer revenue bond ratings which, if adopted, may
result in an upward revision of this rating (see Fitch research 'Exposure Draft:
Reassessment of the Municipal Ratings Framework'.) At this time, Fitch is
deferring its final determination on municipal recalibration. Fitch will
continue to monitor market and credit conditions, and plans to revisit the
recalibration in the first quarter of 2009. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Feb 4 (Reuters) - Britain's healthcare
cost-effectiveness watchdog, in a partial change of heart, has
decided Pfizer's (PFE.N) kidney cancer drug Sutent should be
made available to some patients on the state-run health service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But three other drugs -- Roche's (ROG.VX) Avastin, Bayer's
BAYG.DE Nexavar and Wyeth's WYE.N Torisel -- are still not
recommended as first-line treatments, the National Institute of
Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said on Wednesday.
 NICE caused a furore in August when it said "no" to all four
of the expensive new medicines for advanced or metastatic kidney
cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That decision stoked controversy about the way NICE rations
medicines on the National Health Service (NHS) in England and
Wales, denying patients access to modern drugs which are used
routinely in the United States and some other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, the government has introduced new guidelines
designed to take into account the added value that society puts
on end-of-life treatments, allowing for the change of tack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although this final recommendation is subject to appeal we
very much hope it will form the basis of our guidance to the
NHS," said NICE Chief Executive Andrew Dillon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The other three drugs we are looking at will be the subject
of further consultation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case highlights the tough choices NICE has to make when
deciding which drugs are worth offering to patients and which
are too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Modern targeted drugs are revolutionising cancer care, yet
they often increase survival by only a few months at a cost of
many thousands of pounds. Drugmakers argue they need to charge a
high price to make a reasonable return on risky research
investment.
Sutent is known generically as sunitinib, while Avastin,
Nexavar and Torisel are bevacizumab, sorafenib and temsirolimus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cost of a six-week cycle of treatment with Sutent is
3,139 pounds ($4,467) but Pfizer has agreed a patient access
scheme with the Department of Health under which the first cycle
is provided free to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the last 10 years, NICE has led the world in assessing
the cost-effectiveness of drugs. Similar health technology
assessment bodies are now springing up in other countries as
payers seek a rational way to decide whether pricey new drugs
for cancer and other complex disorders are worth using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worldwide, cancer drugs are the fastest-growing segment of
the pharmaceuticals market with an expected growth rate twice
that of medicines overall, according to healthcare consultancy
IMS Health.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Tuesday as news of an alternative stimulus plan from Senate Republicans suggested lawmakers were moving closer to a package that would soften the blow of a deepening recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A surprise rise in December pending home sales also buoyed sentiment, while a solid profit from drugmaker Merck (MRK.N) offered a rare bit of welcome news in an otherwise gloomy earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we've gotten at least a counter-proposal makes it more likely that something will pass," said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was some concern that we might not get a (stimulus) bill passed a couple of days ago. That certainly added to the market's big move at the end of the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck shares climbed more than 6 percent, making health-care stocks one of the biggest boosts to both the Dow and the SP 500. Schering-Plough SGP.N also posted quarterly results ahead of Wall Street targets, sending its stock up more than 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI jumped 141.53 points, or 1.78 percent, to 8,078.36. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX added 13.07 points, or 1.58 percent, to 838.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC shot up 21.87 points, or 1.46 percent, to 1,516.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of Republican U.S. senators offered a $445 billion alternative plan to boosting the ailing economy, about half of which would be in the form of tax cuts. The plan is an alternative to the $885 billion package crafted by Democrats who control the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISNEY DISAPPOINTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with the optimism, there was some unsettling news after the bell as Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) ,considered a bellwether for consumer spending, posted a 32 percent slide in quarterly profit, worse than expected. Its stock, a Dow component, slid than 9 percent to $18.70 after-hours, from a close of $20.62 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's results could potentially unnerve investors on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the regular session, technology notched a strong advance for a second straight day as shares of such bellwethers as Microsoft (MSFT.O) rallied on hopes that government stimulus plans will boost consumer and business spending, offsetting a disappointing outlook from flash memory card maker SanDisk Corp (SNDK.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, up 3.8 percent at $18.50, was the top boost on Nasdaq, and the software maker capped its strongest two-day run-up in nearly two months. Tech services company International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) led the Dow, finishing up 2.8 percent at $93.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck shares finished 6.4 percent higher at $30.24, while Schering-Plough climbed 8.2 percent to $18.91. Drug companies are a defensive play as their business is considered better able to withstand a downbeat economy. The pharmaceutical index .DRG rose 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors saw a glimmer of hope in the battered housing market after pending sales of existing homes rose 6.3 percent in December, sparking an 8.5 percent rise in the Dow Jones home construction index .DJUSHB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of luxury home builder Toll Brothers (TOL.N) gained 6.4 percent to $18.06. Shares of D.R. Horton (DHI.N) surged 21.4 percent to $7.42 after the home builder posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANK WOES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank shares slid, however, due to uncertainty about the Obama administration's plans to shore up the beleaguered financial sector. JPMorgan (JPM.N) ,down 4.6 percent at $24.05, was the top drag on the Dow, followed by American Express (AXP.N) ,off 5.2 percent to $16.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America (BAC.N) sagged for a fourth straight day, ending 11.8 percent lower at $5.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Obama administration is due to make an announcement about its bank plan next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of SanDisk, whose chips are used in cell phones and digital cameras, plunged 23.2 percent to $8.66, a day after it gave a disappointing outlook and said it may undertake an equity offering that could dilute shares as much as 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 1.35 billion shares changed hands, below last year's estimated daily average volume of 1.49 billion shares, while on the Nasdaq, about 2.12 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of about 8 to 5, while on the Nasdaq, about four stocks rose for every 3 that fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co reported a sharply lower-than-expected quarterly profit as the global downturn hurt its TV advertising, DVD sales and theme parks, pushing its shares 9 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dismal performance by Disney, the first of the major U.S. media firms to report quarterly results this season, bode ill for Time Warner and News Corp NWSa.O, which are also scheduled to report this week and have sought to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Iger, Disney's president and chief executive officer, told analysts on a conference call that the company was still looking at "significant" overall cost reductions, including "reducing costs of distribution, production (and) marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an across-the-board process that does not just involve eliminating jobs," Iger said, while declining to give a target for reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's fiscal first-quarter net profit fell 32 percent to $845 million, or 45 cents per share, from $1.25 billion, or 63 cents per share, in last year's first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding gains from the sale of investments in Latin American pay-TV services, earnings fell to 41 cents per share versus a comparable consensus estimate of 50 cents. according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 8 percent to $9.6 billion from $10.45 billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating income at Disney's theme parks fell 24 percent to $382 million in the quarter, buffeted by slowing domestic consumer spending and a stronger dollar. Revenue at the parks fell 4 percent to $2.67 billion, despite deep discounts for park stays and tickets instituted last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At media networks, operating profit fell 29 percent to $655 million and revenue slid 5 percent to $3.9 billion on lower ratings for ABC programing and weaker ad sales at ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital entertainment analyst Anthony DiClemente said the results missed his "conservative" forecast, reflecting a worse-than-expected climate for advertising and DVD sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What it would say is that most entertainment conference calls are going to bring gloomy news of an increasingly challenged advertising environment," DiClemente said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said last month that it was cutting hundreds of jobs at its theme parks, ABC Media Group and ESPN, and consolidating ABC's production and network businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakness at Disney's retail and licensing businesses also dragged on results. DVD sales for Disney Studios' "Wall-E" and "Prince Caspian" were no match for last year's titles, bringing the unit's operating profit down 64 percent to $187 million, and revenue down 26 percent to $1.95 billion in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Products division saw its operating profit fall 8 percent to $265 million, but revenue rose 18 percent to $773 million for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares fell more than 9 percent to $18.70 in after-hours electronic trade, after closing at $20.62 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sue Zeidler; Editing by Edwin Chan, Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds Iger, analyst's comments, conference call details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
reported a sharply lower-than-expected quarterly profit as the
global downturn hurt its TV advertising, DVD sales and theme
parks, pushing its shares 9 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dismal performance by Disney, the first of the major

 (Updates with Disney dropping after-the-bell, adds volume in
last two paragraphs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as
news of an alternative stimulus plan from Senate Republicans
suggested lawmakers were moving closer to a package that would
soften the blow of a deepening recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A surprise rise in December pending home sales also buoyed
sentiment, while a solid profit from drugmaker Merck (MRK.N)
offered a rare bit of welcome news in an otherwise gloomy
earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fact that we've gotten at least a counter-proposal
makes it more likely that something will pass," said Michael
James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan
in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There was some concern that we might not get a (stimulus)
bill passed a couple of days ago. That certainly added to the
market's big move at the end of the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merck shares climbed more than 6 percent, making
health-care stocks one of the biggest boosts to both the Dow
and the SP 500. Schering-Plough SGP.N also posted quarterly
results ahead of Wall Street targets, sending its stock up more
than 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI jumped 141.53
points, or 1.78 percent, to 8,078.36. The Standard  Poor's 500
Index .SPX added 13.07 points, or 1.58 percent, to 838.51.
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC shot up 21.87 points, or
1.46 percent, to 1,516.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A group of Republican U.S. senators offered a $445 billion
alternative plan to boosting the ailing economy, about half of
which would be in the form of tax cuts. The plan is an
alternative to the $885 billion package crafted by Democrats
who control the Senate. For details, see [ID:nWBT010562]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DISNEY DISAPPOINTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even with the optimism, there was some unsettling news
after the bell as Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) ,considered a
bellwether for consumer spending, posted a 32 percent slide in
quarterly profit, worse than expected. Its stock, a Dow
component, slid than 9 percent to $18.70 after-hours, from a
close of $20.62 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's results could potentially unnerve investors on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the regular session, technology notched a strong advance
for a second straight day as shares of such bellwethers as
Microsoft (MSFT.O) rallied on hopes that government stimulus
plans will boost consumer and business spending, offsetting a
disappointing outlook from flash memory card maker SanDisk Corp
(SNDK.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, up 3.8 percent at $18.50, was the top boost on
Nasdaq, and the software maker capped its strongest two-day
run-up in nearly two months. Tech services company
International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) led the Dow,
finishing up 2.8 percent at $93.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merck shares finished 6.4 percent higher at $30.24, while
Schering-Plough climbed 8.2 percent to $18.91. Drug companies
are a defensive play as their business is considered better
able to withstand a downbeat economy. The pharmaceutical index
.DRG rose 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors saw a glimmer of hope in the battered housing
market after pending sales of existing homes rose 6.3 percent
in December, sparking an 8.5 percent rise in the Dow Jones home
construction index .DJUSHB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of luxury home builder Toll Brothers (TOL.N) gained
6.4 percent to $18.06. Shares of D.R. Horton (DHI.N) surged
21.4 percent to $7.42 after the home builder posted a
smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANK WOES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank shares slid, however, due to uncertainty about the
Obama administration's plans to shore up the beleaguered
financial sector. JPMorgan (JPM.N) ,down 4.6 percent at $24.05,
was the top drag on the Dow, followed by American Express
(AXP.N) ,off 5.2 percent to $16.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America (BAC.N) sagged for a fourth straight day,
ending 11.8 percent lower at $5.30 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The Obama administration is due to make an
announcement about its bank plan next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of SanDisk, whose chips are used in cell phones and
digital cameras, plunged 23.2 percent to $8.66, a day after it
gave a disappointing outlook and said it may undertake an
equity offering that could dilute shares as much as 20
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volume was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, where
about 1.35 billion shares changed hands, below last year's
estimated daily average volume of 1.49 billion shares, while on
the Nasdaq, about 2.12 billion shares traded, below last year's
daily average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of
about 8 to 5, while on the Nasdaq, about four stocks rose for
every 3 that fell.

(1) Beginning with the first quarter fiscal 2009 financial statements, the
Company is reporting its Disney Interactive Media Group along with certain new
business initiatives as "Interactive Media" for segment reporting purposes. The
primary operating businesses of the Disney Interactive Media Group are Disney
Interactive Studios, which produces video games for global distribution, and
Disney Online, which produces web sites and online virtual worlds in the United
States and internationally. The Disney Interactive Media Group also manages the
Company`s Disney-branded mobile phone initiatives. Previously, Disney
Interactive Studios and Disney Online were reported in the Consumer Products and
Media Networks segments, respectively, while the new business initiatives were
reported in corporate and unallocated shared expenses. Prior period amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. See Appendix for financial
information (quarterly and yearly) for fiscal 2008 and 2007 adjusted to reflect
the new presentation. 

Media Networks

Media Networks revenues for the quarter decreased 5% to $3.9 billion and segment
operating income decreased 29% to $655 million. The following table provides
further detail of the Media Networks results (in millions):

Cable Networks

Operating income at Cable Networks decreased $69 million to $517 million for the
quarter driven by decreases at the domestic Disney Channels and at ESPN. The
decrease at the domestic Disney Channels was due to lower DVD sales reflecting
the success of High School Musical 2 in the prior-year quarter. The decrease at
ESPN was primarily due to lower advertising revenues and higher programming and
administrative costs, partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. The decrease
in advertising revenues was due to a decrease in sold inventory, partially
offset by higher rates. Higher programming costs reflected increased costs for
NFL programming. The increase in affiliate revenue was due to higher contractual
rates and, to a lesser extent, subscriber growth. 

Broadcasting

Operating income at Broadcasting decreased $205 million to $138 million for the
quarter primarily due to lower advertising revenue at the ABC Television Network
and at the owned television stations and a bad debt charge in connection with
the bankruptcy of a syndication customer. These decreases were partially offset
by lower programming costs at the ABC Television Network due to a lower cost mix
of programming including a shift of hours from primetime to news. The decrease
in advertising revenues at the ABC Television Network was primarily due to lower
primetime ratings. 

Parks and Resorts

Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter decreased 4% to $2.7 billion and
segment operating income decreased 24% to $382 million. Lower operating income
was due to decreases at the domestic operations and at Disneyland Resort Paris. 

Domestic Operations

Lower operating income at the domestic operations reflected a decline in
attendance and occupied room nights at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland
Resort, mark to market adjustments on fuel hedge contracts and labor and other
cost inflation, partially offset by cost mitigation activities. 

International Operations

At Disneyland Resort Paris, lower operating income reflected a decrease in real
estate sales, labor cost inflation and higher marketing and sales costs,
partially offset by increased attendance. 

Studio Entertainment

Studio Entertainment revenues for the quarter decreased 26% to $1.9 billion and
segment operating income decreased 64% to $187 million. 

Lower segment operating income was primarily due to decreased DVD unit sales at
worldwide home entertainment reflecting the strong performance of Pirates of the
Caribbean: At World`s End, High School Musical 2, Jungle Book Platinum Release
and Ratatouille in the prior-year quarter and lower catalog sales in the current
quarter. Key current quarter releases included WALL-E, Sleeping Beauty Platinum
Release, Tinker Bell and The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. 

Consumer Products

Consumer Products revenues for the quarter increased 18% to $773 million, and
segment operating income decreased 8% to $265 million. The revenue increase was
due to the acquisition of the Disney Stores North America. At merchandise
licensing, earned royalty revenue was comparable to the prior-year quarter. 

The decrease in operating income in the quarter was due to lower results at our
retail business, including the absence of royalties from the former licensee of
the Disney Stores North America, and higher selling and administrative costs. 

Interactive Media

Interactive Media revenues for the quarter increased 13% to $313 million and
segment operating income decreased $58 million to a loss of $45 million. 

Lower segment operating income was primarily due to a decline at Disney
Interactive Studios as higher sales volume was more than offset by an increase
in unit cost of sales and higher marketing expenses in the current quarter. 

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses

Corporate and unallocated shared expense decreased from $92 million to $80
million for the quarter due to an increase in allocation of costs to the
business segments. 

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense was as follows (in millions):

 Net interest expense                $  (139  )    $  (123  )  


The decrease in interest expense for the quarter was primarily due to lower
effective interest rates. 

Interest and investment income for the quarter decreased as the prior-year
quarter included a gain related to the sale of an investment and a recovery in
connection with the Company`s leveraged lease investment with Delta Air Lines
which had been written off previously. 

Minority Interests

Minority interest expense decreased from $24 million in the prior-year quarter
to $6 million in the current quarter due to the impact of lower performance at
Disneyland Resort Paris and ESPN. The minority interest is determined on income
after royalties, financing costs and income taxes. 

Cash Flow

Cash provided by operations and free cash flow were as follows (in millions):

(1) Free cash flow is not a financial measure defined by GAAP. See the
discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows below. 

The decrease in free cash flow was driven by lower segment operating results,
higher net investment in film and television production and programming and an
increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by lower income tax payments.

(1) Net borrowings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the discussion of
non-GAAP financial measures that follows. 

The total borrowings shown above include $3,220 million and $3,706 million
attributable to Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland as of December 27, 2008 and
September 27, 2008, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents attributable to Euro
Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland totaled $513 million and $693 million as of
December 27, 2008 and September 27, 2008, respectively. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This earnings release presents net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate
segment operating income, all of which are important financial measures for the
Company but are not financial measures defined by GAAP. 

These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP
financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of earnings per
share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with
GAAP. Net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income as
we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. 

Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net borrowings
provides investors with a useful perspective on our financial condition. Net
borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total
borrowings. Since we earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a
portion of the interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be
used as a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness when
the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. However, we may not
immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the reduction of debt, nor do we
expect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repay
debt in the ordinary course of business. 

Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by operations
less investments in parks, resorts and other property), among other measures, to
evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for
purposes other than capital expenditures. Management believes that information
about free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the
cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and
pay dividends or repurchase shares. 

Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses
aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating
businesses separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that
information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by
allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company`s
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net
income, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other
factors that affect reported results. 

A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows (in
millions):

Supplemental Financial Information

Interactive Media Group

Fiscal Years 2008 and 2007

The Company has combined the operations and management of Disney Interactive
Studios and the Walt Disney Internet Group into a new business unit, the Disney
Interactive Media Group which creates and delivers Disney-branded entertainment
and lifestyle content across interactive media platforms. The primary operating
businesses of the Disney Interactive Media Group are Disney Interactive Studios,
which produces video games for global distribution, and Disney Online, which
produces web sites and online virtual worlds in the United States and
internationally. The Disney Interactive Media Group also manages the Company`s
Disney-branded mobile phone initiatives and provides technical infrastructure
services to the Company`s non Disney-branded websites, such as ABC.com and
ESPN.com, and to its Disney-branded e-commerce websites, principally
Disneyshopping.com and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Online. The Disney
Interactive Media Group is reimbursed for the cost of providing these technical
infrastructure services, and since these other websites that the Disney
Interactive Media Group supports are managed within the Company`s other
segments, the financial results of these websites are reported within the
Company`s other segments rather than as part of the Disney Interactive Media
Group. 

Beginning with the first quarter fiscal 2009 financial statements, the Company
is reporting the Disney Interactive Media Group along with certain new business
initiatives as "Interactive Media" for segment reporting purposes. Previously,
Disney Interactive Studios and the Walt Disney Internet Group were reported in
the Consumer Products and Media Networks segments, respectively, while the new
business initiatives were reported in corporate and unallocated shared expenses.
The new presentation aligns with how management reports and measures segment
performance for internal management purposes. 

On February 3, 2008, the Company filed on Form 8-K its amended Annual Report for
the year ended September 27, 2008 to reflect the Interactive Media Group as a
segment. The operating results for fiscal 2008 and 2007 as adjusted to reflect
the Interactive Media Group as a segment along with management`s discussion and
analysis of results of operations for the Interactive Media Group from that
filing follow.

fiscal years 2008 and 2007 adjusted to reflect the Interactive Media Group as a

Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations for Fiscal Year
2008 compared to Fiscal Year 2007 for Interactive Media is as follows:

Revenues

Interactive Media revenues increased 47%, or $229 million, to $719 million
primarily due to increases of $160 million at Disney Interactive Studios and $71
million at Disney Online. 

The increase at Disney Interactive Studios was primarily due to the performance
of new High School Musical, Hannah Montana and Turok self-published video games
in fiscal 2008 compared to Pirates of the Caribbean, Spectrobes and Meet the
Robinsons games in fiscal 2007. The increase at Disney Online reflected higher
virtual world subscription revenue due to a full period of Club Penguin, which
was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. 

Costs and Expenses

Costs and expenses, which consist primarily of video game and internet content
development costs, product costs, distribution and marketing expenses, general
and administrative costs, and technology infrastructure costs, increased 25%, or
$193 million, to $974 million driven by increases at Disney Interactive Studios
and Disney Online, partially offset by lower costs related to mobile phone
services as a result of the shut down of the domestic business in the first
quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase at Disney Interactive Studios reflected
higher product, distribution and marketing costs associated with volume growth
and increased investment in video game development. At Disney Online the
increase was driven by higher development and marketing costs related to the
Disney.com website and virtual worlds, including the impact of a full year of
Club Penguin, and the Family.com website. 

Segment Operating Loss

Segment operating loss decreased 11%, or $33 million, to $258 million driven by
reduced costs of mobile phone service activities, partially offset by lower
results at Disney Online. 

The following tables present reconciliations of income from continuing
operations before income tax and minority interest originally reported to income
from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest for fiscal
years 2008 and 2007 (quarterly and full year) adjusted to reflect the new
presentation.

&lt;p&gt;SOUTHLAKE, Texas--(Business Wire)--
GetThere(R), a leading online business travel procurement solution, today
announced a new booking-expense management offering that will integrate IBM`s
Global Expense Reporting Solutions (GERS). The new offering marks IBM`s first
technology integration with an online corporate travel provider, delivering a
comprehensive travel and expense management solution to global corporations and
travel management companies. 

The new GetThere offering provides benefits to corporate travel programs that
include:

* Industrial-strength tools that allow for an aggressive approach to managing
travel spend, a timely item as companies wring the most from travel budgets in a
recessionary economy; 
* Usability-tested interfaces on both the travel and expense elements that drive
productivity savings through increased adoption; 
* Increased visibility into "booked" versus "actually-spent" data, letting
corporations track and trend critical items, including reports of cancelled
trips, hotel properties honoring negotiated rates, ancillary fees charged by
airlines, etc.; 
* An impressive global service infrastructure that supports the complex travel
and expense tracking and integration issues faced by companies as they grow
their businesses in all corners of the world; and 
* Realistic per-PNR pricing that keeps administrative costs to a minimum.

The new solution is not solely for corporations with direct relationships with
GetThere and IBM. Travel management companies that are GetThere resellers can
benefit by now being able to offer a complete travel and expense solution that
facilitates an end-to-end travel procurement partnership with clients. 

IBM GERS is part of IBM Managed Business Process Services (MBPS), a unit that
automates and standardizes core business processes for clients in areas such as
human resources, accounting, mortgage origination and expense reporting. IBM
GERS is deployed in over 60 countries and processes more than 20 million expense
reports annually. Clients using IBM GERS can increase the process efficiency and
cost effectiveness of their overall travel expense management. 

More than 3,000 companies worldwide use GetThere, including more than half of
the Fortune 200 that uses an online booking solution. GetThere, a Sabre Travel
Network business, facilitates the booking of more than 10 million online
business trips annually. 

"The GetThere-IBM integration equips corporations big and small with a deeper
level of travel efficiency and data mining capabilities," said Peter Klebanow,
chairman and CEO of New York-based Ultramar Travel Management and a leading
GetThere reseller and GERS proponent. "Today`s challenging economic climate has
travel managers and procurement departments under the gun to capture data and
provide actionable reports. Companies working with proven entities like GetThere
and IBM, with their commitment to service and continuous refinement of travel
technology, have an excellent toolkit to drive maximum value from their travel
budget." 

"Our new GetThere relationship represents a milestone as we actively broaden our
GERS marketing and sales efforts in the business travel arena," said Raymond
Curatolo, director of GERS for IBM. "GetThere`s status as a proven innovator and
its roster of longtime multi-national clients and reseller agencies, many of
which we jointly serve today, provides a superior foundation for IBM as we
expand our service options for mid-size and large managed programs." 

"We continue to expand the range of proven technologies surrounding our total
travel procurement solution," said Chris Kroeger, president of GetThere. "With
this announcement, our expense management capabilities will have an unmatched
range of configurable options for corporations and their travel programs. We`re
excited to work closely with IBM as they enhance their commitment to the
business travel marketplace." 

Raymond Curatolo from IBM and Suzanne Neufang, GetThere`s vice president of
corporate market strategy and solutions, will speak about the new GetThere-IBM
offering at Ultramar Travel`s 8th Annual Business Travel Forum in New York on

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, weighing in on the firestorm over bonuses paid by banks who got taxpayer bailouts, defended paying staff for tough jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many executives, including Dimon, whose bank has taken $25 billion from the U.S. government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), have said they will not seek a bonus for 2008 after the credit crisis that began more than a year ago spiraled into a global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are banks to blame? Well, of course," said Dimon, but he warned against just blaming banks and bankers for the crisis, noting that other players in financial markets, including U.S. consumers, had borrowed more than they held in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon told delegates at a conference that if there is a tough job to do at a company, a manager wants to know he can persuade his best person to do that job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the theoretical tough job as "Vietnam," Dimon said he would want to support the person handling the role and be able to recognize that they have a difficult job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of TARP recipient banks providing bonuses to executives has irritated many key members of the Democratically-controlled Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank said that while he thought lawmakers were unable to completely ban such bonuses, legislation instead might address it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Democrat told reporters in Washington on Tuesday that a consensus was forming to hand the Federal Reserve the power to regulate systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As part of the systemic risk regulation you have to include executive compensation because executive compensation ... gives incentives to take excessive risk," said Frank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said any investigation into executive pay should take different situations into account, rather than tarring all bankers with the same brush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon also noted that JPMorgan, along with other banks, paid most of its compensation to executives in stock and these executives have already seen their net worth plummet as the banks' share prices have fallen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank index .BKX fell more than 50 percent in 2008, while JPMorgan's shares slid 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon in December joined a raft of bank executives including Citigroup Inc's Chief Executive Vikram Pandit and Morgan Stanley's Chief Executive John Mack in saying that he will not seek a bonus for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And executives at banks that received funds under the TARP agreed to follow rules limiting executive pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in JPMorgan are down 20 percent so far this year and were down 5.2 percent to $23.90 in early Tuesday afternoon trading from Monday's close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay in New York and John Poirier in Washington; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, weighing in on the firestorm over
bonuses paid by banks who got taxpayer bailouts, defended
paying staff for tough jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many executives, including Dimon, whose bank has taken $25
billion from the U.S. government's Troubled Asset Relief
Program (TARP), have said they will not seek a bonus for 2008
after the credit crisis that began more than a year ago
spiraled into a global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Are banks to blame? Well, of course," said Dimon, but he
warned against just blaming banks and bankers for the crisis,
noting that other players in financial markets, including U.S.
consumers, had borrowed more than they held in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon told delegates at a conference that if there is a
tough job to do at a company, a manager wants to know he can
persuade his best person to do that job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Referring to the theoretical tough job as "Vietnam," Dimon
said he would want to support the person handling the role and
be able to recognize that they have a difficult job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The issue of TARP recipient banks providing bonuses to
executives has irritated many key members of the
Democratically-controlled Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank
said that while he thought lawmakers were unable to completely
ban such bonuses, legislation instead might address it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Massachusetts Democrat told reporters in Washington on
Tuesday that a consensus was forming to hand the Federal
Reserve the power to regulate systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As part of the systemic risk regulation you have to
include executive compensation because executive compensation
... gives incentives to take excessive risk," said Frank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said any investigation into executive pay should take
different situations into account, rather than tarring all
bankers with the same brush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon also noted that JPMorgan, along with other banks,
paid most of its compensation to executives in stock and these
executives have already seen their net worth plummet as the
banks' share prices have fallen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The KBW Bank index .BKX fell more than 50 percent in
2008, while JPMorgan's shares slid 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon in December joined a raft of bank executives
including Citigroup Inc's Chief Executive Vikram Pandit and
Morgan Stanley's Chief Executive John Mack in saying that he
will not seek a bonus for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And executives at banks that received funds under the TARP
agreed to follow rules limiting executive pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in JPMorgan are down 20 percent so far this year and
were down 5.2 percent to $23.90 in early Tuesday afternoon
trading from Monday's close.

About NetQoS Unified Communications Monitor

NetQoS Unified Communications Monitor is a network-based monitoring product that
tracks the voice and video quality users experience, provides alerts on call
performance problems, and isolates performance issues to speed troubleshooting
and mean time to repair. The product enables network engineers and IP telephony
management to assess the performance of their Cisco Unified Communications
Manager (CallManager) IP PBX and Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007
environments by tracking, evaluating, and reporting on key metrics without
deploying server agents or probes. For every call, Unified Communications
Monitor reports on user call quality and the underlying network performance
metrics associated with it. Unified Communications Monitor also breaks out
performance data from the IP and PSTN legs of calls that pass through voice
gateways traveling to endpoints in the PSTN. This data lets IT organizations
know if the network is responsible for less-than-optimal call quality.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, weighing in on the firestorm over
bonuses paid by banks who got taxpayer bailouts, defended
paying staff for tough jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Many executives, including Dimon, whose bank has taken $25
billion from the U.S. government's Troubled Asset Relief
Program (TARP), have said they will not seek a bonus for 2008
after the credit crisis that began more than a year ago
spiraled into a global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Are banks to blame? Well, of course," said Dimon, but he
warned against just blaming banks and bankers, noting that
other players in financial markets, including U.S. consumers,
had borrowed more than they held in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon told delegates at a conference that if there is a
tough job to do at a company, a manager wants to know he can
persuade his best person to do that job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Referring to the theoretical tough job as "Vietnam," Dimon
said he would want to support the person handling the role and
be able to recognize that they have a difficult job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said any investigation into executive pay should take
different situations into account, rather than tarring all
bankers with the same brush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon also noted that JPMorgan, along with other banks,
paid most of its compensation to executives in stock and these
executives have already seen their net worth plummet as the
banks' share prices have fallen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The KBW Bank index .BKX fell more than 50 percent in
2008, while JPMorgan's shares slid 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon in December joined a raft of bank executives
including Citigroup Inc's Chief Executive Vikram Pandit and
Morgan Stanley's Chief Executive John Mack in saying that he
will not seek a bonus for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And executives at banks that received funds under the TARP
agreed to follow rules limiting executive pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in JPMorgan are down 20 percent so far this year and
were down 4.6 percent to $24.04 in late Tuesday morning trading
from Monday's close.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background, updates stock movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO Feb 3 (Reuters) - Shares of Mega Brands Inc
MB.TO more than doubled on Tuesday after the toymaker said it
had signed a global licensing agreement with Microsoft Game
Studios (MSFT.O) to make construction toys for its Halo Wars
video game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Montreal-based company's shares soared 123.1 percent to
87 Canadian cents by late morning on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal will see Mega Brands develop construction toy sets
based on the characters and vehicles of Halo Wars, an action
strategy video game set in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial terms of the deal were not announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The video game is set to hit stores shortly, with the Mega
Brands products available beginning in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the huge bump in the share price on Wednesday, Mega
Brand stock is down almost 90 percent in the past year, after
being battered by a toy recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Definitely the last couple of years have been very tough
for us, between recalls and the world economy, but this signals
that we are turning the corner...," said company spokesman
Harold Chizick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have all the ingredients to say 2009 is a turnaround
year for Mega."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The maker of construction toys, games and puzzles, arts and
crafts, and stationery products, is still recovering from a
recall of its Magnetix toys, which began in 2006 and expanded
in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One child was killed and 27 others were seriously injured
after swallowing small, powerful magnets that came loose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The magnetic toys were acquired as part of Mega Brands'
2005 takeover of Rose Art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March 2008, the company announced two separate recalls
after reports of magnets coming loose from several toys
manufactured in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company decided to downsize operations in the former
Rose Art manufacturing facility in China and outsource
production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.24 Canadian)

trained directly by Microsoft and obtain deeper product knowledge, helping them
implement better solutions. 

Participating Partners and customers enjoy benefits such as direct access to
Microsoft domain experts, early product education, and an opportunity to
influence the product through their feedback. 

"Being part of TAP has allowed us to work closely with the Microsoft development
team prior to the final release, helping Microsoft improve the overall quality
and usability of the product and helping us bring the first customer in the
world live on the product," said Tommy Madsen, partner and co-founder of
ArcherPoint. "The process has been beneficial not only to Microsoft,
ArcherPoint, and Exhausto, but also to the future users of Microsoft Dynamics
NAV 2009." 

Taking advantage of the benefits of TAP, ArcherPoint implemented Microsoft
Dynamics NAV 2009 and integrated it with Exhausto`s critical business systems.
The implementation also included integrating with Microsoft Dynamics CRM and an
upgraded version of the company`s proprietary FanCalc application. 

Additionally, ArcherPoint worked closely with Lanham Associates to upgrade and
test on Dynamics NAV 2009 the latest release of their E-Ship Product, a
Certified for Microsoft Dynamics NAV add-on shipping solution, and their
Advanced Forecasting &amp; Procurement solution, both built within Microsoft
Dynamics NAV. 

"The enhancements in Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 will make it easier for us to
provide reliable remote system access to employees worldwide, enabling us to
pursue growth with more confidence," said Steen Hagensen, president of Exhausto.
"Equally exciting, however, was our participation in the Microsoft Technology
Adaption Program. Having the opportunity to be involved with a new product at so
early a stage was an unforgettable and beneficial experience for our company." 

For Exhausto, one of the key enhancements to Microsoft Dynamics NAV is increased
support for connecting critical business systems. The tight integration between
the company`s proprietary FanCalc application and Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009
made it possible to fully automate the conversion of bills of materials into
sales orders. 

Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 delivers value-added technical advancements and
integration with other Microsoft technology, lowering the cost of ownership and
providing a greater return on investment. Customers can take advantage of new
Web services offerings that make data and business logic within Microsoft
Dynamics NAV 2009 available to other applications greatly simplifying
integration with external applications.

&lt;p&gt;This groundbreaking solution for manufacturing enables real-time, evidence-based
decision making to support production and operations improvement
VERNON HILLS, Ill.--(Business Wire)--
Mitsubishi Electric Automation, Inc., a premier industrial automation company,
will introduce its new MES Interface IT appliance at the PULSE 2009 Conference
in Las Vegas. This new product enables low risk integration of real-time plant
floor information to upper level computing applications, such as Manufacturing
Execution Systems (MES). The product is the result of collaboration between
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and IBM. 

The new MES Interface IT is the next step in the Mitsubishi Electric e-F@ctory
Initiative - the corporation`s vision for a unified enterprise achieved through
improved business visibility of manufacturing and processing operations. To make
this vision a reality, Mitsubishi Electric works with strategic partners to
incorporate best-in-class solutions into the e-F@ctory architecture. Two of
these solutions are IBM Maximo and the IBM Manufacturing Information Framework. 

"A key challenge to the adoption of direct factory connectivity has been the
complexity and cost of integration between the manufacturing floor and business
systems, which tend to structure and operate quite differently," said Trayton
Jay, Mitsubishi Electric Automation e-F@ctory manager. "Our new e-F@ctory
product addresses this issue by simplifying the connectivity across a wide range
of production assets and abstracting this equipment to the level of a service in
the business SOA infrastructure. In essence the MES Interface IT enables factory
equipment to speak SOA." 

The Mitsubishi Electric e-F@ctory solution offers a number of advantages over
traditional manufacturing data integration methodologies. MES Interface IT
requires much less integration effort at both the factory and IT levels, which
reduces implementation time and risk. The solution improves security and
standardization and fosters more productive collaboration between factory and IT
resources. MES Interface IT is designed to handle the high level of data
processing and interaction necessary to cover both present and future needs.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds link to bank's move back towards cyclicals; details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Feb 3 (Reuters) - J.P.Morgan downgraded the European
telecoms sector to "neutral" from "overweight" on Tuesday,
saying that although it still believed in the resilience of the
sector it was slowly moving back into more cyclical stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is important to emphasise that our strategists' call is
motivated by a positive call on other cyclicals, not by concerns
over the value or resilience of the European telecoms sector,"
the bank's analysts wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said it was encouraged to return to other cyclicals
by an expected slowdown in the rate of economic deterioration, a
stabilising credit backdrop, aggressive fiscal and monetary
policy action and a steepening yield curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While there is risk that telecoms sector revenues could fall
short of expectations due to the depth of the downturn, other
generic risk drivers, such as mergers and acquisitions or
regulations, had improved, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They added that current market circumstances offered
opportunities for operators to protect free cash flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vodafone (VOD.L) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) offer the
best value of the large caps, in the analysts' view, and they
also recommended KPN (KPN.AS), OTE (OTEr.AT), Telekom Austria
(TELA.VI), Bouygues (BOUY.PA) and the satellite/cable subsector.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Feb 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has tailored its human capital
management consulting services for the mid-market by teaming with Lawson
Software to help smaller companies meet their unique challenges in
maximizing employee potential.

    Effective people management is critical in today's economic climate, as a

employees much more effectively and efficiently than ever before," said
Tim Ringo, global vice president, Human Capital Management, IBM. "In
today's climate, where it is essential to do more with less, this
delivery model is the cornerstone of creating an organization that is as
lean and productive as possible."

    IBM's Mid-Market Workforce Effectiveness service offers the advantages of
smart human resource management services which previously have been
available to large global companies. IBM is harnessing years of experience
gained from improving HR service delivery within large global enterprises
now for the benefit of smaller companies' bottom line.

&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GA, Feb 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today it is the first vendor to commit to
monthly testing to measure the security effectiveness across its entire
product portfolio. The testing will be conducted by NSS Labs, a leading
global independent testing lab that focuses on security product testing
and certification. At the same time, IBM Internet Security Systems (ISS)
is announcing results from its latest NSS Labs Security Update Monitor
(SUM) report from December that showed 100 percent protection against
tested exploits.

    IBM ISS began measuring the effectiveness of its security products in 2002
to ensure its strong research and development arm was keeping up with the
ever evolving threat landscape. In late 2008 the company chose to test its
entire portfolio of products, from its unified threat management tool to
host and network security, for third-party validation across its product
portfolio. In addition to security effectiveness testing, IBM ISS
submitted the IBM ISS Proventia Server for Windows 2.0 and the Proventia
Multifunction Gateway products for PCI suitability testing to verify the
presence of functionality required by the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS).

    "Because cybercrime evolves at such a fast pace, security tools and
companies must constantly prove their effectiveness," said Rick Moy,
President of NSS Labs. "The IBM GX6116 Network IPS product showed 100
percent accuracy in protecting against the latest threats selected by NSS
in December 2008, up from 96% in November. IBM has set the bar incredibly
high. Together, IBM and NSS Labs encourage the rest of the industry to
monthly test their entire product portfolios and use this healthy
competition to drive even greater innovation."

    The December SUM report was based on testing of IBM ISS' Proventia Network
IPS security product against the current set of threats. NSS Labs used a
range of threats against the most common applications and operating
systems spanning as far back as four years to reflect some of the most
current attacks as well as older threats which are still prevalent. The
full SUM report can be found at:
http://nsslabs.com/IPS-SUM/ibm-iss-proventia-nips-gx6116-2008-december.html

    In addition to IBM ISS' significant SUM results, in April 2008, NSS Labs
validated the comprehensive PCI DSS functionality support in both the
Proventia Multifunction Gateway and Proventia Server for Windows 2.0. And
late last year NSS Labs also tested IBM ISS Proventia Server for Windows
2.0 which was found to detect and block 98.5 percent of all attacker
initiated exploits.

    The combination of these tests shows a commitment to increase the security
for each of the IBM ISS products as well as ensuring that the proper
features are in place to help customers demonstrate security compliance.

    "Monthly testing isn't only a call to the industry to raise the bar, but a
commitment to our customers to keep reducing the cost and complexity of
security," said Greg Adams, director of product and services management at
IBM ISS. "Everything we do is intended to ease the lives of our customers
and this is one more step in taking the burden off of their shoulders."

    IBM is the world's leading provider of risk and security solutions.
Clients around the world work with IBM to help reduce the complexities of
security and strategically manage risk. IBM's experience and range of
risk and security solutions are unsurpassed -- from dedicated research,
software, hardware, services and global Business Partner value -- helping
clients secure business operations and implement company-wide, integrated
risk management programs.

industry. Our proven methodologies reflect real-world traffic and usage
conditions, helping information security professionals understand how

J.P. Morgan today announced that it has been selected by the Federal Reserve to
serve as custodian for its program to purchase mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
The program, which began on January 5, 2009, will purchase up to $500 billion in
MBS that are backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. The goal of the
program, which was originally announced on November 25, 2008, is to provide
support to mortgage and housing markets and to foster improved conditions in
financial markets more generally. 

Via a competitive process, the Federal Reserve selected four investment managers
- BlackRock Financial Management, Inc., Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P.,
Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (PIMCO), and Wellington Management
Company, LLP - and a custodian - J.P. Morgan - to implement the program. The
selection criteria were based on each institution`s operational capacity, size
and overall experience in the MBS market. 

"We are proud to have been selected by the Federal Reserve for this important
initiative," said Conrad Kozak, CEO of J.P. Morgan Worldwide Securities
Services. "We are pleased to be able to support the efficient operation of the

&lt;p&gt;BeyondTrust Analysis of All 2008 Microsoft Security Bulletins Finds Vast
Majority of Vulnerabilities can be Diminished by Configuring End Users as
Standard Users
PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(Business Wire)--
BeyondTrust Corporation, the first provider of Least Privilege Management
solutions, today published research findings stating that the removal of
administrator rights from Windows users is a mitigating factor for the vast
majority of all Microsoft software vulnerabilities reported by Microsoft in
2008. The results demonstrate that by configuring users as standard users,
companies can better protect themselves against malware and zero-day threats.
Complete findings and methodology can be found online in a new report, titled
"Reducing the Threat from Microsoft Vulnerabilities." 

BeyondTrust`s findings show that among the 2008 Microsoft vulnerabilities given
a "critical" severity rating, 92 percent shared the same best practice advice
from Microsoft to mitigate the vulnerability: "Users whose accounts are
configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than
users who operate with administrative user rights." This language, found in the
"Mitigating Factors" portion of Microsoft`s security bulletins, also appears as
a recommendation for reducing the threat from nearly 70 percent of all
vulnerabilities reported in 2008. 

Other key findings from BeyondTrust`s report show that removing administrator
rights will better protect companies against the exploitation of:

* 94 percent of Microsoft Office vulnerabilities reported in 2008 
* 89 percent of Internet Explorer vulnerabilities reported in 2008 
* 53 percent of Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities reported in 2008.

Further illustrating the benefits to enterprises of removing administrator
rights from users, a recent Gartner report states: "The Gartner TCO model shows
a significant reduction in TCO between a managed desktop where the user is an
administrator, compared with a desktop where the user is a standard user. Among
the most remarkable observations is that the model shows a 24 percent decrease
in the amount of IT labor needed for technical support." Gartner, Inc.,
"Organizations That Unlock PCs Unnecessarily Will Face High Costs," Michael A.
Silver, Ronni J. Colville, Dec.19, 2008. 

"Companies face imminent danger from zero-day threats as new vulnerabilities
continually crop up while patching efforts lag behind, and even worse, many
threats exist undetected," said John Moyer, CEO of BeyondTrust. "Our findings
reflect the critical role that restricting administrator rights plays in
protecting against these types of threats. This is achievable in one simple
step-adopting a strategy of Least Privilege security. BeyondTrust has helped
over 500 companies equip their end users with those privileges needed to do
their jobs, while protecting against zero-day threats and reducing risk."

About BeyondTrust

BeyondTrust Corporation, a pioneer in Least Privilege Management, enables
enterprises to move beyond the need to trust users with excess privileges or
administrator rights. BeyondTrust Privilege Manager was the first product to
enable the security best practice of Least Privilege in Windows environments by
allowing administrators to assign end-users permissions for required or selected
applications. With Privilege Manager organizations can remove administrator
rights and still allow end-users to run all required Windows applications,
processes and ActiveX controls. By eliminating the need to grant administrator
rights to end-users, IT departments can create a more secure, compliant and

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Seven months after IBM delivered the world's fastest supercomputer, it has announced an even speedier one with the computing power of 2 million laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM said on Tuesday it is developing the technology for its new Sequoia computer, with delivery scheduled in 2011 to the Department of Energy for use at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequoia will chug along at 20 petaflops per second and is one order of magnitude quicker than its predecessor. The earlier machine, delivered in June to the Energy Department, broke the 1 petaflop barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peta is a term for quadrillion and FLOP stands for floating point operations per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequoia, and a smaller computer called Dawn, are being built in Rochester, Minnesota, for use in simulating nuclear tests. IBM says they can also be used for complex tasks like weather forecasting or oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM says Sequoia will be highly energy-efficient for the job it does but even so will occupy 96 refrigerator-sized racks in an area the size of a big house -- 3,422 square feet (318 square meters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Lawsky, Editing by Sandra Maler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unique webinar demonstrates how mainframe businesses can succeed in today`s
tough economic environment
BEND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Alchemy Solutions, Inc., (www.alchemysolutions.com) provider of legacy
modernization solutions for Microsoft`s .NET Framework, in association with
Microsoft will offer a unique opportunity to hear how Crystal Cruises
successfully moved from their legacy mainframe to a modern .NET environment. The
webinar will be held on 12th February at 8:00 am Pacific, see below for
registration details. 

In this webinar, titled "Exploring a Successful Modernization Project from
Mainframe to .NET", Boban Dragojilovic, vice president of computer services at
Crystal Cruises, provides a white-board-aided explanation of their migration
process, including the resulting architecture and modernization benefits of the
Crystal Cruises move to .NET from the mainframe. Scott Rosenbloom, legacy
modernization manager, Microsoft Corporation, will set the scene with an
overview of the opportunities provided by this type of legacy modernization
solution. 

Crystal Cruises, a luxury cruise line, operated its ships with aging IBM 3090
mainframes that were tough to integrate with other systems, expensive, slow to
operate - and about to fall out of service. Recognizing the opportunity to
modernize while also avoiding an expensive upgrade, Crystal Cruises chose to
port its custom code to a Microsoft ASP.NET solution using Alchemy Solutions
tools. This move was accomplished for about one fifth of the price of the
mainframe upgrade. Modernized applications now easily integrate with
off-the-shelf products and Crystal Cruise employees are enjoying the benefits of
modern tools such as graphical data views and navigation. Additionally, the new
solution provided dramatic performance improvements. In one example, a process
that used to take an hour now completes in 90 seconds enabling the adoption of
more effective business processes. 

"The case for moving mainframe applications to .NET has never been stronger.
With the current state of the economy, this option demands serious consideration
as it can provide better performance and future prospects while saving
organizations money," comments Ron Langer. "Boban Dragojilovic at Crystal
Cruises managed the move for their applications and has some great information
and experiences to share. We are sure that both IT and business executives will
find this webinar informative and time well spent." 

Crystal Cruises used the Neo family of products from Alchemy Solutions
including:

* NeoKicks - bringing CICS applications to the .NET world in a simple,
stream-lined fashion that web-enables the screens, provides .NET scalability and
positions the applications to take full advantage of the .NET Framework. 
* NeoBatch - migrating batch JCL to Windows. 
* NetCOBOL - providing the foundation of runtime-free, rock-steady reliable,
compilation and execution of COBOL programs.

&lt;p&gt;Integration Promotes Preemptive Approach to Application Security for Open Source
Code
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Palamida, a leader in application security for open source, today announced its
Palamida Enterprise Edition solution has received IBM`s "Ready for IBM Rational
Software" validation. This solution will facilitate open source security
checking earlier in the software development life cycle process. 

Integration between Palamida Enterprise Edition and IBM Rational ClearCase
enables automated code audits, the process of inventorying the open source
software in use and alerting on security vulnerability issues, as part of the
normal application build and release cycle. The integration helps ensure that
security vulnerability and intellectual property issues are exposed early in the
application development cycle when remediation is simpler and less costly. 

Increased attacks against software and Web applications require securing the
software supply chain for applications. Palamida has found that applications
built in recent years typically contain 50 percent or more open source code,
most of which is not being tracked. Organizations now need to ensure they
understand the composition of their in-house applications including such aspects
as what third-party code is in use, where it came from, and what vulnerabilities
are associated with it. Organizations that are unaware of exactly what comprises
their code base are open to data breaches, legal issues, and financial exposure.


"Open source is helping organizations deliver high-quality, more capable Web and
software applications in less time, with fewer resources, but it is frequently
used informally, without a clear approval or review process," said Mark
Tolliver, Palamida CEO. "The integration with IBM Rational ClearCase helps
organizations take advantage of open source by broadening their use of it, while
ensuring application integrity." 

Integration with IBM Rational ClearCase provides mutual customers the following
benefits:

* A new level of security functionality for increased return on investment in
using IBM Rational tools and services. 
* Complementary application security solution to IBM`s existing security
software such as IBM Rational AppScan, which enables scanning and testing of
application source code. With the new integration, joint customers now have a
solution for software composition analysis, which addresses open source
vulnerabilities including those in binary form. 
* A reliable framework within the development cycle for security and IP
stakeholders to collaborate in the approval, analysis, and remediation of
security and IP issues utilizing alerts of violations against established
policies, and maintain a record of the decisions for remediation.

IBM has been a leader in supporting and promoting open source software. An
important aspect of pervasive open source use today is the management and
security of it within mission critical applications. The Palamida Enterprise
Edition enables organizations to create a comprehensive inventory of open source
in use and then identifies issues of intellectual property violations and known
and published security vulnerabilities. The software sends online vulnerability
alerts as information is updated in the National Vulnerability Database and the
Palamida R lab. It also enables organizations to annotate and tag all files
and directories to create a permanent record of the software composition of
applications, minimizing the security void arising from undocumented code. The
latest 6.1 terabyte Palamida data library is also included along with 29,000
open source releases with vulnerability alerts. 

About Palamida

Palamida provides the industry`s first application security solution exclusively
for open source software. The Palamida Enterprise Edition uses component-level
analysis to quickly identify and track undocumented code and associated security
vulnerabilities, as well as intellectual property and compliance issues. Using
Palamida, organizations can cost-effectively manage and secure mission critical
Web and software applications. Customers include Avaya, Cisco Systems, EMC,
Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems, among others.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Feb 3 (Reuters) - Seven months after IBM
(IBM.N) delivered the world's fastest supercomputer, it has
announced an even speedier one with the computing power of 2
million laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; IBM said on Tuesday it is developing the technology for its
new Sequoia computer, with delivery scheduled in 2011 to the
Department of Energy for use at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sequoia will chug along at 20 petaflops per second and is
one order of magnitude quicker than its predecessor. The
earlier machine, delivered in June to the Energy Department,
broke the 1 petaflop barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peta is a term for quadrillion and FLOP stands for floating
point operations per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sequoia, and a smaller computer called Dawn, are being
built in Rochester, Minnesota, for use in simulating nuclear
tests. IBM says they can also be used for complex tasks like
weather forecasting or oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM says Sequoia will be highly energy-efficient for the
job it does but even so will occupy 96 refigerator-sized racks
in an area the size of a big house -- 3,422 square feet (318
square metres).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Lawsky, Editing by Sandra Maler)

&lt;p&gt; SINGAPORE, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) raised its forecast for the price of gold XAU= to
reach $1,000 an ounce in the next three months from its
previous forecast of $700 due to rising investor demand for
safe haven assets.

 "The gold price rally has been driven by surging demand for
gold in all forms: physical gold, exchange-traded funds (ETFs),
and futures contracts as investors seek 'a safe store of value'
amid the financial distress and inflation risks," it said in a
report.

 It also noted that a strong relationship betwween the price
of gold in U.S. dollars and the exchange rate of the dollar

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Feb 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new capabilities designed to address the
security and compliance concerns of businesses creating dynamic and
interactive Web sites. As companies infuse more Web 2.0 content into
their global, online presence, they are seeing an increased risk of
security vulnerabilities. Using IBM Rational AppScan, companies can now
test Web 2.0-based applications to identify security vulnerabilities on a
frequent basis, helping to make the Web experiences they provide to
customers more secure from hackers. The new features also enhance
customers' abilities to address regulatory mandates and meet business
policies.

    Helping to Secure Online Businesses from Web 2.0 and SOA Vulnerabilities

    According to the newly released 2008 IBM X-Force Trend Report, Web
applications remain the Achilles heel for the security industry. In fact,
more than half of all vulnerabilities disclosed in 2008 were Web
application based. Many of these vulnerabilities can be prevented or
avoided by taking a preemptive approach to security.

    Despite these shortcomings, companies increasingly rely on their Web
presence to serve as the face of their business, drive collaboration and
community-building, and generate new opportunities in today's global
economy. To remain competitive, organizations are using a new set of Web
2.0 capabilities, derived from technologies such as the Adobe(R) Flash(R)
platform, or Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), to create interactive
and graphically rich Web sites. However, due to the dynamic and changing
nature of these technologies, companies are facing new challenges for
meeting the compliance and security needs of their online businesses.

    Hackers and other cyber criminals target Web 2.0 technologies because of
their prevalence across the Web. With IBM Rational AppScan Standard
Edition 7.8, IBM is introducing new functionalities that enable companies
to scan and test rich, Flash-based Web content and applications for
security defects before the content is deployed. This new software can
also scan Web sites built with Ajax technology.

    "The use of Adobe Flash Platform technologies in the enterprise is
increasing, and software such as IBM Rational AppScan can help content
creators take a preemptive approach to security," said Brad Arkin,
director, Adobe Secure Software Engineering Team at Adobe. "By scanning
and testing code for potential issues in the early development stages,
companies can help prevent security and compliance problems before they
ever happen."

    For companies that are concerned that their Web services will face the
same vulnerabilities as their Web applications, the new version of IBM
Rational AppScan now also supports complex Service Oriented Architecture
(SOA) applications. This new technology from IBM provides organizations
with the ability to scan their critical Web services, representing a
significant step forward in the testing support available for SOA
environments.

    Managing the Ongoing Risk of Compliance and Security

    IBM today also announced new risk assessment capabilities in this new
version of IBM Rational AppScan. The new features help customers better
understand where security vulnerabilities are located and suggest an
action plan to minimize further risk. According to IBM research, 80% of
users' time is spent on managing the results of security scans.* Even
after an issue is identified, users might have trouble understanding the
issue, validating whether it really exists, determining how severe it is,
and communicating it to other teams who can help fix the problem. With
IBM Rational AppScan, customers will save valuable time and money by
receiving results that are communicated in a common language that
non-security experts understand.

    Through new production monitoring capabilities delivered with IBM's
Rational AppScan OnDemand offering, users can also catch and be alerted to
vulnerabilities, making it easier and quicker to repair flaws and remain
compliant. This is especially critical for organizations that make
frequent changes to their Web site, and that have an increased need to
scan for security vulnerabilities on a regular basis. For instance, a
large company that updates its Web site every 15 minutes can now
automatically scan their online application four times per hour (i.e. 96
times per day), helping to creating a safer online experience for its
customers.

    Additionally, security alerts can be sent to mobile devices as they occur,
allowing customers to quickly fix vulnerabilities. Previously, security
experts would only test applications before they went into production,
which would not address the further risks posed after deployment. Today,
speed and responsiveness are crucial when dealing with dynamic
applications, given the time and money that organizations can lose due to
failing to meet compliance mandates or exposing their customers' data to
hackers. With IBM Rational AppScan OnDemand, customers now can have
confidence that they can continuously act to protect their Web sites and
manage compliance risks.

    Addressing Security and Compliance throughout the Lifecycle

    Customers can also lower costs by implementing security testing throughout
the entire software delivery lifecycle, from development through the
post-production phase. Bug-ridden, poor quality software costs businesses
billions of dollars annually** and the cost of identifying and repairing a
software defect in a product that is already being used by consumers can
cost upwards of $16,000*** for each defect. By integrating IBM Rational
AppScan Tester Edition into the recently released IBM Rational Quality
Manager, teams can build security and compliance testing into the
software development and delivery process, avoiding many problems that can
be extremely costly to fix at a later point in the software delivery
lifecycle.

    "We're witnessing a trend with governments mandating that organizations
deliver software built with security-tested code. Clearly, application
security is moving towards being a compliance requirement, not just a best
practice," said Dr. Daniel Sabbah, general manager, IBM Rational Software.
"It's more crucial than ever for customers to treat security and
compliance as a top priority. By offering customers the ability to infuse
continuous security testing into their Web 2.0 and SOA application
development, IBM can help them reduce cost, manage risk and provide

"very tough" years for a U.S. economy that shrank at its
fastest pace since 1982 in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. economy shrank by a 3.8 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter, government data showed last week, sinking
deeper into a recession that the White House said demanded
urgent action. [ID:nN30348995]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sharp drop followed a 0.5 percent pace of decline in
the third quarter. Those were the first back-to-back quarterly

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, Feb 04 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge announced that the California Air Resources
Board (ARB) and the Government of Canada have signed-on as Diamond
Sponsors for the EcoCAR Challenge. The new sponsors enable EcoCAR to
strengthen its public and private partnerships in support of the next
generation of engineers competing to improve fuel efficiency and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

    The EcoCAR competition, along with its headline sponsors General Motors
(GM) and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), challenges 17 universities
across the U.S. and Canada to redesign and reengineer the 2009 Saturn VUE
to further minimize energy consumption and reduce emissions. A joint
effort among academic, government and industry partners, EcoCAR seeks to
inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers by giving them
the tools and experience necessary to secure a more energy-efficient
future.

    "We are pleased to have the California Air Resources Board and the
Government of Canada on board as Diamond Sponsors for EcoCAR," said David
Rodgers, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency at the DOE. "It
is vital that we collaborate across state, federal and international
boundaries to solve our critical energy and environmental challenges."

    The California Air Resources Board is demonstrating a strong commitment
to the EcoCAR competition because, like the challenge participants, the
clean air agency is highly dedicated to reducing vehicle green-house gas
emissions while maintaining a high-level of performance and
functionality. Supporting ARB's mission, students will design and build
the vehicles based on the categories from ARB's zero emissions vehicle
(ZEV) regulations.

    "The EcoCAR competition will produce the automotive industry's next
generation of professionals who have a sincere passion for creating the
environmentally-friendly vehicles of tomorrow," said Mary Nichols, ARB
Chairman. "Together with EcoCAR, we'll pick up the pace in our efforts to
reduce air pollution. Our sponsorship gives us the opportunity to attract
newly-minted, top-notch engineers to join our team and apply their
experience and talent to help create a sustainable transportation future."

    The Government of Canada is also highly involved in the EcoCAR program
and has been a long time supporter of the DOE's advanced vehicle
technology competitions, providing technical and program support for more
than 22 competitions over 18 years. The Government of Canada's
partnership with EcoCAR will strengthen the research and development of
energy-efficient technologies currently underway at Canadian universities
and throughout the Canadian automotive industry.

    "The continued health of our economies and our environment demands
innovative thinking today, especially where vehicle technology is
concerned," said the Honourable Lisa Raitt, Canada's Minister of Natural
Resources. "Our Government is proud to offer its support and
encouragement to the young people who are part of the EcoCAR competition."

    EcoCAR continues to sign on high-level sponsors with a passion for green
innovation, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA
will support the testing and technical evaluation of the EcoCAR vehicles
and provide strategic involvement in the execution of the program.

    Other EcoCAR sponsors include: Platinum Sponsors: A123 Systems, Inc.,
dSPACE, National Instruments, The MathWorks, Freescale Semiconductor, AVL
Powertrain Engineering, Inc., Gold Sponsors: National Science Foundation,
Woodward MotoTron Control Solutions, Vector CANtech, Inc., Robert Bosch,

    About the Air Resources Board

    California's Clean Air Agency

    California's state legislature established the Air Resources Board in
1967 to protect public health, the economy, and the state's ecological
resources through the reduction of air pollution. With the passage of AB
32, the agency must now also develop and implement strategies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. Since its formation, the ARB has successfully
worked with the public, environmental groups, businesses and local and
federal agencies to cooperatively reach our clean air goals. While many
problems persist, California now enjoys the cleanest air in more than 50
years.

    About the Government of Canada

    The Government of Canada, through Natural Resources Canada and Transport
Canada, is supporting research and development of new vehicle

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the bank is keen to avoid restrictions it agreed to after receiving funds from the U.S. government late last year and it is looking to pay the money back as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment bank, which received a $10 billion capital injection from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program in October, is not happy with the strings that came attached to the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compensation restrictions and certain capital requirements were part of the original injection, and extra limitations may be in store after U.S. President Barack Obama imposed tough new rules limiting pay for companies receiving government aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would like to get out from under that," Viniar said, adding that the bank aims to pay back the $10 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said Goldman Sachs is also cautious about buying a bank, a move many have urged upon the investment bank to ensure its access to stable deposit funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks have come under heavy fire for paying executives too much after receiving more than $300 billion of capital from the government and trillions of dollars of additional U.S. support. A report last week said that banks paid out $18.4 billion of bonuses, a fact that Obama called "shameful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman can potentially pay back its $10 billion, and avoid salary caps, by issuing preferred stock rather than common stock, Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs were up $6.13 or 7.4 percent at $88.94 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday afternoon, amid a broader rally in shares of financial companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama said on Wednesday that compensation at TARP recipients would be limited to $500,000 a year, adding that lower compensation is a crucial element of restoring taxpayer trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO BANK ACQUISITIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have pressed Goldman to buy a bank to boost its deposit funding, which is seen as a more reliable way for the investment bank to finance itself amid the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Viniar, speaking at a Credit Suisse Financial Services conference on Wednesday, said Goldman is in no rush to acquire another institution, and will look for other ways to boost its deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't pick up The Wall Street Journal looking for a Goldman Sachs acquisition because I think you will be largely disappointed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a long history of financial services acquisitions that have failed due to the difficulty of integrating different companies' cultures, he said, and this makes Goldman wary of such an acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't expect our form to change," he said, adding, "I expect us to be largely a wholesale company." Wholesale finance companies fund themselves in bond markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by John Wallace and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
This is a revision of a release issued yesterday. It removes information on the
implied GOs from the headline. 

Fitch Ratings assigns an 'A+' rating to City of Fresno Joint Powers Financing
Authority (JPFA), California's approximately $47.7 million lease revenue bonds
(police and fire master lease projects) series 2009A. The bonds will be sold on
or about Feb. 23, 2009. Proceeds from the new issues will fund improvements and
additions to police and fire department facilities. The financing is a standard
lease-leaseback structure, subject to abatement. Leased assets include several
fire stations as well as the new police regional training center being
constructed. The leased assets are essential and their value approximates the
value of the improvements, providing sufficient collateral. 

Fitch also affirms the following ratings: 

--$153.4 million in various Fresno JPFA outstanding lease revenue bonds at 'A+';


--City of Fresno (the city) implied general obligation (GO) bonds at 'AA-'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

The 'A+' rating reflects Fresno's stable financial position, including solid
reserves and moderate debt, as well as the housing-led contracting economy which
will likely result in reduced operating revenues (such as property and sales
taxes) over the next one to two years. Fitch believes the city's reserves,
including the emergency reserve fund, and timely response to the slowing economy
will aid in retaining a sound financial position as revenues weaken. However, if
the economic downturn is more severe or prolonged than anticipated, resulting in
multiple years of assessed valuation (AV) contraction, or if the city reduces
its emergency fund below its 5% of spending policy there may be negative rating
pressure. 

Like much of California, Fresno's economy is experiencing weakness after several
years of very strong gains, largely the result of severe distress in the housing
sector. Mortgage delinquencies (60 days or more) and home foreclosures have
risen rapidly, and construction and financial services employment have been
falling since 2006. However, overall employment increased 1.3% in 2007 before
declining year over year in October 2008 by about 0.3% as most of the losses in
the real estate related sectors were offset by gains in the education and
healthcare and government sectors. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate increased
to a high 10.8% in October 2008 compared to 7.7% a year prior. Meanwhile, the
city's assessed valuation (AV) for fiscal 2009 increased just 1.5% compared to
the previous five year average growth rate of 11.1%. Early indications for
fiscal 2010 are for a decline in AV of up to 5% as the county assessor reduces
AV to market values. The median home price in the Fresno metropolitan
statistical area has declined about 24% since peaking in 2006. 

Fresno's financial operations are well managed with conservative revenue
forecasting and cost control measures contributing to stable year-end results.
The city's general fund has run break-even or operating surpluses for several
years, but declined by a modest $1.5 million in fiscal 2008, bringing the 2008
unreserved fund balance to $30.6 million, a strong 12% of expenditures and
transfers out. Within its unreserved fund, the city has been prudently building
its emergency reserve since 2002, which ended fiscal 2008 with a balance of $16
million, or 6.1% of spending. The emergency reserve can only be used during
times of extreme financial distress or natural disasters; the mayor must make a
declaration which must be approved by city council. Given the economic outlook,
the city added to this amount in fiscal 2008 and has budgeted an addition of $1
million in fiscal 2009 despite budget pressures, in order to keep the fund in
excess of the council-adopted 5% policy. Fitch views these balances as prudent
given the area's economic volatility and the fiscal strain foreseen in the next
few years. 

The city's economic growth has kept the debt burden to moderate levels despite
recent issuances. Direct debt is $1,034 per capita and 1.7% of market value
while overall debt is $2,915 per capita and 4.7% of taxable market value. Future
debt needs appear manageable, with the city working to identify revenue sources
to be used to pay some or all of the future debt service. 

Note: Fitch issued an exposure draft on July 31, 2008 proposing a recalibration
of tax-supported and water/sewer revenue bond ratings which, if adopted, may
result in an upward revision of this rating (see Fitch research 'Exposure Draft:
Reassessment of the Municipal Ratings Framework'.) At this time, Fitch is
deferring its final determination on municipal recalibration. Fitch will
continue to monitor market and credit conditions, and plans to revisit the
recalibration in the first quarter of 2009. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) said
on Wednesday it has rescheduled a conference for hedge fund
clients previously planned for the first week of March in Miami,
citing what it called "the current environment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokesman Ed Canaday declined to elaborate, but the
move comes a day after Wells Fargo  Co said on Tuesday it had
canceled employee events in Las Vegas, after a report said it
had booked expensive hotels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Public opinion has turned sharply against banks --
especially those who received taxpayer funds -- paying bonuses,
or lavishing staff or clients with conferences or travel on
private jets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman conference will move to New York and a new date
will be announced in the next few months, Canaday said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedge fund clients at the conference pay for their own
travel and hotel rooms, the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedge funds suffered record redemptions of $155 billion
last year from investors protesting the industry's worst-ever
returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs received $10 billion from the U.S. government
in October as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Plan and, along
with other banks that received TARP funds, it has had to agree
to limit compensation for executives and maintain certain
capital levels.

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Advance tickets for the limited engagement of Walt Disney Pictures` "Jonas
Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience" will go on sale starting February 6, just
in time for Valentine`s Day gift giving, it was announced today by Chuck Viane,
president, distribution, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The film blends
excerpts from the brothers` red-hot Burning Up concert tour, including guest
performances by Demi Lovato and Taylor Swift, with exclusive behind-the-scenes
footage, off-the-wall segments, a brand new song ("Love Is on Its Way"),
swarming fans and a lot of JB-style humor-giving fans never-before-seen insights
into the lives of Kevin, Joe and Nick. 

The 3D rockumentary will be exhibited in state-of-the-art Disney Digital 3D and
will play in theatres across the country. The film is directed by Bruce
Hendricks and produced by Art Repola, who previously served in the same
capacities on Walt Disney Pictures` "Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both
Worlds Concert" film and Touchstone Pictures` and ESPN`s "Ultimate X." Producing
with Repola are Johnny Wright, Philip McIntyre, Kevin Jonas Sr. and Alan Sacks.
Tickets can be purchased online at the movie's official website,

Viane said, "The Jonas Brothers are hugely popular with audiences all over the
world, and they continue to be one of the most dynamic, exciting, and
entertaining musical groups performing today. To accommodate the tremendous
interest in their spectacular limited engagement 3D concert film, we wanted to
make sure moviegoers would be able to purchase tickets well in advance and with
a maximum of ease and convenience. This film delivers a Jonas Brothers
experience unlike any other, and gives every fan the best seat in the house for
an incredible concert. The February release date offers a unique opportunity to
purchase Valentine gifts for your loved ones and share the experience with

phenomenon. In August of 2008, the brothers` latest album, "A Little Bit
Longer," debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 during the filming of "Jonas
Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience" and quickly went platinum. During the same
week the album debuted, the soundtrack to "Camp Rock" featuring the Jonas
Brothers was at No. 8 on the chart and Jonas Brother`s eponymous CD was at No.
10, marking the first time an artist had held three titles in the top 10 in
Sound Scan history. They also appeared on the cover of the Rolling Stone
magazine, which became the top selling issue of 2008, and were Grammy-nominated
as Best New Artist in the same year.

 NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the bank is keen to
avoid restrictions it agreed to after receiving funds from the
U.S. government late last year and it is looking to pay the
money back as soon as possible.

 The investment bank, which received a $10 billion capital
injection from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program
in October, is not happy with the strings that came attached to
the money.

 Compensation restrictions and certain capital requirements
were part of the original injection, and extra limitations may
be in store after U.S. President Barack Obama imposed tough new
rules limiting pay for companies receiving government aid.

 "We would like to get out from under that," Viniar said,
adding that the bank aims to pay back the $10 billion this
year.

 Viniar said Goldman Sachs is also cautious about buying a
bank, a move many have urged upon the investment bank to ensure
its access to stable deposit funding.

 Banks have come under heavy fire for paying executives too
much after receiving more than $300 billion of capital from the
government and trillions of dollars of additional U.S. support.
A report last week said that banks paid out $18.4 billion of
bonuses, a fact that Obama called "shameful."

 But Goldman can potentially pay back its $10 billion, and
avoid salary caps, by issuing preferred stock rather than common
stock, Viniar said.   

 Shares of Goldman Sachs were up $6.13 or 7.4 percent at
$88.94 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday afternoon,
amid a broader rally in shares of financial companies.

 Obama said on Wednesday that compensation at TARP recipients
would be limited to $500,000 a year, adding that lower
compensation is a crucial element of restoring taxpayer trust.

 NO BANK ACQUISITIONS

 Investors have pressed Goldman to buy a bank to boost its
deposit funding, which is seen as a more reliable way for the
investment bank to finance itself amid the credit crunch.

 But Viniar, speaking at a Credit Suisse Financial Services
conference on Wednesday, said Goldman is in no rush to acquire
another institution, and will look for other ways to boost its
deposits.

 "Don't pick up The Wall Street Journal looking for a Goldman
Sachs acquisition because I think you will be largely
disappointed," he said.

 There is a long history of financial services acquisitions
that have failed due to the difficulty of integrating different
companies' cultures, he said, and this makes Goldman wary of
such an acquisition.

 "I don't expect our form to change," he said, adding, "I
expect us to be largely a wholesale company." Wholesale finance
companies fund themselves in bond markets.

&lt;p&gt;Focus on Early Detection and Screening, Improving Quality of Life and Expanding
Patient Services for Cancer Patients
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc and The Pfizer Foundation announced today, on "World Cancer Day",
that they have awarded $7 million in 2009 to help 13 non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) focus on improving both treatment and prevention for cancer
patients, through its Global Health Partnerships grants program (GHP). Since
2007, 29 Global Health Partnerships grants have been awarded to NGOs working in
more than 46 countries around the world. These new grants support the global
commitment of the Pfizer Foundation and Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit to
promote access to quality health care and education and to advance science and
innovation in the development of breakthrough medicines that will cure or
control cancer. 

"These grants represent an important step in enabling us to partner with key
scientists and organizations to encourage the advancement of cancer education
and research globally," said Mace Rothenberg, M.D., vice president of Clinical
Development and Medical Affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit. "This
year`s grants focus on critically important areas such as early breast cancer
detection and education, establishment of patient navigation programs and
methods to increase overall knowledge and understanding of cancer - all of which
play an important role in the fight against cancer." 

Cancer accounts for one in eight deaths globally - more than AIDS, tuberculosis
and malaria combined. One in three people will get cancer in their lifetime:
each year, more than 11 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed and close to 8
million people die from cancer. Among women worldwide, breast cancer is the
leading cause of cancer death. Globally there are an estimated 4.4 million women
alive who have been diagnosed with breast cancer within the last five years. In
developed countries, 30 percent of women with earlier stages of breast cancer
will eventually be diagnosed with metastatic disease. In developing countries,
the majority of women with breast cancer are diagnosed with advanced stage
disease. 

The Pfizer Foundation Global Health Partnership programissupporting 29
innovative public health programs together with Pfizer Inc offices in support of
both cancer and tobacco control by providing $47 million in funding over four
years. Jointly funded by the Pfizer Foundation and Pfizer Inc, this year`s $7
million investment in oncology will help cancer organizations to improve
prevention, early detection and diagnosis for breast cancer; strengthen public
awareness of cancer risks; increase patients` knowledge and understanding of
treatment options, with a special focus on psycho-social factors; and engage in
long-term capacity building efforts through training, technical assistance, and
collaborative partnerships. 

"We are grateful to the Pfizer Foundation for its support of our five-year
cancer prevention program, `Today`s children, tomorrow`s world`". We have run
campaigns against second-hand tobacco smoke, unhealthy diet and lack of physical
activity, overweight and obesity and conducted a survey of cancer beliefs and
behavior that policymakers everywhere will find useful in promoting cancer
prevention", said, Isabel Mortara, UICC executive director. 

The Global Health Partnerships grants will be evaluated by the Bloomberg School
of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, whose task is to build sustainable
evaluation capacity among grantees. "In partnership with Johns Hopkins and our
outstanding partners, we are pleased to take a very rigorous approach to our
programs, yielding learnings that strengthen national cancer agencies and
improve public health policies and services for cancer patients," said Caroline
Roan, vice president, Pfizer Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Feb 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Titus Labs, a leading provider of data classification software, today
announced the release of Titus Labs Document Classification (TDC) 3.1.
TDC 3.1 offers a unique tool for Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, and
PowerPoint) to apply data classification to documents and paragraphs,
enabling policy enforcement throughout the document lifecycle. At the
desktop level, users add tags, structure, and data sensitivity to put
data in context and enforce the proper level of protection. This version
is the first commercially available solution delivering the power to
classify portions within a document.

    Data leaks and an increase in compliance and corporate governance
requirements present administrators with the security challenge of
understanding the context of data and controlling access. To enable
effective and secure information sharing, documents must be properly
marked and formatted. Uniform, consistent, and comprehensive data
classification labels help reduce inadvertent disclosure and data
spillage of sensitive information and promote cross-domain sharing.
Labels applied using TDC help raise awareness to the sensitivity of the
information and metadata, and if documents are being emailed, users rely
on Titus Labs Message Classification (TMC) to check recipient clearance
and ensure documents are sent to the right individuals both inside and
outside the enterprise.

    To successfully use TDC 3.1, content authors require little or no
knowledge of regulatory marking standards to apply the correct markings.
The solution scales easily for large military and enterprise deployments
and is designed to enhance existing infrastructure solutions. TDC 3.1 is
designed to enable customers to centrally manage and apply their
information security policies based on context-sensitive data
classification. Together with Titus Message Classification, organizations
can leverage user identities in Microsoft Active Directory Rights
Management Services (RMS), part of Windows Server 2008. Titus Labs
solutions allow customers to automatically apply RMS-based information
access and usage policies, based on the sensitivity of information. In
addition, the Titus Labs integration with Active Directory enables
customers to efficiently implement data loss prevention controls tied to
employee identity or group membership.

    The latest version of TDC offers several new features which are designed
to meet the specific needs of military customers. This version supports
both Office 2003 and 2007, enabling organizations to immediately apply
data classification. New features include fully configurable
classification markings to help with compliance and protecting Personally
Identifiable Information. Specific guidelines, such as CUI, CAPCO, and
NATO markings, are fully supported. Complex marking guidelines with
caveats and descriptors are easily handled. Administrators can update the
classification configuration at any time, and push it out instantly to
users. TDC has also successfully tested with the US Federal Desktop Core
Configuration (FDCC).

    "Ensuring the information contained in Microsoft Office documents is
secured is a major concern for all organizations," said Charlie Pulfer,
Vice President, Marketing and Product Management, Titus Labs. "Too often,
end users don't have the knowledge or tools to handle these documents
appropriately. TDC offers an easy way for organizations to enforce
security policy with guided tagging so they can meet regulatory
requirements and secure their most valuable asset - their data."

    Pricing and Availability

    Titus Document Classification is currently available, with pricing
starting at $29.99 US per user. The offering is available through Titus
Labs and its authorized reseller partners.

    About Titus Labs

    Titus Labs is the leading provider of email and document classification
software solutions that help organizations: apply a business value to
data, raise awareness to the sensitivity of information and prevent
inadvertent disclosure. Titus Labs Message Classification and Document
Classification solutions allow companies in various industries to share
information securely. The company has over 100 military, government and
enterprise customers worldwide including Dow Corning, NATO, Australian

&lt;p&gt;Bank`s Payables Web Services Enables Fraud Mitigation of ACH Transactions Via
the Internet, Streamlines Check Printing


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan`s Treasury Services business, a full-service provider of cash
management, trade finance and treasury solutions, today announced it has made
important enhancements to its online payables solution, Payables Web Services.
These enhancements allow clients to manage automated clearing house (ACH) debit
and credit transactions and mitigate fraud online, as well as streamline check
printing. Payables Web Services are made available through the bank`s online
portal, JPMorgan ACCESSSM.

"In today`s rapidly changing business environment, secure management of the
payables function is more critical than ever for our clients," stated Iqbal M.
Khan, executive director, J.P. Morgan Treasury Services. "At J.P. Morgan, we
have always placed the highest priority on ensuring that our clients have the
tools they need to execute their business in the most efficient ways possible.
These enhancements to our leading-edge Payables Web Services are evidence of
that commitment." 

By bringing enhanced electronic management to the bank`s online payables
solution, J.P. Morgan also further extends the paper to electronic progression,
allowing clients to streamline their payables processes while gaining online
access to a richer data pool of critical information. 

Enhancements to Payables Web Services support the bank`s announcement in the
fall of 2008 to increase its service capabilities. With an investment of $1
billion, J.P. Morgan is growing its infrastructure and integrating capabilities
globally to meet clients` increasing need for cash management tools and
services. 

ACH Security Services Take A Byte Out of Fraud

While transacting payments via the ACH system is one of the most secure ways to
do business, experts agree that the industry must remain vigilant to keep
fraudsters at bay. J.P. Morgan takes fraud prevention seriously and is
constantly working to enhance safeguards built into payment products. 

J.P. Morgan`s Payables Web Services includes a new module, ACH Transaction
Review, a fraud mitigation tool that enables clients to review and confirm ACH
debit and credit transactions online and return unauthorized transactions on a
case-by-case basis. 

The firm also offers ACH Debit Blocking, a tool that automatically blocks
unauthorized ACH debits from being posted to accounts. 

Check Print Service Streamlines Accounts Payable Process

The Check Print module of J.P. Morgan`s Payables Web Services enables clients to
conveniently print checks by submitting a single electronic file to the Bank.
J.P. Morgan then prints and mails checks and then submits a file for Positive
Pay check review and account reconciliation. Check Print helps reduce the costs
and risks of accounts payable check printing. 

Payables Web Services also includes Check Image Retrieval which allows for
convenient check inquiry and retrieval. This online check imaging service
provides around-the-clock, secure access to vital disbursement information.
Clients can search for paid checks, place stop payments and view check images,
all online. 

"These enhancements to our Payables Web Services allow clients to maximize fraud
mitigation and increase operational efficiencies within their disbursement
activities," added Khan. "Amongst those efficiencies is the ability to outsource
check printing, which further streamlines payables processes. With 20 years of
check printing experience, and an annual check printing volume in excess of 25
million checks per year, J.P. Morgan is able to deliver a low-cost, high-quality
check print solution that clients can trust." 

Key features and benefits of J.P. Morgan`s Payables Web Services:

* Search for paid checks, deposit ticket data and images, place stop payments
and view check images over the Internet 
* Streamline account reconciliation processing by importing and uploading
check-issue information to the bank 
* Expedite receipt of reconciliation reports and bank statements by retrieving
them over the Internet

Payables Web Services can be integrated with J.P. Morgan`s Check Print and ACH
Transaction Review modules and includes these key features and benefits:

* Reduce costs, risks and resources associated with printing checks 
* Submit a single electronic file to print, mail and reconcile checks 
* Control end-to-end check printing and sourcing via the Internet 
* Minimize exposure to ACH and paid check fraud by quickly and accurately making
positive pay and ACH exception decisions online

credit transactions

&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd's (CCL.AX) major shareholder, The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) (TCCC), was still in talks on a A$7.3 billion ($4.7 billion) bid proposal for the Australian soft drinks firm from brewer Lion Nathan Ltd LNN.AX, Amatil said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lion Nathan, 46 percent owned by Japan's Kirin Brewing Co (2503.T), launched the cash and scrip bid in November, though Coca-Cola Amatil said at the time it had material weaknesses and looked cheap compared to other recent deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A condition of the bid from Australia's No. 2 brewer was that TCCC, Coca-Cola Amatil's 30 percent shareholder and supplier, support the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amatil (CCA) said TCCC had provided Kirin with a list of conditions that would need to be satisfied before it would re-consider any proposal and discussions between the pair were continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CCA is not in a position to judge whether these discussions will result in the TCCC agreeing to support the proposal or a varied one, therefore the CCA Board is not presently actively considering the proposal," Amatil said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lion Nathan, Kirin and Coca-Cola Co declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A takeover of Amatil would give Lion Nathan a 60 percent share of Australia's A$10.3 billion soft drinks market as well as a canned fruits and vegetables business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirin is a competitor to Amatil in Australia as the Japanese group owns the biggest juice maker, Berri, and flavoured milk producers National Foods and Dairy Farmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil shares fell 5 percent on Wednesday to A$9.12, while Lion Nathan eased 1 percent to A$8.11 in a broader market that lost 2 percent .AXJO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amatil said that based on Tuesday's closing prices the bid had an implied value of A$9.99 per Coca-Cola Amatil share, representing a multiple of 10.5 times the company's 2008 consensus earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Taiga Uranaka in Tokyo and Martinne Geller in New York)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by James Thornhill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Feb 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Information Builders, the independent leader in operational business
intelligence (BI) systems, today announced an agreement with IBM to
expand the capabilities of IBM's DB2 Web Query for i business
intelligence solution, based on Information Builders' WebFOCUS platform.
The agreement with IBM is to provide a new DB2 Web Query Database Adapter
feature, allowing DB2 Web Query to extend its reach by enabling report
access to data sources other than DB2 for i. This new offering enhances
reporting functionality and increases ease of use while minimizing
installation, support and management, and overhead for users. It marks
another key milestone in Information Builders and IBM's joint roadmap for
IBM's DB2 Web Query for customers of the IBM i (previously named i5/OS).

    The Database Adapter is designed to provide seamless connectivity to
relational databases other than DB2 for i, allowing DB2 Web Query reports
to include data from either a specific remote database or multiple remote
instances of that database type. The initial Database Adapter enables
access to Microsoft SQL Server(TM). Access to other relational database
types will be offered in the future.

    "In today's business environment, small- and medium-sized companies need
to get to all the data they have to make the best informed business
decisions," said Gerald Cohen, president and CEO of Information Builders.
"The Database Adapter feature does just that by enhancing the reach of our
common customers' Web-based business intelligence applications."

    IBM DB2 Web Query for i has more than doubled its customer base in the
past six months, shipping more than 20,000 licenses of the reporting
tool. It supports a broad range of business intelligence applications and
development environments, while leveraging the self-managing and query
optimization features of DB2 for i.

    "The new database adapter feature fulfills a high-priority requirement
from our customers. While the majority of their data most likely resides
in DB2 for i, the desire to have a single tool that also accesses non-DB2
databases without having to replicate data enhances productivity and keeps
costs at a minimum," said Doug Mack, Power Systems marketing manager at
IBM. "Together with Information Builders, we plan to continue to extend
our DB2 Web Query product with additional database connectivity
enhancements in the future."

    The Database Adapter feature is slated for delivery in the first half of
2009 and will be available in beta mode in the first quarter.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Faces $27 Billion Liability for Toxic Catastrophe in Ecuador`s Amazon
Rainforest
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Scientists in the $27 billion class action lawsuit against Chevron in Ecuador`s
Amazon have discovered that the company manipulated laboratory results to evade
a judgment at trial, lawyers for indigenous tribes announced today. 

Chevron`s misleading lab results have been presented by the company as a defense
to the environmental lawsuit, brought by 30,000 rainforest residents in Ecuador
over the dumping of 18 billion gallons of toxic waste in the rainforest from
1964 to 1990. An independent court expert recently estimated damages at $27
billion with a final judgment expected later this year. 

Chevron, which bought Texaco in 2001, used the test results to obtain a limited
legal release from Ecuador`s government that should absolve it of liability.
Texaco was the sole operator of a large concession in Ecuador`s rainforest from
1964 to 1990. 

"The new evidence definitively proves that Chevron has lied to the courts and
the Ecuadorian people about an environmental remediation that failed miserably
to deliver the results promised," said Pablo Fajardo, the lead lawyer for the
plaintiffs. 

Douglas Beltman, an executive vice-president at Stratus Consulting in Boulder,
said that Texaco used a laboratory test called the Toxicity Characteristic
Leaching Procedure (TCLP) to measure soil contamination remaining after its
purported clean-up of dozens of waste pits in Ecuador between 1995 and 1998. The
TCLP test is designed to evaluate the amount of soil contamination that leaches
into surrounding water, rather than the amount of contamination in the soil
itself. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that the TCLP test
not be used for oil-contaminated soils because of unreliability. 

In a remarkable finding, Beltman discovered that in Ecuador Texaco used a
clean-up standard of 1,000 mg/L of oil that leaches into water from soil in the
TCLP test to determine whether it had properly remediated the soil -- a
threshold level physically impossible to reach because the water solubility of
crude oil is typically 10 mg/L or less. 

"If nothing were done at a site contaminated with pure crude oil, a sample
measured using the TCLP test would still easily pass Texaco`s clean-up
standard," said Beltman, a former EPA scientist who made the discovery when
analyzing reams of data submitted by Chevron as evidence in the trial. 

"The entire Texaco clean-up was guaranteed to pass muster because of the
improper use of the test, regardless of the amount of contamination," he added. 

Fajardo, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, added: "This again proves that Chevron
is engaged in classic junk science. Chevron is simply attempting to cover-up
Texaco`s fraud so it can evade its liability." 

The discovery helps solve one of the enduring mysteries of the trial. To secure
its release, Texaco reported to Ecuador`s government that levels of
contamination were so low at its "remediated" sites that its laboratory
equipment couldn`t detect the presence of toxins. Yet at the time, local
residents complained that crude oil was visible on the ground at those very
sites. 

Years later, at the civil trial against Chevron, sample results from those same
sites found levels of hydrocarbons in the soils thousands of times higher than
permissible norms even though Chevron had reported them at "non-detectable"
levels to secure its release. 

Beltman`s analysis was confirmed by other scientists at Status Consulting,
including Dr. Ann Maest, considered a national authority on environmental
chemistry. A report on the findings, called Texaco`s Misuse of the TCLP Test In
Ecuador, is available at www.chevrontoxico.com. 

The discovery of the faked results is further evidence of Chevron`s deepening
crisis in Ecuador, said Fajardo, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs. Besides the
potential $27 billion liability, Fajardo said the new evidence can be used in a
criminal case against two Chevron lawyers and seven government officials
indicted for lying about the clean-up. 

Evidence in the civil trial demonstrates the soil and groundwater in Texaco`s
former concession is so poisoned with hydrocarbons that an area of rainforest
roughly the size of Rhode Island is virtually uninhabitable, according to the
court-appointed expert. The $27 billion in damages is primarily to cover the
clean-up of soils and groundwater, install a water system, provide health care,
and to compensate the region for cancer deaths. 

Fajardo pinned primary blame for the fraud on Ricardo Reis Veiga, one of the
Chevron lawyers under indictment. Reis Veiga supervised the so-called clean-up
in the mid-1990s when working for Texaco. 

He also cited the role of Charles James, Chevron`s General Counsel and a former
Assistant Attorney General in the Bush Administration. James has continued to
defend Reis Veiga`s role and has permitted him to supervise the Chevron team in
the civil trial, which critics call a conflict of interest. 

A final judgment in the case, which is being heard in Ecuador at Chevron`s
request, is expected later this year. 

Texaco has admitted it dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste water
into Ecuador`s Amazon waterways. The waste included cancer-causing chemicals
such as benzene, and five indigenous groups assert their traditional lifestyles
have been decimated by the contamination.

&lt;p&gt;  VALLETTA, MALTA, Feb 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Maltese National Electricity and Water Utilities -- Enemalta
Corporation (EMC) and Water Services Corporation (WSC) -- have selected
IBM (NYSE: IBM) for a 70 million euro, five-year agreement to design and
deliver a nationwide Smart Grid implementation.

    Working with IBM, Enemalta will transform key utility processes through
the implementation of an integrated utility business solution.

    The solution is designed to improve operational efficiency and customer
service levels by introducing smart meters that allow clients to better
manage consumption. Smart metering also enables restructuring of the
billing process, improved customer relationship management and the
introduction of e-services that further empower clients to serve their own
customers.

    The project is the first step in establishing an end-to-end electricity
and water smart utility system. When complete, the multi-phased
engagement is expected to completely transform the relationship between
Maltese consumers and utilities suppliers, while enabling more efficient
consumption of energy and water.

    IBM will replace all 250,000 analog electricity meters with new smart
electronic devices. IBM will also integrate water meters and advanced IT
applications, enabling remote monitoring, management, meter readings and
meter suspensions.

    "This agreement will not just transform Enemalta's metering operations but
will help us introduce new back-office applications to provide an
unprecedented customer relations service," said Enemalta's CEO Ing. Karl
Camilleri. "With the right infrastructure in place to distribute
electricity on the national grid we are looking at ways to both optimize
current operations, as well as open up potentially new untapped markets in
the way we conduct our business operations."

    Benefits include:


--   Actual use: estimated accounts will be eliminated and customers will
pay only for what they actually use. 
--   Flexible tariffs: utility companies will be able to manage different
prices to sustain new policies on energy consumption. 
--   Pre-payment: the solution allows customers to switch to a pre-pay
service, similar to mobile phone pre-payment. 
--   Reduction of losses: commercial losses will be reduced and technical
losses will be more easily identified through monitoring of electricity and
water grids. 
--   Remote management of electricity supply: no local intervention to
activate, reduce, increase or terminate supply, thereby reducing connection
time. 
--   Energy efficiency: the system will enable sophisticated analysis of
consumption patterns enabling a real-time view of energy use to identify
opportunities for reduction. 
--   Customer portal: customers will have an Internet window to their
technical and commercial data, to track current consumption and choose the
most appropriate agreements. 

    
"The implementation of an advanced automated meter management system
will permit the Corporation to further improve its water loss management
initiatives," said WSC CEO Ing. Marc Muscat.

    "This agreement results from a comprehensive process to select a Smart
Grid system that provides clear benefits to the Maltese community," said
Guido Bartels, General Manager Global Energy &amp; Utilities Industry at IBM.
"We see the Smart Grid as a critical enabler for economic growth on a
global scale and it's inspiring to see Malta take such a strong
leadership position."

    The agreement was signed prior to year end 2008. The system is expected to
be completed by the end of 2012.

&lt;p&gt;Product Categories Vary from Consumer and Industrial Packaging to Consumer,
Health and Automotive Applications


HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical will present its broad portfolio at PlastIndia 2009 Hall 7H,
specifically highlighting its specialty elastomers, polyethylene and
polypropylene-based products. Vistamaxx specialty elastomers, Santoprene
thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), Enable mPE and Exxtral Performance
Polyolefins will be among the brands on display. 

"With demand for petrochemicals growing throughout India, PlastIndia is an ideal
showcase for us," said John Verity, vice president, polyolefins, ExxonMobil
Chemical. "The country`s economic infrastructure is expanding rapidly and we
want to be a part of this growth." 

Verity and Dirk Michiels, manager of global polyolefins product technology, also
will be participating in PlastIndia`s International Conference, where they will
be giving presentations on the state of the polymer industry and ExxonMobil
Chemical`s commitment to technology and innovation. 

Among the specialty elastomers on display, Vistamaxx specialty elastomers and
Santoprene thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) can improve flexibility in
polyolefin-based compositions. In addition, these specialty elastomers are cost
competitive. 

Santoprene TPVs are flexible, ready-to-use compounds ideal for electrical
insulation and jacketing applications. They exhibit excellent environmental
resistance to ozone, chemicals and UV light; resistance to extreme temperatures
better low temperature flexibility than thermoplastic polyolefins, good oil
resistance; outstanding electrical performance through high dielectric strength;
and, excellent wet electrical properties. 

Vistamaxx specialty elastomers offer ease of processing and compatibility with a
wide variety of polymers - meaning customers enjoy the flexibility of using them
in a wide variety of new and innovative market applications. These specialty
elastomers can be processed in a number of ways including cast film, blown film,
extrusion coating and injection molding, among others. They provide a gateway to
new, innovative product designs, often at lower costs. 

Along with lower costs, waste reduction and energy consumption are focal points
for many customers. ExxonMobil Chemical`s recently introduced new metallocene
polyethylene product, Enable mPE, has that potential for a broad spectrum of
film applications. Its innovative design reduces the amount of raw materials
needed because the films are thinner but equal in strength. Enable mPE also
generates less process waste than resins used in existing applications, and it
is recyclable. Enable mPE is ideal for packaging as it makes it easier to ship
and store products, plus its transparency and toughness make it well-suited for
agricultural greenhouse films. 

ExxonMobil Chemical continues to be at the forefront of innovation to respond to
new demands from consumers, new requirements from manufacturers and new
specifications from equipment makers. For example, Exxtral Performance
Polyolefins are being certified for various automotive applications. The grade
slate joins an extensive portfolio of neat and impact copolymer products widely
used in a variety of interior, exterior and under-the-hood applications. Another
example involves the introduction of a series of innovations that enable the
production of polypropylene fabrics that have cotton-like softness, excellent
drapability and solid abrasion resistance. 

"Our technological advances continue to bring higher valued products to markets
such as India in the hope of improving the quality of life for each and every
citizen," Verity said.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co reported a sharply lower-than-expected quarterly profit as the global downturn hurt its TV advertising, DVD sales and theme parks, and its shares fell more than 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance by Disney, the first of the major U.S. media companies to report quarterly results this season, bode ill for Time Warner and News Corp NWSa.O, which are also set to report this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What it would say is that most entertainment conference calls are going to bring gloomy news of an increasingly challenged advertising environment," Barclays Capital entertainment analyst Anthony DiClemente said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney continues to see softness in ad sales at its ABC broadcast network and ESPN cable sports network, though advance bookings at its domestic theme parks are up slightly this quarter, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs told analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger warned, however, that in addition to economic pressures, the company was "experiencing secular changes" in consumer behavior that could have long-term impact on its broadcast television and DVD sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger told analysts that the company was still looking at "very significant" overall cost reductions, including "reducing costs of distribution, production (and) marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said last month that it was cutting hundreds of jobs at its theme parks, ABC Media Group and ESPN, and consolidating ABC's production and network businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SLIGHTLY ENCOURAGING"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's fiscal first-quarter net profit fell 32 percent to $845 million, or 45 cents per share, from $1.25 billion, or 63 cents per share, in last year's first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding gains from the sale of investments in Latin American pay-TV services, earnings fell to 41 cents per share versus a comparable consensus estimate of 50 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 8 percent to $9.6 billion from $10.45 billion a year earlier, short of a Wall Street forecasts for $10.04 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a bad miss but the problems that led to this miss are fixable -- the economy... and they have work to do on the cost side of the equation," Caris  Co analyst David Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating income at Disney's theme parks fell 24 percent to $382 million in the quarter, buffeted by slowing U.S. consumer spending and a $40 million accounting charge on fuel hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue at the parks fell 4 percent to $2.67 billion, despite deep discounts for park stays and tickets instituted last fall. But the discounts, extended on Tuesday through March 29, have boosted domestic room reservations and attendance in the second and third quarters over 2008, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Jones consumer analyst Robin Diedrich said the January park trends were "slightly encouraging" and in line with those of other consumer-facing companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Slowly, very slowly, things have been... coming off of what appears to be a really low period," Diedrich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At media networks, operating profit fell 29 percent to $655 million and revenue slid 5 percent to $3.9 billion on weak ad sales at ESPN and lower ratings at ABC, as well as tough comparisons with "High School Musical 2" DVD sales in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pace of ad sales is down slightly at ABC and ESPN and "significantly" at Disney owned and operated TV stations in the current quarter versus 2008, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spot ad sales at ABC are fetching slightly higher prices than advance sales in the current quarter, but advertisers have been slower to pick up options for time in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DVD sales for Disney Studios' "Prince Caspian" were no match for 2008's "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End", bringing the unit's operating profit down 64 percent to $187 million, and revenue down 26 percent to $1.95 billion in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating profit at the Consumer Products unit fell 8 percent to $265 million, squeezed by flat royalties and retail store costs. Revenue rose 18 percent to $773 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares fell 7.4 percent to $19.09 in after-hours electronic trade from a close of $20.62 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sue Zeidler; Editing by Edwin Chan, Leslie Gevirtz and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
WebTrends, a leading provider of web analytics and online marketing solutions,
has identified a steady increase in usage of Microsoft`s new operating system,
Windows 7. Microsoft launched the availability of Windows 7 BETA at the
International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier this year. With WebTrends
OnDemand software WebTrends customers are gaining valuable insights into what
operating systems (OS) their customers use. With Windows 7 in its initial BETA
stage, WebTrends has already seen an up-tick in usage, helping to validate
adoption of what is already the world`s most widely anticipated OS.

and engagement for business. Understanding online behavior and the various
platforms customers use to interact is becoming an increasingly sophisticated
task. With insights into BETA software like Windows 7, WebTrends customers can
plan for necessary upgrades as those BETAs become mainstream. Tracking Windows 7
also allows those customers to save valuable time and money in the future. 

"A big piece in the development strategy for Windows 7 is to promote the advent
of interactive, multi-media informed technology, from the home and business.
True two-way interaction," said Jascha Kaykas-Wolff, vice president marketing,
WebTrends. "Understanding where your customers are coming from and the types of
interactions they want to have with you is very important for marketers.

open BETA, and it`s important that our customers have access to this information
as well."

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Sanofi Eyeing Major Acquisition

Unconfirmed rumors have been circulating since last week that Sanofi-Aventis
(NYSE: SNY), the world`s 4th largest pharmaceutical company, is considering a
major acquisition. In fact, sources at the Financial Times say the French drug
maker is speaking with investment banks about raising as much as $25 billion in
cash. 

The news follows last week`s announcement that rival Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) will
acquire Wyeth (NYSE: WYE) for an estimated $68 billion in cash and stock. Pfizer
raised $22.5 billion through a consortium of five investment banks. It seems
Sanofi is attempting to follow the same path. 

Broadcom's Latest Report Mixed

Broadcom Corp. (NASDAQ: BRCM) is a fabless company, designing and marketing
semiconductor components that network voice, video, and data traffic for
applications in digital cable and satellite set-top boxes, cable and digital
subscriber line (DSL) modems, high-speed local area networks (LANs),
metropolitan area networks (MANs), long-haul networks, wireless communications,
server solutions, and many more areas. 

BRCM recently reported revenues of $1.127 billion in Q4, up 9.7% year over year
but down 13.2% quarter over quarter. Revenues from all the three product lines
were down quarter over quarter due to weakening demand and inventory corrections
by most customers. 

Where Did Citigroup Find $36.5 Billion?

Yesterday, Citigroup (NYSE: C) stated it would deploy $36.5 billion in the
coming months to boost its lending efforts by utilizing funds received from the
Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). This will be in addition to the
approximate $75.0 billion in new loans that Citigroup made during 4Q08. 

Of the $45.0 billion it received from TARP, $36.5 billion will be used as a
partial funding source to support Citigroup's U.S. residential mortgage
activities ($25.7 billion); credit card lending ($5.8 billion); personal and
business loans ($2.5 billion); corporate loan activity ($1.5 billion); and
student loans ($1.0 billion).

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/a857a9/pfizer_pipeline) has
announced the addition of the "Pfizer - Pipeline - Products - Performance -
Potential" report to their offering. 

Headquartered in New York, Pfizer has been the world's largest research-based
pharmaceutical company since it stole Merck &amp; Co's crown in 1998. The subsequent
acquisition of Warner-Lambert (and with it Agouron) in June 2000 and the merger
with Pharmacia in April 2003 (which included the former Monsanto division, GD
Searle) cemented this position and it looks unlikely to be toppled in the near
future. Employing over 86,000 people worldwide, it has more than 100 overseas
subsidiaries and operations in around 150 countries. 

Pfizer has a broad portfolio, with strengths in the areas of cardiovascular
disease, central nervous system disorders, inflammatory disease, metabolic
disorders, infectious diseases and oncology. Pfizer believes it has one of the
broadest product portfolios of all the major pharmaceutical companies. In 2004,
Pfizer set an industry record with ten of its products (including Celebrex)
generating revenues of more than US$1 billion each; in 2007 this number has been
reduced to eight. 

In March 2008, Pfizer outlined its growth strategies, which include optimising
its patent-protected portfolio; generating revenue opportunities from
established products; accelerating growth in emerging markets; focusing on
continuous improvement and innovation; and investing in complementary
businesses. The company also re-affirmed its 2008 guidance of a revenue range
from US$47 to US$49 billion, with adjusted research and development expenses
ranging from US$7.3 to US$7.6 billion. 

Pfizer is executing a wide-ranging strategy to transform all areas of its
business, grow current and new medicines, drive productivity improvements and
launch innovative patient-centred healthcare initiatives. To address the
challenges for 2008, Pfizer is making efforts to sustain in-line product growth

&lt;p&gt;TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran did not issue visas for a group of U.S. women badminton players to compete in the country this month, the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, blaming a "time-consuming process" in handling such applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department said on Monday eight players along with four coaches and managers would visit Iran on February 3-9 to take part in a competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would have been the first sporting exchange between the two foes since the January 20 inauguration of U.S. President Barack Obama, who has said he will pursue greater engagement with the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said they would now not be able to come to the country, which this month marks the 30th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the U.S.-backed shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The process of issuing visas is usually a time consuming process...this work process, because of the timing, did not allow for the visas to be issued," he told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States cut diplomatic ties with Tehran during the 1979-1981 hostage crisis in which a group of radical Iranian students held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days after storming the U.S. embassy in Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nations remain at odds over many issues, including U.S. accusations that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but they have held sports exchanges in recent years. Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the United States resumed people-to-people exchanges with Iran in 2006, it has sent 20 wrestlers and coaches to Iran and brought 75 Iranians to the United States, including table tennis, basketball and water polo players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Zahra Hosseinian; Writing by Fredrik Dahl; Editing by Angus MacSwan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NICE Decision Expands Treatment Choices for Patients
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc said today that the United Kingdom`s National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued its final appraisal document (FAD)
recommending the use of Sutent (sunitinib malate) as a first-line treatment for
patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma mRCC (advanced kidney cancer).
According to NICE, "Sutent provided a step-change in the first-line treatment of
advanced and/or metastatic RCC and [NICE] noted that more than 20% of the public
and patients that responded in consultation highlighted this impressive benefit
from sunitinib." 

Sutent demonstrated a significant improvement in progression- free survival vs.
IFN-&#945;. The median survival of patients treated with Sutent exceeded two years.
In September 2008, NICE had issued an appraisal consultation document (ACD)
which advised against the use of all four medicines for the treatment of mRCC.
Today`s announcement reverses their previous recommendation regarding the
coverage of Sutent, and makes Sutent the only one of the four medicines, under
review, that is recommended for coverage to date. 

"Today`s recommendation is an important step forward for kidney cancer patients
and also for physicians in the U.K. who now have a proven treatment option for
this difficult-to treat cancer," said Garry Nicholson, president and general
manager, Oncology Business Unit at Pfizer. "We appreciate this recommendation by
NICE on behalf of patients." 

It is estimated that more than 7,000 people are diagnosed with kidney cancer in
the UK each year and approximately 3,600 people die from the disease. Worldwide,
approximately 210,000 new cases will be diagnosed worldwide, and at diagnosis,
approximately 25 percent to 35 percent of RCC patients will have advanced
disease. Metastatic, recurrent or relapsed renal cancer has a very poor
prognosis. The historic median survival for patients treated for metastatic
disease was 10 to 13 months. 

Sutent, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, was first approved in January 2006 for
advanced RCC. Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in
the growth, proliferation and spread of cancer. 

Note: Sunitinib is recommended as a first-line treatment option for people with
advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma who are suitable for
immunotherapy and have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status of 0 or 1 (patients without symptoms or only mildly symptomatic from
their cancer). 

Important SUTENT&#174; (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. CBCs with platelet count and serum
chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle for
patients receiving treatment with SUTENT. 

The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials were fatigue, asthenia,
diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspensia, abdominal pain,
constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration,
altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail, shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Simone Giuliani&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE Feb 4 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd's
(CCL.AX) major shareholder, The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) (TCCC), was
still in talks on a A$7.3 billion ($4.7 billion) bid proposal
for the Australian soft drinks firm from brewer Lion Nathan Ltd
LNN.AX, Amatil said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lion Nathan, 46 percent owned by Japan's Kirin Brewing Co
(2503.T), launched the cash and scrip bid in November, though
Coca-Cola Amatil said at the time it had material weaknesses
and looked cheap compared to other recent deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A condition of the bid from Australia's No. 2 brewer was
that TCCC, Coca-Cola Amatil's 30 percent shareholder and
supplier, support the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amatil (CCA) said TCCC had provided Kirin with a list of
conditions that would need to be satisfied before it would
re-consider any proposal and discussions between the pair were
continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "CCA is not in a position to judge whether these
discussions will result in the TCCC agreeing to support the
proposal or a varied one, therefore the CCA Board is not
presently actively considering the proposal," Amatil said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lion Nathan, Kirin and Coca-Cola Co declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A takeover of Amatil would give Lion Nathan a 60 percent
share of Australia's A$10.3 billion soft drinks market as well
as a canned fruits and vegetables business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kirin is a competitor to Amatil in Australia as the
Japanese group owns the biggest juice maker, Berri, and
flavoured milk producers National Foods and Dairy Farmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Amatil shares fell 5 percent on Wednesday to
A$9.12, while Lion Nathan eased 1 percent to A$8.11 in a
broader market that lost 2 percent .AXJO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amatil said that based on Tuesday's closing prices the bid
had an implied value of A$9.99 per Coca-Cola Amatil share,
representing a multiple of 10.5 times the company's 2008
consensus earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms the 'AAA/V1+' ratings assigned to the Goldman Sachs Prime
Obligations Money Market Fund, a money market fund managed by Goldman Sachs
Asset Management, L.P. (GSAM). The affirmation is a result of Fitch's annual
review of the fund and is based on the high credit quality of the funds' assets
and the capabilities of GSAM as investment advisor. As of Jan. 14, 2009, the
portfolio had approximately $34.2 billion in total assets under management. 

The Goldman Sachs Prime Obligations Money Market Fund aims to maximize current
income to the extent consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance
of liquidity by investing exclusively in high credit quality money market
instruments. As of Jan. 14, 38% of the fund's total assets were invested in
asset-backed (ABCP) and unsecured commercial paper, 36.4% were in government
agency securities, 11.9% were in overnight repurchase agreements, 7.1% were in
banks notes and certificates of deposit, 5.4% were in corporate notes, and 1.2%
were in funding agreements. The fund invests in ABCP programs sponsored by large
money center banks backed by pools of receivables as well as high credit quality
debt securities. In addition to liquidity support facilities associated with
such ABCP conduits, the portfolios benefit, albeit on a temporary basis, from
the liquidity afforded to ABCP programs under the terms of the Asset-Backed
Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility. 

The fund maintains a high credit quality by investing in securities rated at
least 'A/F1' by Fitch or being of a comparable credit quality by other global
rating agencies. In addition, the fund continues to participate in the U.S.
Treasury Department's Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds. Under
the term of the program, only shareholders on records as of the close of
business as of Sept. 19, 2008 may benefit from such guarantee to receive $1.00
for each share held in the fund on that day. As of Jan. 14, 2009 the fund
portfolio's weighted-average maturity was 44 days. 

GSAM is an affiliate of Goldman Sachs Group (rated 'A+/F1+' by Fitch). GSAM
manages assets on behalf of institutions and individuals worldwide through a
variety of equity, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment
products. Fitch views GSAM's investment advisory capabilities, resource
commitment, operational controls, corporate governance, and compliance
procedures as consistent with the rating assigned to the fund. 

Fitch will publish the fund's credit profile on its web site
www.fitchratings.com in the near future. 

On Jan. 26, 2009, Fitch issued an exposure draft outlining proposed criteria
changes for rating global money market funds. The finalization of the criteria
remains subject to a 60-day comment period. The report, entitled 'Exposure
Draft: Global Money Market Fund Rating Criteria' is available on Fitch's web
site at www.fitchratings.com.

&lt;p&gt;SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) today announced the integration of NetApp SnapMirror to
Tape and Snapshot technologies with IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) 6. As a
result, NetApp and IBM customers using TSM 6 will experience enhanced backup and
disaster recovery capabilities for data stored on NetApp FAS and IBM System
Storage N series storage devices. 

TSM 6 leverages NetApp SnapMirror to Tape technology, enabling customers to use
TSM Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) support to back up FAS and IBM N
series volumes directly to tape or across the network to any tape device managed
by TSM. This can be done without having to scan each volume to find new and
changed files, helping reduce the amount of time customers need to back up their
FAS and IBM N series systems, which can make the backup process up to 12 times
faster. 

TSM 6 also leverages NetApp Snapshot technology to reduce progressive
incremental file backup time by comparing the current backup Snapshot copy with
the previous backup Snapshot copy to identify new, changed, and deleted files.
Traditional backup scans of large file systems can take hours. However, TSM 6,
together with NetApp Snapshot technology, completes the identification of new,
changed, and deleted files in seconds, drastically reducing the amount of time
customers need to complete NetApp file system backups with TSM. 

"The improvements in Tivoli Storage Manager 6 are all about keeping ahead of the
tidal wave of data growth. Integrating new NetApp Snapshot technology and
SnapMirror to Tape technology with the latest version of our TSM software
enables us to provide our customers with much improved backup performance, even
as their data volumes continue to grow," said Kelly Beavers, director, IBM
Storage Software. "The ability to reduce the time it takes for incremental
backups and creating an improved capability to perform file-level restores will
instantly benefit NetApp customers who upgrade to TSM 6." 

"NetApp is committed to providing customers with the industry`s most efficient
storage solutions," said Patrick Rogers, vice president of Solutions Marketing
at NetApp. "Through our integration of NetApp Snapshot and SnapMirror to Tape
technologies, NetApp and IBM are helping solve an industry-wide problem
customers face with backing up large storage systems by reducing the amount of
time needed to complete their backups."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings assigns 'AAA/V1+' ratings to the JP Morgan US Dollar Government
Liquidity Fund, a newly organized money market fund managed by JP Morgan
Investment Management, Inc. (JPMIM). 

The ratings reflect the high credit quality and liquidity of the fund's assets,
as outlined by its investment guidelines, as well as the capabilities of JPMIM
as the investment advisor of the fund. The fund is a sub-fund of JP Morgan
Liquidity Funds, registered under Luxemburg law and qualified as an Undertaking
for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS). 

The JP Morgan US Dollar Government Liquidity Fund's investment objective is to
achieve a competitive level of total return, in U.S. dollar terms, consistent
with the preservation of capital and a high degree of liquidity. The fund will
invest exclusively in debt securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
government or by U.S. government agencies and repurchase agreements fully
collateralized by such securities. The fund's investment guidelines permit
entering into repurchase agreements with counterparties rated at least 'A/F1' by
Fitch or being of a comparable credit quality by other global rating agencies.
Furthermore, such repurchase agreements must be overcollateralized by at least
102% by U.S. government or U.S. government agency securities. 

Given the fund's recent inception, the portfolio is not yet representative of
its expected long-term composition. That said, the fund will maintain a weighted
average maturity that will not exceed 60 days. The fund will only hold
securities which, at the time of their acquisition, have an initial or remaining
maturity which does not exceed 397 days or securities for which the reference
interest rate is adjusted at least every 397 days. The fund is currently
capitalized with $10 million of seed capital and is accepting eligible investor
subscriptions. 

JPMIM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (rated 'AA-/F1+' by
Fitch). The firm manages assets on behalf of institutions and individuals
worldwide through a variety of equity, fixed income, cash management and
alternative investment products. Fitch views JPMIM's investment advisory
capabilities, resource commitment, operational controls, corporate governance,
and compliance procedures as consistent with the rating assigned to the fund. 

Fitch will publish the fund's credit profile on its web site
www.fitchratings.com in the near future.

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N) hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to help it sell its pharmaceuticals brands or find other ways to exit the business, sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As always, we don't comment on rumor or speculation about our business," a PG spokeswoman said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, PG had said it may exit the pharmaceutical business as it focuses on products such as toothpaste and feminine care items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also has said it would stop making new investments in pharmaceuticals, consider divesting its healthcare brands and focus its health business on over-the-counter healthcare products such as Pepto Bismol and Prilosec. PG's prescription drugs include Actonel and Enablex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PG's fiscal second quarter, ended December 31, healthcare sales fell 6 percent to $3.5 billion, pressured by foreign exchange and a decline in the volume of products sold.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Feb 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced Tivoli Storage Manager 6, software
designed to help customers reduce operational costs by improving
scalability and addressing the performance of their storage management
assets, cut capital expenditures by reducing duplicate data to lower
storage capacity needs, and simplify the overall management of their data
protection infrastructure. As part of IBM's Service Management strategy,
Tivoli Storage Manager 6 offers customers significant efficiency gains
while improving their ability to meet increasingly demanding service
levels.

    Tivoli Storage Manager helps customers address the issue of managing the
tidal wave of data growth with agility and speed. With data reduction
capabilities, scalability, performance and availability, the Tivoli
Storage Manager family provides support for the widest range of systems
-- from laptops to mainframes -- for an end-to-end data management
solution for organizations of all sizes. It is also designed to help
customers effectively meet and improve service levels, while reducing
risks and energy consumption.

    According to IDC(1), 180 exabytes of digital content was created,
captured, or replicated in 2006 and the number is expected to multiply by
10 times to 1,800 exabytes by 2011. Data deduplication has emerged as a
key technology in the effort to reduce the amount of data and the cost of
storing it. Also introduced today, Tivoli Storage Manager Extended
Edition offers a data reduction capability to help customers control and
slow the rate of backup data growth by identifying and eliminating
redundant data, which can result in more effective use of storage
capacity and lower capital costs. This expands on IBM's comprehensive
data deduplication portfolio, which includes complementary technologies
such as IBM ProtecTIER.

    "Large or small, businesses today are faced with ever-increasing amounts
of data and pressures to cut costs," said Al Zollar, general manager, IBM
Tivoli. "The new features introduced with IBM Tivoli Storage Manager 6
will help customers manage the explosion of data while maintaining
reliable access to important business information. With increased
visibility into data growth and enhanced scalability, customers can
accommodate increased volumes of data, control the rate of backup data
growth and improve efficiency across their storage environments."

    Through integration with IBM's DB2 database software, Tivoli Storage
Manager 6 helps customers cut operational costs with improved scalability
and performance. This powerful database technology manages up to twice the
amount of data objects, potentially allowing for management of one billion
objects in a single system. According to IBM internal studies, customers
can obtain as much as a 300 percent improvement in backup performance,
which can enable them to increase workloads that can be managed within
existing backup windows. The integrated database software also allows
customers to retroactively apply policy changes to protected or archived
objects.

    In addition, Tivoli Storage Manager 6 offers new reporting and monitoring
features that can simplify management and improve storage administrator
productivity by increasing visibility into, and control of, the data
protection environment through a customizable dashboard. Besides a broad
range of predefined reports, customers also have flexibility to quickly
and easily create custom reports. Since the new monitoring and reporting
capability is built on IBM Tivoli Monitoring software, it integrates
application, server and storage backup performance metrics to deliver a
consolidated view of the broader IT environment.

    "We are very excited about the new reporting and monitoring features as
well as the enhanced scalability capabilities of Tivoli Storage Manager
6," said Butch Umble of the Principal Financial Group. "The reporting
capability gives us the tools we need to better manage our data protection
environment in a more cost effective manner. The scalability will allow us
to continue to deliver the high standards of data protection required in
our organization."

    With more than 200 Beta testers, IBM has made significant investments in
the development of its new offering to deliver a reliable storage
management software solution with new capabilities that can help customers
improve efficiency and reduce infrastructure and operational expenses.

    "Chesapeake Energy uses Tivoli Storage Manager to help us stay ahead of
our growing data management needs," said Paul Conway, Senior System
Administrator for Chesapeake Energy. "Our testing of the new version has
gone very well, and we especially like the performance improvements with
DB2. Some SQL jobs that previously took three to four hours can now be
completed in 30 minutes. The new reporting and monitoring features should
also simplify administration."

    "We are seeing higher scalability and system stability with the new
version of TSM because the integration of the DB2 database leads to an
increased active log size," said Dipl.-Inform. Kirsten Gloeer, University
of Heidelberg. "The new item level recovery capabilities for Microsoft
Exchange data will be very useful, as will the UTF-8 support for Linux
clients."

    IBM Tivoli Storage Manager has long delivered a broad range of
capabilities to manage data throughout its lifecycle. Tivoli Storage
Manager 6 continues this tradition with a number of enhancements that are
designed to reduce costs and improve service levels. Among these are new
capabilities in IBM System Storage(R) N series network-attached storage
systems (NAS) that can potentially reduce the time it takes to perform
incremental file-level backups from hours to just minutes; improved
integration with IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for remote office
data protection; item-level recovery of Microsoft Exchange and Active
Directory environments; and full image backups of virtual machines in
VMware environments.

    IBM Tivoli Storage Manager 6 will be available March 27, 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Negative Publicity Casts Shadow over Oil Giant As It Tries To Explain Liability
to Congress and Journalists
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron's lobbying team is spreading inaccurate information in Congress to
combat negative publicity about a $27 billion environmental liability in
Ecuador, lawyers for indigenous communities in the Amazon charged today. 

The $27 billion liability, assessed in 2008 by an independent court expert in
Ecuador, could lead to one of the highest civil judgments ever if the trial
judge accepts the report. Chevron reported record profits of $24 billion in 2008
and is under increasing pressure from shareholders to set aside funds to satisfy
the Ecuador liability, which could come as early as the summer. 

Several in-depth news articles about the lawsuit, including one by the
Associated Press and another by Bloomberg Markets magazine, have in recent weeks
called attention to Chevron's potential liability. Bloomberg quotes a
representative for the New York City pension fund, which owns $470 million worth
of Chevron stock, as saying Chevron should consider settling the case. 

The lawsuit, which is being heard in Ecuador at Chevron's request, asserts that
Texaco dumped 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon over the course
of 26 years when it was the sole operator of an oil concession. Five indigenous
groups say their traditional lifestyles have been decimated and the court expert
estimated 1,041 people have died of cancer due to the contamination. 

Chevron bought Texaco in 2001 and has assumed liability in the case. 

A Chevron team that includes public relations spokesman Kent Robertson, lobbyist
William Irwin, and lawyer Sylvia Garrigo have been making the rounds of
Congressional staff and journalists this week. Inaccurate information from the
group, some of which was reflected in a Washington Times story today (Chevron
Urges U.S. to Revoke Ecuador Trade), was condemned by Pablo Fajardo, the lead
Ecuadorian lawyer for the plaintiffs. 

"We urge Chevron to respect the law and not interfere with the trial process by
politicizing the case in Washington," said Fajardo, a CNN Hero Award winner for
his work on the case. 

"We also urge Chevron not to spread false information to the public or to the
Congress," he added. 

Among Chevron's inaccuracies, said Fajardo, are the following:

* Chevron claims it was "released" by Ecuador's government from further clean-up
in Ecuador after a partial remediation of contaminated well sites, but the
release expressly excludes the private claims being pressed in the lawsuit. 
* Chevron claims its limited "remediation" was adequate, but two Chevron lawyers
are under criminal indictment in Ecuador for lying about the results. 
* Chevron claims the plaintiffs wanted the case moved from the U.S. to Ecuador,
but in reality it was Chevron that sought the transfer to avoid a U.S. trial. 
* Chevron claims the plaintiffs produced a critically-acclaimed documentary film
on the case, Crude, by the Emmy-award winning director Joe Berlinger. The
plaintiffs had no role in producing the film, said Fajardo.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 5 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is
delaying plans to build a unit to test a new heavy-oil
upgrading technology at its Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery,
a company spokesman said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Depending on market conditions, the company said it will
delay until 2010 construction of a 3,500 barrel per day
precommercial plant that uses the technology, called Vacuum
Resid Slurry Hydrocracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a strategic deferral," said Lloyd Avram, a
spokesman for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "First, the recent drop in oil prices. Second, an
opportunity to achieve reductions in construction costs as
global construction slows in the coming year. Third, the
opportunity to incorporate additional design flexibility," he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The technology, which  could significantly increase yields
of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from heavy and ultra-heavy
crude oils, like those produced in Venezuela and the Canadian
oil sands, was very attractive in times of tight supply and
demand for oil products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the falling price of oil -- down nearly $100 a barrel
from its high in July -- and sluggish demand for oil products
due to a weak global economy, refiners have been forced to cut
back production of existing units to keep profit margins in the
black.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, rivals in area, share prices; changes
dateline, previously NEW YORK)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Feb 5 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
announced on Thursday a new deepwater oil discovery at the
Buckskin prospect in a promising part of the Gulf of Mexico
that is also being scoured by smaller competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The block is about 190 miles (305 km) southeast of Houston
and 44 miles west of Chevron's 2004 Jack discovery in the lower
tertiary -- a geological formation seen as a potential source
of significant new supplies in the offshore fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Buckskin No. 1 discovery well encountered more than 300
feet of net pay, Chevron said. The well is located in about
6,920 feet of water and was drilled to a depth of 29,404 feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a very significant discovery in the lower tertiary
trend, where Chevron is the largest leaseholder," said George
Kirkland, executive vice president for global upstream and gas
at San Ramon, California-based Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Kurt Wulff of McDep Associates said generally that
the lower tertiary offered a great deal of economic value "if
you have any confidence that the economy is going to recover"
and long-term crude prices rise back above $50 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude futures CLc1 were trading slightly lower on
Thursday, just above $40 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Chevron rose 1.5 percent to $72.66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) announced its
second deepwater Gulf of Mexico discovery this week, with
nearly 300 feet of net oil pay found at the Shenandoah well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Initial data indicates the Shenandoah discovery has
reservoir properties that appear to be of much higher quality
than industry has seen previously in the emerging
lower-tertiary play," Bob Daniels, Anadarko's senior vice
president for worldwide exploration, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips (COP.N) owns 40 percent of Shenandoah,
Cobalt International Energy holds 20 percent, Marathon Oil Corp
(MRO.N) 10 percent, while Anadarko has the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on Wednesday, Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) President John
Richels said on a conference call his company expected to begin
booking lower-tertiary reserves in 2010 when its Cascade
project begins producing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Anadarko were up 4 percent at $40.96, while Devon
shares were 2 percent higher at $59.24.

&lt;p&gt;  COLOMBO, SRI LANKA, Feb 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Suntel, the fastest growing
telecommunications company in Sri Lanka with over 550,000 customers, has
selected IBM Lotus software to create a collaborative environment to
improve the way employees work together in any mode at any time, raising
employee performance and cost-efficiency. Suntel chose to move from
Microsoft Exchange and Outlook to IBM Lotus suite of products because of
flexibility, reliability and cost.

    Under the agreement signed in 2008, Suntel is deploying the
enterprise-wide software consisting of Lotus Notes and Domino and Lotus
Sametime for unified communications and collaboration and Lotus Symphony
document, spreadsheet, and presentation tools to its employees. The
implementation will be completed this month.

    Suntel required a well-integrated, robust and reliable mail messaging
system that would enhance collaboration among its employees. Moving to IBM
Lotus Notes and Domino from Microsoft Exchange and Outlook has reduced
software licensing costs by about 50 percent for Suntel. In addition,
Suntel will make Lotus Sametime available to its employees so they would
be able to communicate with each other through instant messaging, visuals
and voice.

    Lotus Notes was chosen because it is more than just e-mail, as it enables
creation of Web 2.0 composite applications or "mashups" which combine
content in unique ways from multiple internal and external web sources and
does "live text" which allows a person to click on a company address and
automatically bring up driving directions. The software, running on an
enhanced and open standards-based system, will also allow Suntel to
collaborate with its business partners effectively in the future as the
business grows.

    "We are sure that IBM Lotus Notes and Domino solution will give us a
secure and scalable collaboration environment for future growth and
development at a lower cost of ownership," said Dr. Tariq Marikar,
Director, Product Development &amp; CIO, Suntel Ltd. "We are also pleased
with the contribution IBM has made to the open community through Lotus
Suite of products."

    With Lotus Symphony, which is based on the Open Document Format (ODF), an
open industry standard, Suntel no longer relies on a proprietary
technology. This feature-rich integrated office productivity suite will
provide Suntel the ability for users to create, edit and share word
processing documents, spreadsheets and presentation at much lower costs.

    "This win holds great significance for us as it further affirms the
acceptance of IBM Lotus in our market and the significant growth in the
number of Lotus users," said Chari Wijewardane, Country Manager, IBM Sri
Lanka. "Rapidly growing enterprises like Suntel are making strategic IT
investments to meet their long-term growth plans. They prefer open
standards-based solutions like Lotus Symphony over legacy proprietary
technology for their long-term collaboration investments."

    According to Chetan Yardi, Country Manager, Lotus Software, IBM
India/South Asia, "Suntel evaluated IBM's Lotus suite as a much-enhanced
solution over the existing one. Suntel chose to go with IBM as our
proposed solution clearly demonstrated our capabilities in delivering a
collaboration platform that would allow the user community to integrate
information from a variety of sources in a single context and use it for
gaining competitive advantage."

    About Suntel Ltd.

    Suntel has an all-digital network that connects thousands of residential
customers and businesses ranging from corner shops to the biggest
corporate names in the country.

    Suntel puts the latest technology, innovative thinking, and an
unprecedented service commitment into customizing telecom solutions with
its state-of-the-art voice and data network enabling enhanced internal and
external communication that meets the most sophisticated demands of
corporate customers in Sri Lanka. Suntel is also ISO 9001 certified and
ISO: IEC 27001: 2005 certified and operates one of the most advanced

enterprise sectors in Sri Lanka for more than a decade.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) insists it will remain an investment bank, but many experts think the Wall Street firm must buy a commercial bank or a wealth manager if it is to retain its premier status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs legally has been a bank holding company since September, but it still acts like an investment bank. When it comes to funding itself, it relies almost exclusively on borrowing in the bond markets and very little from deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding in those markets can be expensive and unreliable, even if some Goldman debt is guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why many investors say Goldman should acquire a bank or brokerage, which can boost stable deposit funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman has a stay-the-course mentality now, but when the dust settles, I think they'll have no other choice but to buy deposits," said Bill Fitzpatrick, a research analyst at Optique Capital Management in Milwaukee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what its rivals are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS.N) acquired a controlling stake in Citigroup's Smith Barney wealth management business, and has the right to buy full control in five years. Analysts said the Smith Barney deal could help Morgan Stanley increase deposits from brokerage clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley also has said it intends to build a retail banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most financial institutions are looking at their sources of funding," said Brian Sterling, co-head of the investment banking group at Sandler O'Neill. "And it appears clear given this cycle that having deposits is an attractive part of a diversified funding base."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman officials, though, say they have no plan to change their strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said at a Credit Suisse Financial Services conference that he expects Goldman to continue to fund itself mainly in the bond markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't pick up The Wall Street Journal looking for a Goldman Sachs acquisition because I think you will be largely disappointed," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying a bank has its own risks. Goldman would have to worry about the quality of assets on any acquisition's books. And Goldman has not been a retail bank, an institution that requires a separate set of management skills, according to some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a long history of financial services acquisitions that have failed due to the difficulty of integrating different companies' cultures, Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ORGANIC GROWTH MAY NOT WORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquisitions can be difficult, but so can creating a retail bank franchise quickly. People familiar with the matter told Reuters in December that Goldman was considering launching an Internet bank, but such an enterprise may not be a great way to attract long-term deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet banking clients are usually drawn by high rates on products like certificates of deposit, and leave when they find better rates elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has about $885 billion of assets on its balance sheet, of which about $100 billion could be funded with deposits. The bank also has said it could amass deposits through wholesale purchases or by acquiring pools of deposits from failed banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman converted to a bank holding company along with rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in September, a week after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK filed for bankruptcy and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) bought Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, the bank received $10 billion from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new status gave the bank crucial support during a tempestuous period, including the right to issue government-guaranteed debt, and the capital showed investors that the United States supported Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was a cost, too. Goldman Sachs must now reduce its assets relative to its equity, and submit to greater regulatory scrutiny. Goldman's Viniar said on Wednesday that he hopes to pay the government back its $10 billion as soon as possible, to reduce Washington's sway over the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Most financial institutions are looking at their sources of
funding," said Brian Sterling, co-head of the investment banking
group at Sandler O'Neill. "And it appears clear given this cycle
that having deposits is an attractive part of a diversified
funding base."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman officials, though, say they have no plan to change
their strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said at a Credit Suisse
Financial Services conference that he expects Goldman to
continue to fund itself mainly in the bond markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Don't pick up The Wall Street Journal looking for a Goldman
Sachs acquisition because I think you will be largely
disappointed," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buying a bank has its own risks. Goldman would have to worry
about the quality of assets on any acquisition's books. And
Goldman has not been a retail bank, an institution that requires
a separate set of management skills, according to some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is a long history of financial services acquisitions
that have failed due to the difficulty of integrating different
companies' cultures, Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ORGANIC GROWTH MAY NOT WORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acquisitions can be difficult, but so can creating a retail
bank franchise quickly. People familiar with the matter told
Reuters in December that Goldman was considering launching an
Internet bank, but such an enterprise may not be a great way to
attract long-term deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Internet banking clients are usually drawn by high rates on
products like certificates of deposit, and leave when they find
better rates elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs has about $885 billion of assets on its
balance sheet, of which about $100 billion could be funded with
deposits. The bank also has said it could amass deposits through
wholesale purchases or by acquiring pools of deposits from
failed banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman converted to a bank holding company along with rival
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in September, a week after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK filed for bankruptcy and Bank of America
Corp (BAC.N) bought Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In October, the bank received $10 billion from the
government's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new status gave the bank crucial support during a
tempestuous period, including the right to issue
government-guaranteed debt, and the capital showed investors
that the United States supported Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there was a cost, too. Goldman Sachs must now reduce its
assets relative to its equity, and submit to greater regulatory
scrutiny. Goldman's Viniar said on Wednesday that he hopes to
pay the government back its $10 billion as soon as possible, to
reduce Washington's sway over the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For more MA news and our DealZone blog, go to

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has trimmed its
forecast for the drop in U.S. payrolls in January to 475,000
from the bank's previous estimate of a decline of 525,000,
saying the labor market was weakening more slowly than
thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While a government report on Thursday showed initial
jobless claims last week rose more than expected to a 26-year
high of 626,000, "the claims number today has no bearing on the
January payrolls reading," said Andrew Tilton, economist at
Goldman Sachs in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The current median forecast of economists surveyed in a
Reuters poll is for the government's employment report, due for
release on Friday, to show a loss of 525,000 payrolls jobs in
January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although the labor market continues to deteriorate
rapidly, we expect the January employment report to be slightly
less awful than December's," wrote Tilton in a research report
dated Wednesday. "We are revising our payroll forecast to
-475,000, though we still expect the unemployment rate to move
up to 7.5 percent," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In December, U.S. payrolls dropped 524,000 and the
unemployment rate rose to 7.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Several facts suggest that the rate of deterioration in
January was not quite as rapid as in December. First, the
number of jobless benefit claimants rose less rapidly, despite
eye-catching layoff announcements. Second, particularly weak
hiring during the holiday season suggests fewer post-holiday
layoffs," Tilton wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also ADP data released on Wednesday showed a loss of
522,000 U.S. private sector jobs in January, less than the
659,000 private sector job losses in December, Tilton noted.

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA Feb 5 (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N)
hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to help it sell its pharmaceuticals
brands or find other ways to exit the business, sources
familiar with the situation said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As always, we don't comment on rumor or speculation about

they deal with the recession. [ID:nN30466373]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PG expects sales to be flat to down 4 percent in the
current fiscal year, ending June 30.

&lt;p&gt;Buckskin Prospect in Lower Tertiary is Similar to Company`s Jack Discovery
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)today announced a new deepwater oil discovery at
the Buckskin prospect located in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico.The block is
approximately 190 miles southeast of Houston, Texas, and 44 miles west of
Chevron`s 2004 Jack discovery, which is also in the lower tertiary. 

The Buckskin No. 1 discovery well encountered more than 300 feet of net pay. The
well is located in approximately 6,920 feet of water and was drilled to a depth
of 29,404 feet. 

More tests are being conducted on data gathered from the discovery well, and
additional work at the prospect, located in Keathley Canyon Block 872, will be
needed to determine the extent and commercial viability of the discovery. 

George Kirkland, Chevron executive vice president, Global Upstream and Gas,
said, "This is a very significant discovery in the lower tertiary trend, where
Chevron is the largest leaseholder. Continuing our success at the Jack well,
Buckskin reinforces the trend`s potential to provide the U.S. with important new
energy supplies." 

Repsol, with a 12.5 percent working interest in the prospect, was the operator
of the Buckskin discovery well. Chevron, with a 55 percent working interest,
will become operator and conduct all future work. Other Buckskin co-owners are
Maersk Oil America, with 20 percent, and Samson Offshore Company, with a 12.5
percent working interest. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Feb 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a new technical validation program to
help clients easily identify IBM Business Partner offerings that are
designed and demonstrated to provide energy and environment benefits.

    The new "Ready for IBM Energy &amp; Environment" technical validation -- a
first-of-its-kind in the IT industry -- is designed to help IBM Business
Partners validate, market and sell solutions bearing a unique mark that
assures clients the product or service has been rigorously evaluated and
demonstrated to reduce environmental impact based on real-world customer
use.

    Ready for IBM Energy &amp; Environment is open to any of IBM's nearly 100,000
Business Partners and is targeted to those which develop software,
hardware or services solutions that include IBM technology or services and
demonstrate customer-documented, measurable sustainability benefits.

    IBM's validation process requires products and services to meet stringent
criteria that address the reduction or use of resources such as energy,
water and paper materials. These requirements, established by the IBM
Energy &amp; Environment Review Board, are based on IBM's long history of
environmentally responsible practices in its own operations, as well as
extensive experience in helping clients around the world address energy,
environment, and sustainability issues and opportunities. All submissions
will be reviewed by this board and IBM's Corporate Environmental Affairs,
which is providing guidance and input to the program.

    "We developed this program to help clients cut through the clutter of
self-labeled 'green solutions' and identify products and services that
offer customer-documented environmental benefits," said Jim Corgel,
general manager of IBM independent software vendors and developer
relations. "This new program showcases solutions that are already
reducing environmental impact in the field and will help our Business
Partners better position themselves to meet customers' energy and
environment goals."

    Business Partners that receive the validation can market their offering as
"Ready for IBM Energy &amp; Environment" and participate in IBM-driven
marketing opportunities that include on-line marketing campaigns, speaking
opportunities, and free events for clients and prospects showcasing their
Ready for IBM Energy &amp; Environment solutions at any of the 42 IBM
Innovation Centers worldwide.

    Validated: Ready for IBM Energy &amp; Environment

    APC by Schneider Electric, a global leader in critical power and cooling
services, is one of the first Business Partners to receive the Ready for
IBM Energy &amp; Environment validation. The company's  InfraStruXure(R) data
center architecture solutions fully integrate power, cooling and
environmental management within a rack-optimized design. InfraStruXure
Central works with IBM Tivoli Monitoring software to give decision-makers
additional visibility and control of their IT infrastructure's energy
consumption to help improve energy efficiency.

    Combining APC InfraStruXure architecture with IBM BladeCenter servers
through the IBM Scalable Modular Data Center offering, Rhode Island-based
Bryant University reduced its electrical energy usage from 603,593 kWh to
480,000 kWh per year, saving over $18,000 annually. Additionally, the
university consolidated its data centers from three locations to one,
reducing the required cooling capacity from 43 to 25 tons.

    "IBM's Ready for Energy &amp; Environment program is a compelling third-party
validation of the proven energy reduction benefits provided by our
InfraStruXure architecture," said John DiPippo, senior vice president of
data center services, solutions and software at APC. "With so much hype
around 'green,' it is important for our prospective clients to know they
can confidently purchase InfraStruXure with IBM's validation."

    IBM Premier Business Partner Red Hat has received the Ready for IBM Energy
&amp; Environment validation for its solution of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
running on zVM and IBM System z mainframe. BNZ, one of New Zealand's
largest financial services providers, selected these technologies for its
front-end IT environment to help meet its corporate goal to become carbon
neutral by 2010.

    Since migrating to this solution, BNZ has reduced its datacenter footprint
by 30 percent by consolidating 131 Sun Sparc systems and recorded a 33
percent reduction in heat output and a 38 percent reduction in power
usage. In addition to environmental benefits, BNZ plans to receive cost
advantages with approximately 20 percent return on its investment
expected over the life of the platform.

    Additionally, IBM Business Partner KLG Systel Ltd. of India also has
received validation for its energy management system connectgaia.com that
is built on IBM's open standards-based SOA architecture, including IBM
WebSphere Portal and DB2 database software.

    This Web-based offering allows power consumers to MEASURE, VISUALIZE,
ANALYZE, CONTROL AND SAVE(TM) electricity as events occur throughout their
business. The system combines advanced metering, sensors, digital inputs
and digital outputs to help clients such as Aggressive Electronics become
more energy efficient by matching their cooling load to the IT equipment
heat output on a real-time basis, reducing overall energy use.
Implementation of the system has helped save the company 12,252 kWh of
annual energy usage and receive a return on its investment in only five
months.

    IBM Energy &amp; Environment

    The Ready for IBM Energy &amp; Environment validation offers an opportunity
for its Business Partners to join with IBM in providing greater energy
efficiency and other environmental benefits for clients. In addition to
its Business Partner community, IBM also actively provides resources to
developers and works with dozens of higher education institutions around
the world to promote next generation applications and the skills necessary
to develop energy and environment technology solutions. For example, IBM
developerWorks hosts The Green IT Report, an online repository for IT
professionals interested in learning about adding energy efficiency into
their solutions.

    With greater intelligence being infused into the way the world works, IBM
is developing new ways to help clients address energy, environment, and
sustainability issues and opportunities. IBM's products and services are
focused not only on improving the direct energy consumption and associated
CO2 emissions of information technology itself, but also applying IT to
help solve the world's energy and climate challenges.

    Ranging from energy-efficient IT hardware and energy-management software
to the Intelligent Utility Network Coalition, water management solutions,
"greener" supply chain offerings, solar-energy research, carbon management
consulting, smarter transportation systems, and more, IBM's initiatives
are responding to achieving global sustainability goals consistent with
the company's core value of "innovation that matters."

    IBM Business Partners can nominate solutions for the Ready for IBM Energy
&amp; Environment validation at http://ibm.com/isv/tech/validation/energy.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO AND MARKHAM, ONTARIO, Feb 05 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Victorian Order of Nurses for Canada (VON) has signed a two-year deal
worth more than C$10 million with IBM (NYSE: IBM) to help the
organization transform the way home and community health care is
delivered in Canada.

    IBM will provide new business processes and clinical technologies -
including mobile wireless hand-held devices for hundreds of home
healthcare providers to schedule appointments and collect, share and
access patient information in real-time. Other systems such as human
resources, talent management, benefits administration, finance and
accounting will also be automated and interconnected as part of the
project.

    This transformational initiative will enable the national, not-for-profit
organization's 52 locations across Canada to be more integrated and
cost-efficient, thereby improving community services and patient care.

    "VON's vision is to streamline practices and create a technology platform
that is compatible with provincial systems, so we are in better position
to integrate into the larger healthcare system," says Judith Shamian,
president and chief executive officer of VON Canada. "With IBM as our
collaborator, this work will facilitate the adoption of electronic health
records, and enable, for the first time, the integration of home and
community care activities into other parts of the health care system."

    Home health care is the fastest growing sector in health care and as the
Canadian population ages, demand will increase. Approximately 900,000
Canadians regularly access home care. Between 1995 and 2002, the number
of Canadians receiving home care increased by more than 60 per cent.

    The IBM contract covers financing, business transformation, consulting,
application management of back-office functions, new hardware, portal
software, and integration services to support the new wireless handheld
devices.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO AND MARKHAM, ONTARIO, Feb 05 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Victorian Order of Nurses for Canada (VON) has signed a two-year deal
worth more than C$10 million with IBM (NYSE: IBM) to help the
organization transform the way home and community health care is
delivered in Canada.

    IBM will provide new business processes and clinical technologies -
including mobile wireless hand-held devices for hundreds of home
healthcare providers to schedule appointments and collect, share and
access patient information in real-time. Other systems such as human
resources, talent management, benefits administration, finance and
accounting will also be automated and interconnected as part of the
project.

    This transformational initiative will enable the national, not-for-profit
organization's 52 locations across Canada to be more integrated and
cost-efficient, thereby improving community services and patient care.

    "VON's vision is to streamline practices and create a technology platform
that is compatible with provincial systems, so we are in better position
to integrate into the larger healthcare system," says Judith Shamian,
president and chief executive officer of VON Canada. "With IBM as our
collaborator, this work will facilitate the adoption of electronic health
records, and enable, for the first time, the integration of home and
community care activities into other parts of the health care system."

    Home health care is the fastest growing sector in health care and as the
Canadian population ages, demand will increase. Approximately 900,000
Canadians regularly access home care. Between 1995 and 2002, the number
of Canadians receiving home care increased by more than 60 per cent.

    The IBM contract covers financing, business transformation, consulting,
application management of back-office functions, new hardware, portal
software, and integration services to support the new wireless handheld
devices.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks Myriad Genetics (Nasdaq: MYGN) as Bull of the Day
and School Specialty, Inc. (Nasdaq: SCHS) as Bear of the Day. In addition, the
analysts at Zacks Equity Research discuss the latest on Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM),
Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Transocean (NYSE: RIG). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

Myriad Genetics (Nasdaq: MYGN) relies on its predictive medicine for its revenue
generation and is currently seeing solid growth in this business. On February 3,
2009, Myriad reported fiscal 2Q09 financial results ended December 31, 2008. 

For the 3-month period ended December 31, 2008, total revenues increased to
$84.4 million from $56.7 million in the same 3 months in 2007, an increase of
48.7%. This growth resulted primarily from an increase in molecular diagnostic
revenues, which were $84 million this quarter, compared to $53.1 million in the
same quarter of the prior year. 

This 58% product revenue growth resulted primarily from an increase in the
Company's sales and marketing efforts, including expansion of the Company's
women's health sales force to 100 sales representatives, and continuation of the
direct-to-consumer marketing campaign, which the Company believes has resulted
in improved physician acceptance and adoption of its molecular diagnostic
products. Sequentially, growth was 20% from the first fiscal quarter of 2008.
Sales from molecular diagnostics were way above our estimate of $74.5 million. 

Bear of the Day

School Specialty, Inc. (Nasdaq: SCHS) is a company serving the pre-K-12
education market by providing products, services, and ideas which enhance
student achievement and development to educators and schools across the U.S.
School Specialty's family of brands serves more than 116,000 schools throughout
the U.S. and Canada, with a comprehensive range of more than 100,000 products. 

Back on November 20, School Specialty reported disappointing results for its
fiscal second quarter, and management lowered its guidance for the fiscal year
2009. The shortfall was due to a decline in state revenue. SCHS is highly
dependent on state and local governments for its revenues. A weak economy and
de-leveraging in the credit markets will only exacerbate the problems in local
government funding. 

We expect this trend to continue, and that will hurt School Specialty's results.
We reiterate our Sell rating on SCHS and $11 target price. School Specialty is
scheduled to report fiscal third quarter results on February 19. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

Oil Inventories Continue to Grow

With the economy expected to continue shedding jobs in the coming months and the
full impact of the upcoming stimulus package still some time off, the near-term
outlook for demand remains grim. In this anemic demand environment, the
inventory overhang has become a significant price driver, particularly for the
shorter end of the forward curve. 

This situation is expected to change as OPEC`s supply cuts take effect -- most
likely in the spring months -- and visibility on the U.S. economy improves.
While a renewed push to new lows in oil prices cannot be ruled out in the coming
days, we think that the commodity is close to bottom levels at present. 

While we continue to recommend defensive names like Exxon (NYSE: XOM) and
Chevron (NYSE: CVX), we like the relatively more high-beta names such as
Transocean (NYSE: RIG).

&lt;p&gt;Zend`s PHP-Based Web Stack to Ship on All IBM i Servers
CUPERTINO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Zend Technologies, Inc., the PHP Company, announced today that it is teaming
with IBM to preload Zend`s Web stack with every shipment of IBM i software, the
integrated operating environment for IBM Power Systems, including all hardware
that ships with IBM i. Zend`s PHP-based Web solution stack lets customers Web
enable IBM i assets and includes support on IBM i for rapid application
development and Rich Internet Applications (RIAs). With PHP, IBM i users also
get immediate access to a vast ecosystem of market leading PHP applications and
a large professional developer community. 

Since the start of IBM and Zend`s joint partnership more than 12,000 IBM i
customers from 150 countries have obtained Zend products for IBM i and PHP has
been utilized by i customers in rolling out business-critical Web applications.
With Zend Core, Zend`s Web solution stack, now bundled with the IBM i operating
environment, IBM customers now enjoy an out-of-the-box experience with PHP on
both the IBM i 5.4 and IBM i 6.1 implementations. 

"Today`s announcement is an expansion of the relationship between the two
companies to further enhance PHP-based offerings for IBM i customers," said
Scott Handy, Vice President, Worldwide Marketing, Strategy, and Sales Support,
IBM Power Systems. "Our customers asked for PHP and we brought Zend PHP to the
platform. The enthusiasm for-and utilization of-Zend PHP has exceeded our
expectations." 

PHP is the most popular Web development language due to its ease of use and
enterprise-grade functionality. More than 22 million Internet domains deploy PHP
including Yahoo! and Facebook. PHP`s large developer community is estimated at
close to 5 million and also enjoys a rich application eco-system including the
popular Drupal content management system. PHP's popularity has accelerated
rapidly over recent years due to its flexibility and ease of use in building
modern web applications and web services, including its much heralded support on
IBM i operating environments. 

Zend Technologies has worked with IBM for more than three years to deliver
PHP-based products, support, services, and education for IBM i. Recently, based
on feedback from IBM i customers, Zend has delivered a 5250 bridge to simplify
the modernization and extension of business applications. Zend Framework can
also be used with IBM i to rapidly and easily build industrial-strength web
applications in PHP. 

"We have worked with midsize and large i clients to run PHP applications ranging
from complete order management systems, to web-enabling their green screen ERP
systems, to leveraging the vast open source application portfolio that continues
to grow every day," said Andi Gutmans, CEO at Zend Technologies. "In addition,
IBM &amp; Zend business partners are generating revenue by web-enabling green screen
applications and building new web-based applications, reducing costs and
extending the long life of this powerful platform." 

"We`re heavy users of IBM i," said John Horner IBM Power Systems programming
manager at APi Group, a billion dollar conglomerate with home security,
transportation/distribution, and specialty construction interests. "Rather than
move to a brand name ERP system implementation estimated to cost 8 figures+ and
take 3 years to implement, we were able to significantly reduce our risk, stay
on IBM Power Systems platforms, and completely modernize our applications using
Zend Solutions for PHP. We completed this project at 1/10 the cost and in only
18 months!" 

"Everyone knows that Business Partners-for instance VARs/SIs and consultants
like myself-are experiencing margin compression and Zend`s PHP solutions present
an additional revenue stream for us, which is key," said Larry Nies, President
of NSC. "As a whole PHP runs faster, accesses the database quicker, and is
easier for the RPG-minded developer to become proficient in, than other web
languages (Net.data, CGIDEV2, Java, etc.). Using Zend`s solution suite we can
often deliver our implementations in 50-80% less time than competing solutions."

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Any deal between Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) would face a tough antitrust probe, the former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Google Inc's (GOOG.O) deal with Yahoo fell apart under antitrust scrutiny last year, there has been persistent talk that Yahoo, the No. 2 search engine, would resume discussions with Microsoft, a distant No. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Barnett, who led the investigation of Google's scrapped deal with Yahoo when he headed the Justice Department's antitrust division, said tying the lucrative search divisions of Yahoo with Microsoft could be a tough call for regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any 'three to two merger' to my mind would require a significant investigation," said Barnett, who stepped down in November after three years as head of the division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A three to two merger is one where there are three competitors in a market and a merger reduces that to two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo chief Carol Bartz, who replaced co-founder Jerry Yang in January, said recently she did not join Yahoo to sell the company, but that "everything is on the table." Microsoft has said it no longer wants all of its rival, but would still pursue a search engine only deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the deal was broader than just search, antitrust regulators, who are expected to be led by Christine Varney once she is confirmed, could look at other areas of business overlap, such as instant messaging and e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether that would present a problem would require an investigation," Barnett told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AOL leads instant messaging with Microsoft in second and Yahoo in third place, according to data from Nielsen Online. In the e-mail market, Yahoo and Microsoft are the industry leaders with Google's gmail in third place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, which leads the market for online display advertising, has been under pressure for nearly a year as it held fruitless merger or partnership talks with Microsoft, Google and Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) AOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, Yahoo lost market share in search advertising, while display ad sales have been badly hit industrywide by the U.S. recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor is the widespread expectation antitrust enforcement will be tougher under President Barack Obama's antitrust team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think all merging parties are going to have a much more difficult time getting their mergers through," said Steve Newborn, an antitrust lawyer with Weil Gotshal and Manges LLP. "I think the Obama DOJ (Justice Department) is going to be much more enforcement minded than the Bush administration DOJ."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 5 (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N) is working
with Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) to identify potential buyers
for its pharmaceuticals brands or find other ways to exit the
business, people close to the matter said late on Wednesday,
the Financial Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; PG said its pharmaceuticals unit accounts for global sales
of more than $2 billion, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The consumer goods group, which sells brands such as
Gillette razors and Crest toothpaste, has been working actively
to focus more heavily on high-growth businesses and divest
non-key assets, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A.G. Lafley, PG's chief executive, told analysts in
December that the company had stopped investing in new drug
development and would consider divesting some of its key
pharmaceuticals brands, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PG, which reported its second-quarter results on Jan. 30,
lowered its earnings and sales forecast for the fiscal year
ending in June, adding to the list of household products makers
tempering expectations as they deal with the recession.
[ID:nN30466373]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PG expects fiscal 2009 sales to be flat to down 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PG's pharmaceuticals business sells prescription drugs
that focus on women's health and gastrointestinal and
musculoskeletal problems, while the broader healthcare arm
sells over the counter products such as heartburn treatment
Prilosec and Pepto-Bismol, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PG and Goldman Sachs could not be immediately reached for
comments by Reuters.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' long-term rating to Corporacion Andina de
Fomento's (CAF) JPY10 billion Samurai bonds due 2019. The Rating Outlook is
Stable. 

CAF's ratings could benefit from an increase of its loan diversification and/or
an enhancement of its capital base. Downward pressures could arise from a
further increase on private sector exposures on the loan portfolio and/or a
stress situation of a member country that could affect the benefits of its
preferred creditor status. 

CAF ratings reflect the privileges conferred on it by its member countries, its
strong capital base and a solid track record in terms of asset quality and
self-sustainable profitability. The ratings are limited by the volatility of the
economic environment in which the institution operates, significant loan
concentrations and the member countries' creditworthiness. CAF has been able to
operate without difficulty in successive periods of instability in the region
due to a conservative operating policy and the member countries' support. 

CAF's shareholders are governments and public agencies, mostly of the Andean
countries. The shareholders have demonstrated strong support in the form of
capital contributions and privileges and immunities. As CAF is one of the few
providers of long- and medium-term financing to the region, Fitch believes its
shareholders have a vested interest in supporting CAF should it be required.
However, some doubts remain concerning their ability to provide such support. 

CAF is a Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) established in 1968 to assist in
the economic development of its member countries. CAF is headquartered in
Caracas, Venezuela. It focuses on providing medium- and long-term project loans
and trade finance, both to public and private institutions. CAF is 85.1% owned
by the Andean countries. The remaining stake belongs to a number of non-regional
member states and 15 private-sector banks. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance
and other relevant policies and procedures are also available from the 'Code of
Conduct' section of this site.

&lt;p&gt;Employee Volunteer Program Brings Coca-Cola Associates From Across the Country
to Provide Hands-On Assistance

Coca-Cola CEO and Special Olympics Board Member Muhtar Kent Attends Opening
Ceremonies, Presents $10,000 Donation to Games Organizing Committee
BOISE, Idaho--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company is helping to refresh thousands of athletes, families and
fans at the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games through a wide variety of
programs that celebrate the accomplishments of the more than 2,000 athletes with
intellectual disabilities gathering here for the Opening Ceremony tomorrow. 

As part of its global sponsorship, Coca-Cola is providing financial support to
the local organizing committee, donating beverages, creating marketing campaigns
to raise awareness of the World Winter Games and has brought more than 20
employees of the Company and its bottling partner, Coca-Cola Enterprises, to
serve as volunteers at events. The employees were chosen through a national
competition and selected on the basis of their ongoing involvement with
community organizations. The associates will spend one week on site during the
World Winter Games helping to organize sport activities, providing beverages and
helping serve meals to athletes. 

"The values of Special Olympics of understanding, acceptance and inclusion are
shared by Coca-Cola," said Muhtar Kent, President and Chief Executive Officer,
The Coca-Cola Company and a member of the Special Olympics International Board
of Directors. "Giving our associates the opportunity to connect directly with
Special Olympics athletes and their families brings those values to life and
supports the mission in a meaningful way." 

Since the establishment of Special Olympics in 1968, The Coca-Cola Company has
been a proud global sponsor, providing monetary and in-kind contributions,
hands-on volunteer assistance, equipment, uniforms, and other materials and
services for Special Olympics competitions and community activities around the
world. 

In addition to its global sponsorship, Coca-Cola also will donate $10,000 to the
Games Organizing Committee for the World Winter Games. The funds, raised through
a donation of a portion of Coca-Cola sales, will be presented by Mr. Kent in a
ceremony at the "Special Olympics Sports Experience" on Sunday, February 8. 

"The Coca-Cola Company has been a strong supporter of Special Olympics since day
one," said Timothy Shriver, Chairman of Special Olympics. "Coca-Cola`s support
over the years - from refreshing our athletes and their families during
competition, conducting marketing initiatives to raise the profile of our
movement and to now creating employee programs to bring more people into the
Special Olympics family -- has helped us foster a greater acceptance and
understanding of those with intellectual disabilities. This is the true heart of
our mission and an example of the deep partnership we have with Coca-Cola." 

For this year`s event, Coca-Cola and its local bottling partner Swire Coca-Cola
USA, helped to raise awareness for the World Winter Games through advertising
and promotions including:

* At participating retailers throughout the Boise area, in-store signage and
specially marked Coca-Cola 12 Oz Fridge Packs included a message promoting the
Special Olympics World Winter Games. For every 12 Oz pack sold, Coca-Cola
donated 10 cents, raising $10,000 to support the staging of the events in Boise.

* At participating convenience stores, Coca-Cola gave a free limited edition
2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games "Fan Pin" to anyone purchasing three 20
oz. Coca-Cola products. 
* Throughout the area, Coca-Cola delivery trucks featured graphics that
encouraged people to "Be a Fan of Joy" and promoted the Special Olympics World
Winter Games. 
* Coca-Cola also created awareness by using radio advertising to promote the
Games. 
* At the World Winter Games, Coca-Cola is also participating in the "Sports
Experience" where visitors can interact with Special Olympics athletes and
participate in several sports with them such as basketball, table tennis or
floor hockey. 
* The Coca-Cola Polar Bear, from the well-known animated holiday television
commercials, will be at the Sports Experience entertaining guests and posing for
photographs.

In May 2008, Coca-Cola extended its top-level, worldwide sponsorship of Special
Olympics to cover the calendar years 2008 through 2011 - including support for
the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games and the 2011 World Summer Games.
The sponsorship consists of cash, in-kind products and services, technical
support and marketing and fund-raising support for Special Olympics. The
Coca-Cola Company supports the Olympic Games, Paralympic Games and Special
Olympics World Games.

of information and become more responsive to customer needs. Since implementing
the system, the retailer has been able to more effectively target new customers
and boost sales by more than 10 percent, while cutting operating costs. 

As a fashion designer with global operations, Elie Tahari's collection changes
from season to season throughout the year. It was critical for the retailer to
get better visibility into their supply chain to keep up with customer demand
for changing clothing line based on season's trends and geography. With the new
business intelligence solution, Elie Tahari now has been able to achieve more
than 30 percent savings in managing their supply chain and transfer of
merchandise from warehouse to the stores. 

In today's new economy, retailers are challenged to attract new customers and
create advocates for their brand while driving down costs. If the right
merchandise is placed in the wrong location, such as in the back room, instead
of the front of the store, retailers risk not only losing short-term
profitability, but long-term consumer loyalty and interest. Through the use of
advanced real time analytics, Elie Tahari has successfully been able to address
this challenge and address the new shopping paradigm. 

To date, the solution has helped Elie Tahari employees gain better visibility
into all of their critical business information, such as trends around customer
orders.The software helps identify best selling sizes across product lines,
popularity and demand for a particular item, or colors in fashion for the
season. Based on gaining visibility into customer demand from previous years,
they are now able to predict upcoming demands -- for example, the retailer can
now anticipate a high demand for "yellow halter dress" for the spring season in
New York and would now be able to get the right amount of dresses with the right
sizes available in stores in New York. 

In addition, the IBM software also helped reduce the risk of manual reporting
errors by moving to a new electronic system. In the past, it would take days for
information to be manually compiled. That information is now updated every 5
minutes and can be viewed by all departments across the company, irrespective of
location in any part of the world. With real time access to information across
their stores worldwide, channels and supply chain, retail managers, designers
and merchandisers now have detailed information on buying patterns in different
parts of the world, so they can ensure they have the optimal assortment of
merchandise to satisfy customer needs. 

"The IBM business intelligence system has significantly helped us gain
visibility into our customers` needs. With efficiencies that have been brought
into our day-to-day transactions, this system has saved Elie Tahari several
millions of dollars annually and has paid for itself many times over," said
Nihad Aytaman, director of business applications, Elie Tahari. "IBM technology
has helped us bring the kind of innovation in the high fashion industry that is
helping us position ourselves better than the competition by creating brand
loyalty for our products." 

To cope with intensifying competition and global expansion of its business, Elie
Tahari put a new focus on driving business efficiency and cutting costs while
building loyal customers as advocates for their brand. The retailer needed to
gain deeper insight into what products were selling and what customers were
reacting to in their regional stores, in order to develop more strategic and
customized sales and promotion campaigns. As a result, the retailer turned to
IBM business intelligence (BI) software to give a 360 degree view of all
information, from sales to production, and help all systems and departments
connect with one another in near real time. 

With the new technology, running on IBM Cognos BI and eServer iSeries, Elie
Tahari is fulfilling its expansion goals to serve several key international
markets, including Kuwait. The new solution has enabled the global sales team to
have instant access to unified and standardized reports to meet shifting
customer needs. 

New Intelligence Helping Improve Sales

With real time access to information across their stores, channels and supply
chain, retail managers, designers and merchandisers now have detailed
information on buying patterns as well as market trends, so they can ensure they
have the optimal assortment of merchandise to satisfy customers.The BI system
effectively allows Elie Tahari to create new intelligence by presenting a
unified view of all the information available in different systems, which can
then be put to use for smarter decisions around market demand and specific
customer needs. 

Prior to implementing IBM Cognos BI, employees often had to run several reports
from different systems and manually try to piece the information together to
make sense of trends, market demands, financial and product availability. This
was not only time consuming but also left room for errors since the combined
information was never put together in a timely manner. By the time manual
reports were compiled, a lot of new data had been generated or changed in the
systems which made the manually prepared excel sheets obsolete. 

Now, the business intelligence system built on IBM technology not only provides
business information, but provides on-line access to the company`s key
transactional systems - orders, warehouse, financials, production, point-of-sale
and channel sales. Sales associates searching for specific stock across the
distributed supply chain can now quickly pinpoint the item in need, determine
the location, and order new shipments to minimize the financial impact of
carrying out-of-stock merchandise. As an added bonus, the system also
incorporates pictures and PDF files into reports so managers can see actual
images of merchandise -- a critical factor in the high fashion apparel industry.


The IBM Cognos BI solution also gives the retailer a consolidated view of
production, sales, distribution. Employees can anticipate problems by drilling
down if the garment is off schedule and understand supply and demand cycle ahead
of time. Elie Tahari employees have the combination of up-to-the-minute creative
designs and product process that enable early detection, fast reaction and quick
execution based on anticipated trends. 

"In today's economic times, retailers must adapt to the changing consumer
behaviors to attract new shoppers and create more advocates while driving down
costs, and creating new value," said Ambuj Goyal, General Manager, Information
Management, IBM. "We are committed to the success of our clients helping them
gain new intelligence into their business operations by creating an information
agenda and using customer information as a strategic asset to improve business
outcomes."

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights National-Oilwell Varco (NYSE: NOV) as the Bull
of the Day and The Corporate Executive Board (Nasdaq: EXBD) as the Bear of the
Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Citigroup (NYSE:
C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

National-Oilwell Varco`s (NYSE: NOV) fourth-quarter results came in
better-than-expected, reflecting increased sales of its oil and gas drilling
components, buoyed by the April merger with Grant Prideco. 

Revenue for the quarter was up 5.5% sequentially and 43.3% year-over-year to
$3.81 billion. The company ended 2008 with a backlog of $11.1 billion, and aims
to enter 2010 with a solid $9 billion backlog, highlighting a very high level of
earnings visibility going forward. 

Despite the challenging economic conditions, the company remains well-positioned
for a strong performance in 2009 based on its healthy backlog, solid balance
sheet, and strength in its international operations in the Middle East and
Brazil. As such, our Buy recommendation remains unchanged. 

Bear of the Day: 

We maintain our Sell rating on shares of The Corporate Executive Board (Nasdaq:
EXBD) following the release of disappointing Q4 results. The company continues
to experience deterioration in its cross-sell ratio, and other key operating
metrics, including contract value, average subscription price, total member
subscriptions, and client renewal rate, all fell in the fourth quarter of 2008. 

Given the current operating pressures, along with ongoing concerns regarding a
slowing economy, we believe the shares should trade at a discount to the peer
group average. 

As such, we anticipate that the company`s shares will continue to underperform
the market in the near-term. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Wanted: A Super-Regulator

Did the regulators not have the authority to crack down on the lending practices
at the banks and the enormous amount of risk that was being assumed by the
financial institutions, without putting in place a comprehensive risk
management, or, was it the result of lack of coordination between the several
agencies and institutions entrusted with the task of regulating the various
sectors of the U.S. financial markets? 

In addition to the lack of exercise of regulatory powers (for whatever reasons),
one of the main contributors to the current crisis was the complex and uneven
regulatory system, which gave way to gaps and differences in degrees of
oversight. As a result, the financial institutions were able to shift risky
products to less regulated entities or entities having favorable accounting
treatment. This calls for consolidated supervision of parents and all related
entities. 

Also required is stronger coordination with regulators of other countries so as
to effectively regulate the financial behemoths like Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank
of America (NYSE: BAC) and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), which have operations
all over the world.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), Cost Plus, Inc. (NASDAQ: CPWM), Tessera Technologies

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Pay Back TARP, Pay Yourself More

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) is now looking to repay the funds it received from the
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) as soon as possible. 

Goldman Sachs received a $10 billion capital injection from TARP in October
2008. Investors have been urging the investment bank to buy a bank in order to
boost its deposit funding, typically seen as a reasonable way the investment
bank to finance itself amidst a credit crunch. It would appear, though, the firm
is not in a rush to acquire another institution, considering the long history of
failed financial services acquisitions due to various management`s inability to
integrate different company cultures. 

Cost Plus Worth Even Less

Cost Plus, Inc. (NASDAQ: CPWM) announced plans to close another 26 stores and
reduce headcount by 18%. The company believes these moves should lead to over
$20 million in annual savings beginning this year. Even so, that will do very
little to improve the company's sales trends, which have been weak for some
time. 

Moreover, the current macro economic headwinds are not helping the company's
prospects. Mall traffic suffered a severe decline from September through the
holiday shopping season, and there are no signs of traffic improving. Macro
headwinds will continue to pressure the company's sales and profit margins. 

Tessera Tech a Buy, Post-Earnings

Tessera Technologies' (NASDAQ: TSRA) advanced packaging technologies have
industry-wide application. December quarter top and bottom-line results beat
consensus estimates. The licensing business has very attractive operating
leverage characteristics. 

The firm has won 5 major lawsuits and now receives royalties from all of the Big
4 in the DRAM market. TSRA currently has 4 major litigation cases pending. These
could provide significant ongoing, one-time income, or both. We continue to rate
shares of TSRA a Buy. 

On February 2, 2008, Tessera announced results for the 4th quarter of fiscal
year 2008 ending December 2008. Revenue for the period was $69.1 million, up
8.8% sequentially, and up 30.3% year-over-year. Growth was driven by
stronger-than-expected royalty revenue from certain existing customers and
option fees from Motorola (NYSE: MOT). 

ProLogis a Real Value

ProLogis (NYSE: PLD) owns and manages interests in 2,898 distribution
facilities, service offices and properties, spanning about 548 million square
feet of space in 136 markets, including North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific.


In December, PLD announced the sale of all of its China operations and Japan
fund interests for $1.3 billion. With the sale, the company will reduce its
development exposure by about $1 billion. The company will use the proceeds to
pay down debt as PLD continues to take steps to de-lever and decrease the
company`s overall risk profile.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Keeping Corporate Skies Private?

The perks that use to be a given with being at the helm of a major institution
are becoming fewer, as other follows Citicorp's (NYSE: C) example in cutting
back in the area of private jet travel. 

As part of an ongoing cost reduction effort to scale back, BankAmerica (NYSE:
BAC) announced it would be selling nearly half of its corporate aircraft (three
corporate jets and a helicopter from Merrill Lynch). As of last year, Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) records showed that BankAmerica owned nine planes,
of which four were Gulfstreams. 

In addition, Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) also stated it would be downsizing the jet
fleet it acquired from Wachovia. 

Anaren Beats; Kept a Hold Rating

Anaren Inc. (NASDAQ: ANEN), a leading provider of microwave components and
subassemblies for the wireless and defense industries, reported 2nd quarter
fiscal 2009 financial results above our estimates. The company made significant
improvements related to the execution of development projects, production
yields, and control of cost overrun. 

Recent acquisitions of M.S. Kennedy and Unicircuit have further strengthened the
company's Space &amp; Defense business prospects. 

Chevron at Good Entry Point

Chevron Corp.'s (NYSE: CVX) 4th-quarter earnings came in below the year-earlier
level, weighed down by sharply lower oil and gas prices. Upstream profits
dropped nearly 35%, partly offset by improved results from the company`s
refining and marketing business. 

Looking ahead, Chevron plans to continue with its active exploration and
development program, keeping its 2009 capex budget unchanged from the
year-earlier level at $22.8 billion.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is
planning to offer new programs and services for mobile phones,
including an "online bazaar" for software, the Wall Street
Journal reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The online bazaar would be for phones running Microsoft's
Windows Mobile operating system, the Journal said, citing
people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft will also soon offer its latest version of
Windows Mobile, which the report said would have a "more
sophisticated interface."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, the company started a limited release of its "My
Phone" service, which syncs information like contacts and
calendar appointments on a cell phone to a password protected
website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A representative for Microsft was not immediately available
to comment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is expected to announce a movie distribution deal on Monday with DreamWorks SKG, the movie company controlled by Steven Spielberg, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Journal said Disney will distribute around six movies a year for DreamWorks.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is
expected to announce a movie distribution deal on Monday with
DreamWorks SKG, the movie company controlled by Steven
Spielberg, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing
people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Journal said Disney will distribute around six movies a
year for DreamWorks. It will also likely provide some form of
financing for DreamWorks, either in the form of a loan or a
line of credit of at least $150 million, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the deal, Disney would collect a distribution fee of
at least 8 percent from DreamWorks, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DreamWorks has produced movies such as "Saving Private
Ryan" and the action hit "Transformers," but has been looking
for cash since splitting off from Paramount Pictures last year
and taking itself private with the backing of Indian media
conglomerate Reliance ADA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DreamWorks SKG and Universal Pictures severed their film
distribution pact on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Universal, a unit of the NBC Universal media division of
General Electric Co (GE.N), said it broke off "several weeks"
of talks on a distribution deal after the smaller DreamWorks
"demanded material changes to previously agreed upon terms."

to Provide Hands-On Assistance

Coca-Cola CEO and Special Olympics Board Member Muhtar Kent Attends Opening
Ceremonies, Presents $10,000 Donation to Games Organizing Committee
BOISE, Idaho--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company is helping to refresh thousands of athletes, families and
fans at the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games through a wide variety of
programs that celebrate the accomplishments of the more than 2,000 athletes with
intellectual disabilities gathering here for the Opening Ceremony tomorrow. 

As part of its global sponsorship, Coca-Cola is providing financial support to
the local organizing committee, donating beverages, creating marketing campaigns
to raise awareness of the World Winter Games and has brought more than 20
employees of the Company and its bottling partner, Coca-Cola Enterprises, to
serve as volunteers at events. The employees were chosen through a national
competition and selected on the basis of their ongoing involvement with
community organizations. The associates will spend one week on site during the
World Winter Games helping to organize sport activities, providing beverages and
helping serve meals to athletes. 

"The values of Special Olympics of understanding, acceptance and inclusion are
shared by Coca-Cola," said Muhtar Kent, President and Chief Executive Officer,
The Coca-Cola Company and a member of the Special Olympics International Board
of Directors. "Giving our associates the opportunity to connect directly with
Special Olympics athletes and their families brings those values to life and
supports the mission in a meaningful way." 

Since the establishment of Special Olympics in 1968, The Coca-Cola Company has
been a proud global sponsor, providing monetary and in-kind contributions,
hands-on volunteer assistance, equipment, uniforms, and other materials and
services for Special Olympics competitions and community activities around the

In addition to its global sponsorship, Coca-Cola also will donate $10,000 to the
Games Organizing Committee for the World Winter Games. The funds, raised through
a donation of a portion of Coca-Cola sales, will be presented by Mr. Kent in a
ceremony at the "Special Olympics Sports Experience" on Sunday, February 8. 

"The Coca-Cola Company has been a strong supporter of Special Olympics since day
one," said Timothy Shriver, Chairman of Special Olympics. "Coca-Cola`s support
over the years - from refreshing our athletes and their families during
competition, conducting marketing initiatives to raise the profile of our
movement and to now creating employee programs to bring more people into the
Special Olympics family -- has helped us foster a greater acceptance and
understanding of those with intellectual disabilities. This is the true heart of
our mission and an example of the deep partnership we have with Coca-Cola." 

For this year`s event, Coca-Cola and its local bottling partner Swire Coca-Cola
USA, helped to raise awareness for the World Winter Games through advertising
and promotions including:

* At participating retailers throughout the Boise area, in-store signage and
specially marked Coca-Cola 12 Oz Fridge Packs included a message promoting the
Special Olympics World Winter Games. For every 12 Oz pack sold, Coca-Cola
donated 10 cents, raising $10,000 to support the staging of the events in Boise.

* At participating convenience stores, Coca-Cola gave a free limited edition
2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games "Fan Pin" to anyone purchasing three 20
oz. Coca-Cola products. 
* Throughout the area, Coca-Cola delivery trucks featured graphics that
encouraged people to "Be a Fan of Joy" and promoted the Special Olympics World
Winter Games. 
* Coca-Cola also created awareness by using radio advertising to promote the
Games. 
* At the World Winter Games, Coca-Cola is also participating in the "Sports
Experience" where visitors can interact with Special Olympics athletes and
participate in several sports with them such as basketball, table tennis or
floor hockey. 
* The Coca-Cola Polar Bear, from the well-known animated holiday television
commercials, will be at the Sports Experience entertaining guests and posing for
photographs.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said it secured a deal to distribute films by Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Studios in a pact short on details but one that provides much-needed cash for the Oscar-winning director's outfit and reaps long-term revenues for Disney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney Studios Chairman Dick Cook said on Monday his unit will market and distribute about six films each year for DreamWorks, the fledgling studio helmed by Spielberg, but refrained from disclosing details of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal has reported that Disney will earn at least an 8 percent fee off the box office gross of DreamWorks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;films, and would lend the studio $150 million. But Cook would only say those numbers were off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ideas are right, the numbers may be wrong," Cook told Reuters in a telephone interview. "It hasn't been entirely accurate..., the stuff that has been reported today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was from some old proposals or old deals along the way," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DreamWorks Studios is Spielberg's newly created production unit, and is separate from listed DreamWorks Animation SKG Incor the DreamWorks SKG Inc private firm that Spielberg founded with media moguls David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In exchange for mounting promotional campaigns and sending movies to theaters, Disney earns a share of DreamWorks' films' box office grosses. In the case of a huge hit like DreamWorks SKG Inc's "Transformers", which made $708 million, the fees would easily be in the tens of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney stepped in after a previously announced -- but never consummated -- deal between DreamWorks and General Electric Co's Universal Studios fell apart, because of what a source close to the matter described as disagreements over financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larry Haverty, manager of Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust, which owns Disney shares, saw the deal as positive for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's revenues without a lot of costs (for Disney). It's a very good situation for them and for DreamWorks, it solves the funding situation for (DreamWorks)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spielberg and DreamWorks chief executive Stacey Snider were seeking distribution, and some financing, for films they planned to make with India's Reliance BIG Entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliance agreed last year to match up to $500 million in financing for the new studio but DreamWorks had trouble securing its share of funding in the worsening global economic conditions, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DreamWorks turned to Disney late last year when Universal balked at its demand for more upfront money and fees from Universal's TV distribution pact with HBO, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Disney-distributed DreamWorks film is set to hit theaters in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'LONG TERM VIEW'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DreamWorks Studios now owns the rights to a variety of film projects, expected to include a remake of the 1998 French comedy "The Dinner Game" and fantasy adventure series "The 39 Clues".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future DreamWorks films will carry Disney's Touchstone Pictures banner, an adult-oriented niche that Disney had pared to two to three films a year during a 2006 restructuring that cut the studio's total output and a quarter of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney enjoyed years of strong growth from its big-budget "Pirates of the Caribbean", "National Treasure" and "Chronicles of Narnia" franchises, as well as its Pixar-Disney films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the risks inherent in big budgets and hit-driven filmmaking caught up with the studio in 2008 when it posted two steep sequential quarterly drops in profit and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal returns Disney's slate to close to its pre-2006 number of 17 or 18 films a year and will add workers to the studio's staff, Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it spares Disney the expense of making less pricey films that can fill revenue gaps left by a failed "event" film, such as last year's underperformer, "Prince Caspian."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook said the tie-up of two iconic names "didn't have anything to do with a quarter, or a movie... we are taking a very long term view of this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DreamWorks films under its Reliance partnership will complement Disney's family-friendly fare, Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think (DreamWorks) are going to make all different kinds of movies in all different price points and genres," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook described as "erroneous" and "ridiculous" rumors that Disney wanted to sell its Miramax film production unit, which focuses on art-house fare such as "Shakespeare in Love."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney closed down 1 cent, or 0.05 percent, at $19.44 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 9 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on
Monday it will begin next year to disclose most payments made
to doctors and other U.S. healthcare professionals, to comply

aims by early 2010 to begin listing its payments for
consulting, speaking engagements and clinical trials on its Web
site www.pfizer.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This makes Pfizer the first biopharmaceutical company to
commit to reporting payments for conducting Phase I to Phase IV
clinical trials, in addition to disclosing payments for
speaking and consulting," Pfizer said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such trials run the gamut from earliest-stage human trials
to so-called post-marketing studies conducted after medicines
are approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based Pfizer said it collaborated with almost
8,000 clinical researchers last year in more than 280 studies,
making payments to many investigators and their research
centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Greater transparency, we feel, will lead to greater trust

medical writers who do not prescribe medicines and who are
sometimes listed as authors of formal study findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In some cases, we will compensate a technical writer to
work under the direction of a clinical trial investigator and
the technical writers' contributions are publicly disclosed in

medical journal articles are written by "ghostwriters" who have
not actually been involved in clinical trials, but nevertheless
make strong conclusions about a drug's effectiveness and safety
that can impress doctors and boost sales of the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said medical journal articles written with the help
of its hired technical writers do not constitute "ghostwriting"

section of the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other large drugmakers, including Eli Lilly  Co (LLY.N),
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Merck  Co (MRK.N) have previously
announced varying levels of financial disclosure for their
payments to doctors, including speaking or consulting fees.

would easily be in the tens of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney stepped in after a previously announced -- but never
consummated -- deal between DreamWorks and General Electric
Co's (GE.N) Universal Studios fell apart, because of what a
source close to the matter described as disagreements over
financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Larry Haverty, manager of Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust,
which owns Disney shares, saw the deal as positive for both
parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's revenues without a lot of costs (for Disney). It's a
very good situation for them and for DreamWorks, it solves the
funding situation for (DreamWorks)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spielberg and DreamWorks chief executive Stacey Snider were
seeking distribution, and some financing, for films they
planned to make with India's Reliance BIG Entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reliance agreed last year to match up to $500 million in
financing for the new studio but DreamWorks had trouble
securing its share of funding in the worsening global economic
conditions, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DreamWorks turned to Disney late last year when Universal
balked at its demand for more upfront money and fees from
Universal's TV distribution pact with HBO, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first Disney-distributed DreamWorks film is set to hit
theaters in 2010. [ID:nWEN4113]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'LONG TERM VIEW'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DreamWorks Studios now owns the rights to a variety of film
projects, expected to include a remake of the 1998 French
comedy "The Dinner Game" and fantasy adventure series "The 39
Clues".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Future DreamWorks films will carry Disney's Touchstone
Pictures banner, an adult-oriented niche that Disney had pared
to two to three films a year during a 2006 restructuring that
cut the studio's total output and a quarter of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney enjoyed years of strong growth from its big-budget
"Pirates of the Caribbean", "National Treasure" and "Chronicles
of Narnia" franchises, as well as its Pixar-Disney films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the risks inherent in big budgets and hit-driven
filmmaking caught up with the studio in 2008 when it posted two
steep sequential quarterly drops in profit and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal returns Disney's slate to close to its pre-2006
number of 17 or 18 films a year and will add workers to the
studio's staff, Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it spares Disney the expense of making less pricey
films that can fill revenue gaps left by a failed "event" film,
such as last year's underperformer, "Prince Caspian."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cook said the tie-up of two iconic names "didn't have
anything to do with a quarter, or a movie... we are taking a
very long term view of this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The DreamWorks films under its Reliance partnership will
complement Disney's family-friendly fare, Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think (DreamWorks) are going to make all different kinds
of movies in all different price points and genres," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cook described as "erroneous" and "ridiculous" rumors that
Disney wanted to sell its Miramax film production unit, which
focuses on art-house fare such as "Shakespeare in Love."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Disney closed down 1 cent, or 0.05 percent, at
$19.44 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 9 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on
Monday it will begin next year to disclose most payments to
doctors and other U.S. healthcare professionals, to comply with
the spirit of recently proposed legislation and boost trust in
its products and collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker by sales, said it
aims by early 2010 to begin listing its payments for
consulting, speaking engagements and clinical trials on its Web
site www.pfizer.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This makes Pfizer the first biopharmaceutical company to
commit to reporting payments for conducting Phase I to Phase IV
clinical trials, in addition to disclosing payments for
speaking and consulting," Pfizer said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such trials run the gamut from earliest-stage human trials
to so-called post-marketing studies conducted after medicines
are approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based Pfizer said it collaborated with almost
8,000 clinical researchers last year in more than 280 studies,
making payments to many investigators and their research
centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Greater transparency, we feel, will lead to greater trust
and bring new medical innovations" forward, said company
spokeswoman Kristen Neese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other large drugmakers, including Eli Lilly  Co (LLY.N),
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Merck  Co (MRK.N) have previously
announced varying levels of financial disclosure for their
payments to doctors, including speaking or consulting fees.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, preparing for highly charged Congressional hearings this week, called for stricter regulation and expanding oversight to the largest hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By penning his opinion article in Monday's Financial Times, Blankfein may win over U.S. lawmakers who are under pressure to overhaul the nation's failed regulatory system, industry experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be an incredibly hostile environment. Bank CEOs are not negotiating from a position of strength," said Bert Ely, a veteran business consultant in the Washington area. "Blankfein's saying 'We'll play ball, but we do have concerns.' I think this is going to be the posture for everybody who will be there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Blankfein and executives from seven other banks that received $125 billion in Treasury capital last year will appear before the House Financial Services Committee. Goldman received $10 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market meltdown and the mounting cost of the taxpayer-funded bailout has fueled a backlash against banks and their executives. The public and lawmakers say banks are not redeploying the capital as needed mortgages and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Blankfein may have helped diffuse some of that anger and steer the direction of regulatory changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's taking the politically wise high road. The need for so much regulation is abhorrent, but the industry demonstrated that it's absolutely required," veteran banker and Lane Berry  Co co-founder Frederick Lane said. "This gives Blankfein a voice at table and it helps his own lobbying effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other proposals, the head of the world's largest investment bank said capital, credit and underwriting standards should fall under more proactive regulation. He also called for applying fair value accounting consistently across companies and for greater cooperation among regulators worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For policymakers and regulators, it should be clear that self-regulation has its limits," Blankfein wrote. "At the very least, fixing a system-wide problem, elevating standards or driving the industry to a collective response requires effective central regulation and the convening power of regulators."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein also said he was in favor of expanding regulation to the largest hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All pools of capital that depend on the smooth functioning of the financial system and are large enough to be a burden on it in a crisis should be subject to some degree of regulation," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein speaks from a position of relative strength, since Goldman generated $2.3 billion of profit last year. The top executives at Goldman were also early in announcing they would forego bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank paid out $11 billion in salaries, bonuses and benefits last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of Lehman Brothers' LEHMQ.PK collapse, Goldman became a bank holding company under Federal Reserve watch. The conversion meant Goldman entered a new era of closer scrutiny and restrictions on how it does business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street's lobbying group, called for similar regulatory change in October. The group favors broader oversight across all types of financial firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A financial markets stability regulator with oversight of insurance companies, private equity firms, hedge funds and other financial firms that are systemically important is absolutely key to building a stronger, more robust financial system," SIFMA spokesman Travis Larson said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamar Frankel, a Boston University professor and expert on regulation, said Blankfein's opinion piece acknowledges that regulators are needed to impose fair play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is saying is the government needs to limit antisocial behavior from the outside because we can't do it on the inside. As we've seen, self-regulation was not effective," Frankel said. "The most important thing is restoring public trust, and Blankfein shows he recognized that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initiative Will be First to Include Payments for Both Clinical Development and
Product Education
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc today announced its plans to make publicly available its compensation
of U.S. healthcare professionals for consulting, speaking engagements and
clinical trials. The disclosure will include payments made to practicing U.S.
physicians and other healthcare providers, as well as principal investigators,
major academic institutions and research sites for clinical research. This makes
Pfizer the first biopharmaceutical company to commit to reporting payments for
conducting Phase I-IV clinical trials in addition to disclosing payments for
speaking and consulting. This disclosure demonstrates Pfizer`s commitment to
increased transparency and public candor. 

Pfizer is committing to share this information in order to provide greater
clarity and understanding of the valuable scientific innovations and improved
patient care that result from these collaborations with healthcare
professionals. 

"These collaborations are an essential part of medical progress," said Jeffrey
B. Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer. "Simply put, without
these collaborations, Pfizer would not be able to continue delivering the
medical innovations that the global health community has come to expect." 

In 2008, Pfizer collaborated with almost 8,000 clinical investigators to conduct
more than 280 studies to better understand how our medicines can be safely and
effectively used to the benefit of patients. Pfizer makes payments to
investigators and research institutions to compensate them for the work done on
the company`s behalf. As part of this initiative, Pfizer will ensure that
payments are posted in an accurate, clear and consistent manner that clearly
demonstrates the recipient name or institution, the payment made and the service
provided. 

Pfizer`s plans reflect the spirit of recent proposed legislation regarding
payments to physicians in that it includes payments to practicing physicians and
other healthcare providers as well as to principal investigators and
institutions for Phase I-IV clinical trials sponsored by Pfizer. 

Pfizer plans to publish its first annual online update on www.pfizer.com in
early 2010. The report will include payments made from July 1, 2009, going
forward. 

Parameters under consideration include reporting payments to recipients whose
aggregate amount exceeds $500 in a calendar year, including the value of
non-monetary items, such as meals, that exceed $25 in value. 

Specifically, this includes disclosing all payments to:

* All practicing healthcare providers who can prescribe medicines; 
* Major institutions for ongoing clinical trials; and 
* All principal investigators and other entities for Phase I-IV clinical trials
sponsored by Pfizer beginning after July 1, 2009.

The payments include those for:

* Clinical development and commercial consulting; 
* Promotional speaking; 
* Phase I-IV clinical trials; 
* Investigator-initiated research; and 
* Meals and other non-monetary items.

"Pfizer has made an important step forward with this extensive disclosure
policy. The release of financial information about consulting, education and
clinical research activities sets a standard for transparency in the
pharmaceutical and medical device industries," said Andrew F. Leuchter, M.D.,
Professor of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, Associate Dean, David Geffen
School of Medicine at UCLA. "I believe policies such as these will help restore
public confidence in the relationships physicians and academic medical centers
have with the industry." 

Pfizer is committed to increasing transparency and disclosure of activities that
relate to the public interest:

* In 2002, Pfizer began to register its clinical trials on the public database
www.clinicaltrials.gov. As of 2008, the company registers all clinical trials
(Phase I and beyond) as well as non-interventional studies with prospective data
collection. To date, the company has registered more than 1,000 trials. 
* Also in 2002, Pfizer began publicly reporting U.S. political contributions. 
* In 2004, Pfizer began publicly posting the results of its clinical trials at
www.clinicalstudyresults.org. As of 2005, results of all patient studies (Phase
I and beyond) are posted, and starting in 2008, the results of all clinical
studies, whether in patients or normal volunteers, are posted, as well as the
results of prospective observational studies.

* In December 2006, the company launched a regularly updated public website,
describing compounds in its drug development pipeline and detailing their
progress. 
* In April 2007, Pfizer began reporting its FDA post-marketing commitments
relating to the safe and effective use of Pfizer medicines. 
* In May, 2008, Pfizer began reporting its non-clinical grants and charitable
contributions to patient, medical and scientific organizations on
www.pfizer.com. 
* In September 2008, Pfizer launched its unbranded Medicine Safety Web site.

"We are committed to taking the steps necessary to achieve greater transparency
in our interactions with U.S. healthcare professionals," Mr. Kindler said. "By
disclosing payments to physicians, we are breaking down a major barrier and
increasing the trust healthcare providers must have when prescribing our
medicines. To be viewed as an open, candid and transparent company, we must
address the concerns of our customers and take action. This new initiative does
just that."

&lt;p&gt;AMERICAN CANYON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
AMCAN Beverages, Inc. (AMCAN), a subsidiary of The Coca Cola Company, will pay a
total of $7.59 million to the City of American Canyon in Napa County to address
violations under AMCAN`s wastewater treatment permit. 

The settlement, which addresses a number of alleged offenses that were
identified by the City of American Canyon, involves payment of a civil penalty
of $3.5 million, with the remainder being restitution paid to the City for
certain alleged avoided fees and costs incurred. 

The City operates a wastewater plant and a publicly owned treatment works into
which AMCAN and other businesses discharge wastewater through a system governed
by permits. 

AMCAN`s permit required its non-alcoholic beverage production plant to initially
treat wastewater at its site through its own treatment system before discharging
it into the city`s treatment works. From May 2007 through September 2007, the
City monitored wastewater discharged by AMCAN and discovered high concentrations
of contaminants that interfered with the City`s wastewater treatment process and
posed an environmental hazard. These levels were different and much higher than
in sample results submitted by AMCAN during the same time period. 

During the same time, AMCAN management and their legal representatives became
aware of certain issues associated with AMCAN`s wastewater operations, launched
their own investigation, and in September 2007 disclosed their findings to the
City. AMCAN thereafter cooperated with the City. The City later alleged, based
on its own investigation and disclosures by AMCAN, that violations took place as
early as January 2005, with additional violations for the period of November
2007 through May 31, 2008. Those discoveries led to extensive settlement
discussions between the City and AMCAN to resolve all alleged violations. 

In commenting on the settlement, attorney William Ross, who represented the City
of American Canyon, along with Special Counsel William Carter and Greg
Patterson, acknowledged AMCAN`s cooperation. 

"AMCAN, a subsidiary of The Coca Cola Company, acted proactively to report and
correct conditions that led to the alleged permit violations, and has
responsibly reimbursed the City for its costs. At the same time, this case
vividly demonstrates the city`s dedication to fulfilling its role as a good
steward over the environment," Ross said. 

"When AMCAN, a subsidiary of The Coca Cola Company, discovered the problems
involving some former employees at their American Canyon Plant, the company held
itself accountable, cooperated with our investigation, took action to address
our concerns, and agreed to a fair settlement that will benefit the City and its
residents. If more of Corporate America behaved with such resolve, we might not
have some of the issues that we as a society are all struggling with today,"
said American Canyon City Manager Richard Ramirez. 

Incorporated in 1992, The City of American Canyon is located in southern Napa
County and has a population of 17,000. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;Fourteen ExxonMobil Facilities Welcome Middle School Girls as `New Hires`
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
More than 3,000 middle school girls will be greeted as "New Hires" in the next
week as they visit local ExxonMobil facilities and get a first-hand experience
as an engineer. The event, taking place nationwide at ExxonMobil locations, is
part of the company`s participation in Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day and
National Engineers Week.

For the second year, the company also will host the ExxonMobil Girls in
Engineering Festival in Houston where middle school girls from three
Houston-area school districts will participate in a day-long event on Feb. 14. 

Both activities are rewarding to middle school girls as ExxonMobil employees
seek to persuade them that engineering is "cool" and opens doors of opportunity
to them if they choose it as a career. 

"As a corporation, we want to unlock the potential of our nation`s future
through educational awareness programs such as Introduce a Girl to Engineering
Day and Girls in Engineering Festival in hopes of showing young women that
engineering is a field where even the sky won`t be the limit," said Rex
Tillerson, chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corporation. "The girls
who take part in these activities will experience the fun and excitement of
engineering and also see successful women in high-profile jobs. It`s one thing
to dream about the future; it`s even more compelling to actually see and meet
some of the brightest engineering minds in the world who are creating it." 

This is the ninth year that ExxonMobil has hosted Introduce a Girl to
Engineering Day, providing the company with an opportunity to positively impact
girls during their formative years and spark their interest in this critical
field. 

"When girls arrive at our facilities, we welcome them as though they were new
hires coming for their first day of orientation," Tillerson added. "By doing
this, we are planting the seeds of opportunity in their minds and showing them
that engineering as a career can be well within the realm of possibility." 

Also as part of National Engineers Week, the ExxonMobil Girls in Engineering
Festival will host 200 middle school girls from the Houston, Cypress Fairbanks
and Spring Branch independent school districts at the Spring Branch Education
Center. During the event, the participating girls will sharpen their engineering
skills through team-oriented workshops and competitions. A panel of four highly
successful female engineers, including meteorologist Casey Curry, NASA engineer
Lisa Spence, and scientists from ExxonMobil, will take part in a discussion with
the girls, before they also enjoy the witty and comical Professor Smart`s Fun
with Physics. 

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the growing demand for qualified
engineers will soon reach a critical level and about 80 percent of new jobs
created in the next 10 years will require science, technology, engineering or
math skills. At the same time, women make up 46 percent of the workforce but
hold just 26 percent of the country`s technical jobs. 

This year`s National Engineers Week is Feb. 16-20.

&lt;p&gt;Pilot Program to Deliver Enhanced Access to Higher-Quality, More Cost-Effective
Care; 

Improves Financial Incentives for Primary-Care Doctors
PHOENIX &amp; TUCSON, Ariz.--(Business Wire)--
UnitedHealthcare, a UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) company, and IBM (NYSE:IBM)
announced plans for a collaboration with select primary-care physician practices
in Arizona to launch a transformative new health care initiative called the
"Patient-Centered Medical Home" (PCMH) model. 

Aimed at strengthening the primary-care patient/physician relationship to
enhance communication and service across the health care delivery system, the
PCMH model provides comprehensive, information-supported primary care for
children, youth and adults. In the PCMH model, patients receive more
comprehensive and coordinated care from their primary-care physician, or
"medical home," rather than fragmented and episodic care from various health
care providers or facilities operating without all the information needed to
define a safe context for care. 

In the PCMH model, primary-care physicians partner with their patients to
understand their needs and preferences, manage their health care, and facilitate
any care needed from other professionals. The model places special emphasis on
preventing disease and improving the care of chronic conditions, and emphasizes
behavioral health support and patient education - not simply the diagnosis and
treatment of injury and illness. 

The new pilot program, open to UnitedHealthcare`s employer-sponsored, Medicare
Advantage and Medicaid health plan customers, will include four to six
primary-care practices from UnitedHealthcare`s physician network in Phoenix and
Tucson. UnitedHealthcare will provide the selected primary-care practices with
technology, infrastructure support and care coordination, with the goal of
leveraging improved information systems to enhance patient access to care, the
quality and safety of the care experience, and patient satisfaction with health
care providers. 

IBM, with some 386,000 employees around the world, led in the formation of the
physician-employer Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative in 2006, of which
most major U.S. trade associations, consumer groups and leading health benefits
and services companies are now members. In 2007, IBM spent more than $21 million
for Arizona employees and their dependents in health benefits costs.
UnitedHealthcare is IBM`s largest health plan in Arizona, serving nearly 11,000
beneficiaries. In support of the pilot, IBM will encourage these employees to
seek primary-care services from the physicians participating in the pilot
program. 

UnitedHealthcare and IBM expect the PCMH model of care will, over time, assist
in lowering overall health care costs for patients and their employers by
reducing emergency room visits, hospitalizations and disabilities that result
from the lack of immediate access to primary-care physicians when people have
medical needs. 

"UnitedHealthcare and IBM are committed to supporting primary-care physicians
through the Patient-Centered Medical Home model, which provides for more
centralized and comprehensive care that is focused on preventive care and
disease prevention," said Dawn Bazarko, RN, MPH, UnitedHealthcare senior vice
president, Clinical Innovation. "We believe the Patient-Centered Medical Home
model enhances the delivery of higher-quality, more coordinated care, while
improving outcomes and reducing health care costs." 

The PCMH model of health care delivery provides benefits to physicians as well
as patients. Primary-care physicians providing care based on the PCMH model
stand to receive enhanced reimbursement in recognition of superior care
coordination and improvements to access, communications, delivery of preventive
and chronic care, and patient experience and satisfaction. 

"We at IBM know that established and continuous access to a personal
primary-care physician who really looks out for the whole person and not just a
disease is proven to produce materially better health outcomes at lower costs.
Still, our system in the United States is allowing the professionals trained to
deliver this type of care to decline precipitously," said Martin Sepulveda,
M.D., IBM vice president, Integrated Health Services. "Through our
transformative pilot program with UnitedHealthcare, leading primary-care
practices and our own employees in Arizona, we are stepping up both our
commitment and our actions to assist in reversing that decline and make
patient-centered primary care a reality for our own employees and those of other
companies across the United States." 

The PCMH model has been developed by primary-care physicians in the United
States including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College
of Physicians, the American Osteopathic Association, and the American Academy of
Pediatricians. Last year, UnitedHealth Group announced its collaboration with
these organizations, a move that has led to the launch of this pilot program in
Arizona. One of the goals of the model and the pilot program is to highlight the
importance of primary care to patients` health and well-being. According to the
American Academy of Family Physicians, fewer than 8 percent of medical school
graduates choose to go into primary care. 

"UnitedHealth Group recognizes the importance of enhancing the quality
capabilities and rewards for primary-care practice as a key element in the
provision of coordinated, comprehensive patient-centered care," said Reed
Tuckson, M.D., UnitedHealth Group`s executive vice president and chief of
medical affairs. "We are especially pleased to partner with an innovative
company like IBM to seek new solutions for enhancing cost-effective care
outcomes for their valued employees. We continue to applaud the leadership of
our nation`s primary-care specialty societies and physician practices in
Arizona."

&lt;p&gt;LAKE FOREST, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Wonderware today announced that future releases of its industry-leading mobile
workforce and decision support system software, IntelaTrac, will leverage new
Microsoft technologies for improved presentation and reporting functionality for
the mobile workforce. 

Wonderware will be adding compatibility with several of Microsoft`s enhanced
.NET Framework 3.0 capabilities. Future Wonderware IntelaTrac developments will
feature Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), which is a graphical subsystem in
.NET Framework 3.0 that uses a markup language known as XAML for rich user
interface development. 

"With current Wonderware development efforts focused on the .NET framework, WPF
is the next logical step for enhancing the functionality of IntelaTrac," said
John Madden, director of product development for Wonderware Mobile Solutions.
"We expect that the clean separation between the user interface and business
logic that WPF supports will greatly increase Wonderware software development
productivity. Wonderware also expects to be able to speed our quality assurance
and issue resolution times, while simultaneously speeding time-to-market for
future releases of Wonderware IntelaTrac. 

"In addition, we believe that the commonality between Microsoft WPF and
Silverlight technologies should enable Wonderware to more easily extend some
desktop experiences to the Web and mobile clients." 

Wonderware IntelaTrac software reporting also will be enhanced with the addition
of connectivity to Microsoft`s SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). SSRS is a
server-based report generation software system from Microsoft that can be used
to prepare and deliver a variety of interactive and printed reports via the
Internet. 

"SQL Server Reporting Services is a rich reporting platform that delivers
business intelligence to everyone in the enterprise," said Jared Bienz, ISV
architect advisor with Microsoft. "Reports are built in a familiar Microsoft
Office-like design that can be shared with peers and workgroups to promote
collaboration and knowledge transfer. SSRS also integrates with SharePoint,
adding value to the infrastructure many customers already have in place." 

Wonderware currently offers a custom reporting solution with IntelaTrac. With
the addition of SSRS, Wonderware can deliver new reporting features more
quickly. By adopting a proven reporting platform like SSRS, Wonderware will be
able to focus its efforts on feature upgrade requests. 

"Customers will be excited to know that many of their functionality suggestions,
such as caching, subscriptions and exporting to Excel, Word or PDF, will be
available out of the box with the future use of this new mobile platform
technology," Madden said.

&lt;p&gt;  NASHUA, NH, Feb 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Business and IT professionals are increasingly looking at how to leverage
their existing investment and knowledgebase in Microsoft(R) SharePoint(R)
to achieve success with business process management (BPM) initiatives.

    A new interview with Mauro Cardarelli, director of Portals and
Collaboration at  Vitale Caturano, examines strategies for linking 
document scanning with SharePoint to eliminate business process
bottlenecks.

    To read the complete Cardarelli interview, please click here.

    Cardarelli sees great value to be gained by automating paper-based
processes within SharePoint. According to Cardarelli, "Adding document
scanning capabilities to SharePoint lets you place document capture
activities at the points most appropriate in the workflow. A product like
the  eCopy Connector for Microsoft SharePoint plugs in nicely with
SharePoint because it makes scanning easy and has  document imaging
capabilities like OCR to create searchable text -- a feature not native
to SharePoint."

    When looking at how organizations can leverage document scanning to
advance BPM, Cardarelli advised, "The people involved in a specific
business process are the ones best able to determine at what step in that
process paper should be added to a workflow. Companies don't want to hire
administrators to add paper into applications. The faster and more
reliably business process participants can add paper into SharePoint, the
more quickly the entire organization can leverage that data out of
SharePoint."

&lt;p&gt;REST API Simplifies Application Integration With SharePoint
RESTON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Bamboo Solutions, a leading provider of technologies that enhance Microsoft
SharePoint, today announces the availability of a new REST API for SharePoint.
REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular software architectural
approach used with distributed web-based applications, and includes principles
which outline how software resources are defined and addressed. Bamboo`s REST
API for SharePoint is the newest feature of Bamboo`s MashPoint platform, a
community-driven platform designed to enable enterprise Mashups and integration
with SharePoint. The new REST API simplifies the process of integrating web
services with SharePoint. MashPoint, including the REST API for SharePoint, is
available as a free download from Bamboo`s website. 

With Bamboo`s REST API for SharePoint, accessing data or functionality within
SharePoint is straightforward. Developers can interact with any SharePoint-based
resource via REST`s familiar vocabulary of actions. In addition, the Bamboo API
automatically translates SharePoint-based data into a wide variety of standard
formats, such as ATOM, XHTML, JSON, vCard, iCalendar and more. 

As part of this release, Bamboo has published a number of working use cases as a
starting point for developers, including the ability to render a
SharePoint-based calendar with a Google Calendar. Use cases are graphically
displayed with how-to information on Bamboo`s website, www.bamboosolutions.com. 

"Our goal with REST API for SharePoint is to make it easier for developers to
extend the functionality of SharePoint with additional applications, similar to
how we extend SharePoint with our Web Parts," said Mike Tanner, CEO of Bamboo
Solutions. "By connecting SharePoint to the open Web through our REST API for
SharePoint, Bamboo is helping to expand the use of SharePoint in the new world
of Web 2.0 and enterprise computing."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Feb 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new services and products to help clients
build a new, more dynamic infrastructure that will bring more
intelligence, automation, integration, and efficiencies to the digital
and physical worlds. As a result, it will enable businesses and
governments to better respond to and manage challenges presented by
today's globally integrated planet.

    The new products and services enable clients to use powerful computing
systems to manage and gain insight from an increasing number of things in
their physical infrastructure that are being instrumented with intelligent
sensors. For example, a utility could build a smart grid to eliminate
wasted power, delivering power to where it is needed most, in real time. A
smart grid also helps a utilities' customers to monitor their energy
consumption in real time and view stresses in its electrical grid
instantly to schedule pre-emptive maintenance.

    Key requirements for the new dynamic infrastructure are:


--  The integration of digital and physical infrastructure, providing the
ability to use information technology to manage business processes,
increasingly intelligent physical infrastructure and assets, and drive new
and improved services as a result.  

--  The ability to manage, store, and analyze the 15 new petabytes of
information the world is now generating per day -- eight-times more
information than in all US libraries combined.   This will enable clients
to address massive information management requirements associated with
today's governance, compliance, availability, retention, risk, and security
challenges. 

--  A reduction of massive inefficiencies and greater resilience in today's
interconnected world.  Data centers costs, for example -- for energy,
space, etc. -- have risen eight-times since 1996; and average distributed
server utilization is just 6-15%. 

    
In response, IBM announced products and services to address these
requirements. IDC estimates the market opportunity for the software,
servers, technologies, and services to manage the world's converged IT and
physical infrastructure to be $122 billion by 2012.

    The Integration and Management of Digital and Physical Worlds

    Today's physical infrastructure is becoming instrumented. Sensors are
being embedded everywhere: In bridges and roads, cars, appliances,
cameras, pipelines, even in medicine and livestock. At the same time, the
Internet is allowing all of this embedded computing to be interconnected,
leading to a trillion connected and intelligent things, and the massive
volumes of data they will produce.

    IBM is working with thousands of clients around the world, applying its
deep industry expertise and experience, to link these increasingly more
intelligent things to powerful new backend systems that can process all
that data, and applying advanced analytics capable of turning it into real
insight, in real time.

    Building on that expertise, IBM today announced new industry-specific
services and software to help clients integrate their digital and physical
infrastructure. Through the new services, IBM will help clients map and
integrate intelligent things with backend systems, enabling them to gain
new insight into their operations and provide better services as a result.
The new offerings include:


--  A new software and services offering, IBM Service Management Industry
Solutions, that is customized for seven industries: Utilities, chemicals &amp;
petroleum, telecommunications retail, banking, electronics and
manufacturing. The new offering includes IBM service management software
and services from IBM Global Business Services, IBM Global Technology
Services and specialized IBM Business Partner capabilities. Together, they
enable organizations to design and implement IT systems that centrally
manage and monitor an entire industry infrastructure, enabling greater
performance of both traditional assets such as manufacturing robotic
equipment as well as emerging technologies like "smart meters" and RFID.




--  New services to help clients design and implement service management
strategies.  IBM's Service Management Implementation Enhancements &amp;
Accelerators design services and deployment planning.  Through these
services, IBM helps clients streamline the implementation of Tivoli
software components so businesses can realize faster returns.  These new
services complement the IBM Service Management Industry Solutions.




--  A new governance consulting practice.  Through the practice, IBM works
with clients to design governance systems to help mitigate risks related to
business changes, changing market conditions and regulatory requirements.
By providing clients with greater visibility into the performance of their
businesses and control over the management of business processes, IBM helps
them improve their ability to respond to changes, and gain greater command
over their hardware, software, people and information assets. 



--  New Tivoli Service Automation Manager software, which automates the
design, deployment and management of services such as middleware,
applications, hardware and networks, tasks that today are largely done
manually and thus subject to error, time constraints and other human
limitations. For example, the new software would enable a manufacturer to
deploy a new quality assurance application in dramatically less time than
it takes today and with far less disruption to the operation. 



--  New Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager software, which helps organizations
simplify the lifecycle of encryption keys by enabling them to centralize,
automate and strengthen security through key management processes, with an
increasing number of IT infrastructure elements having built in encryption
to protect them.  

    
Managing Staggering Amounts of Information

    IBM is announcing new technologies to help clients more securely and
efficiently manage skyrocketing data:


--  To reduce data proliferation, IBM today announced an integrated
appliance, including a server, storage, and "data deduplication" software.
The new IBM TS7650 ProtecTIER(R) Deduplication Appliance helps eliminates
redundant copies of the same data, reducing it to a single instance of the
data and eliminating duplicative copies.  This is a critical capability as
information needs continue to escalate, making data deduplication one of
the hottest areas in Storage.  The offering is a result of IBM's
acquisition of Diligent Technologies in 2008. 



--  IBM announced enhancements to the IBM XIV Storage System, including a
new lower point of entry and interoperability enhancements. The new, 65
percent smaller minimum capacity configuration is designed for mid-range
customers and enterprise organizations with initial smaller capacity needs.
XIV's design provides fast access to information even as data grows across
traditional applications, such as financial services or health care, or new
workloads, such as digital media and Web 2.0.  



--  IBM is announcing Full-Disk Encryption on its IBM System Storage
DS8000, which can help increase security and reduce costs and complexity
through innovative
self-encrypting drives.  Data breaches and new regulations have fueled an
interest in IBM's industry-leading self-encrypting storage solutions. After
almost three years of enabling IBM clients to successfully secure their
backup tapes with self-encrypting tape drives, the DS8000 series now
extends this crucial technology to the disk system. By combining the DS8000
with its full-disk encrypting drives and the flexible Tivoli Key Lifecycle
Manager, the DS8000 security solution can not only secure data at rest but
can also offer a simple, cost-effective solution for "securely erasing"
disk drives that are being retired or used for a different purpose.




--  IBM Internet Security System's new data security services are designed
with next-generation security technology to help clients secure their
sensitive information from the enterprise to the edge of a network. With
these new security offerings, IBM can help prevent information loss via:
Network extrusion prevention; implementing and managing encryption
solutions to help protect data even when an endpoint device is lost or
stolen; securing data more effectively while it's in use on an endpoint
device; monitoring and controlling the use of external storage devices for
storing and transporting data; and enhancing the security of inbound and
outbound email.   



--  New InfoSphere Warehouse for System z beta software, designed to help
clients make real-time decisions based on core business data for driving
better customer management. System z customers can use this new software to
more easily and cost effectively design and run a data warehouse that
supports business intelligence applications, such as Cognos 8 BI.

    
Reducing Massive Inefficiency, Building Resilience

    IBM announced new software that builds on its leadership in making
infrastructure more resilient, virtualized, green, and efficient, while
helping clients reduce costs.


--  A key element of a more efficient infrastructure is previously
announced IBM Systems Director software, which can bring order to the
jumble of physical and virtual assets that characterize today's data
center.  The Systems Director software can enable customers to realize
major increases in the efficiency of UNIX, Windows, and Linux server
platforms. The software's advanced tools can help IT managers control and
automate large numbers of physical and virtual servers across the full
range of IBM hardware (and non-IBM platforms as well) including AIX,
Windows, Linux, Power, VMware, Microsoft Virtual Server, Xen, and z/VM.
Through a single Systems Director interface, users can map virtual
resources to physical servers; throttle energy consumption up or down as
needed; and collect data on hardware temperatures and data center energy
use.  Systems Director can automatically monitor remote hardware operations
and take proper action based on alerts. 

    
Building on the benefits of IBM Systems Director, IBM announced
new
offerings.


--  New IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Energy Management software, which brings
automation to the management and reporting of energy consumption by non-IT
assets -- an office building air conditioning system, for example, or
streetlights in a city. With the new software, organizations can now
generate a variety of configurable reports to help them track and visualize
energy dynamics -- and take appropriate action as a result, while
extrapolating how changes will yield different business outcomes using
sophisticated "what if" calculations. 



--  New IBM Resiliency Consulting Services, which provide assessment,
planning and business-impact analysis to identify the critical business
processes that most impact a client's revenue and assets, and help them
prioritize the recovery strategies that might be needed during business
disruption. 

    
As part of today's news, IBM also introduced a new initiative to help
Business Partners develop and deepen their competencies and skills that
can enable them to better respond to clients' business and IT
transformational needs. The new "Dynamic Infrastructure Specialty
Program" provides education, sales, marketing and technical guidance to
advance Business Partners' skills in key business challenge areas such as
virtualization, information management and energy efficiency. Business
Partners can also qualify to receive as much as 100 thousand dollars in
business development funds. The first wave of Business Partners is
already gaining certification, including Sirius, Mainline, Vicom,
MicroStrategies, Agilysis and Computer Integrated Engineering System --
who are now in a strengthened position to go to market with a
consultative, solutions-led approach.

    Also announced today, IBM Global Financing, the lending and leasing
business segment of IBM, is available to provide funding in the form of
leases and loans for companies looking to access this new set of
technology infrastructure solution offerings. For more information:

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Evergreen Solar Misses Slightly

Evergreen Solar (NASDAQ: ESLR) reported financial results for the 4th quarter
and full year 2008. The company recorded revenue of $44 million for the 4th
quarter and $112 million for the year. 

Net loss for the 4th quarter of 2008 was $52.1, or $0.32 per share, and includes
charges of $23.1 million for the closure of the Marlboro pilot facility, $8.0
million for the write-off of certain research and development equipment and $9.7
million of facility start up costs for Devens and Midland. 

McClatchy's Drastic Measures

The McClatchy Company (NYSE: MNI) reported 4Q08 financial results Thursday that,
as we expected, reflected an accelerating decline in ad revenue. In the midst of
the secular and cyclical slowdown in print advertising, circulation revenue has
fallen for the third consecutive year (-16% in 2008), while ad revenue sinks
disproportionately as a third of MNI's revenues are in the hard-hit California
and Florida markets. 

EBITDA fell 28% to $114.5 million in 4Q08, faster than the 18% drop in revenue.
Clearly, this does not leave a lot of room to pay interest ($41.1 million in
4Q08) and maintenance cap ex, not to mention investment spending in Internet
growth initiatives. The dividend, which totaled roughly $7.4 million in 4Q08,
was suspended effective 2Q09. 

Epicor Software Guidance Weak

Epicor Software (NASDAQ: EPIC) reported its Q4 and FY08 results yesterday and
there was not much to be cheerful about the upcoming quarter. The company stated
that it expects Q1:FY09 to be the weakest in FY2009 and that it has no
visibility beyond the quarter. 

The stock has been under pressure over the last 2 quarters, and the current
guidance doesn't add optimism by any means, although Q4 was relatively a decent
quarter. A leading provider of enterprise business software solutions for the
mid-market and divisions of Global 1000 companies, Epicor seems to be feeling
the heat from the depressed retail environment in terms of garnering new market
opportunities in 2009 and even keeping its maintenance revenues flowing from
existing customers. 

Merck Enters Challenging Period

Merck &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) is a global research-driven pharmaceutical products
company. Merck is entering a challenging period over the next few years.
Revenues have stalled and will actually begin to decline in the next few years
due to patent expirations and key late-stage pipeline failures. 

Earnings should decline in 2009 due to the stalled topline and a higher tax
rate. Still, Merck is dramatically cutting costs and buying back shares. This
should allow management to deliver positive EPS growth in 2010. 

In the meantime, we do not see the shares outperforming until investors get more
clarity on what will drive the topline over the next few years. We also fear
that Merck may follow its U.S. rival Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and attempt a massive
acquisition. This keeps us on the sideline. We see $34 as fair value.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Research Director, Dirk Van Dijk says that S 500 earnings are continuing
to show red ink. He tracks companies on the Zacks.com web site, naming names,
while forecasting trends for the months ahead. 

Key Points from Van Dijk's Latest Earnings Assessment

* Earnings reports remain ugly, total net income running 37.9% below a year ago 
* Surprise ratio of 1.70:1 and median surprise of 2.22% are both below "normal" 
* Fourth-quarter total net income expected to be 32.7% below year ago 
* Financials red ink is $18.9 billion versus $6.0 Billion black ink last year 
* Excluding Financials, total earnings down 20.5% so far 
* Still heading south as 2009 expectations fall 2.22% in a week 
* More than 1/3 of all 2009 consensus earnings estimates down more than 10%; 1/6
down more than 25% over the last month 
* Total net income in 2009 now expected to fall 10.0%, following 13.3% 2008
decline 
* P/Es based on 2009 estimates will prove to be to low as "E" plunges 
* Bottom up estimate for S 500 now $65.12 in 2009, down from $66.60 a week
ago; I expect it to be less than $60.

Total Net Income Growth

For those that desperately search for silver linings in the earnings
expectations data, the best that can be said is that the rate of decline has
slowed somewhat. 

The bottom-up consensus earnings estimate declined 2.2% over the last week, but
at least that is a much slower decline than the 6.6% decline the week before.
However, anyone who thinks that the earnings for the S 500 in 2009 will come
in at anything close to the current figure of $65.12 is an absolute fool. 

When looking at this data, the trend is always more significant than the level
at any given date. While down 2.2% is better than down 6.6%, it is still awful
any way you cut it. We are talking weekly changes here, not monthly. 

If the rate of decline were to slow to 1.0% per week for the rest of the year,
that would mean that earnings for the year would be only $41.01. I suspect that
it will end up being somewhat higher than that, since I am optimistic that the
economic stimulus package will get passed and will start to have some limited
impact in the second half. Even so, earnings of $55 for the year seem like a
fairly optimistic forecast, but in the right ball park. 

The question then becomes, what sort of multiple should one put on those
earnings. As of Friday lunchtime, the S 500 was trading at 868.10, which based
on earnings of $55 would put the P/E at 15.8x. To make money holding the S 500
then one of two things has to happen. Either I have to be all wet about the $55
earnings level, or the multiple has to expand from this level. Granted interest
rates are low and they are depressed earnings, but north of 16x is a pretty
princely multiple. 

The earnings declines are very widespread. When we combine those that have
already reported with the expectations for those yet to report (implicitly
assuming no surprises for the yet to report group), 8 of the 10 economic sectors
are expected to earn less in the fourth quarter of 2008 than they did in the
fourth quarter of 2007, and 7 of those sectors have expected declines of over
19%. The outlook for the first quarter is just as bad, with an expected drop of
28.5% and nine sectors down and one essentially unchanged. 

Scorecard and Median EPS Growth Rates

* Median EPS growth of 326 firms reporting so far is -6.8% 
* Surprise ratio 1.70, median surprise 2.2%, both below normal 
* Health Care still healthy with 10.1% growth, others anemic or down 
* Health Care, Industrials doing well on Surprise front 
* Nine sectors expected to be negative in 1Q 
* Remaining firms expected to be down 9.5% in 4Q

Positive surprises still outnumber disappointments, but at only about half the
ratio that we became accustomed to seeing during the good times. CEOs learned
long ago that it is better to under promise and over deliver, and thus keep the
guidance to the analysts conservative. 

The overall picture when we measure earnings based on median year-over-year EPS
growth is not quite as bleak as on a total net income basis. During the first
three quarters of 2008, firms were still buying back stock at a fairly
aggressive pace (although not as aggressively as in 2007, fourth-quarter data is
not out yet), which helps boost EPS by shrinking the denominator, where that
effect is not present in the total net income data. Also the decline in total
net income is in part been driven by some huge losses at some mega firms, most
notably in the financial sector. 

The Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2009

* Revisions ratio for full S 500 up to 0.19, unchanged from last week 
* Health Care the "strongest" as positive surprises help it 
* 9 sectors have at least 3 cuts for every increase 
* 34.4% of all firms see consensus earnings estimate decline by more than 10%,
22.4% more than 20% 
* Ratio of firms with rising to falling consensus earnings estimates at 0.18,
unchanged 
* Total number of revisions (4 week total) up to 3,594 from 2,626 last week
(36.8%) 
* Increases up to 578 from 410 (40.9%), cuts up to 3,016 from 2,216 (36.1%) 
* Estimate activity picking up sharply, nearing seasonal peak

Despite five of the sectors recording at least twice as many positive surprises
as disappointments, it is not translating into upward estimate revisions for
2009. Granted, unlike the other quarters, there is no automatic reason for 2009
estimates to rise due to a positive surprise in the fourth quarter of 2008, the
way there is if there is a positive surprise in the first quarter of 2009.
However, the disparity is pretty stark. 

The Health Care sector is the best of the bunch, but even there, estimate cuts
are running at almost 2x estimate increases despite positive surprises
outnumbering disappointments more than five to one. There are a few names where
positive surprises have translated into higher estimates, like McKesson
Corporation (NYSE: MCK) and Forest Laboratories (NYSE: FRX), but they are the
exception, rather than the rule. 

While the revisions ratio has improved from what we were seeing a month ago, it
is still in horrendously negative territory. Furthermore, negative revisions are
occurring on a far higher overall volume of estimates. 

The size of the estimate cuts is awful, with more than one third of all S 500
firms seeing their consensus earnings estimate fall by more than 10% over the
last month and more than one-fifth seeing greater than a 20% decline. The
economy is still accelerating to the downside, so it seems unlikely that the
cutting will stop anytime soon. 

Not surprisingly the relatively defensive Health Care and Consumer Staples
sectors are holding up better than the cyclical sectors like the Industrials and
Materials. Financials they are in their own separate hell. 

The Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2010

* Revisions ratio rises to 0.22 from 0.20 last week 
* More than 3 cuts per increase for 9 sectors, more than 4 per increase in 6
sectors 
* Telecom, Health Care the "strongest"; Industrials, Energy, Materials,
Financials and Tech all very weak 
* Only 21 total revisions in Telecom 
* Ratio of rising to falling consensus earnings estimates falls to 0.20 from
0.26 
* Total number of revisions rises to 1,479 from 1,127 (31.2%) 
* Estimate increases rise to 264 from 184 (43.5%), cuts rise to 1215 from 943
(28.8%) 
* Sample size of 2010 revisions is thin, but starting off weak 
* Mean estimates to be affected by new estimates as much as revisions

While the total net income table above shows expectations of a very healthy
rebound in profits in 2010 of 24.3%, don`t start counting those chickens.
Analysts are cutting their 2010 estimates at almost the same pace that they are
cutting their 2009 estimates. If the two fall in tandem, the growth rate will
not change, but it will be off a much lower base. 

As with 2009, the estimate cuts are widespread, with Health Care being the only
place where cuts are running at less than 2:1 over increases, in every other
sector they are running at more than 3:1. 

The size of the cuts is also very substantial. In 5 sectors, the average change
in the consensus earnings estimate over the last month is in the double digits,
and that is after we have removed all the declines of greater than 100%. The
declines in the Energy sector look particularly bad, with major firms like Exxon
Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and
ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) all registering double digit declines. Given the
scale of their operations that translates to billions of dollars of lower
expected earnings. 

Earnings Shares and P/Es

* P/Es are too low since earnings estimates are too high 
* Earnings Shares, including historical, based on current make up of S 500 
* Disappearance of losers like Merrill, Wachovia and National City distorts
Financials 2008 earnings share, with them it is under 4%. 
* Health Care expected to take earnings crown from Energy in 2009, keep it in
2010 
* Energy's earnings share expected to plunge to 14.2% from 21.4% 
* Financials expected to dramatically grow earnings share in 2009 from depressed
2008 levels, but more write-offs are likely, and expected share is shrinking 
* Consumer Discretionary market cap share far above earnings shares
(overvalued?) 
* S 500's P/E of 12.99 equates to earnings yield of 7.69%, very attractive
relative to 10 year T-note yield of 2.98%. 
* T-note rates are rising and more realistic earnings yields of near 6.50% based
on lower earnings means the spread, while still attractive is not overwhelming.

&lt;p&gt;COPPELL, Texas--(Business Wire)--
CiCi's Pizza announces that they are sponsoring a Restaurant Business Conference
open to include any interested business leaders and entrepreneurs March 4-5,
2009 at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino. While the first day
will be closed for CiCi's franchisees, addresses on March 5th are open to the
public and will feature keynote presentations by industry experts Donny Deutsch,
CNBC Host &amp; Chairman of Deutsch Inc. and Scott Young, Senior Vice President of
Coca-Cola. The day will also include sessions on "Obamanomics," SBA lending, a
commodity outlook, loss prevention and additional high impact seminars designed
specifically for the restaurant industry. 

"We need to work together to strengthen our industry," said Craig Moore,
president and CEO of CiCi's Pizza. "The experts we have lined up have a wealth
of information that we want everyone to have access to because this year,
operators don't have the funds to attend conferences without subject matter.
It's important to us, as an industry leader, to offer a powerful agenda that
positions our industry to prosper." 

"Now is the time and 2009 should be the year you bet on you," said Donny
Deutsch, who also authored the newly released book, THE BIG IDEA. "We can say `I
cannot depend on the institutions, I have to depend on me.' In this day and age
more than ever it`s important to bet on yourself." For those who are interested
in being their own boss and do not see long range security in working for
someone else, franchise ownership helps people get into business for themselves,
but not by themselves. The support offered by an internal senior management
team, such as CiCi's, is a major factor in the improved success rate that is
associate with franchising. 

Kicking off the conference on March 4th, President Craig Moore and VP of
Operations Kyle Smith will deliver the company's vision for 2010 and 2011 to
team members in attendance. Day two of the conference, which is open to the
public, will begin with Donny Deutsch delivering the keynote address and
participating in a Q &amp; A via satellite at 8:30 a.m. Throughout the day, industry
experts will give insight into how the new administration's policies will effect
the restaurant industry, SBA lending, a commodities outlook will be provided,
research conducted on loss prevention will be presented and Senior Vice
President of Coca-Cola Scott Young will wrap up the conference. Attendees are
encouraged to visit the day long vendor fair and stay for a networking
reception. 

The conference is free of charge, and for those interested in staying at the
Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino, CiCi's Pizza has secured a
block of rooms at discounted prices. For more information about the conference
and how to register, please call Angie Zimmermann at 972-745-9316.

change. CiCi`s mission then and now is to exceed each guest's expectation in

&lt;p&gt;February 24 webinar gives businesses critical information on how to minimize
sales tax audit risk, streamline business processes, and reduce overhead by
adopting sales tax Software as a Service solutions 
LAGUNA HILLS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Sales tax audits are a rising threat to businesses of all sizes as state
revenues decline. In order to help businesses better understand the risks they
face, and take steps to mitigate those risks, SpeedTax, Inc., a provider of
Software as a Service (SaaS), fully-automated sales tax management solutions,
today announced the availability of a free webinar on February 24, 2009 at 10:00
a.m. Pacific time - "Sales tax audit risk: what you can do to protect your
business." Registration is now open at:
https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/376172336. 

Led by noted sales tax expert Diana DiBello, the webinar is specifically geared
toward Sage MAS 90/200 ERP, Sage Accpac ERP, Microsoft Dynamics GP, and
QuickBooks Enterprise, Pro, and Premier customers who want to minimize their
sales tax audit risk, reduce overhead related to sales and use tax compliance
and management, and streamline their business processes. 

During this live webinar, DiBello will demystify business-critical sales tax
concepts, give clear direction on how to address crucial areas without the need
for developing or maintaining in-house sales tax expertise, and answer
attendees` specific questions. Some of the key points to be covered during the
webinar include:

* Nexus: Businesses need to know their connection to each state in which they`re
making sales. Too many companies do not understand the nexus implications of
sending their delivery person across state lines or hiring a telesales employee
in another state. 
* Rates: There are, on average, 1.9 sales tax rate changes per day - an
unrealistic pace for most small businesses to contend with on a regular basis. 
* Sourcing: If a sale is taxable, which jurisdiction is imposing the tax?
Businesses must first make this determination so they can apply the correct rate
- to do this they must understand the distinction between origin- and
destination-based sourcing rules, which can be complicated. 
* Taxability: Companies must determine if a customer, product or service is
subject to tax. They have to manage resale exemption certificates, interpret
state taxability matrices and pay attention to particular nuances. 
* Return Filing and Remittance: Once a business decides which state it owes, it
must file a myriad of state and local returns with various taxing authorities.
California, for example, uses a single consolidated return, but many states
require filings in local jurisdictions.

Webinar attendees will learn what audit risks their businesses face, gain a
better understanding of where potential exposure exists, and find out how
SpeedTax can cost effectively protect their business in the event of a sales tax
audit while simultaneously simplifying their business processes.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3f65bd/beginning_tsql_wi) has
announced the addition of John Wiley and Sons Ltd's new report "Beginning T-SQL
with Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008" to their offering. 

You may already have a basic idea of what SQL is used for, but you may not have
a good understanding of the concepts behind relational databases and the purpose
of SQL. This book will help you build a solid foundation of understanding,
beginning with core relational database concepts and continuing to reinforce
those concepts with real-world T-SQL query applications. 

If you are familiar with relational database concepts but are new to Microsoft
SQL Server or the T-SQL language, this book will teach you the basics from the
ground up. If you're familiar with earlier versions of SQL Server, it will get
you up-to-speed on the newest features. And if you know SQL Server 2005, you'll
learn about some exciting new capabilities in SQL Server 2008. 

Information Technology professionals in many different roles use T-SQL. Our goal
is to provide a guide and a reference for IT pros across the spectrum of
operational database solution design, database application development, and
reporting and business intelligence solutions. 

Application developers who write code to manage and consume SQL Server data will
benefit from our thorough coverage of basic data management and simple and
advanced query design. Several examples of ready-to-use code are provided to get
you started and to continue to support applications with embedded T-SQL queries.


Finally, database administrators who are new to SQL Server will find this book
to be an all-inclusive introduction and reference of mainstream topics. This can
assist you as you support the efforts of other team members. Beyond the basics
of database object management and security concepts, we recommend Beginning SQL
Server 2005 Administration and Beginning SQL Server 2008 Administration from
Wrox, co-authored in part by the same authors. 

This book introduces the T-SQL language and its many uses, and serves as a
comprehensive guide at a beginner through intermediate level. Our goal in
writing this book was to cover all the basics thoroughly and to cover the most
common applications of T-SQL at a deeper level. Depending on your role and skill
level, this book will serve as a companion to the other Wrox books in the
Microsoft SQL Server Beginning and Professional series.. 

More advanced topics in the concluding section will teach you to create and
manage T-SQL programming objects, including views, functions, and stored
procedures. You learn to optimize query performance and use T-SQL in application
design, applying the query design basics to real-world business solutions.
Chapter 15 contains a complete tutorial on using SQL Server 2008 Reporting
Services to visualize data from the T-SQL queries you create. 

The book concludes with a comprehensive set of reference appendixes for command
syntax, system stored procedures, information schema views, file system
commands, and system management commands. 

Key Topics Covered:

Chapter 1: Introducing T-SQL and Data Management Systems. 

Chapter 2: SQL Server Fundamentals. 

Chapter 3: SQL Server Tools. 

Chapter 4: Introducing the T-SQL Language. 

Chapter 5: Data Retrieval.

&lt;p&gt;  JUELICH, GERMANY and STUTTGART, GERMANY, Feb 10
(MARKET WIRE) -- 
The German research center Forschungszentrum Juelich has selected IBM
(NYSE: IBM) to develop the first supercomputer in Europe capable of one
Petaflop, or one thousand trillion operations per second. IBM will
partner with Juelich-based Gauss Centre for Supercomputing to install the
new IBM Blue Gene/P System in the first half of this year.

    This new system -- financed by the German Government -- will help assure
Forschungszentrum Juelich remains one of Europe's most renowned research
centers and continues to play an important role in the global high
performance computing research community.

    This new Blue Gene System is the first to include new water cooling
technology, created by IBM Research, that uses room temperature water to
cool the servers. As air moves through the server racks, heat is removed
as it passes through the water-based cooling system before it enters the
next rack of servers. This result is a 91 percent reduction in air
conditioning units that would have been required to cool Forschungszentrum
Juelich's data center with an air-cooled Blue Gene.

    "Supercomputers of this performance level are universal key technology
instruments to solve most complex and urgent scientific problems in many
areas," comments Professor Achim Bachem, Chairman of the Board of
Forschungszentrum Juelich. "Scientists of all disciplines use
supercomputers to identify climate changes, conduct research about protein
folding in cells, how semiconductors work or how fuel cells can be
improved."

    "With speeds over a Petaflop, this new Juelich-based supercomputer offers
the processing ability of more than 200,000 laptop computers," explains
Professor Thomas Lippert, lead scientist of the Juelich supercomputing
center. "In addition to raw power, this new system will be among the most
energy efficient in the world."

    "Forschungszentrum Juelich and IBM complement each other ideally with a
focus in developing compact systems with industry leading performance and
energy efficiency", said Martin Jetter, general manager, IBM Germany.
"This new Petaflop Blue Gene system will ensure that Germany remains
relevant for leading research and engineering."

    The new Blue Gene/P System will include nearly 295,000 POWER processors in
72 racks and also include over 144 terabytes of memory. It will
significantly add to Forschungszentrum Juelich's existing supercomputing
capability at the Center, which includes an additional six petabytes of
hard disk drive space, the amount equivalent of more than one million
DVDs.

    Inauguration and naming of the new systems will take place at an opening
ceremony in mid 2009.

    The new supercomputer will be the first system that has been selected and
purchased in the context of the German Gauss Center for
Supercomputing
(GCS).


The new Juelich Blue Gene System in Brief:

Type: IBM Blue Gene / P
Peak Performance: 1 Petaflop
Processors: 294,912
Processor Type: PowerPC 450 core 850 MHz
Compute node: 4-way SMP processor
Memory: 144 Terabytes
Racks: 72
Network Latency: 160 Nanoseconds
Network Bandwidth: 5.1 Gigabytes
Energy consumption: 2200 Kilowatts

&lt;p&gt;Initiative Will be First to Include Payments for Both Clinical Development and
Product Education
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc today announced its plans to make publicly available its compensation
of U.S. healthcare professionals for consulting, speaking engagements and
clinical trials. The disclosure will include payments made to practicing U.S.
physicians and other healthcare providers, as well as principal investigators,
major academic institutions and research sites for clinical research. This makes
Pfizer the first biopharmaceutical company to commit to reporting payments for
conducting Phase I-IV clinical trials in addition to disclosing payments for
speaking and consulting. This disclosure demonstrates Pfizer`s commitment to
increased transparency and public candor. 

Pfizer is committing to share this information in order to provide greater
clarity and understanding of the valuable scientific innovations and improved
patient care that result from these collaborations with healthcare
professionals. 

"These collaborations are an essential part of medical progress," said Jeffrey
B. Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer. "Simply put, without
these collaborations, Pfizer would not be able to continue delivering the
medical innovations that the global health community has come to expect." 

In 2008, Pfizer collaborated with almost 8,000 clinical investigators to conduct
more than 280 studies to better understand how our medicines can be safely and
effectively used to the benefit of patients. Pfizer makes payments to
investigators and research institutions to compensate them for the work done on
the company`s behalf. As part of this initiative, Pfizer will ensure that
payments are posted in an accurate, clear and consistent manner that clearly
demonstrates the recipient name or institution, the payment made and the service
provided. 

Pfizer`s plans reflect the spirit of recent proposed legislation regarding
payments to physicians in that it includes payments to practicing physicians and
other healthcare providers as well as to principal investigators and
institutions for Phase I-IV clinical trials sponsored by Pfizer. 

Pfizer plans to publish its first annual online update on www.pfizer.com in
early 2010. The report will include payments made from July 1, 2009, going
forward. 

Parameters under consideration include reporting payments to recipients whose
aggregate amount exceeds $500 in a calendar year, including the value of
non-monetary items, such as meals, that exceed $25 in value. 

Specifically, this includes disclosing all payments to:

* All practicing healthcare providers who can prescribe medicines; 
* Major institutions for ongoing clinical trials; and 
* All principal investigators and other entities for Phase I-IV clinical trials
sponsored by Pfizer beginning after July 1, 2009.

The payments include those for:

* Clinical development and commercial consulting; 
* Promotional speaking; 
* Phase I-IV clinical trials; 
* Investigator-initiated research; and 
* Meals and other non-monetary items.

"Pfizer has made an important step forward with this extensive disclosure
policy. The release of financial information about consulting, education and
clinical research activities sets a standard for transparency in the
pharmaceutical and medical device industries," said Andrew F. Leuchter, M.D.,
Professor of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, Associate Dean, David Geffen
School of Medicine at UCLA. "I believe policies such as these will help restore
public confidence in the relationships physicians and academic medical centers
have with the industry." 

Pfizer is committed to increasing transparency and disclosure of activities that
relate to the public interest:

* In 2002, Pfizer began to register its clinical trials on the public database
www.clinicaltrials.gov. As of 2008, the company registers all clinical trials
(Phase I and beyond) as well as non-interventional studies with prospective data
collection. To date, the company has registered more than 1,000 trials. 
* Also in 2002, Pfizer began publicly reporting U.S. political contributions. 
* In 2004, Pfizer began publicly posting the results of its clinical trials at
www.clinicalstudyresults.org. As of 2005, results of all patient studies (Phase
I and beyond) are posted, and starting in 2008, the results of all clinical
studies, whether in patients or normal volunteers, are posted, as well as the
results of prospective observational studies.

* In December 2006, the company launched a regularly updated public website,
describing compounds in its drug development pipeline and detailing their
progress. 
* In April 2007, Pfizer began reporting its FDA post-marketing commitments
relating to the safe and effective use of Pfizer medicines. 
* In May, 2008, Pfizer began reporting its non-clinical grants and charitable
contributions to patient, medical and scientific organizations on
www.pfizer.com. 
* In September 2008, Pfizer launched its unbranded Medicine Safety Web site.

"We are committed to taking the steps necessary to achieve greater transparency
in our interactions with U.S. healthcare professionals," Mr. Kindler said. "By
disclosing payments to physicians, we are breaking down a major barrier and
increasing the trust healthcare providers must have when prescribing our
medicines. To be viewed as an open, candid and transparent company, we must
address the concerns of our customers and take action. This new initiative does
just that."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, preparing for highly charged Congressional hearings this week, called for stricter regulation and expanding oversight to the largest hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By penning his opinion article in Monday's Financial Times, Blankfein may win over U.S. lawmakers who are under pressure to overhaul the nation's failed regulatory system, industry experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be an incredibly hostile environment. Bank CEOs are not negotiating from a position of strength," said Bert Ely, a veteran business consultant in the Washington area. "Blankfein's saying 'We'll play ball, but we do have concerns.' I think this is going to be the posture for everybody who will be there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Blankfein and executives from seven other banks that received $125 billion in Treasury capital last year will appear before the House Financial Services Committee. Goldman received $10 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market meltdown and the mounting cost of the taxpayer-funded bailout has fueled a backlash against banks and their executives. The public and lawmakers say banks are not redeploying the capital as needed mortgages and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Blankfein may have helped diffuse some of that anger and steer the direction of regulatory changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's taking the politically wise high road. The need for so much regulation is abhorrent, but the industry demonstrated that it's absolutely required," veteran banker and Lane Berry  Co co-founder Frederick Lane said. "This gives Blankfein a voice at table and it helps his own lobbying effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other proposals, the head of the world's largest investment bank said capital, credit and underwriting standards should fall under more proactive regulation. He also called for applying fair value accounting consistently across companies and for greater cooperation among regulators worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For policymakers and regulators, it should be clear that self-regulation has its limits," Blankfein wrote. "At the very least, fixing a system-wide problem, elevating standards or driving the industry to a collective response requires effective central regulation and the convening power of regulators."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein also said he was in favor of expanding regulation to the largest hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All pools of capital that depend on the smooth functioning of the financial system and are large enough to be a burden on it in a crisis should be subject to some degree of regulation," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein speaks from a position of relative strength, since Goldman generated $2.3 billion of profit last year. The top executives at Goldman were also early in announcing they would forego bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank paid out $11 billion in salaries, bonuses and benefits last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of Lehman Brothers' LEHMQ.PK collapse, Goldman became a bank holding company under Federal Reserve watch. The conversion meant Goldman entered a new era of closer scrutiny and restrictions on how it does business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street's lobbying group, called for similar regulatory change in October. The group favors broader oversight across all types of financial firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A financial markets stability regulator with oversight of insurance companies, private equity firms, hedge funds and other financial firms that are systemically important is absolutely key to building a stronger, more robust financial system," SIFMA spokesman Travis Larson said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamar Frankel, a Boston University professor and expert on regulation, said Blankfein's opinion piece acknowledges that regulators are needed to impose fair play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is saying is the government needs to limit antisocial behavior from the outside because we can't do it on the inside. As we've seen, self-regulation was not effective," Frankel said. "The most important thing is restoring public trust, and Blankfein shows he recognized that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds company comment, shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE Feb 12 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd
(CCL.AX), Australia's largest soft drink bottler, reported
strong trading at the start of the year after a 10 percent rise
in 2008 net profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA), 30 percent-owned by
Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), rose as much as 5.6 percent after the
results, taking back some of its losses since Lion Nathan Ltd
LNN.AX, Australia's second-largest brewer, scrapped a
takeover bid for Amatil at the end of last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Full-year profit of A$404.3 million ($266 million) was in
line with analysts expectations and was helped by new products
and continuing hot summer weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As a result, CCA's Australian beverage business has seen
well above average demand and has delivered high single-digit
volume growth for the first six weeks of the new year," the
company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Amatil also said it expected to maintain dividend
payments within the 70 percent to 80 percent range for 2009.
The dividend was at 22 cents in 2008, a 71 percent payout
ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amatil shares stood 3.3 percent higher at A$8.66 at 0307
GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shares, which were at A$9.35 last Friday, fell to as
low as A$8.09 on Monday after talks on the bid between Lion
Nathan's major shareholder, Japan's Kirin Brewery Co (2503.T),
and Coca-Cola Co failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lion Nathan's bid, worth around A$7 billion, was
conditional on Coca-Cola's acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The CCA board was presented with a proposal that was just
not capable of being accepted," Managing Director Terry Davis
told reporters on a teleconference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said problems included an unrealistically low price and
no willingness to make an offer just for the 70 percent of
shares not owned by Coca-Cola Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amatil said it would continue to expand its alcoholic and
non-alcoholic drinks businesses in 2009. Davis said the
expansion of the non-alcoholic business would come from organic
growth.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Feb 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a new agreement with Amazon Web Services
(AWS), a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc., to deliver IBM's market leading
software to clients and developers. The new "pay-as-you-go" model
provides clients with access to development and production instances of
IBM DB2, Informix Dynamic Server, WebSphere Portal, Lotus Web Content
Management, WebSphere sMash and Novell's SUSE Linux operating system
software in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) environment,
providing a comprehensive portfolio of products available on AWS.

    Businesses today are looking for ways to quickly build, deploy and take
advantage of the flexibility that cloud computing environments can bring.
This is challenging for organizations that are constrained by limited
resources, technical skills and capital, as they look to their IT
infrastructure to help them gain a competitive advantage. IBM and Amazon
Web Services are helping to address these challenges by making it easier
for software developers to build solutions based on open standards and
backed up by the necessary technical resources to help simplify the
process.

    Effective immediately, IBM is making available new Amazon Machine Images
(AMIs) at no charge for development and test purposes, enabling software
developers to quickly build pre-production applications based on IBM
software within Amazon EC2. The new portfolio will over time extend to
include Service Management capabilities from IBM Tivoli software for
Amazon EC2 to help clients better control and automate their dynamic
infrastructures in the cloud.

    The IBM software images for full production running in Amazon EC2 will be
launched in beta in the coming months, with pricing to be announced. All
developers and customers will have the operational capability to run
development and production instances of IBM software for an hourly price
per instance.

    Additionally, customers will also be able to run their already-purchased
IBM software on Amazon EC2. For more information, visit:
http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/pvu_for_Amazon_Elastic_compu
e_cloud.html.

    "IBM is offering yet another way for our partners and customers to build
solutions that can help them meet their business goals," said Dave
Mitchell, Director of Strategy and Emerging Business, IBM Software Group.
"This relationship with Amazon Web Services provides our customers with a
new way to use IBM software and broadens our distribution channels."

    We are pleased to be working with IBM to extend this new model for
building and deploying applications to companies of all sizes," said
Terry Wise, Director of Business Development for Amazon Web Services.
"Extending IBM software to the cloud via Amazon EC2 will help even more
businesses take advantage of the benefits of the reliable, scalable and
cost efficient infrastructure in the cloud."

    The new development AMIs can be accessed by visiting the new IBM Cloud
Space on developerWorks at www.ibm.com/developerworks/spaces/cloud or the

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW Feb 11 (Reuters) - U.S. drinks maker Coca-Cola Co
(KO.N) said it would invest $1.2 billion in Russia over the next
3 to 5 years as it bets sales of the carbonated drink will
increase during the economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The company can afford to have aggressive positions in
Russia," Coca-Cola's Russia, Ukraine and Belarussian head Zoran
Vucinic told a news conference on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market of non-alcoholic beverages is growing during
(the) crisis and we want to continue investing in the Russian
market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The crisis will allow us to increase the range of products
and sell coca-cola, energy drinks and (Russian beverage) kvas to
a network comprising small kiosks and hypermarkets," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russian vodka producers have said they believe they are
poised for the biggest gains from the crisis as many Russians
will switch back to cheap vodka after a few years of relative
prosperity when they showed taste for wine and beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola has bigger international exposure than its rival
PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N). Both have a large presence in Russia
although PepsiCo has a stronger position in the juice segment
through the country's biggest juice producer Lebedyansky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Juice is more expensive than carbonated drinks, and any
advance on carbonated beverages could weaken the position of
PepsiCo, which owns Russia's biggest juice producer, in the soft
drinks market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global demand for beverages and bottled water has suffered
in the past months as consumers cut back in a contracting
economy and retailers close shops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many global retailers are now seeking ways to cope with
problems in mature markets and are expanding to Eastern European
countries [ID:nLA156494].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some cheap restaurant chains have shown strong resilience
during the crisis, such as McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) which posted
better-than-expected results as diners sought out lower-priced
fare. [ID:nN09508063].

&lt;p&gt;* New Offering Will Bring ISI Regulatory Solutions Suite to Microsoft Office
SharePoint Server 2007

PHILADELPHIA--(Business Wire)--
ISI, a leading provider of software and services to streamline the regulatory
approval process in the life sciences industry and Microsoft Gold Partner today
announced it has expanded its relationship with Microsoft to offer a
SharePoint-based solution for regulatory submissions. The announcement was made
at the Drug Information Association conference on Electronic Data Management
(ISI Booth #407-409). Through the integrated solution, ISI`s Regulatory
Solutions Suite - which includes ISI`s flagship products eCTDXPress and
ISIPublisher - is now built upon and seamlessly integrates with Microsoft Office
SharePoint Server 2007, offering several powerful new features that remove
administrative burdens from regulatory departments to accelerate timelines for
taking drug therapies to market. 

ISI`s integration with SharePoint Server improves organizational effectiveness
by providing comprehensive control over electronic content, accelerating shared
business processes and facilitating better decision making and information
sharing within the enterprise and externally among partners. Through the
integration, ISI will offer its clients optimal flexibility to utilize
SharePoint Server as a base platform for managing regulatory content and/or a
robust tool for drug development collaboration. 

"ISI`s product portfolio has been built on Microsoft`s .NET Framework for
several years, which makes the integration with SharePoint Server more seamless
and allows us to more fully utilize functionality across both platforms," said
Jinsoo Kim, CEO and President at ISI. "SharePoint Server allows us to create a
familiar collaboration environment that enables life sciences companies to
easily deploy our proven solutions." 

SharePoint Server provides users the ability to control information rights,
digitally sign key review documents in a SAFE-compliant manner, manage
electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) metadata or clinical trials
documents, and publish to PDF and Microsoft XPS, the two leading electronic
formats for regulatory submissions. By integrating ISI Regulatory Suite with
SharePoint Server, publishers will be able to manage content in SharePoint
Server and easily publish it to an eCTD, non-eCTD electronic submission or NeES,
paper submission or other submission format. 

"The major hurdles we are seeing to building truly collaborative environments
are inconsistent content, inefficient workflows, and lack of integration between
existing content management systems, workflows and collaboration tools," said
Michael Naimoli, U.S. life sciences industry solutions director, Microsoft Corp.
"ISI`s vertical solution, built on SharePoint Server`s familiar, easy-to-use and
widely supported platform, can help life sciences firms solve these issues
head-on and increase the speed and efficiency of regulatory submissions." 

ISI`s integration with the SharePoint platform will be further described at a
joint-hosted Webinar titled "Enabling the Networked Pharma Model Through
Collaborative Work Spaces," to be held at 2:00 p.m. EST/11:00 a.m. PST on
Wednesday, February 25, 2009. Eric G. Brown, vice president and research
director, Forrester Research will be presenting, along with Toban Zolman,
director of consulting services, ISI. To register for the Webinar, please visit

&lt;p&gt;* Excluding certain items, comparable fourth-quarter 2008 EPS totals 22 cents
driven by modest improvement in North American operating income trends and
continued solid operating performance in Europe; comparable full year EPS totals
$1.32.

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE) today reported a fourth-quarter 2008 net loss
of $1.45 billion, or $2.99 per diluted share. This includes a non-cash, pre-tax
impairment charge of $2.3 billion. Excluding items that impact comparability,
the company achieved net income of $107 million, or 22 cents per diluted share. 

The non-cash impairment charge is the result of CCE`s impairment analysis in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" and is
necessary to reduce the book value of the company`s North American franchise
license intangible assets to their estimated fair value in light of financial
market conditions and CCE`s stock price. 

For full-year 2008, CCE reported a net loss of $4.4 billion, or $9.05 per
diluted share. This includes total non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of $7.6
billion. Excluding items that impact comparability, the company achieved net
income of $647 million, or $1.32 per diluted share. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of reported and comparable
earnings per diluted share and a reconciliation of reported and comparable items
is available on pages 7 through 15 of this news release.

 (a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow investors to more clearly evaluate operating performance and business trends. Management uses this information to review results excluding items that are not necessarily indicative of ongoing results. 


For the full year, total revenues grew 4 percent reflecting consolidated
comparable volume decline of &#189; percent and comparable, currency-neutral net
pricing per case growth of 4&#189; percent. Comparable operating income declined 6&#189;
percent and consolidated cost of sales per case increased 6&#189; percent reflecting
higher North American commodity costs and the mix impact of increased sales of
higher cost purchased finished goods. Full year comparable results include a
benefit from currency translations of less than 1 cent per diluted share. 

In the fourth quarter, on a comparable basis, total revenues declined 1 percent
reflecting a consolidated comparable volume decline of 5 percent and comparable,
currency-neutral net pricing per case growth of 8 percent. Comparable operating
income declined 11 percent on a consolidated basis. 

"Our fourth quarter results reflect slight improvement in our North American
business trends and continued solid operating performance in Europe," said John
F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. "However, we continue to face
economic pressures in all territories, making our work to enhance margins, grow
profit, protect free cash flow, and improve efficiency and effectiveness vitally
important. 

"We are moving forward with several significant initiatives in North America as
we meet the challenges of the current economic environment," Mr. Brock said.
"These initiatives are focused on improving supply chain operations,
implementing a new price/package architecture that will balance channel and
package profitability while enhancing brand value, and improving our execution
to strengthen our marketplace presence. 

"We believe this work, coupled with an improved relationship with The Coca-Cola
Company, will ultimately restore long-term, profitable growth for our company,"
Mr. Brock said. 

NORTH AMERICAN RESULTS

For full-year 2008, comparable North American volume declined 1&#189; percent, while
net pricing per case grew 5&#189; percent. In the fourth quarter, North American
comparable volume declined 7 percent, while net pricing per case grew 9&#189; percent
reflecting the impact of a September price increase, matching a fourth quarter
cost of sales per case increase of 9&#189; percent. Full year cost of sales per case
increased 8 percent. 

Full year volume results reflect the continued strength of Coca-Cola Zero, which
grew approximately 30 percent, and the benefits of still beverages such as
glac&#233;au, Fuze, and Campbells. 

"With the addition of Monster to our energy portfolio, the expansion of our
still beverage brands, and Coca-Cola Zero`s positive impact on our sparkling
beverage brands, our North American brand portfolio is well positioned to drive
improved performance in key categories," Mr. Brock said. "This creates solid
marketplace opportunities that we will capture with our new price/package
architecture and targeted execution initiatives." 

EUROPEAN RESULTS

In Europe, full year comparable volume grew 3 percent, with growth in Great
Britain of 4 percent and 2 percent growth on the continent. Europe achieved a
balance of sparkling and still beverage growth, as sparkling beverages grew 2
percent and still beverages grew 8&#189; percent. Coca-Cola trademark brands grew 2&#189;
percent, with Coca-Cola Zero up 15 percent and regular Coca-Cola up 3&#189; percent.
Still beverage growth was driven by Capri-Sun, Fanta, and sports drinks. Full
year net pricing per case increased 2 percent, and cost of sales per case
increased 2 percent. 

In the fourth quarter, comparable European volume grew 1&#189; percent, and on a
comparable currency-neutral basis, net pricing per case grew 2&#189; percent and cost
of sales per case increased 3 percent. 

"We are encouraged by the continued strength of our European business, including
Europe`s ability to control costs and enhance profitability," Mr. Brock said.
"Balanced volume and price growth combined with strong execution and continued
expense management will be essential as we work to counter the impact of changes
in Europe`s economic conditions." 

2009 OUTLOOK

The company today affirmed its prior guidance for 2009. On a comparable and
currency-neutral basis, consolidated financial results for 2009 will reflect low
single-digit operating income growth and mid single-digit EPS growth. Including
the expected impact of currency translations, the company also expects strong
free cash flow of approximately $600 million, and capital expenditures of
approximately $900 million. Free cash flow will continue to be used primarily
for debt reduction. The effective tax rate for 2009 is expected to be 25 percent
to 27 percent. At current rates, foreign currency translations would have a
negative impact on expected 2009 comparable EPS of approximately 20 cents. 

In North America, the company expects full-year 2009 revenue to increase in a
mid single-digit range. Volume will decline, reflecting the impact of essential
pricing actions to offset an expected high single-digit increase in cost of
goods per case. European revenue will grow in a mid single-digit range. Volume
will grow modestly and cost of goods per case is expected to increase in a low
single-digit range, reflecting a continued moderate commodity cost environment.

company`s full-year 2008 results and 2009 outlook live over the Internet today

 (a)  The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Net Pricing per Case" is used to more clearly evaluate bottle and can 
      pricing trends in the marketplace. The measure excludes the impact of fountain gallon volume and other items that are 
      not directly associated with bottle and can pricing in the retail environment. Our bottle and can sales accounted for 
      approximately 91 percent of our net revenue during 2008.                                                             
      
      
      
                                                                                                                   
 (b)  The non-GAAP financial measures "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Net Pricing per Case" and "Currency-Neutral Bottle  
      and Can Cost of Sales per Case" are used to separate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our operations. 
      
                                                                                                                   
 (c)  The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Cost of Sales per Case" is used to more clearly evaluate cost trends  
      for bottle and can products. The measure excludes the impact of fountain ingredient costs as well as marketing       
      credits and Jumpstart funding, and allows investors to gain an understanding of the change in bottle and can         
      ingredient and packaging costs.                                                                                      
      
      
                                                                                                                   
 (d)  "Comparable Bottle and Can Volume" excludes the impact of changes in the number of selling days between periods. The 
      measure is used to analyze the performance of our business on a constant period basis. There was one additional      
      selling day for the full-year 2008 versus the full-year 2007. There were two additional selling days in the fourth   
      quarter of 2008 versus the fourth quarter of 2007.                                                                   
      
      
                                                                                                                   
 (e)  The non-GAAP measure "Free Cash Flow" is provided to focus management and investors on the cash available for debt   
      reduction, dividend distributions, share repurchase, and acquisition opportunities.                                  
      
                                                                                                                   
 (f)  The non-GAAP measure "Net Debt" is used to more clearly evaluate our capital structure and leverage.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Industry Outlook. Today`s interview is with senior
analyst Jason Napodano,who talks about the Pharmaceuticals Industry, including
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Merck (NYSE: MRK), Sanofi (NYSE:
SNY), and Schering-Plough (NYSE: SGP). 

A synopsis of today`s Industry Outlook is presented below. The full article can
be read at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Large pharmaceutical companies all seem to be in a similar boat heading into
2009. Most of the names in the industry are facing significant patent challenges
in the years to come. U.S.-based firms are facing foreign exchange headwinds as
well. Revenue growth is non-existent, and earnings growth is being driven
primarily by cost-cutting and share buybacks. 

Knowing that investors rarely pay-up for this type of manufactured earnings
growth, we struggle to see a broad-based out-performance for the large-cap
pharmaceutical sector in 2009. 

Valuations, however, are attractive, with several of the largest players trading
at PEs below 10x, including Pfizer (NYSE: PFE, 7x), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY, 9x),
Merck (NYSE: MRK, 9x), Sanofi (NYSE: SNY, 9x), and Schering-Plough (NYSE: SGP,
10x) based on our fiscal 2009 estimates. Attractive valuations, along with big
dividend yields, should protect investors against significant downside risk even
if the economy continues to languish well into the second half of the year.

&lt;p&gt;CANBERRA (Reuters) - It's not often a classical violinist ranks alongside pop stars like Madonna and Bon Jovi on the concert tour circuit. Then again, Andre Rieu has not followed a conventional path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch violinist and conductor has carved out a career playing the waltz, performing to massive crowds around the world, most recently in Australia, with his fans in the habit of getting up and dancing in the aisles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieu, who ranked eighth in Pollstar's 2008 list of the world's top touring acts with revenue of US$76.9 million, says he is delighted to see his audiences having so much fun -- and just as delighted for his critics to see that enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I never asked people to dance in the aisles but they do it and they have fun. People often ask if I am disturbed when people dance as I play the Danube but not at all. It is great to see they are alive," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I play a waltz, I can see the whole audience starting to move and smile, but every night you see two or three people who do not move as they don't want to be like that ... but we live in a free world and they don't have to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieu, 59, who has been dubbed the king of waltz by media -- and by some critics, the king of schmaltz -- says music is his life. He was raised by a father who was a symphony conductor and began playing the violin from the age of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He studied at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels and in 1987, set up the Johann Strauss Orchestra with original 12 members. It now has up to 50 musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieu's revival of the waltz has put him in the global spotlight and made him a concert tour sensation, winning him credit for doing as much for the waltz as Michael Flatley did for Irish dancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his huge sets and his showmanship -- cracking jokes on stage and bantering with the audience -- has not endeared him to the music purists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His live show in Australia involved a replica of the Viennese Schoenbrunn Palace complete with skaters, princesses, white horses, footmen and a 500 strong touring party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieu, who has sold more than 25 million albums globally, said touring is his life with an estimated 700,000 fans attending his concerts each year. He has plans this year to perform in the United States, Canada and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Dutchman with his long, flowing hair and theatrical stage outfits, is puzzled by critics who dislike him so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do nothing wrong. I play my music in a very serious way. I am a classical musician and I do it in a good way," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't do crossover music. I like to play the music as it was composed. Every now and then I make it shorter and quicker time. At the time of Johann Strauss there was no juke box or television and people wanted the waltz to be 18 minutes, but now it is better to make it four or five minutes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bob Tourtellotte)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accused of Using Political Pressure and Junk Science to Evade Court Judgment
Over 'Amazon Chernobyl'
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Chevron`s legal department was blasted today by the leaders of indigenous groups
in the Amazon for engaging in misconduct in an effort to sabotage a lawsuit in
Ecuador over environmental contamination where the company faces a potential $27
billion liability. 

Chevron has admitted that Texaco dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste into
Amazon waterways, decimating five indigenous tribes and causing an outbreak of
cancer. The court-appointed expert, who worked with a team of 14 other
scientists, determined that 1,041 cancer deaths in an area the size of Rhode
Island could be attributed to Chevron`s sub-standard operational practices. 

Chevron bought Texaco in 2001 and will bear any liability for clean-up of the
area, which some experts call the "Amazon Chernobyl". 

Pablo Fajardo, the lawyer for the indigenous groups, said Chevron General
Counsel Charles James has orchestrated "a pattern of deception and misconduct
shocking for a high official from a public company." Fajardo said he had
evidence Chevron engaged in several corrupt acts intended to intimidate the
judge and damages expert into abandoning the trial, which is expected to end
later this year. 

Fajardo added that comments made by James today in a Chevron press release,
alleging without proof that an independent court expert was cooperating with the
plaintiffs, were "false and defamatory" and could expose Chevron shareholders to
additional liability. 

Among Chevron`s misconduct in the Ecuador trial, said Fajardo:

* Chevron`s lawyers in Ecuador have tried to intimidate and harass the
court-appointed expert, Richard Cabrera, by stalking him while collecting soil
and water samples that would prove the existence of unsafe levels of toxic
contaminants. The impediments were so significant that the presiding judge was
forced to order police protection for Cabrera to enable him to carry out his
court mandate. 
* Chevron insisted that Cabrera take "blind" soil samples to ensure that the
laboratory equipment was working properly, an expensive practice that was
undertaken with the understanding that the company would pay for it. Chevron
subsequently refused to pay for the processing of the samples, presumably out of
fear that the testing would provide additional proof of contamination. 
* Chevron`s engaged in the manufacture of junk science. The company ignored
sound scientific practices by taking water and soil samples at higher elevations
than the sources of contamination. Chevron also faked its laboratory results by
using an inappropriate test. 
* James is intentionally distorting facts by alleging that Cabrera is
"cooperating" with the plaintiffs. The reality is that Cabrera -- as is standard
in legal cases in Ecuador and around the world - consulted with both parties in
order to fulfill his court-ordered mandate. The report prepared by Cabrera
relied substantially more on evidence provided by Chevron's than that provided
by the plaintiffs. 
* Chevron has consistently tried to politicize the trial by pressuring Ecuador
President Rafael Correa to extinguish the legal claims of the plaintiffs. When
he resisted, Chevron has repeatedly lobbied the U.S. Congress to cancel
successful foreign trade pacts with Ecuador to "punish" the country for letting
its citizens exercise their legal rights against Chevron 
* Chevron has consistently tried to obstruct and delay the trial by violating
the due process rights of the plaintiffs. Employees of the company interfered
with evidence gathering by fabricating a security threat to delay a critical
inspection on indigenous territory. Lawyers for the plaintiffs have received
death threats, the court expert`s office was mysteriously robbed of case
materials, and a press spokesperson for the plaintiffs was assaulted.

James, Chevron`s General Counsel, is a former disciple of Attorney General John
Ashcroft and is a practitioner of Karl Rove-style politics, according to Karen

including infamous author of the Pentagon "torture memos," lawyer William J.
Haynes.

working in an environmentally sustainable way is seen by investors to be as
important as making profits," she said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on stores, background on retailing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Feb 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
announced plans on Thursday to open its own chain of branded
stores as it looks to catch up with rival Apple Inc's (AAPL.O)
successful move into retailing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which also makes the
Xbox video game console and the Zune digital music player, did
not say how many stores it was looking to open, or when, or
which of its products would be on sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is to be decided by David Porter, a former DreamWorks
Animation DWA.N executive, which Microsoft named as its new
vice president of retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turner, a former Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) manager, will
report to Microsoft chief operating officer Kevin Turner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-rumored move to open stores comes as consumer
spending is under severe pressure due to the recession, which
has already pushed electronics chain Circuit City CCTYQ.PK
into bankruptcy. A similar attempt by computer maker Gateway to
open its own stores some years ago was not successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, bruised by the poor reception of its latest Vista
operating system, is facing increased competition from Apple,
which is eating into the personal computer market and dominates
the personal digital music player market with its iPod line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's stylish stores, now numbering more than 200
worldwide, have been crucial in attracting customers in recent
years.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds additional comment, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
denied a CNBC television report on Thursday that it had
convened an "emergency" meeting of top investors earlier this
week, prompted by worries Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's
bank rescue plan was not viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman said the bank invited 30 private equity
and hedge fund firms to a dinner Tuesday, a routine gathering
for investment banking clients. The event, hosted by veteran
investment banker Milton Berlinski and Goldman co-President
Gary Cohn, was scheduled three weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attendees also heard a presentation by Jim O'Neill, the
bank's chief economist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There was no secret, emergency meeting to discuss the
Geithner plan," Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag told Reuters.
"We clearly could not have called a meeting. We'd need to be
psychic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an emailed statement, Goldman added: "Three weeks ago,
we issued an invitation to a large group of our investing
clients to discuss market conditions, including a presentation
on the macroeconomic environment. The fact that the dinner took
place on the same day as the Treasury Department's announcement
was a coincidence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Thursday, CNBC on-air editor Charles Gasparino
reported that Goldman had convened 20 large investment firms
for an "emergency discussion" of the Geithner plan within hours
of the plan's presentation to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attendees of the Goldman dinner expressed worries about the
plan and suggested alternatives for reviving the financial
markets, Gasparino reported on CNBC. The report continued that
Goldman would produce a white paper laying out the firm's own
plan for reviving the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment on what was discussed, but
insisted the report distorted the meeting's purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He was completely wrong. The spin was wrong. The facts are
wrong. The implications of what he's suggesting are also
wrong," said van Praag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even so, private-equity industry sources familiar with the
discussion told Reuters the firms in attendance welcomed the
direction of Geithner's plan, but they remain "cautious" as
they await more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors in particular expressed their support for such
government proposals as adding leverage to the system,
providing backstop guarantees and allowing private firms to
purchase assets, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was a wide-ranging conversation, led mostly by Goldman
Sachs' economist," said a person briefed by one of the
attendees. "It was not a "Geithner" conversation per se -- it
was more far-reaching and broad than that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There were no assignments or action items that I'm aware
of as it wasn't that kind of gathering -- it was
business/social event, a group of colleagues and GS clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the plan's unveiling on Tuesday, financial stocks
have been under pressure because many investors complained
Geithner failed to provide enough specifics on how the plan
would revive debt markets.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Walter Anderson, Chairman &amp; CEO of PARADE Publications, is retiring, it was
announced today by S.I. Newhouse, Jr., Chairman of Cond&#233; Nast. He will stay with
the company until his replacement is named. 

During his 31-year tenure at PARADE, Anderson, 64, increased the magazine`s
circulation from 21.6 million in 129 Sunday newspapers to 33 million in 470
papers. As editor, he brought in acclaimed writers including David Halberstam,
Norman Mailer, Dick Schaap, Gail Sheehy, and Herman Wouk. Anderson introduced
regular columns by Isadore Rosenfeld on health, Sheila Lukins on food, Dr. Carl
Sagan on science, the "Ask Marilyn" column by Marilyn vos Savant, and "In Step
With," by James Brady. 

"One of Walter`s greatest achievements was his creation of the `modern` PARADE,"
Mr. Newhouse said. "He transformed the Sunday magazine with new columns, ideas,
and a higher level of reporting and writing." In addition, "Walter has played a
major role in PARADE being one of the most successful publications in the
company while publishing books, writing plays, and being an active public
servant. We will miss him tremendously but wish him all the best in what I`m
sure will be a very fulfilling retirement." 

Mr. Anderson has been Chairman &amp; CEO of PARADE since 2000. Prior to that, since
1979, he was Editor-in-Chief. Anderson joined PARADE as a senior editor in June
1977. Prior to joining PARADE, Anderson held several management positions with
Gannett Newspapers in Westchester County. Previously he was an investigative
reporter whose articles appeared in publications such as New York and Ring, as
well as a writer for the Associated Press. 

A champion of literacy, Anderson made his theatrical debut on October 19, 1992,
at Ford`s Theater in Washington, D.C., with an original program of storytelling
to benefit the Literacy Volunteers of America and the National Center for Family
Literacy. Anderson received the Literacy Volunteers of America`s Stars in
Literacy Award with Mrs. Barbara Bush in 1990. He is a member of the board of
advisors of the National Center for Family Literacy and serves on the board of
Very Special Arts. In 1995, Anderson was nominated by President Clinton to serve
as a member of the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information
Science. Anderson`s latest play, "Johnny`s War," is being produced by Julian
Schlossberg. 

Mr. Anderson is a prolific author and has published five books including,
"Courage Is A Three-Letter Word," (1986, Random House), "The Greatest Risk of
All," (1988 Houghton Mifflin), "Read With Me," (1990 Houghton Mifflin), "The
Confidence Course," (1997 HarperCollins), and "Meant To Be: The True Story of a
Son Who Discovers He Is His Mother`s Deepest Secret," (2003 HarperCollins). 

A Vietnam veteran, Anderson served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1961 to 1966,
rising to the rank of sergeant. Today, he is a member of the board of advisors
of the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. 

In May 1999, Anderson launched "It`s About Time," a series of filmed discussions
with prominent Americans. The project is permanently available at the Library of
Congress. His guests have included Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel, Marian
Wright-Edelman, president of the Children`s Defense Fund, former U.S. Senator
Bill Bradley, the actor Christopher Reeve, and former Disney CEO Michael Eisner.


Anderson has received many honors throughout his career, including the 1994
Horatio Alger Award for which he was nominated by the late Norman Vincent Peale.
In 1988, Anderson was honored for his professional leadership and humanitarian
service with the Tree of Life Award from the Jewish National Fund and in 1989,
Anderson received the Napoleon Hill Foundation Gold Medal for literacy
achievement. 

Anderson was valedictorian of his class at Mercy College in Westchester, where
he majored in psychology. He served as chairman of the board of trustees of
Mercy for eight years and is now trustee emeritus. He is married to the former
Loretta Gritz. They have two children, one grandchild and live in White Plains. 

Cond&#233; Nast, a unit of Advance Publications, includes twenty-three consumer
magazines, Cond&#233; Nast Digital, the Fairchild Fashion Group, PARADE, the Cond&#233;
Nast Media Group, and the Shared Services Centers.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 12 (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's (GM.N)
bondholders will likely receive about 50 cents on the dollar in
a bond exchange if the government kicks in support to the deal,
JPMorgan said in a new report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Though a 50 cents-on-the-dollar exchange seems high
compared with the current trading levels on GM's bonds,
bondholders are not likely to participate in the exchange
unless they are treated roughly the same as the automaker's
unions, JPMorgan analysts Eric Selle and Atiba Edwards said in
the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM has been negotiating with bondholders and the United
Auto Workers union to forge a restructuring plan and meet
conditions for government aid. The automaker has to prove it is
viable by March 31 or risk losing about $13.4 billion in
government loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the restructuring, GM is asking the UAW to
accept about half of $20 billion it is owed for a health-care
trust in equity rather than cash. The automaker has also
offered to exchange bonds for equity as it attempts to reduce
its unsecured debt by two-thirds to $9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's report echoes a Detroit News report on Thursday
that bondholders are insisting that their own concessions match
the terms offered to the UAW, which could amount to near 50
cents on the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government could fund $0.10 of the bond exchange value
in cash and guarantee $0.40 value in new exchange notes,"
JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe a government guarantee combined with a takeout
premium above current trading levels in an exchange makes (GM)
bonds attractive," the report said. "However, we find better
relative value at Ford."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With union concessions and a 50 percent concession from
bondholders in a debt exchange, GM would likely become
sustainable in 2010, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Automakers must become self-sustaining by 2010 or risk
losing government assistance, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Despite expected resistance for concessions ... we expect
both union and bondholders to ultimately concede," JPMorgan
said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Rival drugmakers are looking to pick up some promising assets left behind when Pfizer ties the knot with Wyeth WYE.N, although that may turn out to be slim pickings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) $68 billion acquisition of its smaller rival is not expected to hit serious antitrust snags, but there will almost surely be some forced divestments, particularly in animal health and possibly cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N said it would likely evaluate any products that become available as a result of the merger as it looks to expand its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly  Co (LLY.N) CEO John Lechleiter has made clear he will be looking closely at products sold off by Pfizer to build up Lilly's Elanco animal health unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any time there is any large combination like this we are looking at opportunities there might be in divested assets," Lechleiter told analysts in a conference call last month. "So you can bet with our interest in growing our animal health business we have our eye on that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal health has become an increasingly important source of revenue for drugmakers. Pfizer reported revenue of $2.83 billion from its animal health business in 2008, while Wyeth posted $1.08 billion in animal health sales last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analysts believe Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) will have strong interest in the business to supplement the Merial operation it jointly owns with Merck  Co (MRK.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayer AG BAYG.DE and Novartis (NOVN.VX) also have been mentioned as possible buyers of animal health assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be plenty of people looking at any assets that would undergo FTC (Federal Trade Commission) scrutiny," Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts said the overlaps between Pfizer and Wyeth are few, which could result in very little that the world's largest drugmaker will be forced to sell by U.S. trade regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would be hard pressed to think of much of anything. I don't see any real overlap from an antitrust perspective," said Barbara Ryan, an analyst for Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe some obscure products or something in the pipeline, but I don't think there's going to be anything meaningful," Ryan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez also saw little need for significant divestitures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only thing that has any material overlap with Wyeth is animal health and we already assume that maybe 5 percent of that overall business might have to go," Fernandez said. "But the synergies across these companies are pretty positive, you (Pfizer) get to keep most of the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another asset that could be on the block is Wyeth's kidney cancer drug Torisel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe Pfizer will be forced to divest Torisel given its ownership of the gold standard first-line agent in renal cell carcinoma, Sutent," the Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other industry watchers disagree on Torisel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank's Ryan called it "highly unlikely" that Pfizer would be forced to unload Torisel, saying it and Sutent worth through different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leerink's Fernandez was even stronger in his belief that Pfizer will be able to add Torisel to its oncology portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Wyeth kidney cancer drug definitely will not have to be sold off," Fernandez said in no uncertain terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted competition in the kidney cancer space from Nexavar, sold by Bayer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc ONXX.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see Torisel definitely staying in the mix," Fernandez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although currently only approved for kidney cancer, Torisel has potential in other indications, including gynecological, melanoma and brain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez said there is something of an overlap in osteoporosis that could lead Pfizer to sell lasofoxifene, an experimental drug that has seen several regulatory setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That probably is not going to fetch a particularly good price because the product isn't going to be that big," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Ben Hirschler; editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

The implications of what he's suggesting are also wrong," said van Praag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, private-equity industry sources familiar with the discussion told Reuters the firms in attendance welcomed the direction of Geithner's plan, but they remain "cautious" as they await more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors in particular expressed their support for such government proposals as adding leverage to the system, providing backstop guarantees and allowing private firms to purchase assets, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the plan's unveiling on Tuesday, financial stocks have been under pressure because many investors complained Geithner failed to provide enough specifics on how the plan would revive debt markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, as double-digit volume gains in China, India and Eastern Europe offset a decline in North America, and shares rose 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than three-quarters of Coke's sales volume comes from abroad, a statistic analysts have often pointed to when trying to predict whether the world's top soft drink maker, or its rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), would outperform in the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke said global sales by volume rose 4 percent. JPMorgan analyst John Faucher called that "kind of remarkable" since eight large beverage and household product makers have reported results so far, and Coke is only the second to see a quarterly gain, after Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), which gets a much greater share of revenue from North America, will report results on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Volume was better than I expected it would be and the earnings were better," said Steve Dixon, portfolio manager of the Global Beverage Fund at New York-based Arnhold  S. Bleichroeder. Dixon's fund holds shares in Coke and Pepsi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What really (stood) out to me was the consistency of the results across geographies and product lines, of course with the exception being North America," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke said net income fell to $995 million, or 43 cents per share, in its fourth quarter, from $1.21 billion, or 52 cents per share, a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items profit was 64 cents per share, versus 61 cents forecast by Wall Street, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 2.7 percent to $7.13 billion, hurt by recent divestitures of some bottlers and the strengthening U.S. dollar, which depresses the value of overseas sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CURRENCY HEADWINDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke said a stronger dollar reduced quarterly operating income 9 percent and forecast a hit of 10 to 12 percent for the current first quarter. It did not estimate the full-year impact, saying volatility made it "impossible to forecast."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pepsi will have less of a currency headwind," said Dixon. "And because of its mix of business I expect that Pepsi, looking forward into 2009, would have a better benefit from lower commodity input costs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepsi also owns the Frito-Lay snack business, which got squeezed last year as costs for corn and cooking oils spiked. Dixon said it should get more of a boost now they've receded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding the impact of currency, Coke's long-term performance targets call for operating income to increase 6 percent to 8 percent, and earnings per share to grow at a high single-digit rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our picture of success for 2009 is to achieve those targets, as well as enhancing brand health and gaining share, despite the difficult operating environment," Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's U.S. sales have been hurt as high gas prices kept many people away from gas stations and convenience stores and the recession leads people to cut back on dining out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Coke Chief Executive Muhtar Kent told reporters that lower gas prices have helped sales recover, at least at restaurant drive-throughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of the food service business, I think we're seeing a little bit of improvement, but it's really too early to say whether it's sustainable or not," Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume of carbonated soft drinks such as Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite rose 2 percent. Other beverages such as juice, bottled tea and water rose 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume rose 6 percent in Latin America, 2 percent in Europe, 9 percent in the Pacific region and 7 percent in the Eurasia and Africa segment. Volume fell 3 percent in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it was on track to deliver $500 million in annualized savings from productivity improvements by the end of 2011. It said Coca-Cola Supply, a new company it formed with its largest bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc (CCE.N) should save it another $150 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares rose $2.45, or 5.9 percent, to $43.72 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Gunna Dickson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recycling Effort Helps Trendsetters "Give it Back" in Style
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Recycling, LLC, is making green the new black with a recycling program
at the Mercedes-Benz Fall Fashion Week Fall 2009 Collections. Fashion devotees
attending the shows will be encouraged to "Give it Back" by recycling their used
bottles, cans, glass, aluminum, plastic, and cardboard. 

More than 25 recycling bins bearing the "Give It Back" logo will be placed
throughout the complex in Bryant Park including the lobby, hospitality lounges
and backstage areas during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Fall 2009 Collections from
Feb. 13-20. 

"Recycling at the tents is an easy way for all Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week
attendees to do their part to protect the environment and minimize waste,"
commented Fern Mallis, Senior Vice President of IMG Fashion. "We are grateful to
Coca-Cola Recycling for helping us create a new and important tradition of
recycling during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week." 

Coca-Cola Recycling worked with New York recycler, Boro Recycling Inc., to
establish a recycling program to meet the needs of the more than 100,000
attendees during the eight days of shows, events and activities. Boro will be
making multiple pick-ups onsite each day to ensure a smooth operation. The
collected materials will then be sent to recycling processors throughout the
northeast to be reused in new products. Coca-Cola Recycling estimates that
11,000 thousand pounds of recyclables will be collected during this effort
alone. 

"It`s not just about what`s in the bottle, it`s what we do with the bottle that
can make a positive difference," said Celeste Bottorff, vice president of Living
Well, Coca-Cola North America. "With `Give It Back,` we aim to inspire people to
join us in our efforts to recycle and reuse all of our bottles and cans in the
U.S. marketplace." 

The "Give it Back" recycling initiative at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week is the
latest in an ongoing series of environmental efforts in New York City. In
January, Coca-Cola Recycling led a "Give it Back" recycling education program
for consumers outside the New York Public Library. On New Year`s Eve, revelers
were among the first to witness the "Give it Back" recycling message on
Coca-Cola`s iconic Times Square billboard. This year also marks the conversion
of the iconic billboard to wind power. This move to 100 percent wind power will
reduce CO2 emissions by 376 metric tons, the equivalent of planting 471.5 acres
of trees or of taking 75 cars from the road for one year. 

The "Give It Back" message also is being delivered to consumers in a new
television ad unveiled January 13 during the season premiere of American Idol.
The 30-second commercial informs consumers that, "If you`ve had a Coke in the
last 40 years, you`ve played a part in one of the largest beverage recycling
efforts in the world." For more information on "Give It Back," visit

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Feb 12 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has

Ecuador to discard a claim for $27 billion submitted by a
court-appointed expert last year, the U.S. oil company said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

party requesting technical work has to pay for it, and denied
helping Cabrera produce the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, which peasants and Indians in Ecuador brought
in the early 1990s, contends that Texaco, which Chevron bought
in 2001, polluted the jungle and damaged their health by
dumping 18 billion gallons (68 billion liters) of contaminated
water from 1972 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, has argued that it
was released from any liability because it paid $40 million for
an environmental cleanup in the 1990s, and blames state oil
company Petroecuador for much of the pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiffs expect a final ruling on the case in 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Court provided with evidence that author of $27 billion damage assessment has
violated Ecuadorian law and irrevocably tainted the current proceeding


SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX)has asked an Ecuador judge to discard a
court-requested assessment of current environmental conditions in Ecuador`s
Amazon, as a result of fraud, gross errors and conflict of interest. In its
filing with the court, Chevron documents a litany of fundamental flaws within
the assessment demonstrating that the objectivity and independence of the
report`s author have been fully compromised, rendering the report inadmissible. 

The report, filed in November 2008 with the Provincial Court of Sucumbios,
recommends that the judge presiding in the ongoing environmental lawsuit assess
damages of more than $27 billion, augmenting an earlier report in which $8 to
$16 billion in damages was suggested. Prepared by a court appointee, Richard
Cabrera, the report was intended to respond to the parties` criticism of his
earlier report. Instead, Cabrera`s updated filing presents no new facts or data;
rather, he simply adopts the demands of plaintiffs` counsel - in some instances,
word for word - to substantiate more than $11 billion in newly alleged damages. 

"Judging by Mr. Cabrera`s undeniable disdain for science, transparency and
Ecuadorian law, he cannot be seen as an unbiased adviser to the judge," said
Charles James, Chevron`s general counsel. "Through his ongoing collaboration
with parties who stand to benefit from this lawsuit, we believe that Mr. Cabrera
has knowingly abandoned his obligations to the court and assumed the role of
advocate for plaintiffs` counsel." 

Chevron has shown Cabrera`s first report contains fabricated evidence,
indefensible theories and, in some instances, even gross mathematical errors.
Despite an awareness of these fundamental defects, Cabrera`s amended assessment
makes no effort to correct any prior mistakes and introduces a new series of
egregious errors, such as:

* Recommending more than $9 billion in damages associated with "excess cancer
deaths" without identifying a single victim, let alone providing any
corroborating documentation such as a death certificate or a medical diagnosis. 
* Recommending more than $3 billion in damages associated with groundwater
contamination even though his own data clearly indicate no such contamination
exists, and Cabrera acknowledges that he has no basis for devising a remediation
plan or developing a cost estimate. Rather, Cabrera simply adopts plaintiffs`
counsel`s demands to assess damages and repackages them as fact. 
* Conceding that his work was conducted in such a fashion as to assign blame to
Chevron instead of performing an objective and unbiased scientific analysis of
current environmental conditions, as the court had ordered.

"An extraordinarily disturbing pattern has emerged with respect to Mr. Cabrera.
The court appointee`s work and plaintiffs` counsel`s demands read like two parts
of the same script," added James. "It is clear that Mr. Cabrera`s reports are
produced for an ulterior purpose by persons interested in exploiting this
lawsuit for an unwarranted and utterly disproportionate financial windfall. If
for no other reason than to preserve its own credibility, the court must
intervene before this farce proceeds further." 

The rationale Cabrera uses to justify his "independently" developed damage
recommendation comes directly from the plaintiffs` counsel. In many instances,
Cabrera simply cuts and pastes portions of a plaintiffs` filing and presents
them as his own. For instance:

* On September 16, 2008, plaintiffs` counsel wrote:

"Therefore the cost analysis to remediate to 1000 ppm of TPH as stated in
Attachment N calculates a cost that is lower than the actual one in order to
achieve this level of cleanliness (even though it should be taken into account
that 1000 ppm of TPH is not adequate level of cleanliness, as previously
mentioned). The real cost to remediate the soils to 1000 ppm of TPH is
approximately $2,034,000,000." (emphasis added)

* On November 26, 2008, Cabrera wrote:

"Therefore my analysis to remediate to 1000 ppm of TPH as stated in Attachment N
calculates a cost that is lower than the actual one in order to achieve this
level of cleanliness (even though it should be taken into account that 1000 ppm
of TPH is not adequate level of cleanliness, as previously mentioned). Using my
revised calculations the real cost to remediate the soils to 1000 ppm of TPH is
approximately $2,034,000,000." (emphasis added) 

In addition, Cabrera also declines to explain or deny his apparent connection to
representatives of the Amazon Defense Coalition, the financial beneficiary of
the lawsuit. Photographs and video demonstrate that members of the Amazon
Defense Coalition directly participated in Cabrera`s "independent" data
collection, and the organization exclusively funded his work. 

Moreover, Chevron has provided the court with evidence suggesting that the
social survey that provides the evidentiary foundation of one-third of Mr.
Cabrera`s total damage assessment was produced at the request of and funded by
the Amazon Defense Coalition. When asked to testify under oath to explain this
relationship, Cabrera refused to show up or to comment, illustrating that the
court`s "independent" appointee has violated his mandate and is working in
collaboration with the plaintiffs` advocates. 

In the rebuttal now on record with the court, Chevron provides an exhaustive
analysis of the baseless and nonsensical alleged damages and proposed remedies
contained within Cabrera`s report. Meanwhile, in past submissions, Chevron has
sought to have the case dismissed in Ecuador, citing judicial misconduct,
interference in the case by the country`s executive branch and denial of the
constitutionally guaranteed right to fair trial.

about the lawsuit can be found at www.chevron.com/ecuador.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Reportlinker.com announces that a new market research report related to the
Telecommunication industry is available in its catalogue. 

Non-traditional competitors in the consumer telecoms market: Microsoft

http://www.reportlinker.com/p0102081/Non-traditional-competitors-in-the-consumer-telecoms-market-Microsoft.html

Increasingly seamless communication mobility, achieved through improved
interoperability, partnerships and aggregation, is creating network effects that
make communications more valuable to consumers. 

Seamless mobility will expand network effects, potentially excluding telco
systems. Increasingly seamless communication mobility, achieved through improved
interoperability, partnerships and aggregation, is creating network effects that
make communications more valuable to consumers. This will lead to increased use
of rich instant messaging, file sharing and social networking applications.
Communication systems that don`t offer the right rich communication experience
or connect themselves to massive networks will be used less and lose customers. 

Growth in video calling would drive users from fixed line towards VoIP
platforms. Because video and imaging require Internet protocol technology, this
means that fixed line providers will lose traffic to Internet services and
mobile networks through PCs, televisions, games consoles and mobile phones. 

MSN Mobile to grab bigger advertising share. Microsoft has acquired a range of
companies, leaping towards its goal of building a world-class Internet-wide
advertising platform. In the mobile sector, these acquisitions are geared
towards significant improvements in device penetration, choice of applications
and consumer experience. In the near term, Ovum expects to see MSN Mobile gain a
greater share of mobile advertising revenues at the expense of operator portal
advertising revenues. 

Category search is an opportunity for telcos. Microsoft is segmenting Search
into key verticals (e.g. shopping, travel, locational services) to offer both
advertisers and consumers more relevant and better-targeted results than Google.
Ovum believes that targeted and localised search facilities offer opportunities
for telcos to customise Search in their portals, thereby attracting specialised,
regional or local advertisers. 

Microsoft is to target APAC in the downturn. Heavy reliance on the US region
(60% of revenues) exposes Microsoft to risks associated with adverse
socio-political and economic changes. If the downturn becomes more severe, Ovum
expects the company to target APAC countries more aggressively. 

Net neutrality is not a done deal. Ovum expects to see the debate on bandwidth
metering and throttling to return to centre stage, as networks continue to lose
out to webcos and software companies in the battle to monetise added-value
services.

&lt;p&gt;COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.--(Business Wire)--
U.S. semiconductor maker Ramtron International Corporation (Nasdaq: RMTR), the
leading developer and supplier of nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory
(F-RAM) and integrated semiconductor products, today announced that it has
entered into a foundry services agreement with IBM. The companies plan to
install Ramtron`s F-RAM semiconductor process technology in IBM's Burlington,
Vermont, advanced wafer manufacturing facility. Once installed, the new foundry
supply will serve as a foundation for the introduction of new and cost effective
high-performance F-RAM semiconductor products. 

"We look forward to increased manufacturing capacity through our foundry
relationship with IBM to help meet the growing demand for Ramtron`s unique F-RAM
semiconductor products," said Bob Djokovich, Ramtron COO. "This new world-class
foundry will provide a flexible and cost effective manufacturing platform for
our new product development initiatives, which will drive new market
opportunities for Ramtron. We have high confidence in IBM Microelectronics and
believe that the addition of their process development and foundry services will
help Ramtron serve the future needs of F-RAM customers around the world." 

"We are pleased to help facilitate the expansion of Ramtron`s F-RAM product
offerings," said John DiToro, vice president, semiconductor manufacturing, IBM
Systems and Technology Group. "The vast array of IP blocks available through IBM
foundry services can provide Ramtron with a great deal of product development
flexibility. We look forward to working with Ramtron to help the company reach
its manufacturing and product development objectives." 

Ramtron expects to generate first production wafers during 2010 on the IBM
0.18-micron wafer manufacturing process. IBM will become Ramtron`s third foundry
supplier for its F-RAM semiconductor products, along with Fujitsu Limited and
Texas Instruments. 

In tandem with the foundry agreement, Ramtron is in the process of establishing
an $11.0 million loan facility through Silicon Valley Bank to fund the capital
and development costs in connection with the foundry relationship with IBM. In
addition, Ramtron is working with Silicon Valley Bank to extend the company`s
revolving line of credit (LOC) until March of 2012, and increase the amount that
can be borrowed under the LOC to a total of $5.0 million. Ramtron`s existing LOC
allows for borrowings of up to $4.0 million. To date, Ramtron has no amount
outstanding on its line of credit. The new loan facility is expected to close
during the first quarter of 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Local Agencies Will Hire Interns for Summer-Long Program
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil today announced the 75 nonprofit agencies selected to participate in
the 2009 Community Summer Jobs Program (CSJP) in Dallas. In its 19th year
locally and 38th year nationally, the program offers undergraduate students a
paid summer internship and real-world work experience in the nonprofit and
community service sectors. 

The Volunteer Center of North Texas administers the program, training agencies
on the recruiting, interviewing and selection process, and assisting in
organizing and managing the summer internships. Each participating agency will
select its own full-time undergraduate intern. 

With the summer months often being some of the busiest for nonprofits, CSJP
interns offer agencies much-needed help and, in turn, students gain valuable
information about a variety of nonprofit activities. ExxonMobil CSJP interns
also participate in a group service project and numerous professional
development seminars throughout the summer. 

"Education in the classroom is an important part of learning and development,
but through the ExxonMobil CSJP, students are turning those lessons into real
world action," said Robert Lanyon, corporate citizenship and community
investments manager, ExxonMobil. 

"We are proud to help place college students with some of the finest local
agencies each year, where passionate staff members teach students about the
inner workings of a nonprofit. Equally exciting is the opportunity to offer
agencies a college intern who is ready to take on the challenges of a nonprofit
and the growing demands of that sector." 

"It is an honor to have so many dedicated agencies involved in this program,"
said Phyllis Bernstein, chair of the Dallas County Council on Volunteerism,
which is part of the Volunteer Center of North Texas. 

"The 75 nonprofit agencies selected for the 2009 ExxonMobil CSJP offer a wide
variety of internship opportunities for undergraduate college students, and each
promises to add a new and exciting dimension to this program. With a passion for
encouraging young people in the nonprofit world, these selected agencies will
certainly be invaluable to the interns` professional development and future
careers." 

College students interested in internship positions may contact the selected
agencies and university career planning and placement offices. For a list of
participating agencies, visit the Volunteer Center website at

&lt;p&gt;GOTHENBURG, Sweden--(Business Wire)--
Swedish data giant PAR has launched a plug-in called `One-by-One` to enable
users of Microsoft Dynamics CRM to link directly with its pan-European
EuroContactPool business-to-business database. 

PAR has worked with Cybernetics - a Microsoft partner and specialist in Dynamics
CRM - to develop the One-by-One plug-in. It enables users to quickly verify and
enhance their customer data, and prospect for new customers, by linking
seamlessly with the 22 million company records in the EuroContactPool (ECP)
database. 

Data records can be accessed either on an individual basis using One-by-One, by
importing segments or updating an entire database. 

One-by-One enables users of Microsoft Dynamics CRM to input search information
they have, say from a telephone conversation, and immediately enhance it with
all other data from the ECP database, such as postal address, phone number,
activity code, size of company and decision-makers` names. The Cybernetics
application opens a search window with a hot list of basic information so users
can select the correct company and populate the CRM with all relevant fields. 

The record is automatically flagged for monthly synchronisation so that any
changes made to the EuroContactPool database are also updated in the in-house
CRM system. 

Per L&#246;fgren, International Product Director for PAR, says: "The most common
reason for inaccurate data on a company`s CRM system is manual inputting errors
and empty fields. The One-by-One plug-in eradicates that by automatically
populating the relevant fields and synchronising on an ongoing basis enabling
clients to always have updated and correct data in their CRM systems". 

The launch of the One-by-One plug-in provides database cleansing and enhancement
on a pan-European basis to thousands of users of Microsoft Dynamics CRM. It
significantly increases a company`s ability to maintain accurate information on
both its existing and prospect client data. 

Maria Lennman, CEO of Cybernetics, says: "In most big organisations, the
company`s value is in its knowledge and intelligence, particularly information
on its customers".

EuroContactPool is the world`s fastest-growing business-to-business European
database, now covering 22 million companies and 16.4 million executives across
16 European countries.

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Feb 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ManageSoft, the leading provider of software asset management and license
compliance solutions, announced today that it is now a member of the
Microsoft System Center Alliance Program. ManageSoft's Enterprise
Compliance Manager(TM) (ECM) software includes out-of-the-box integration
with Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2003 and System Center
Configuration Manager (SCCM) 2007.

    ECM extends the value of the Microsoft System Center infrastructure in
three ways. First, by transforming Configuration Manager asset evidence
into a list of proper application titles, customers gain an immediate
understanding of what software is installed in their enterprise. Secondly,
ECM can import purchase order data, including SKU numbers, to reconcile
software purchases versus what has been installed throughout the
enterprise. And third, ECM applies product usage rights to generate a
license entitlement position that enables license and maintenance
optimization resulting in lower IT expense.

    ECM aids IT spend management by reducing new software purchases, cutting
maintenance renewal fees, and minimizing the cost and risk associated with
software publisher license reviews. For example, by taking into account
application usage data imported from Configuration Manager, ECM allows
reallocation of existing unused licenses to decrease new purchases.
Furthermore, it enables organizations to negotiate volume license
agreement renewals in line with actual software use.

    "The broad offerings from our System Center Alliance partners extend the
management capabilities of the System Center solutions and help our mutual
customers reduce their overall IT management costs," said JD Marymee,
director of strategic partner alliances, Management and Services Division,
Microsoft. "ManageSoft's Enterprise Compliance Manager offering, in
combination with Microsoft Configuration Manager 2007, enables customers
to more fully optimize their software and hardware investments and we're
pleased to see them join the System Center Alliance community."

    "Our membership in the Microsoft System Center Alliance is indicative of
our commitment to providing integrated solutions that leverage existing IT
investments and provide the fastest ROI," said John Emmitt, director of
business development, ManageSoft. "Our customers require asset management
infrastructure tools and license compliance solutions that allow them to
align IT strategies with business goals."

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today reported unit case volume growth of 4 percent in the

and 6 percent growth in the prior year quarter and full year, respectively.
Acquisitions contributed 1 point of unit case volume growth for the quarter and
2 points of growth for the full year. 

The Company achieved broad-based growth across the globe. In key emerging
markets, China increased unit case volume 29 percent, India increased 28 percent
and Eastern Europe increased double digits in the quarter. Latin America
delivered solid, balanced growth in unit case volume led by Mexico increasing 6
percent and Brazil increasing 7 percent in the quarter. Europe achieved unit
case volume growth of 2 percent in the quarter successfully cycling 3 percent
growth in the prior year. In other key markets, North America unit case volume
declined 3 percent in the quarter and unit case volume in Japan was even. 

Sparkling beverages increased unit case volume 2 percent in both the quarter and

increasing unit case volume 2 percent, 3 percent and 6 percent, respectively,
for the year. International sparkling beverage unit case volume increased 4

Still beverage unit case volume increased 11 percent in the quarter and 13

juice and juice drinks, teas, active lifestyle and water brands. International
still beverage unit case volume increased 17 percent for both the quarter and
full year. 

Globally, the Company continued to gain volume and value share in nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink beverages as well as in core sparkling and still beverages for
both the quarter and full year. 

Financial Highlights

Cash flow from operations was $7.6 billion for the year, compared with $7.1
billion in the prior year, an increase of 6 percent. 

The Company reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.43. After
considering items impacting comparability, earnings per share for the quarter
were $0.64, an increase of 10 percent. Reported earnings per share for the
quarter included a net charge of $0.21 per share primarily related to a non-cash
impairment charge at Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., an equity investee ("CCE"),
restructuring charges and asset write-downs. Reported earnings per share for the
fourth quarter of 2007 were $0.52 and included a net charge of $0.06 primarily
related to restructuring charges and asset write-downs. 

Earnings per share for the year were $2.49 on a reported basis. After
considering items impacting comparability, earnings per share for the year were
$3.15, an increase of 17 percent. Reported earnings per share for the year
included a net charge of $0.66 per share primarily related to non-cash
impairment charges at CCE, restructuring charges and asset write-downs. Full
year 2007 reported earnings per share were $2.57 and included a net charge of
$0.13 per share primarily related to restructuring charges and asset
write-downs. 

Operating income in the quarter increased 12 percent on a reported basis and
increased 10 percent after considering items impacting comparability. Items
impacting comparability reduced fourth quarter pre-tax operating income by $108
million in 2008 and by $126 million in 2007. Currency negatively impacted
comparable operating income in the quarter by 9 percent. Full year operating
income increased 16 percent on a reported basis and increased 17 percent after
considering items impacting comparability. Currency benefited both full year
reported and comparable operating income by 6 percent. 

The Company is currently on track to deliver $500 million in annualized savings
from productivity initiatives by year-end 2011. The continued acceleration of
these efforts will enable cash flows to be redeployed to drive investments for
growth. 

"Our performance in the fourth quarter was very solid," said Muhtar Kent,
president and chief executive officer, The Coca-Cola Company. "Our fourth
quarter and full year 2008 results reflect both the universal appeal of our
global brands and the unrivalled reach of one of the world's leading consumer
products distribution systems. We delivered consistent, quality results for the
quarter and for the full year. For the year, we again exceeded our long-term
growth targets despite a very challenging economic environment. And importantly,
we gained volume and value share in most of our leading markets through solid
execution of our strategies." 

"Our highly skilled management team is assertively addressing the challenges
posed by the current global economic crisis. Working in close collaboration with
our bottling partners, we successfully accelerated actions, refocused
investments and intensified our disciplined execution to drive results. We also
made significant gains in realigning our organizational structure to generate
greater productivity and in rewiring our business for sustainable results. 

While certainly not crisis proof, as no company is, I do believe our global
business model is relatively resilient, as we bring simple moments of pleasure
to our consumers, nearly 1.6 billion times a day, for cents at a time. We
recognize that 2009 will bring many unique challenges to us and our consumers,
customers, and bottling partners. Yet, I believe that our solid brand and
business fundamentals - together with a fundamentally sound balance sheet,
robust cash generating model and strong global bottling system - provide a sound
foundation for our management team to continue driving long-term sustainable
growth."

across the portfolio. Unit case volume growth in Europe was driven by
double-digit growth in Eastern Europe for the quarter and high single-digit
growth for the full year. 
* Key countries across the group including Germany, Great Britain and France
gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the
quarter.

Latin America

* The Latin America Group delivered strong unit case volume growth of 6 percent
in the quarter and 8 percent for the year, cycling 10 percent and 9 percent
growth in the prior year quarter and full year, respectively. Net revenues for
the year increased 18 percent, reflecting a 6 percent increase in concentrate
sales, positive pricing and mix as well as a 4 percent currency benefit.
Operating income for the year increased 20 percent reflecting the net revenue
increase and continuing investment in key marketing initiatives. 
* Latin America delivered growth across the portfolio with sparkling beverages
increasing 4 percent and still beverages increasing 40 percent for the year.
Unit case volume expanded across all key markets in the quarter and full year,
with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina increasing 9 percent, 7 percent and 5 percent
for the full year, respectively. Acquisitions contributed 1 point of the overall
unit case volume growth in the quarter and 3 points for the full year. 
* For the quarter and full year, volume and value share gains continued for the
Latin America Group in both sparkling and still beverages.

North America

* Unit case volume in the North America Group declined 3 percent in the quarter,
driven by significant bottler price increases and poor macroeconomic conditions
partially offset by strong consumer marketing, value creating customer programs
and good bottler execution. Retail unit case volume declined 4 percent, while
Foodservice and Hospitality increased 1 percent. For the year, unit case volume
declined 1 percent, including a 1 percent benefit from acquisitions. Net
revenues for the year increased 6 percent, reflecting a 2 percent decline in
concentrate sales, offset by positive pricing and mix. Operating income
decreased 7 percent for the year with higher input costs and continued
investment in strategic marketing initiatives offsetting increased net revenues.

* Sparkling beverage unit case volume declined 4 percent in the quarter and 3
percent for the year. Continued successful execution of the three-cola strategy
helped the Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero portfolio gain volume and
value share in the U.S. for the full year. Coca-Cola Zero continued its stellar
performance, increasing unit case volume 29 percent in the quarter and 36
percent for the full year. 
* Still beverage unit case volume increased 1 percent in the quarter and 5
percent for the full year, and achieved volume and value share gains, due to the
continued strong performance of glac&#233;au, Fuze, Trademark Simply and Minute Maid
Enhanced Juices.

Pacific

* The Pacific Group increased unit case volume 9 percent in the quarter and 8
percent for the year, successfully cycling 3 percent and 7 percent growth in the
prior year quarter and full year, respectively. Net revenues for the year
increased 7 percent, reflecting an 8 percent increase in concentrate sales and a
high single-digit currency benefit partially offset by the impact of structural
changes and unfavorable product mix. Operating income for the year increased 9
percent reflecting the net revenue increase and continued investments in key
business initiatives. 
* Pacific delivered growth across the portfolio with sparkling beverages
increasing 8 percent and still beverages increasing 7 percent for the year led
by solid performance in key markets. 
* China unit case volume increased 29 percent in the quarter and 19 percent for
the year. The results were led by double-digit unit case volume growth in
Trademark Coca-Cola, Trademark Sprite and Minute Maid along with the successful
launch of Yuan Ye, an original green leaf tea, each of which contributed to
volume and value share gains in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages as well as
in sparkling and still beverages for the year. 
* Japan unit case volume was even in the quarter and full year. Sparkling
beverages delivered unit case volume growth of 8 percent in the quarter led by
Trademark Coca-Cola and Trademark Fanta, which grew unit case volume 8 percent
and 16 percent, respectively. Strong performance by Coca-Cola Zero and Fanta
FuruFuru supported this growth. Unit case volume declines in Sokenbicha and
Aquarius offset strong growth in sparkling beverages. Japan gained volume and
value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages for the quarter and full
year. 
* In the Philippines, unit case volume increased 1 percent in the quarter,
returning to growth after two quarters of sequential decline, and increased 3
percent for the year. The Philippines gained volume and value share in
nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages for the year despite operating in a more
challenging economic environment. 
* Volume and value share gains continued for the Pacific Group in both sparkling
and still beverages for the year.

Bottling Investments

* The Bottling Investments Group`s unit case volume decreased 1 percent in the
quarter, reflecting bottling divestitures partially offset by organic growth
across most operations. For the full year, unit case volume increased 14
percent, reflecting both organic growth and a benefit from acquisitions
partially offset by bottling divestitures. Net revenues increased 16 percent for
the year due to the unit case volume increase, a mid single-digit currency
benefit and the impact of structural changes. Operating income increased 73
percent for the year reflecting the net revenue increase and the benefits of
supply chain efficiencies and controlled operating expenses, partially offset by
higher commodity input costs and continued investments to enhance market
execution capabilities.

Financial Review

Operating Results

Net operating revenues for the fourth quarter decreased 3 percent, with a 4
percent increase in concentrate sales and a 4 percent favorable impact from
pricing and mix, offset by a 4 percent decrease from structural changes
primarily related to bottling divestitures and a 7 percent negative currency
impact. For the year, net operating revenues increased 11 percent, reflecting a
4 percent increase in concentrate sales, a 4 percent benefit from currency and a
3 percent favorable impact from pricing and mix. 

Cost of goods sold decreased 3 percent for the quarter. This reflects a 4
percent increase in concentrate sales as well as increases in commodity-based
input and freight costs offset by a 6 percent decrease from currency and a 7
percent decrease from structural changes primarily related to bottling
divestitures. For the year, cost of goods sold increased 9 percent. This
reflects a 4 percent increase in concentrate sales, a 4 percent increase from
currency and increases in commodity-based input and freight costs, partially
offset by a 2 percent decrease from structural changes primarily related to
bottling acquisitions and divestitures. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 10 percent for the
quarter and increased 8 percent for the year reflecting a 6 percent decrease and
a 4 percent increase from currency in the quarter and full year, respectively.
The Company continued to realize expense leverage by investing in marketing
strategies to drive brand growth and by more effectively managing general and
administrative expenses. 

The Company had other operating charges in the fourth quarter and full year
totaling $108 million and $350 million pre-tax, respectively, primarily related
to restructuring costs, productivity initiatives, asset impairments and contract
termination fees. 

Operating income increased 12 percent for the quarter and 16 percent for the
year. After considering items impacting comparability, operating income grew 10
percent for the quarter and 17 percent for the year. Currency negatively
impacted comparable operating income by 9 percent in the quarter, but benefited
it 6 percent for the year. Based on the anticipated benefits of hedging coverage
in place, the Company currently expects currencies to have an estimated 10 to 12
percent negative impact on operating income in the first quarter of 2009. 

Effective Tax Rate

The reported effective tax rates for the quarter and the year were 13.5 percent
and 21.9 percent, respectively. The underlying effective tax rate on operations
for the quarter and year was 22.0 percent. The variance between the reported
rate and the underlying rate was due to the tax impact of various separately
disclosed items impacting comparability. 

The Company anticipates that its underlying effective tax rate on operations for
the full year 2009 will be approximately 23.0 to 24.0 percent. The Company`s
estimated underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of discrete
events, which, if and when they occur, are separately recognized in the
appropriate period. 

New Operating Structure

As previously communicated, effective July 1, 2008, the Company made certain
changes to its operating structure to realign geographic responsibility. The
European Union Group was reconfigured to include the Adriatic and Balkans Region
and was renamed the Europe Group; and the remaining Eurasia Group was combined
with the Africa Group into the new Eurasia and Africa Group. The changes in
operating structure did not impact the other existing geographic operating
segments, Bottling Investments or Corporate. Reporting on the new structure
began in the third quarter. Reclassified operating segment information can be
found in the Company`s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on September 8, 2008. 

Items Impacting Prior Year Results

In 2007, the fourth quarter results included a net charge of $0.06 primarily
related to restructuring charges and asset write-downs. Third quarter 2007
results included a $0.03 per share charge primarily related to restructuring
charges which was offset by a $0.03 per share gain primarily related to the sale
of a portion of the Company`s investment in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited. Second
quarter 2007 results included a net charge of $0.05 per share primarily related
to restructuring charges and a non-cash impairment charge at an equity investee.
First quarter 2007 results included a net charge of $0.02 per share primarily
related to an asset write-off in the Philippines bottler, partially offset by
gains on the sales of the equity interest in a Brazilian bottler and real estate
in Spain. 

Conference Call

The Company will host a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss
the fourth quarter and full year 2008 results today at 9:30 a.m. (EST). The

Note: Refer to the Company`s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on September 8, 2008 for more information on
the changes to the Company`s operating structure. 

(1) Intersegment revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2008 were
approximately $33 million for Eurasia and Africa, $206 million for Europe, $48
million for Latin America, $28 million for North America, $65 million for
Pacific and $30 million for Bottling Investments. 

(2) Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes for the three
months ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately $1 million for
Eurasia and Africa, $44 million for North America, $21 million for Bottling
Investments and $42 million for Corporate, primarily as a result of
restructuring costs, productivity initiatives, asset impairments and contract
termination fees. 

(3) Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended December 31,
2008 was reduced by approximately $19 million for Europe, $8 million for North
America and $529 million for Bottling Investments, primarily attributable to our
proportionate share of asset impairment charges recorded by equity method
investees. 

(4) Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended December 31,
2008 was reduced by approximately $2 million for North America, $30 million for
Bottling Investments and $52 million for Corporate, primarily due to
other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities. 

(5) Intersegment revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2007 were
approximately $34 million for Eurasia and Africa, $230 million for Europe, $71
million for Latin America, $12 million for North America, $112 million for

million for North America, $2 million for Pacific, $4 million for Bottling
Investments and $86 million for Corporate, primarily as a result of asset
impairments and restructuring costs. 

(7) Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended December 31,
2007 was increased by approximately $18 million for Corporate due to the sale of
real estate in the United States. 

(8) Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended December 31,
2007 was reduced by approximately $9 million for Bottling Investments. The
reduction was primarily due to our proportionate share of asset impairments and
restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees, partially offset by
our proportionate share of tax benefits recorded by CCE.

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U. S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain
non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of
this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current
results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these
non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U. S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain
non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of
this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current
results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these
non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of
underlying trends of the business because they provide a comparison of
historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall
comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making
financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's
performance. See the Tables above for supplemental financial data and

&lt;p&gt;Industry-Leading InfiniBand Switching Technology To Drive New Levels of
Performance and Efficiency for IBM BladeCenter
BILLERICA, Mass. &amp; HERZLIYA, Israel--(Business Wire)--
Voltaire Ltd. (NASDAQ: VOLT), a leading provider of scale-out computing fabrics
for data centers, today announced that it will design a next generation
high-performance 40 Gb/s InfiniBand switch module for IBM BladeCenter. The new
IBM custom switch will deliver 100% faster InfiniBand connectivity to accelerate
performance of applications running on BladeCenter. 

According to Gartner Research, blade servers represent the fastest-growing
server form factor on a worldwide basis. (1) 

"We recently built the world`s fastest computer, and Voltaire was a big
contributor. That`s a great example of how IBM consistently provides our blade
customers with the latest in networking technologies to allow them to extract
maximum performance from their systems," said Alex Yost, vice president, IBM
BladeCenter. "The addition of Voltaire-designed, 40 Gb/s, QDR InfiniBand
switching to BladeCenter will provide an ideal platform for clients with
high-performance needs." 

The new switch module enables additional benefits for IBM BladeCenter in both
the enterprise data center and high performance computing (HPC) markets. The
combined solution will better support the performance requirements of enterprise
applications for virtualization and enterprise resource planning and, because of
the high bandwidth and I/O throughput, will greatly simplify large-scale HPC
deployments. In addition to performance and scalability, Voltaire solutions
contribute to the BladeCenter`s energy efficiency by requiring very low power
per port, making it a more energy efficient solution than bladed systems using
10 Gigabit Ethernet for the interconnect. 

"Voltaire solutions are built to deliver the application acceleration and
scalability demands of data centers and HPC centers while also delivering the
best price performance and energy efficiency of any high-performance
interconnect," said Ronnie Kenneth, chairman and CEO, Voltaire. "IT
organizations with environments ranging from data warehousing and virtualization
to industries including financial services, manufacturing, life sciences,
government and education will achieve new levels of application performance with
IBM BladeCenter and its new, 40 Gb/s InfiniBand switch." 

The solution is expected to be available through IBM in 1H 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Real-time operational visibility helps leading online auto insurance agency meet
rigorous service-level agreements, strengthen customer care


ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE:IBM) today announced that Insurance.com is using IBM Cognos
performance management software to provide staff with live up-to-the-second
operational visibility required to deliver peak sales center performance for its
customers. 

In today`s economy, growing attention is now being paid to IT solutions that can
help organizations nurture customer relationships and stimulate revenue growth.
For sales centers, in particular, the challenge lies not just in understanding
the past, but reacting to what customers need in the present. Real-time,
automated performance monitoring and analytics is key to helping sales centers
adapt `on the fly` to immediate conditions, such as sudden call service spikes.
This is especially critical in today`s world of online services where timeliness
and service are critical to a competitive advantage. 

As the leading online independent auto insurance agency in the United States,
Insurance.com needed a solution that could continuously monitor both its
workflow and IT systems to ensure its sales center was always running at top
performance. Fundamentally, the company had to honor its commitment to
round-the-clock system uptime for its online quoting platform, which supports
more than one million car insurance quotes each year. The company was also
interested in capitalizing on immediate performance insights that could help
make the center more nimble and responsive to its customers. 

Following a competitive review, Insurance.com chose IBM Cognos Now!, the
industry`s first BI solution with a continuous business monitoring appliance
designed to help decision makers proactively track, monitor, and respond to
updated operational metrics. 

With the initial installation implemented in just three weeks, the IBM Cognos
software today enables users across the enterprise - from executives to
front-line sales center support staff - to monitor all of their critical
applications in real-time. At-a-glance dashboards provide up-to-the-minute key
performance indicators (KPIs) for Web traffic throughput, business throughput
and general traffic data with stop-lighting capabilities, allowing management to
quickly identify performance issues and bottlenecks before they escalate to
customer service problems. For instance, when an insurance rate request goes
without response from an insurance carrier, the problem can be quickly
pinpointed, and Insurance.com staff can alert the insurance carrier to the issue
before the carrier is even aware of it. 

Beyond service level agreement monitoring, Insurance.com also capitalizes on
greater visibility and clarity into operational performance. Dashboards, for
instance, provide detailed views by agent, by states licensed, and by skill-set,
as well as individual call statistics. Through this unified view of agent
productivity, the company has eliminated multiple steps previously required for
adjusting staffing levels to call volumes. 

Building off this initial success, Insurance.com is now exploring more strategic
use of their continuous monitoring solution, including better balancing the
workflow of activities across the sales center, and more closely aligning online
sales &amp; marketing efforts, such as alerting the sales team every time there is
an increase in activity. 

"What began as a search for a bread-and-butter IT monitoring solution has opened
our eyes to the possibilities that a continuous monitoring solution can offer to
advancing our day-to-day performance and optimizing every facet of our
business," said Scott Noerr, director of IT services at Insurance.com. "IBM has
helped us set the stage for a more collaborative and responsive sales center
environment that matches our corporate culture and our commitment to delivering
the highest levels of customer satisfaction." 

"Customer service is the yardstick by which all sales centers are measured. What
distinguishes one center from the rest is not just the ability to meet standard
levels of service, but exceed," said Leah MacMillan, vice-president of IBM
Cognos product marketing. "IBM provided Insurance.com with the low-latency,
continuous monitoring capabilities they needed to be able to respond quickly to
changing metrics, gain a holistic view of performance, and drive better decision
making." 

IBM is a recognized leader in delivering performance management solutions for
the insurance industry. Specifically, over 1,000 financial services institutions
worldwide use IBM Cognos solutions, including 9 of the top 10 insurance
companies and 9 of the top 10 property and casualty companies. For more

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI Feb 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has
deferred plans to start mutual fund operations in India as a
sharp drop in the share market and a slowing economy have hit
investment flows into domestic funds, two sources told Reuters
on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We are, due to market conditions, going to delay the
actual launch of a series of mutual funds to the domestic
market," a source in Goldman Sachs said, confirming a report in
the Economic Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not
give a timeframe for the launch but said it would not be until
market conditions improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs received regulatory approval to join India's
35-member mutual funds industry in September last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, India's benchmark index has dropped almost 40
percent and investors have stayed away from equity funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stock funds have seen net outflows of 1.99 billion rupees
($410 million) in the five months ended January, compared to
inflows of 218 billion rupees  in the same period a year
earlier, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India
showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total assets under management of the industry have dropped
12 percent to 4.8 trillion rupees since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs India fund unit chief executive Adam Broder
would move out of India, the sources said, adding chief
investment officer Prashant Khemka would continue to work out
of Mumbai.

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan Asian fund arm sees 25 pct upside for H-shares&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sees China's economic growth at 5-6 percent in 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Likes property, banks, domestic consumption plays
(Rewrites throughout)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Faith Hung&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TAIPEI, Feb 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan's (JPM.N) Asian fund arm
expects Hong Kong's H-shares to rise as much as 25 percent this
year on possibly more stimulus steps from China's government to
bolster slowing economic growth, an executive said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; H-shares .HSCE, or shares of mainland firms listed in Hong
Kong, will get a lift if the authorities unveil more measures on
top of its $4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) package last year,
said Howard Wang, managing director of JF Asset Management's
Pacific regional group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be definitely more coming out (than the package).
The Chinese government is extremely concerned about the
unemployment level and the growth level of the economy," Wang
told Reuters on the sidelines of a business event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Growth in China's economy could slow to 5-6 percent in 2009,
prompting the government to take more measures to boost domestic
consumption amid declining exports, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said his firm has about US$5 billion in funds dedicated to
Greated China stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wang's view was mostly echoed by its peers, with Asian fund
managers seeing Hong Kong and China stocks appealing at current
valuations, though they remain cautious on Asian equities, a
Reuters poll published this week showed. [ID:nHKG46458]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; H-shares could catch up with the 25 percent rally that
China's A shares and B shares have staged, respectively, so far
this year, Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JF Asset Management favours shares of property, banks and
domestic consumption plays such as department stores, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Right now, it's probably not the best time to be very
aggressive on stocks," Wang said. "However, maybe six or nine
months from now, we are going to see a sharp rebound in Chinese
economic activity that stocks are going to be a lot higher than
where they are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, H-shares ended 3.05 percent lower, down 6.6
percent since the start of the year. China's benchmark index
.SSEC shed 0.56 percent, up 23.5 percent since the start of
this year. The Hang Seng Index .HSI dropped 2.3 percent,
extending its slide to 8 percent during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=T$34.0)

and sell coca-cola, energy drinks and (Russian beverage) kvas to
a network comprising small kiosks and hypermarkets," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russian vodka producers have said they believe they are
poised for the biggest gains from the crisis as many Russians
will switch back to cheap vodka after a few years of relative
prosperity when they showed taste for wine and beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola has bigger international exposure than its rival
PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N). Both have a large presence in Russia
although PepsiCo has a stronger position in the juice segment
through the country's biggest juice producer Lebedyansky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Juice is more expensive than carbonated drinks, and any
advance on carbonated beverages could weaken the position of
PepsiCo, which owns Russia's biggest juice producer, in the soft
drinks market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global demand for beverages and bottled water has suffered
in the past months as consumers cut back in a contracting
economy and retailers close shops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many global retailers are now seeking ways to cope with
problems in mature markets and are expanding to Eastern European
countries [ID:nLA156494].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some cheap restaurant chains have shown strong resilience
during the crisis, such as McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) which posted
better-than-expected results as diners sought out lower-priced
fare. [ID:nN09508063].

filed notices with local pollution regulators of planned
flaring, signaling West Coast refined products markets an end
of the cat cracker overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wholesale gasoline in the Los Angeles market finished down
13 cents on Friday and sold down by as much as 19.5 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokesman Rod Spackman said Friday evening the
refinery had completed the overhaul and would "be done with the
start-up very shortly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked if the restart would finish over the weekend,
Spackman said, "I expect it will be sooner than that."

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Feb 13 (Reuters) - A group of farmers and
ranchers are urging close scrutiny of Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) plan
to buy rival Wyeth WYE.N, worried the $63 billion merger
would mean higher prices for animal vaccines, pharmaceuticals
and medicines to control parasites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Increasingly, farmers and ranchers are paying more for the
products they need to produce the food American consumers
need," said Randy Stevenson, president of the Organization for
Competitive Markets (OCM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer and Wyeth compete head to head in several animal
health markets, along with a few smaller companies, said the
the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The giants have buying programs that utilize bundling to
force group purchasing of their products. Better competition
would result in greater innovation and lower prices for both
farmers and consumers," said Dr. Cap Dierks, who is on OCM's
board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Animal health has become an increasingly important source
of revenue for drugmakers. Pfizer reported revenue of $2.83
billion from its animal health business in 2008, while Wyeth
posted $1.08 billion in animal health sales last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, analysts have said there are few overlaps in what
Pfizer and Wyeth produce, which could result in U.S. regulators
requiring very few divestments of products to allow the deal to
proceed.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Feb 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
A new IBM (NYSE: IBM) consulting offering can help clients analyze their
carbon dioxide emissions and energy usage at any level -- from a single
department to a worldwide operation.

    IBM's Strategic Carbon Management offering is designed to assist clients
in developing strategies to better manage and reduce energy use and CO2
emissions while improving efficiency and lowering costs throughout their
operations. By implementing the strategic recommendations, clients could
reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 50 percent -- ranging from 15-20
percent for travel to up to 90 percent for datacenters -- with
corresponding reductions in cost.

    The analysis is designed to cover any part of a client's business or an
entire operation -- business travel, transportation systems, datacenters
and IT systems, manufacturing and distribution centers, office facilities,
retail space, research and development sites, etc. -- anywhere energy is
consumed and CO2 is produced.

    Top UK construction and regeneration group Morgan Sindall has engaged IBM
for this offering to help better address rising energy costs, growing
expectations of clients and other stakeholders about "green" performance,
and new UK CO2 reduction legislation. The engagement will help Morgan
Sindall manage the challenges of collecting and reporting environmental
performance information and ensure environmental standards are applied and
measured consistently across its various groups and activities to improve
its overall sustainability performance.

    Using IBM's Component Business Model approach, the offering can assess a
client's current CO2 emissions performance, identify gaps and set
objectives for improvement, balance drivers such as cost, risk and
regulation, shareholder needs and customer demand, and prioritize areas to
address. Clients can then employ other IBM consulting offerings using
"smart" approaches, technologies and processes that allow them to meter,
monitor and regulate their energy use and CO2 emissions on an ongoing
basis.

    "Companies are being driven to reduce their environmental impact and
improve their energy efficiency -- their customers and partners demand it,
their financial performance depends on it, and governments increasingly
require it," said Eric Riddleberger, IBM's business strategy consulting
global leader, who heads up the company's corporate social responsibility
consulting efforts. "Piecemeal approaches yield piecemeal results, but
setting a comprehensive strategy for emissions and energy management can
provide real improvements and business value."

    The Strategic Carbon Management offering specifically helps clients:

     Determine what they want to achieve through their energy efficiency and
environmental efforts; Integrate these energy and environmental
strategies into their overall business strategies; Analyze financial
costs and benefits for these initiatives.

    The Strategic Carbon Management offering uses a number of IBM consulting
processes to help companies perform this analysis, including a carbon
management diagnostic, carbon footprinting, "green" action planning and
business case modeling. It uses measuring and monitoring tools and
dashboards to help clients analyze a wide range of issues and
opportunities, including carbon trading, regulations and incentives. The
Component Business Model approach breaks the company down into logical
segments -- finance, operations, purchasing, etc. -- and then provides an
analysis as to which ones are the most energy and CO2 emissions intensive.

    An IBM global corporate social responsibility survey of more than 250
c-suite executives shows that 68 percent of them already are focusing on
CSR activities to create new revenue streams and 54% believe it's giving
them a competitive advantage. In addition, 85 percent said they were using
CSR initiatives to reduce costs, and a third report that their business
partners are requiring them to lower their CO2 emissions.

    Strategic Carbon Management joins a growing list of consulting offerings
from IBM designed to help clients address CSR issues throughout their
operations, including: the Supply Chain Network Optimization Workbench (or
SNOW), the Carbon Tradeoff Modeler, the CSR Assessment and Benchmarking
Utility, Green Sigma(TM), and Environmental Product Lifecycle Management.

    It is designed to complement IBM's CSR Assessment and Benchmarking Utility
and Green Sigma(TM) consulting offerings. The CSR Assessment and
Benchmarking Utility offering helps clients do a comprehensive assessment
of all parameters of CSR -- ranging from environmental policies to labor
practices. Strategic Carbon Management is designed to provide a
comprehensive analysis and set strategic priorities for CO2 emissions and
energy use. Green SigmaTM uses Lean Six Sigma principles to establish key
measurements and provide ongoing monitoring, analysis and reporting of
performance.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 13 (Reuters) - Cowen  Co upgraded Visa Inc (V.N) and

"underperform" citing stronger and sustainable pricing trends,

rates coupled with continued fall in discretionary advertising
would help both companies expand margins and generate earnings
per share growth rates in excess of 20 percent, Katri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Visa were up 88 cents at $57.28 and those of
MasterCard's were up $6.20 at $168.00 in morning trade on the

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS), and Best Buy Co
Inc (NYSE: BBY) were among the companies seeing put buying on Thursday. 

The action in Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs is intriguing for two reasons.
First we have seemingly upbeat news that Elizabeth Harrow discussed on
Wednesday. Second we have the strong 3-month return data shown in the table.
While both companies still certainly face challenges ahead, and both stocks
remain well below their all-time highs, there has at least been some signs of
life. That is in stark contrast to what was noted earlier on Bank of America and
Citigroup.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
General Electric Co (NYSE: GE), Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), Citigroup Inc
(NYSE: C), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) were among the companies
seeing heavy call yesterday. That is curious when you consider environment. 

These are of course some of the most well-known, big-cap names in the market.
With chatter of bank rescues and stimulus abounding it is understandable that
some may look to these stocks as leaders. After all, it wasn't that long ago
that these were generally accepted as the cream of the crop. However, times have
changed.

&lt;p&gt; "Works started on Feb. 11 on some units for planned

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Hot Topic (NASDAQ: HOTT), Cree Inc. (NASDAQ: CREE), General Electric (NYSE: GE),
American Tower Corp. (NYSE: AMT) and Web.com (NASDAQ: WWWW). 

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from
the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Hot Topic with a Hot Brand

We are initiating coverage of Hot Topic (NASDAQ: HOTT) with a Buy rating. Hot
Topic is one of the few specialty retailers with positive comp-store sales and
the ability to expand its profit margins. 

The popularity of the movie Twilight, which is about a teenage girl falling in
love with a vampire, has been driving Hot Topic's recent results. Going forward,
we think the retailer's strategy to increase its in-store music events, where
bands have autograph sessions or play their music for Hot Topic shoppers, will
pick up the slack when Twilight sales begin to taper off. 

CREE: The Lights Are On

Cree Inc. (NASDAQ: CREE) is one of the leading producers of SiC and GaN-based
light emitting diode (LED) chips. Only a handful of companies use Silicon
Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN) materials. 

December quarter results exceeded the consensus on both the top and bottom
lines. Forward guidance is for an 8-13% decline in the March quarter. The global
movement to energy efficient lighting is prompting lighting companies and
consumers to look at other options. Therefore, lighting will be the strongest
end market for Cree, likely followed by video displays and notebooks. 

With the signing of the energy bill in December last year, the U.S. government
has decided to ban inefficient light bulbs by 2012. The energy efficiency
standards set by the government effectively do away with incandescent light
bulbs as we know them today. Although General Electric (NYSE: GE) has stated
that it is developing a more efficient bulb that will meet the efficiency
standards, a delay in development may actually put it out of the running. 

American Tower's Good Visibility

We maintain our Buy recommendation and the same valuation target for American
Tower Corp. (NYSE: AMT), a leading operator of wireless communications towers in
the US and other emerging markets, ahead of its fourth quarter 2008 financial
results. 

Overall performance has been driven by substantial demand for additional tower
space to facilitate high-speed wireless data services and mobile video, along
with emerging 3G technologies. Rental &amp; management revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and
free cash flow financial metrics remain favorable. 

Web.com with Big Upside

Web.com (NASDAQ: WWWW) is a leading provider of Web services for small and
medium businesses (SMBs). The company uses a factory approach that it can
leverage over thousands of customers. Web.com currently has minimal competition,
as most competitors are much smaller and focus on customized solutions at higher
price points. 

We have reduced our estimates for fiscal 2009 and 2010. Although the company is
currently feeling pressure from a slowing consumer market, which many of its
customers cater to, the long-term outlook still looks bright.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Lone Star LS.UL, the Development Bank of Japan DBKJP.UL and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) are among the final bidders for failed Japanese real estate investment trust New City Residence Investment Corp, two people familiar with the transaction said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state-owned Development Bank of Japan is teaming up with Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) and Genkai Capital Management Co to bid in the sale worth about 100 billion yen ($1.1 billion), they said, asking not to be identified as the information is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oaktree Capital Management and Daiwa Securities SMBC Principal Investments, an investment arm of Daiwa Securities Group (8601.T), are also in the final round, which took place about two weeks ago, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New City Residence filed for court protection from creditors in October with 112 billion yen in debt, becoming Japan's first real estate investment trust to fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikko Citigroup Ltd, Citigroup Inc's (C.N) Japanese investment banking unit, is arranging the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New City Residence owns apartment buildings in Ginza, Harajuku and other up-market areas of Tokyo. The trust was unable to raise funds to repay its debts and finance the purchase of new assets to sustain growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=91.12 Yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Michael Watson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp announced plans Thursday to open its own chain of branded stores as it looks to catch up with rival Apple Inc's successful move into retailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which also makes the Xbox video game console and the Zune digital music player, did not say how many stores it was looking to open, or when, or which of its products would be on sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is to be decided by David Porter, a former DreamWorks Animation executive, which Microsoft named as its new vice president of retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turner, a former Wal-Mart Stores Inc manager, will report to Microsoft chief operating officer Kevin Turner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-rumored move to open stores comes as consumer spending is under severe pressure due to the recession, which has already pushed electronics chain Circuit City into bankruptcy. A similar attempt by computer maker Gateway to open its own stores some years ago was not successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, bruised by the poor reception of its latest Vista operating system, is facing increased competition from Apple, which is eating into the personal computer market and dominates the personal digital music player market with its iPod line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's stylish stores, now numbering more than 200 worldwide, have been crucial in attracting customers in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; editing by Carol Bishopric, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Rival drugmakers are looking to pick up some promising assets left behind when Pfizer ties the knot with Wyeth WYE.N, although that may turn out to be slim pickings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) $68 billion acquisition of its smaller rival is not expected to hit serious antitrust snags, but there will almost surely be some forced divestments, particularly in animal health and possibly cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N said it would likely evaluate any products that become available as a result of the merger as it looks to expand its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly  Co (LLY.N) CEO John Lechleiter has made clear he will be looking closely at products sold off by Pfizer to build up Lilly's Elanco animal health unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any time there is any large combination like this we are looking at opportunities there might be in divested assets," Lechleiter told analysts in a conference call last month. "So you can bet with our interest in growing our animal health business we have our eye on that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal health has become an increasingly important source of revenue for drugmakers. Pfizer reported revenue of $2.83 billion from its animal health business in 2008, while Wyeth posted $1.08 billion in animal health sales last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analysts believe Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) will have strong interest in the business to supplement the Merial operation it jointly owns with Merck  Co (MRK.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayer AG BAYG.DE and Novartis (NOVN.VX) also have been mentioned as possible buyers of animal health assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be plenty of people looking at any assets that would undergo FTC (Federal Trade Commission) scrutiny," Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts said the overlaps between Pfizer and Wyeth are few, which could result in very little that the world's largest drugmaker will be forced to sell by U.S. trade regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would be hard pressed to think of much of anything. I don't see any real overlap from an antitrust perspective," said Barbara Ryan, an analyst for Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe some obscure products or something in the pipeline, but I don't think there's going to be anything meaningful," Ryan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez also saw little need for significant divestitures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only thing that has any material overlap with Wyeth is animal health and we already assume that maybe 5 percent of that overall business might have to go," Fernandez said. "But the synergies across these companies are pretty positive, you (Pfizer) get to keep most of the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another asset that could be on the block is Wyeth's kidney cancer drug Torisel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe Pfizer will be forced to divest Torisel given its ownership of the gold standard first-line agent in renal cell carcinoma, Sutent," the Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other industry watchers disagree on Torisel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank's Ryan called it "highly unlikely" that Pfizer would be forced to unload Torisel, saying it and Sutent worth through different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leerink's Fernandez was even stronger in his belief that Pfizer will be able to add Torisel to its oncology portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Wyeth kidney cancer drug definitely will not have to be sold off," Fernandez said in no uncertain terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted competition in the kidney cancer space from Nexavar, sold by Bayer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc ONXX.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see Torisel definitely staying in the mix," Fernandez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although currently only approved for kidney cancer, Torisel has potential in other indications, including gynecological, melanoma and brain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez said there is something of an overlap in osteoporosis that could lead Pfizer to sell lasofoxifene, an experimental drug that has seen several regulatory setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That probably is not going to fetch a particularly good price because the product isn't going to be that big," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Ben Hirschler; editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - As cash-strapped U.S. consumers think twice before buying a coffee or a newspaper, and banks fight for survival, Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) are cutting costs to sustain earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their latest quarterly results, the world's largest payment networks beat expectations by slashing expenses and increasing prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That contrasts with previous periods when the companies could rely more for growth on people switching to electronic payments from cash for an increasing number of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That trend had Mastercard and Visa in the sweet spot of the credit and debt card industry -- getting paid each time a transaction took place on their branded cards while not having to deal with the risks of consumers defaulting that are faced by the credit card issuers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising defaults have led to mounting charges for the issuers, such as Citigroup Inc (C.N) or Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), which are major clients of Visa and Mastercard. American Express is both an issuer and a payments company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world have bailed out many of the battered banks, making it more difficult for the credit card-payment networks to raise the prices they charge them for transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most likely, the bottom line will benefit from cost cuts (rather) than growth in volumes," said Michael Kon, an analyst at Morningstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's payment volume growth slowed to 12 percent in the latest quarterly report from 15 percent in the quarter before, while MasterCard's volume increased at only a 3 percent rate from 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global deterioration of the economy and the strengthening of the dollar, which hits dollar revenues from overseas, forced Visa and MasterCard to cut their revenue growth outlook for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard's Chief Executive Robert Selander said in a February conference call with analysts that worldwide process revenue was flat in January, and if that trend continued it would be a challenge to get high-single digit revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the company forecast an average annual net income growth of 20 percent to 30 percent, while Visa estimated annual adjusted diluted Class A common earnings per share growth of 20 percent or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They plan to get those returns through cost cutting. MasterCard slashed expenses 16 percent in the fourth-quarter; Visa trimmed costs 4 percent in its fiscal first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The companies have not been run very tightly and there is room to cut," said Standard  Poor's analyst Stuart Plesser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa, which slashed expenses as part of a restructuring plan to integrate the former U.S., Canada and international operations into one company, has accelerated the pace and expects to finish that plan -- which will save $300 million in 2009 -- a year earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the economy moved into negative territory we, as a management team, began to accelerate our efforts to globally integrate these businesses," said Visa's CFO Byron Pollitt in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, which increased expenses by 3 percent last year as it hired employees and contractors, was now cutting travel expenses, capping hiring, and cutting advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have the need to cut costs," Mastercard's Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and analysts said both companies have room to cut marketing and advertising, which account for around one-third of their expenses, by 20 percent without suffering any impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If consumers are not spending, and banks are not lending, there is no reason to invest in marketing," said Morningstar's Kon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sponsorships are on the chopping block. Pollitt said Visa was committed to support the FIFA World Cup, and the Olympic Games, but withdrew its support from the Rugby World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard is reviewing its support to other events in the United States and the United Kingdom, said Hund-Mejean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both credit card executives, who believe that cash is their main competition, were confident that the expansion of electronic payments in emerging markets would drive growth, despite the global economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts are more skeptical and said further cost cut might be needed if the recession continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio, editing by Leslie Gevirtz and Martin Golan)&lt;/p&gt;

The project will cost a minimum $500 million, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, TPAO is in talks on exploring for Iraqi natural gas with companies from Japan, India, Russia and Italy on setting up a consortium, Oztas said, without naming them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TPAO needs foreign oil partners to explore and drill to share the risk and high costs, as well as secure Turkey technology transfers, he also said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides exploration in the Black Sea, TPAO is carrying out early seismic tests in the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jason Neely)&lt;/p&gt;

d`actifs, les additions aux r&#233;serves ont remplac&#233; 110 % de la production. Ces
additions adoptent la base de prix &#224; long terme que la soci&#233;t&#233; utilise dans la
prise de d&#233;cisions en mati&#232;re d`investissements, plut&#244;t que le prix sur un seul
jour en fin d`exercice. 

&#171; ExxonMobil continue &#224; r&#233;aliser des additions significatives de r&#233;serves et a
remplac&#233; en moyenne 110 % de la production sur les dix derni&#232;res ann&#233;es &#187;, a
d&#233;clar&#233; le pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral Rex W. Tillerson. &#171; Cette solide
performance refl&#232;te notre focalisation strat&#233;gique sur la capture de ressources,
une d&#233;marche disciplin&#233;e en mati&#232;re d`investissements et l`excellence en mati&#232;re
d`ex&#233;cution de projets. &#187; 

&#171; Nous avons une vision sur le long terme du d&#233;veloppement des ressources et
investissons dans l`ensemble du cycle de prix des mati&#232;res premi&#232;res. Ajouter de
nouvelles r&#233;serves garantit qu`ExxonMobil va continuer &#224; d&#233;velopper de nouvelles
ressources &#233;nerg&#233;tiques cruciales pour aider &#224; r&#233;pondre aux besoins croissants
de la plan&#232;te dans l`avenir. &#187; 

Le rapport annuel relatif aux r&#233;serves prouv&#233;es est le fruit du processus
rigoureux de longue date de la soci&#233;t&#233;, gr&#226;ce auquel la continuit&#233; et
l`obligation de rendre compte de la direction quant &#224; toutes les
comptabilisations des r&#233;serves sont assur&#233;es. 

Les additions de r&#233;serves en 2008 de la soci&#233;t&#233; refl&#232;tent de nouveaux
d&#233;veloppements avec des engagements financiers non n&#233;gligeables tout comme des
r&#233;visions et extensions de champs existants r&#233;sultant de forages, &#233;tudes et de
l`analyse de la performance des r&#233;servoirs. Les additions de r&#233;serves provenant
du projet de sables bitumeux Kearl Phase 1 au Canada ont totalis&#233; 1,1 milliard
de barils &#233;quivalent p&#233;trole. Des additions prouv&#233;es ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; r&#233;alis&#233;es
dans divers pays, dont les &#201;tats-Unis, la Norv&#232;ge, le Nigeria, l`Angola et
l`Australie. Les cessions d`actifs en 2008 ont r&#233;duit les r&#233;serves prouv&#233;es de
0,1 milliard de barils &#233;quivalent p&#233;trole. 

Sur la base des prix des liquides et du gaz naturel au 31 d&#233;cembre, le
remplacement des r&#233;serves prouv&#233;es s`est &#233;lev&#233; &#224; 2 milliards de barils
&#233;quivalent p&#233;trole en 2008, rempla&#231;ant ainsi 136 % de la production, effet des
cessions d`actifs compris. Toutefois, les prix sur un seul jour ne sont pas pris
en consid&#233;ration lorsque les d&#233;cisions en mati&#232;re d`investissements &#224; long terme
sont prises par la soci&#233;t&#233;, et les variations annuelles des r&#233;serves bas&#233;es sur
ces prix en fin d`exercice ne sont pas en phase avec la gestion effective des
activit&#233;s. 

Vision &#224; long terme

La nature &#224; long terme du secteur et la taille importante des projets discrets
qui contribuent &#224; une part significative des additions de r&#233;serves de la
soci&#233;t&#233;, font qu`il convient de tenir compte d`un horizon d&#233;passant une seule
ann&#233;e. Hors l`effet des prix sur un seul jour en fin d`exercice, le taux de
remplacement moyen des r&#233;serves de la soci&#233;t&#233; sur dix ans est de 110 % percent,
le taux de remplacement des liquides se situant &#224; 103 % et celui du gaz &#224; 119 %.
Pour les quinze derni&#232;res ann&#233;es cons&#233;cutives nos additions de r&#233;serves ont
exc&#233;d&#233; le remplacement de production. 

Les additions de r&#233;serves faites au cours de cette p&#233;riode comprennent un
&#233;ventail vari&#233; de types de ressources et repr&#233;sentent de nombreuses zones
g&#233;ographiques. &#192; la fin de 2008, la base de r&#233;serves prouv&#233;es d`ExxonMobil a
augment&#233; &#224; 22,8 milliards de barils &#233;quivalent p&#233;trole, r&#233;partie &#224; peu pr&#232;s de
fa&#231;on &#233;gale entre les liquides et le gaz. La vie des r&#233;serves d`ExxonMobil au
taux actuel de production est de 15,3 ans et la part des r&#233;serves prouv&#233;es d&#233;j&#224;
d&#233;velopp&#233;e est de 62 %. 

Une base de ressources en t&#234;te du secteur

ExxonMobil a ajout&#233; 2,2 milliards de barils &#233;quivalent p&#233;trole &#224; sa base de
ressources en 2008, avec des additions cl&#233;s provenant du Canada, de
l`exploitation sur terre aux &#201;tats-Unis, de l`exploitation en eaux profondes
dans le Golfe du Mexique et de l`Afrique occidentale. Globalement, la base de
ressources de la soci&#233;t&#233; a augment&#233; de 0,3 milliard de barils &#233;quivalent p&#233;trole
passant &#224; 72,4 milliards de barils &#233;quivalent p&#233;trole, la production, les
r&#233;visions aux d&#233;couvertes existantes et les cessions d`actifs &#233;tant prises en
compte. Ce chiffre inclut &#233;galement l`impact de droits gouvernementaux plus
&#233;lev&#233;s, qui ont r&#233;duit la base de ressources de 0,5 milliard de barils
&#233;quivalent p&#233;trole en 2008. La base de ressources inclut des r&#233;serves prouv&#233;es
et probables, plus d`autres ressources d&#233;couvertes qui, &#224; terme, devraient &#234;tre

com compromissos de financiamento significativos e revis&#245;es e amplia&#231;&#245;es dos
campos j&#225; existentes, em consequ&#234;ncia de perfura&#231;&#227;o, estudos e an&#225;lises de
desempenho dos reservat&#243;rios. Os acr&#233;scimos da Fase 1 do projeto das areias de
Kearl, no Canad&#225;, totalizaram o equivalente a 1,1 bilh&#227;o de barris de petr&#243;leo.
Tamb&#233;m houve acr&#233;scimos comprovados em uma s&#233;rie de pa&#237;ses, como Estados Unidos,
Noruega, Nig&#233;ria, Angola e Austr&#225;lia. As vendas de ativos em 2008 reduziram as
reservas comprovadas ao equivalente a 0,1 bilh&#227;o de barris de petr&#243;leo. 

Utilizando os pre&#231;os do g&#225;s natural e liquefeito em 31 de dezembro, as reservas
comprovadas substitu&#237;ram 136% da produ&#231;&#227;o, incluindo o efeito das vendas de
ativos. No entanto, os pre&#231;os de uma &#250;nica data n&#227;o s&#227;o levados em conta quando
a empresa toma decis&#245;es de investimento a longo prazo, e as varia&#231;&#245;es das
reservas anuais baseadas nesses pre&#231;os de final de ano n&#227;o est&#227;o alinhadas &#224;
maneira como a empresa &#233; administrada de fato. 

Vis&#227;o de longo prazo

A natureza de longo prazo do setor e a amplitude de projetos distintos que
oferecem um por&#231;&#227;o significativa dos acr&#233;scimos de reservas da empresa
aconselham a levar em conta um horizonte maior do que um s&#243; ano. Excluindo os
efeitos de um &#250;nico dia no encerramento de exerc&#237;cio, a taxa m&#233;dia de
substitui&#231;&#227;o de reservas em dez anos &#233; de 110%, com a substitui&#231;&#227;o de l&#237;quidos
situando-se em 103% e de g&#225;s, em 119%. Durante os &#250;ltimos quinze anos,
consecutivamente, nossos acr&#233;scimos mais do que substitu&#237;ram a produ&#231;&#227;o. 

Os acr&#233;scimos de reservas feitos durante esse per&#237;odo incluem um conjunto
diversificado de tipos de recursos, com ampla representa&#231;&#227;o geogr&#225;fica. No final
de 2008, as reservas comprovadas da ExxonMobil incrementaram-se no equivalente a
22,8 bilh&#245;es barris de petr&#243;leo, divididos quase igualmente entre l&#237;quido e g&#225;s.
A vida das reservas da ExxonMobil &#224;s taxas de produ&#231;&#227;o atuais &#233; de 15,3 anos, e
a por&#231;&#227;o de reservas comprovadas j&#225; desenvolvidas &#233; de 62%. 

Base de recursos l&#237;der da ind&#250;stria

A ExxonMobil acrescentou o equivalente a 2,2 bilh&#245;es de barris &#224; sua base de
recursos em 2008, com acr&#233;scimos fundamentais no Canad&#225;, em terra nos Estados
Unidos, em &#225;guas profundas do Golfo do M&#233;xico e na &#193;frica Ocidental. No todo, a
base de recursos da empresa cresceu do equivalente de 0,3 bilh&#227;o de barris de
petr&#243;leo para 72,4 bilh&#245;es, considerando-se produ&#231;&#227;o, revis&#245;es das descobertas
existentes e vendas de ativos. Esses n&#250;meros incluem ainda o impacto do aumento
da parte governamental, que reduziu a base de recursos no equivalente a 0,5
bilh&#227;o de barris de petr&#243;leo em 2008. A base de recursos inclui reservas
comprovadas e prov&#225;veis, al&#233;m de outros recursos descobertos que se espera
sejam, em &#250;ltima inst&#226;ncia, recuperados. 

NOTA DE ADVERT&#202;NCIA: Os termos "recursos" e "base de recursos" incluem
quantidades descobertas de g&#225;s e petr&#243;leo que ainda n&#227;o foram classificadas como

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to "worldwide process volume" from "worldwide process revenue" in 10th paragraph. No other changes to text)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Juan Lagorio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - As cash-strapped U.S. consumers think twice before buying a coffee or a newspaper, and banks fight for survival, Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) are cutting costs to sustain earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their latest quarterly results, the world's largest payment networks beat expectations by slashing expenses and increasing prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That contrasts with previous periods when the companies could rely more for growth on people switching to electronic payments from cash for an increasing number of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That trend had Mastercard and Visa in the sweet spot of the credit and debt card industry -- getting paid each time a transaction took place on their branded cards while not having to deal with the risks of consumers defaulting that are faced by the credit card issuers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising defaults have led to mounting charges for the issuers, such as Citigroup Inc (C.N) or Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), which are major clients of Visa and Mastercard. American Express is both an issuer and a payments company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world have bailed out many of the battered banks, making it more difficult for the credit card-payment networks to raise the prices they charge them for transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most likely, the bottom line will benefit from cost cuts (rather) than growth in volumes," said Michael Kon, an analyst at Morningstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's payment volume growth slowed to 12 percent in the latest quarterly report from 15 percent in the quarter before, while MasterCard's volume increased at only a 3 percent rate from 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global deterioration of the economy and the strengthening of the dollar, which hits dollar revenues from overseas, forced Visa and MasterCard to cut their revenue growth outlook for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard's Chief Executive Robert Selander said in a February conference call with analysts that worldwide process volume was flat in January, and if that trend continued it would be a challenge to get high-single digit revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the company forecast an average annual net income growth of 20 percent to 30 percent, while Visa estimated annual adjusted diluted Class A common earnings per share growth of 20 percent or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They plan to get those returns through cost cutting. MasterCard slashed expenses 16 percent in the fourth-quarter;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa trimmed costs 4 percent in its fiscal first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The companies have not been run very tightly and there is room to cut," said Standard  Poor's analyst Stuart Plesser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa, which slashed expenses as part of a restructuring plan to integrate the former U.S., Canada and international operations into one company, has accelerated the pace and expects to finish that plan -- which will save $300 million in 2009 -- a year earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the economy moved into negative territory we, as a management team, began to accelerate our efforts to globally integrate these businesses," said Visa's CFO Byron Pollitt in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, which increased expenses by 3 percent last year as it hired employees and contractors, was now cutting travel expenses, capping hiring, and cutting advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have the need to cut costs," Mastercard's Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and analysts said both companies have room to cut marketing and advertising, which account for around one-third of their expenses, by 20 percent without suffering any impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If consumers are not spending, and banks are not lending, there is no reason to invest in marketing," said Morningstar's Kon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sponsorships are on the chopping block. Pollitt said Visa was committed to support the FIFA World Cup, and the Olympic Games, but withdrew its support from the Rugby World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard is reviewing its support to other events in the United States and the United Kingdom, said Hund-Mejean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both credit card executives, who believe that cash is their main competition, were confident that the expansion of electronic payments in emerging markets would drive growth, despite the global economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts are more skeptical and said further cost cut might be needed if the recession continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio, editing by Leslie Gevirtz and Martin Golan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney Marks Newest Princess In 10 Years With Princess Tiana Debut And Honors
First Disney Princess, Snow White


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
As the Disney Princess royal court prepares to welcome its newest member,
Princess Tiana, star of the upcoming Walt Disney Pictures animated theatrical
release, The Princess And The Frog, Disney Consumer Products (DCP) in
collaboration with Mattel (NYSE: MAT) and CDI, a division of JAKKS Pacific
(NASDAQ: JAKK), today unveiled a dazzling and magical toy line inspired by the
film and its colorful characters. Tony Award-winning actress/singer Anika Noni
Rose, the voice of Princess Tiana, unveiled the line which includes dolls, play
sets and role-play dresses at a sneak preview event at the American
International Toy Fair in New York City. DCP also unveiled a new collection of
Snow White toys in celebration of its first Disney Princess fairytale, Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs, which releases from the Disney Vault on Blu-ray
hi-def and DVD this fall. 

Opening Holiday 2009, The Princess And The Frog is a magical fairytale set in
New Orleans that marks Disney`s return to musicals and the warmth and grandeur
of 2D hand drawn animation. Embodying the timelessness of Disney`s storytelling
heritage, the film also introduces Disney`s newest princess in more than 10
years, Princess Tiana. The event marked the first time that Ms. Rose and Toy
Fair attendees were able to see the toy line. Mattel presented a one-of-a-kind
Princess Tiana doll created specifically for Ms. Rose in celebration of her
role. 

"I have loved Disney movies since seeing Fantasia, Bambi, and Mary Poppins when
I was little," said Ms. Rose. "I have always wanted to do a Disney voice, since
before I even thought of being an actor, so for me, this is a dream come true.
It didn't even need to be a princess, so this is just the cherry on top. Tiana
is a different sort of princess in that she has had a very loving childhood and
is not waiting for someone to change her life for her - she has a vision and a
plan. I saw early models of the toy line, but seeing them today in final form,
they are just beautiful. What an absolute thrill to be a part of something so
timeless!" 

In addition to toys, DCP will also introduce an extensive line of The Princess
and The Frog-inspired apparel, accessories, home d&#233;cor, consumer electronics,
school supplies and personal care products arriving to retailers nationwide this
fall. Disney Publishing Worldwide will launch an assortment of titles including
story and activity books. In malls across North America and Canada, over 220
Disney Stores will also celebrate the debut of Princess Tiana and The Princess
And The Frog with gorgeous window displays and merchandising. The one-of-a-kind
product assortment designed by Disney Store will offer something for everyone
including Halloween costumes and role play dresses. 

As Disney celebrates its newest princess, Disney will also honor its first
princess, the one that started it all, Snow White, with the introduction of a
new toy line set to release this October in tandem with the highly-anticipated
Blu-ray debut of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - one of the most requested
Disney home entertainment releases of all time. 

Disney Princess fairytales have been enchanting girls since Snow White first
graced the screen in 1937. However, only recently has Disney brought these
beloved characters together in a collection of fantasy-based girls'
entertainment and products - the Disney Princess brand. With the introduction of
a new princess, the Disney Princess franchise continues to grow as a powerful
lifestyle brand beyond toys and into categories such as fashion and decor, which
today accounts for $4 billion in global retail sales and touches every aspect of
girls' lives around the world. Disney Princess' successes span around the globe
with merchandise, theatrical releases, home videos, books and magazines,
television, theme park attractions, a website, radio air play and live
entertainment. 

The Princess And The Frog Toy Line

The Princess And The Frog toy line is inspired by the magical elements and
characters featured in the fairytale, including the beautiful Princess Tiana,
Frog Prince Naveen, a trumpet-playing alligator and a love-sick Cajun firefly.
The toys boast vibrant colors such as purple, green, gold and blue, with
decorative elements reminiscent of New Orleans and the bayou. New playthings
include stunning dolls, imaginative playsets, fun role-play items and costumes
and colorful accessories that offer plenty of Disney magic and hours of play for
little girls everywhere. 

The Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs Toy Line

The first Disney Princess, Snow White, was introduced to the world in 1937 as
"the fairest of them all" in Walt Disney`s - and the world`s - first full-length
animated feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. After more than 70
years, Snow White continues to inspire girls of all ages with her beauty, grace,
kind nature and love for animals. Girls will be able to re-live moments from the
classic film and celebrate the debut Blu-ray with a new toy line that hearkens
back to life in the woods with her furry little friends in the cottage. 

About "The Princess And The Frog"

The Princess And The Frog marks Disney`s return to the warmth and grandeur of 2D
hand drawn animation. Set in one of the greatest musical cities of them all, New
Orleans, the film teams Ron Clements and John Musker, creators of The Little
Mermaid and Aladdin, with Oscar winning composer, Randy Newman. From the heart
of Louisiana`s mystical bayous and the banks of the mighty Mississippi comes an
unforgettable tale of love, adventure, comedy and heart. Voice talent includes
Anika Noni Rose, Keith David, Jenifer Lewis, John Goodman, Jim Cummings,
Terrence Howard and Oprah Winfrey.

princess through world-class entertainment and innovative products that let them

classics. The franchise is comprised of eight beloved princesses - Ariel (The
Little Mermaid), Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) Belle (Beauty and the Beast),
Cinderella, Jasmine (Aladdin), Mulan, Pocahontas, and Snow White. Each Disney

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 16 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
on Monday that it added 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent
in 2008, or 103 percent of its production for the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The largest U.S. oil company said that excluding the impact
of asset sales, reserves additions replaced 110 percent of
production in the year. It said these additions assume a
long-term pricing basis, rather than single-day, year-end
pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil and gas companies are generally expected to replace
more than 100 percent of their annual production as a sign of
growth, according to industry analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said the reserve additions reflected both new
developments with significant funding commitments and revisions
and extensions of existing fields from drilling, studies and
analysis of reservoir performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reserves additions from the Kearl Phase 1 oil sands project
in Canada totaled 1.1 billion oil-equivalent barrels, Exxon
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said proved additions were also made in the United
States, Norway, Nigeria, Angola and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asset sales in 2008 reduced proved reserves by 0.1 billion
oil-equivalent barrels, the Irving, Texas-based company said.

attract bright young women and men to the exciting world of engineering and the
opportunities that are opening up everyday in science and technology. 

As a participant in National Engineers Week, ExxonMobil hopes to raise greater

these in-demand fields." 

ExxonMobil engineers will visit seven local middle schools, where more than
1,700 seventh graders will hear engineers talk about their experiences and
participate in interactive demonstrations and experiments.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Feb 16 (Reuters) - U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) will not cut back on investments in new crude
production, despite the collapse in oil prices, the company's
regional head of exploration said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The lower price environment has had no impact whatsoever on

Europe, the Middle East and North Africa said during the IP week
petroleum industry meeting in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We take a long-term view, and even if prices stay at these
kind of levels for a number of years, it will make no impact on
our investment strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices have collapsed by more than $100 a barrel since a
record above $147 last July as the global economic slowdown has
cut consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, there have been project cancellations and
delays, prompting some concern there could be a supply shortage
when the world economy recovers and oil demand picks up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bell said there was a price that in theory could force the
company to cut investments, but Exxon had always taken a
long-term view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When prices fell to a low of $10 a barrel in 1998 we were
investing way more than what we were making for a number of
years -- so the strategy continues."

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today that additions to its proved
reserves in 2008 totaled 1.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels, replacing 103
percent of production. Excluding the impact of asset sales, reserves additions
replaced 110 percent of production. These additions assume the long-term pricing
basis that the corporation uses to make its investment decisions, rather than
single-day, year-end pricing. 

"ExxonMobil continues to make quality reserves additions, and has replaced an
average of 110 percent of production over the last 10 years," said Rex W.
Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer. "This strong performance
reflects our strategic focus on resource capture, a disciplined approach to
investment and excellence in project execution." 

"We take a long-term view of resource development and invest throughout the
commodity price cycle. Adding new reserves ensures that ExxonMobil will continue
to develop new supplies of energy that will be critical to help meet the world`s
growing needs into the future." 

The annual reporting of proved reserves is the product of the corporation`s
long-standing, rigorous process that ensures consistency and management
accountability in all reserve bookings. 

The corporation`s reserve additions in 2008 reflect both new developments with
significant funding commitments and revisions and extensions of existing fields
resulting from drilling, studies and analysis of reservoir performance. Reserves
additions from the Kearl Phase 1 oil sands project in Canada totaled 1.1 billion
oil-equivalent barrels. Proved additions were also made in a diverse range of
countries including the United States, Norway, Nigeria, Angola and Australia.
Asset sales in 2008 reduced proved reserves by 0.1 billion oil-equivalent
barrels. 

Utilizing December 31 liquids and natural gas prices, proved reserves
replacement was 2.0 billion oil-equivalent barrels in 2008, replacing 136
percent of production, including the effect of asset sales. However, prices from
a single date are not considered when long-term investment decisions are made by
the corporation, and annual variations in reserves based on such year-end prices
are not aligned with how the business is actually managed. 

Long-Term View

The long-term nature of the industry and the large size of the discrete projects
that provide a significant portion of the corporation`s reserves additions make
it appropriate to consider a time horizon longer than a single year. Excluding
single day, year-end pricing effects, the corporation`s 10-year average reserves
replacement ratio is 110 percent, with liquids replacement at 103 percent and
gas at 119 percent. For the last 15 consecutive years our reserves additions
have more than replaced production. 

The reserves additions made during this period comprise a diverse range of
resource types and have broad geographical representation. At the end of 2008
ExxonMobil`s proved reserves base increased to 22.8 billion oil-equivalent
barrels, split approximately evenly between liquids and gas. ExxonMobil`s
reserves life at current production rates is 15.3 years and the portion of
proved reserves already developed is 62 percent. 

Industry-Leading Resource Base

ExxonMobil added 2.2 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base in
2008, with key additions from Canada, the onshore United States, deepwater Gulf
of Mexico and West Africa. Overall, the corporation`s resource base grew by 0.3
billion oil-equivalent barrels to 72.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels, taking
into account production, revisions to existing discoveries, and asset sales.
This figure also includes the impact of increased government take, which reduced
the resource base by 0.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels in 2008. The resource
base includes proved and probable reserves, plus other discovered resources that
are expected to be ultimately recovered. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE: The terms "resources" and "resource base" include quantities of
discovered oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves but that
are expected to be ultimately recovered in the future. The term "reserves", as
used in this release, includes proven reserves from oil sands operations in
Canada which are currently reported separately as mining operations in our SEC
reports. [Under amendments to the SEC rules expected to become effective January
1, 2010, oil sands reserves will no longer be reported separately.] The reserves
in this release are the combined total from both consolidated subsidiaries and
our interest in equity companies. The Corporation operates its business with the
same views of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated
subsidiaries.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Feb 16 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil
(XOM.N) remains in talks with Russian gas export monopoly
Gazprom (GAZP.MM) about the possible export of gas from Exxon's
Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in east Russia, a senior
executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We continue to talk to them about the potential for
exports," Russell Bellis, Exploration director for Europe, the
Middle East and North Africa told reporters at the sidelines of
the International Petroleum Week conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon believes it is entitled to export gas at world rates
under its contract with the government but Gazprom wants the
project to sell its gas to Gazprom at a lower, local price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's partners in Sakhalin-1 include Russia's Rosneft
(ROSN.MM) and India's ONGC (ONGC.BO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bellis added that Exxon, which has operations in Libya, was
not worried about recent comments by the Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi threatening possible nationalisation of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bellis said he had "No concerns," about such an outcome.
Other oil executives have also dismissed the threats and
analysts believe the Libyan leadership is simply trying to
extract better terms from oil companies in contract
negotiations.

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Feb 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Pfizer Canada and the PROOF (PRevention Of Organ Failure) Centre of
Excellence for Commercialization and Research announced today they are
teaming up in the fight against vital organ failure (heart, lung and
kidney). In Canada, the personal, societal and economic consequences of
this type of organ failure cost our health care system more than $35
billion a year. This serious health issue is fueled by the parallel
epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and smoking-related conditions.

    Pfizer Canada will contribute $1 million to the PROOF Centre to fund
research into biomarkers - biological molecules that indicate disease -
which are at the core of the march towards more personalized health care.
The funding will go towards new biomarker initiatives in which the PROOF
Centre will be engaging in shortly, and eventually will expand to cover
relevant projects that are led by the Centre focusing on the translation
of biomarkers into clinical practice.

    "Efforts to create an environment conducive to research and development
investments are continuing in British Columbia," says Paul Levesque,
President of Pfizer Canada. "Pfizer is proud to contribute to the
research capacity in British Columbia by supporting this PROOF
initiative, which is being led by an exceptional group of scientists and
clinicians. We believe that to be truly healthy it takes more than
medication and we share PROOF's goal: to develop personalized tools that
could one day more effectively prevent, diagnose and treat patients
suffering from heart, lung and kidney failure."

    The PROOF Centre, hosted by the University of British Columbia, was one
of 11 Centres of Excellence for Commercialization and Research announced
by the Government of Canada in February 2008 when it received nearly $15
million in federal funding through the Networks of Centres of Excellence
(www.nce.gc.ca/cecrs_e.htm). The PROOF Centre's goal is to move away from
drug-only strategies towards biomarker-guided prevention and effective
early detection of primary diseases that cause organ failure. By speeding
up the commercialization process, the PROOF Centre hopes to make their
discoveries part of daily medical practice as quickly as possible.

    "The PROOF Centre is committed to leading the way in personalized
healthcare for the reduction of heart, lung and kidney disease," said Dr.
Bruce McManus, Director. "This additional funding from Pfizer Canada will
help us greatly to make significant strides."

    QUICK FACTS ABOUT HEART, KIDNEY AND LUNG FAILURE

    - Cardiovascular disease (heart disease, diseases of the blood vessels
and stroke) accounts for the death of more Canadians than any other
disease. Every 7 minutes in Canada, someone dies from heart disease or
stroke.(1)

    - In 2004 cardiovascular disease accounted for: 32% of all deaths in
Canada (72,338 deaths).(2)

    - Heart disease and stroke costs the Canadian economy more than $18
billion every year in physician services, hospital costs, lost wages and
decreased productivity.(3)

    - Globally, cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death and
is projected to remain so. An estimated 17.5 million people died from

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Feb 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Pfizer Canada and the PROOF (PRevention Of Organ Failure) Centre of
Excellence for Commercialization and Research announced today they are
teaming up in the fight against vital organ failure (heart, lung and
kidney). In Canada, the personal, societal and economic consequences of
this type of organ failure cost our health care system more than $35
billion a year. This serious health issue is fueled by the parallel
epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and smoking-related conditions.

    Pfizer Canada will contribute $1 million to the PROOF Centre to fund
research into biomarkers - biological molecules that indicate disease -
which are at the core of the march towards more personalized health care.
The funding will go towards new biomarker initiatives in which the PROOF
Centre will be engaging in shortly, and eventually will expand to cover
relevant projects that are led by the Centre focusing on the translation
of biomarkers into clinical practice.

    "Efforts to create an environment conducive to research and development
investments are continuing in British Columbia," says Paul Levesque,
President of Pfizer Canada. "Pfizer is proud to contribute to the
research capacity in British Columbia by supporting this PROOF
initiative, which is being led by an exceptional group of scientists and
clinicians. We believe that to be truly healthy it takes more than
medication and we share PROOF's goal: to develop personalized tools that
could one day more effectively prevent, diagnose and treat patients
suffering from heart, lung and kidney failure."

    The PROOF Centre, hosted by the University of British Columbia, was one
of 11 Centres of Excellence for Commercialization and Research announced
by the Government of Canada in February 2008 when it received nearly $15
million in federal funding through the Networks of Centres of Excellence
(www.nce.gc.ca/cecrs_e.htm). The PROOF Centre's goal is to move away from
drug-only strategies towards biomarker-guided prevention and effective
early detection of primary diseases that cause organ failure. By speeding
up the commercialization process, the PROOF Centre hopes to make their
discoveries part of daily medical practice as quickly as possible.

    "The PROOF Centre is committed to leading the way in personalized
healthcare for the reduction of heart, lung and kidney disease," said Dr.
Bruce McManus, Director. "This additional funding from Pfizer Canada will
help us greatly to make significant strides."

    QUICK FACTS ABOUT HEART, KIDNEY AND LUNG FAILURE

    - Cardiovascular disease (heart disease, diseases of the blood vessels
and stroke) accounts for the death of more Canadians than any other
disease. Every 7 minutes in Canada, someone dies from heart disease or
stroke.(1)

    - In 2004 cardiovascular disease accounted for: 32% of all deaths in
Canada (72,338 deaths).(2)

    - Heart disease and stroke costs the Canadian economy more than $18
billion every year in physician services, hospital costs, lost wages and
decreased productivity.(3)

    - Globally, cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death and
is projected to remain so. An estimated 17.5 million people died from
cardiovascular disease in 2005, representing 30 % of all global deaths.(4)

    - In 2006, there were 33,832 Canadians on renal replacement therapy and
this number is expected to double over the next 10 years. Each day, an
average of 14 Canadians learns that their kidneys have failed. Of the
4,195 Canadians on the waiting list for a transplant as of December 31,
2007, 2,963 (71%) were waiting for a kidney.(5)

conferencing, click-to-call, instant message (IM), video, and media
services to be easily integrated into Software as a Service offerings,
gaming environments, social networking sites, web mail, and wireless TV.
The solution enables service providers and business customers to
authorize as well as deliver, account and manage these communication
services made through web service requests.

    "Nortel single-click communications capabilities complement our LotusLive

providers a Software as a Service (SaaS) business model and the ability
to easily implement a revenue generating hosted communication solution."

    "Nortel's CaaS Transaction Broker can be deployed quickly and easily in
any network environment because it works across Nortel and non-Nortel
network infrastructures," said Samih Elhage, president, Carrier VoIP and
Application Solutions, Nortel. "The business solution also easily scales
to the service needs of any business or service provider's customer base.
Today, the communication business is no longer about selling a phone line
to a home or business. It's about being able to easily add communication
services like conferencing, IM and video into any online network service
like social networks and online gaming. The integration of Nortel's CaaS
with IBM's LotusLive application is just one example of how this business
solution can help carriers easily add these revenue generating
communication services to their networks."

&lt;p&gt;Customers Can Keep in Touch with Friends and Communities on the Go Through Any
Handset That Allows SIM Cards 
BARCELONA, Spain--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft Corp. and Gemalto today announced they are collaborating to offer
Windows Live Messenger services to the mass market of mobile subscribers through
a new Windows Live Messenger client application that comes pre-installed on
phone Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards. The Gemalto application, named
SIMessenger, is the world`s first Microsoft-certified instant messaging SIM
client solution. 

Gemalto`s SIMessenger enables users to easily keep in touch with their Windows
Live Messenger contacts from their mobile phone. SIMessenger offers an intuitive
menu that allows subscribers to access their Windows Live Messenger environment
with an experience similar to what they get when accessing it from a PC.
SIMessenger also automatically launches when they switch their handset on, so
they can start chatting immediately. 

SIMessenger`s user-friendly interface enables quick and easy navigation, so that
users retrieve the messaging service they are familiar with while on the move.
To date, three operators have successfully deployed SIMessenger: Oi in Brazil,
Personal S.A. in Argentina and Movistar in Peru. Gemalto has already delivered
close to 5 million SIM cards embedding the Windows Live instant messaging
application. 

"Through our alliance with Gemalto, we are able to greatly expand the reach of
the Windows Live Messenger experience on mobile to new markets and more
consumers," said Tom Bailey, senior director of product management for Windows
Live for Mobile services. "SIMessenger will enable the masses to easily use the
popular Windows Live Messenger to communicate with the people they care about
while on the go." 

"Worldwide, people who own a mobile phone widely outnumber those who have
Internet access," added Philippe Vall&#233;e, executive vice president of the
Telecommunications Business Unit at Gemalto. "With more than 320 million active
Windows Live Messenger accounts worldwide, combined with 3.6 billion SIM cards
currently in use, there is strong growth potential for SIMessenger, and Gemalto
is proud to join forces with Microsoft to make messaging available to all."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - Five questions with Kathy Franklin, Disney Consumer Products' vp global studio franchise development, at the Toy Fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER: TIANA FROM "THE PRINCESS AND THE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FROG" WILL BE YOUR FIRST NEW DISNEY PRINCESS IN 11 YEARS BY THE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIME THE FILM COMES OUT DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. HOW DOES SHE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIT INTO YOUR DISNEY PRINCESS FRANCHISE, AND HOW IS SHE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIFFERENT -- OTHER THAN BEING AFRICAN-AMERICAN?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franklin: Our hope is that she will fit in as all the other princesses have fit in. We hope that she is very inspirational for little girls and that little girls will want to play out her story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER: HOW DO YOU KEEP THE DISNEY PRINCESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRANCHISE GOING BEYOND ADDING CHARACTERS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franklin: This fall is a great example. We're bringing "Snow White" back (on Blu-ray Disc) in a fresh way to reintroduce her to girls who may not be as familiar with her story, and we have a brand-new princess, Tiana, for girls who are looking to add to what are, in some cases, gigantic Disney Princess collections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER: SHOULD WE EXPECT MORE PRINCESSES TO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BE UNVEILED AND EXISTING ONES TO MAKE A COMEBACK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franklin: We have plans over the next several years to introduce more princess characters and to continue to refresh our existing characters. We've done this with "Cinderella," "Little Mermaid" and "Sleeping Beauty." "Snow White" will have that same treatment, and then "Beauty and the Beast" (in 3-D) next fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER: HOW IS THE RECESSION AFFECTING YOUR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUSINESS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franklin: We definitely have the kind of brand that can weather a recession better than many. But we have planned our toy line so that there is something at every price point. A little girl who falls in love with Princess Tiana can have Tiana items -- something very small or something as elaborate as the Disney Store deluxe role-play, depending on what is appropriate for her and her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER: THE DISNEY PRINCESS FRANCHISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BROUGHT IN RETAIL SALES OF $4 BILLION LAST YEAR. IS THERE ROOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR GROWTH?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franklin: Disney Princess is now a 10-year franchise ... so it's more mature than in the early years when we had double-digit growth. We still see growth, but that will definitely be slower than in the past, especially in a recessionary period. But we also have Disney Fairies, Hannah Montana, High School Musical, our tween properties -- so we now have many, many offerings for girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dean Goodman at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Feb 18 (Reuters) - Investors seeing the bottom
of the collapse in commodity prices drawing near, should hang
fire and remain focused on equities, analysts at Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The investment bank said rising forward price curves for
commodities, also known as contango markets, meant speculating
in the asset class was still a risky proposition and investors
would be better placed putting their money in mining and energy
equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the bank remained bullish on the long-term outlook for
commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly commodity markets are beginning to show signs of a
bottom, suggesting that the upside risks of being long
commodities now outweighs the downside risks," Goldman said in
a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it warned the hefty cost of holding positions had
prompted the bank to advise investors to underweight direct
investment in the asset class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Unlike an equity, which an investor can buy and hold, a
long investment in a commodity cannot be held indefinitely, as
ultimately the futures contract for which the investment is
held will near expiration, at which point, the position will
need to be rolled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If an investors buys oil for delivery in three months
CLc3, currently at $41.00, front month prices CLc1, at
$35.05 on Wednesday, will have to rise by $6 or 17 percent to
break even.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a graphic showing the forward curves for copper and
oil, please click on the following link:
 here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The key reason why you would want to be long the
commodity-related equity today, but still short the commodity,
is that equity instruments are anticipatory assets that are
forward looking, while commodities are spot assets that reflect
current fundamentals," the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Once it becomes clear that fundamentals are improving
sequentially, then the equity should begin to perform," it
said, adding that a change in the structure of forward prices
for commodities needed a bigger push -- for inventories to
actually decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Once inventories begin to decline, the forward curve
begins to tighten and the negative carry lessens, decreasing
the cost of holding a long commodity position."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - A lot has changed in the "big get" TV interview business since ABC's Barbara Walters and "60 Minutes" correspondent Steve Kroft began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the personal approach used to work back in the day, both TV journalists said Tuesday that there are now plenty of handlers between interviewer and interviewee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even murderers have agents and lawyers," Walters told the New Yorker's Ken Auletta during a panel attended by the likes of former New York Mayor Ed Koch, Sony chairman Howard Stringer and others of Manhattan's media elite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone is now press-savvy, Walters said. Interview subjects now ask how many minutes they'll get on air and other questions that used to be left unsaid. And, as Kroft mentioned, most people want to get on the air only to serve their purposes, like pushing a book or some other profit-making enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like landing an advertising account. You have to do a song and dance," Kroft said. "It's very distasteful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither network star was upbeat about the future of the broadcast evening newscasts. Kroft said that he thought the future of an evening newscast would be on cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if it'll be on CBS or ABC or NBC," Kroft said. "The medium seems to be losing steam."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters went even further: "The only programs that will be here 10 years from now are the morning shows. Everything else you can TiVo or see on the Internet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interviewee's press-savvyness sometimes extends to the questions that can be asked. Walters said that in her upcoming Oscar night program, she was told by actress Anne Hathaway's press people that there would be no questions about her jailed ex-boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But you can say, 'What kind of year has it been?'" Walters said. She said that she has walked out of interviews because of too many restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters said that it's crucial for interviewers to do their homework and know more about their subjects than the people who are in front of the camera. Kroft said that it's important to not only figure out the questions but also think ahead of time about possible answers. And he took issue with New Yorker writer Janet Malcolm's oft-quoted article about how journalists betray their sources to do their job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only thing you can promise them is to be fair," Kroft said. "You talk about betrayal. I think your only responsibility is to the audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroft said that Walters' reputation is strong because she hasn't burned too many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I may lose that whole reputation being on 'The View,'" Walters said of the daytime program she co-created. She said that "The View" co-hosts aren't journalists, but they do ask lots of questions, sometimes to the annoyance of subjects. She pointed to the experience of former GOP presidential candidate John McCain, who was told by Joy Behar that he "lied." Walters saw McCain two weeks ago in Washington and said she hoped to see him on "The View" again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He looked at me and said, 'Not anytime soon,'" Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Walters wanted to clear up any misconceptions about her reputation of making people cry. It isn't on purpose, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's because I ask them about their childhood, especially when I ask them about their fathers," Walters said. "It's always the father."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And she defended herself about her query to Katharine Hepburn about what kind of tree the actress was, saying that forever she'd be associated with that question. But Walters maintained that Hepburn brought it up first, saying on camera that she was "an old tree." Nobody heard that but they sure did hear her follow-up, Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If someone told you that they were a tree, wouldn't you ask, 'What kind of tree?'" she asked Auletta and the audience. "I rest my case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auletta got some ribbing from the ABC News legend by introducing her as "Babwa Wa-Wa," channeling the late Gilda Radner's impression on "Saturday Night Live."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't do that," Walters said. "I'm just amazed at you. I'm leaving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You did that to (Walters' former ABC News co-anchor) Harry Reasoner," Auletta joked. "Don't do that to me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters said she had initially been hurt by the impression but later decided it was no big deal. She even asked Radner to do it for her, in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dean Goodman at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA (Reuters) - After spending a month sewing the beading on to her white satin gown, Russian student Emma Akopjan is attending her first Vienna ball and hopes to forget the economic downturn for just one magical night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The season is in full swing and showing few effects of the crisis, with many of the city's 450 balls fully booked and 300,000 people attending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does not depend upon whether it is a time of crisis or not, balls were always in Vienna ... and you wish for just one night which is a fairytale," said the 21-year old economics student at the Moscow Ball in Vienna's neo-gothic city hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moscow Ball is one of the newest additions and highlights the Vienna season's international standing, with dozens of young Russians like Akopjan flying in to make their debut in a throw-back to a bygone era of imperial splendor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dancers twirl in gowns and black tails, or sip champagne and listen to the orchestra at tables decorated with white roses and scarlet amaryllis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Compared to last year's balls there is no difference. People still like to have fun," said Roland Krupitza, out of breath after dancing to Johann Strauss's "The Blue Danube."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austria's economy declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 for the first time in eight years and the downturn is just beginning to make itself felt among the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krupitza, 47, a tour operator, has seen a slowdown in business but that did not deter him and hundreds of others from dancing through the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are feeling the pinch in their wallets, but they don't want to admit that something is happening ... they are wearing blinkers, like horses," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUSINESS LEADERS AND POLITICANS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the balls are as well-attended as ever, Austria's business leaders and politicians are keeping a low profile, grappling with the fallout from the financial crisis which is likely to spread as the quarterly earnings season approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austrian companies such Voestalpine, a supplier to Europe's car industry, have issued earnings warnings this year and several banks are in talks with the government about drawing on its rescue package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only ball where you can tell the impact of the financial crisis, a political impact, is the Opera Ball which some politicians and chief executives have said they will not attend," said Brigitte Jank, president of the Vienna Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Opera Ball on Feb 19, the high point of the season and traditionally an event for high society to be seen, is shown live on national television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ball is sold out, despite giddy prices ranging from 230 euros ($293.5) for a normal ticket to 17,000 euros for a box, according to an official on the organizing committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company heads such as Telekom Austria's Boris Nemsic and Raiffeisen Zentralbank's Walter Rothensteiner will not be attending this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In times like these when you are talking to the government about a capital injection, it just doesn't look very good to sit there in public, sipping champagne at the Opera Ball," said a banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local politicians and organizers argue the show must go on and the balls provide a stimulus to the economy, especially at the start of the year when spending is sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the whole season we are expecting a consumer investment of 65 million euros, on average 215 euros per ball guest on the tickets, clothes, shoes, hair, taxis, dinner before the ball etc," said Jank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CITY'S BUSINESS CARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eva Dintsis, an organiser of the Opera Ball, said it would be counterproductive to cancel or shun the usual festivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some 40 companies start work on the ball four months in advance for the carpets, wallpaper, renovation ... and there is an incredible number of people working at the ball itself, caterers, musicians, etc," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austria's ball tradition is proving a popular export, with Viennese balls established in cities such as Johannesburg and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see Vienna balls as a form of business card for the city," said Renate Brauner, deputy mayor of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We sometimes combine them with economic presentations, and try to present Vienna as a tourist destination ... it is a romantic and very Viennese way to present our city."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most Viennese, however, the balls are a long-held tradition, one they are not likely to forgo in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For us Austrians, it goes without saying that your wardrobe includes black tie, tail coat or ball gown ... and that you attend a dance school," said Renate Danler, managing director of the Hofburg Palace, which is hosting 17 balls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danler, 50, herself a keen dancer, said Viennese would rather spend less on other things than miss out on their beloved balls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last luxury the Viennese would give up would be their balls, said Christian Rainer, 47, editor of Austrian weekly magazine profil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Viennese would spend their last cent on balls because it is the nucleus of Viennese social life ... we would dance into disaster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Boris Groendahl; editing by Andrew Dobbie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   * PG gives "special equity award" to CEO Lafley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Award for his role in acquisition of Gilette in 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Award consists of $3.5 mln in restricted stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares closed about 2 pct lower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Adds spokesman comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co
(PG.N) has awarded its chairman and chief executive officer a
bonus of $3.5 million in restricted stock units for the
acquisition of the Gilette Co in 2005, the company said in a
filing on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "special equity award" given Feb 10 was for A.G.
Lafley's "foresight for initiating the acquisition of the
Gilette Company and his leadership throughout the acquisition
and integration processes," the company said in a release filed
with the U.S. Securities  Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Through this grant, the Committee rewards Mr. Lafley's
strategic vision to combine two world-class consumer products
companies into the largest consumer products company in the
world, his understanding of the transaction's benefits for
shareholders and his successful leadership through the
complexities of integrating Gillette into PG," read the
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Procter  Gamble bought Gillette in October 2005. The
combined company now sells everything from Tide laundry
detergent to Gillette razors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the company lowered its profit and sales
outlook for the fiscal year ending in June and said fiscal 2009
sales would be flat or down as low as 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The award will be made in the form of restricted stock
units using the Feb. 27 share closing price, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Procter  Gamble spokesman Paul Fox said the bonus was "not
unusual," saying the company had granted a similar award to its
chief financial officer last year. The company waited until now
to grant the bonus to make sure that savings goals tied to the
acquisition had been reached, Fox said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Procter  Gamble shares, which are down 24 percent in the
past year, closed 98 cents on Tuesday at $50.11 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 17 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) plans to take
advantage of the U.S. economic stimulus package signed earlier on
Tuesday by offering Internet services over power lines to more
rural consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; IBM said its venture with International Broadband Electric
Communications (IBEC), a company that provides broadband over
power line (BPL) services, had begun to sign up Internet customers
in rural parts of Alabama, Indiana, Michigan and Virginia and that
it hoped to access more government funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The economic stimulus law signed by President Barack Obama
included $2.5 billion for the Agricultural Department to expand
broadband service in rural America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp Chief Executive Sam
Palmisano was one of several U.S. business leaders who met with
Obama late last month, and IBEC's chief executive is set to meet
with lawmakers on Wednesday to see how much of that funding would
be available to the venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BPL technologies use radio signals which help connect Internet
service over electric power lines. Consumers can access the
Internet by plugging modems into power outlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such services are widely seen as slower and less reliable than
that of cable and phone providers, which offer increasingly fast
connections as well as online video services with the help of
fiber-optic networks and advanced network gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But IBM said the IBEC venture's service is aimed at remote and
sparsely populated areas where advanced Internet services are not
available, meaning the only competition would be traditional
dial-up services which are even slower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said it did not know how much government funds it could
receive but that the venture would proceed regardless, and that it
expects broader Internet use to stimulate the economy and help
create more business opportunities in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the long-term, the effort will lead to the expansion of
small businesses and creation of new industries, bringing new jobs
to rural Americans and driving net new economic growth," said
Raymond Blair, director of advanced networks at IBM.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jon Winkelried, co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), is retiring next month for personal reasons, a spokesman for the firm said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winkelried, 49, has worked at Goldman for 26 years and is looking to spend more time with his family and on his horse ranch, spokesman Lucas van Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will not receive any sort of severance payment. He had planned to leave last summer, but as the markets eroded, he elected to stay with the firm, van Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winkelried, one of seven senior Goldman executives not to get a bonus for 2008, joined the bank in 1982 as an investment banker. He later became head of corporate bond syndication, and from 1995 to 1999, he headed leveraged finance. After a short stint heading fixed-income, currency, and commodities in Europe, Winkelried became co-head of that business globally. He became president and co-COO of the firm in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winkelried's retirement is effective March 31, leaving Gary Cohn as the sole president and COO. In addition to Winkelried's co-COO spot, he is also retiring as a director on Goldman's board. He will be given the honorary title of "senior director" when he retires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a regulatory filing, as of mid-January Winkelried held about 1.44 million Goldman shares, either directly or through a partnership or his family, worth about $123.2 million based on Tuesday's closing price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winkelried was among a group of executives that agreed not to sell more than 10 percent of their Goldman shares until October 2011 for as long as Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) owns preferred shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway agreed in September to invest in $5 billion of Goldman's perpetual preferred shares, as well as to buy warrants on another $5 billion of Goldman shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman received another $10 billion of capital from the government in October, under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government money has come with strings attached, including executive compensation limits, that have made many banks eager to pay taxpayers back as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman aims to pay back its $10 billion of TARP money this year, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said at a conference earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jon Stempel; Editing by Tim Dobbyn and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

co-COO spot, he is also retiring as a director on Goldman's
board. He will be given the honorary title of "senior director"
when he retires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a regulatory filing, as of mid-January
Winkelried held about 1.44 million Goldman shares, either
directly or through a partnership or his family, worth about
$123.2 million based on Tuesday's closing price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winkelried was among a group of executives that agreed not
to sell more than 10 percent of their Goldman shares until
October 2011 for as long as Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N)
owns preferred shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway agreed in September to
invest in $5 billion of Goldman's perpetual preferred shares,
as well as to buy warrants on another $5 billion of Goldman
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman received another $10 billion of capital from the
government in October, under the Troubled Asset Relief
Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Government money has come with strings attached, including
executive compensation limits, that have made many banks eager
to pay taxpayers back as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman aims to pay back its $10 billion of TARP money this
year, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said at a conference
earlier this month.

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX, Feb 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ClearCorrect, Inc., a manufacturer of FDA-cleared transparent orthodontic
aligners, commonly known as clear braces or invisible braces, today filed
a declaratory judgment against Align Technology, Inc., the manufacturer of
Invisalign(R). The suit was filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division.

    By definition, a declaratory judgment is a court decision in a civil case
that tells the parties what their rights and responsibilities are, without
awarding damages or ordering them to do anything. Unlike most court cases,
where the plaintiff asks for damages or other court orders, the plaintiff
in a declaratory judgment case simply wants the court to resolve an
uncertainty so that it can avoid future litigation and associated costs.

    Specifically, ClearCorrect has filed a complaint that alleges that
certain patents owned by Align Technology (Invisalign) are invalid and
that ClearCorrect's clear braces products and processes do not infringe
upon those patents.

    According to ClearCorrect's attorney, Randy J. McClanahan of Houston-based
law firm McClanahan, Myers and Espey, LLP, "This suit was filed against
Align Technology not to prevent Align from conducting business, but to
ensure that ClearCorrect could compete openly and fairly in the market for
clear orthodontic aligners without threat of litigation by Align."

    "Fortunately for us, the Constitution provides protection in these 'David
vs. Goliath' situations," explained ClearCorrect CEO and practicing
Houston dentist, Dr. Willis Pumphrey. "We are merely trying to avoid
protracted litigation such as Align's suit against Ormco Corporation,
which took six years and untold legal costs to eventually prove the
invalidity of several of Align's patent claims. We are willing to
voluntarily dismiss our suit if Align provides assurance that it will not
initiate similar litigation in the future."

    About ClearCorrect, Inc.

    Headquartered in Houston, Texas, ClearCorrect was founded by dentists to
serve the dental and orthodontic industry by providing a superior and more
affordable clear aligner system. The highly-sophisticated ClearCorrect
treatment delivery system and corresponding aligner products are based on
years of research and clinical experience. Cutting-edge technological
advances and advanced treatment expertise, coupled with comprehensive
marketing and sales support, make ClearCorrect the premier clear aligner
solution of choice for informed dentists and patients. The company's
modern, needs-based approach for serving doctors and patients has earned
it a leadership position within the dental industry. For information about

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) over the weekend announced that it has
signed a multi-year licensing agreement with Denmark's privately held Lego
Group, giving the toy maker access to Disney and Disney Pixar properties. While
Disney didn't disclose how much the deal was worth, it did say that Lego
products are currently in development for 3 franchises -- Disney Pixar's "Toy
Story" and "Cars," and the upcoming movie "Prince of Persia," which is being
produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Mike Newell. All 3 product lines
are scheduled for release in 2010. 

Technically speaking, the shares of DIS are in a spot of trouble. The security
is down more than 18% since the start of the year, and has recently broken out
of its sideways channel to the downside, fracturing support in the 19-20 region.
The equity is also drifting lower under resistance from its 10-day moving
average.

&lt;p&gt;  YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, NY, Feb 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that IBM Research Scientist Robert H.
Dennard was the recipient of the National Academy of Engineering's 2009
Charles Stark Draper Prize.

    View video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5zY48sJ5m8=channel_page

    Recognized as one of the world's preeminent awards for engineering
achievement, the Charles Stark Draper Prize honors an engineer whose
accomplishment has significantly impacted society by improving the quality
of life, providing the ability to live freely and comfortably, and/or
permitting the access to information.

    Dr. Dennard was recognized for his invention and contributions to the
development of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), used universally in
computers and other data processing and communication systems. The 1968
invention of DRAM using one-transistor cells paved the way for the
worldwide explosion of computing, and the increase of data storage into
small devices.

    DRAM is a form of computer memory that puts bits of data into capacitors
-- energy-storage devices within a miniaturized electronic circuit -- and
periodically recharges the capacitors so that the information in them is
not lost. His 1-transistor design was a vast improvement over the existing
6-transistor cell in use at that time. Dennard's ability to use only a
single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistor -- a device that
conducts electricity, amplifying the charge as the electricity is passed
along -- allowed his memory cell to be much smaller and simpler in design
than its predecessor.

    In addition, Dennard and associates developed the set of consistent
scaling principles for miniaturizing MOS transistors and integrated
circuits using them, which are the basis for today's electronic
microprocessor chips as well as DRAM chips. In the early 1970s the
industry was concerned with how far MOS transistors could be miniaturized
without affecting their switching ability. Dennard's IBM group introduced
a theory -- called constant-field scaling -- which addressed these
issues. This scaling allowed for computers to run faster on significantly
less energy and thus be less costly to operate and is a major driver of
the industry. His 1974 paper on MOS transistor scaling is universally
referenced and has been reprinted as a "Classic Paper" in the Proceedings
of the IEEE.

    The availability of cheap, high-density memory that has come about due to
the invention of the DRAM cell has enabled tremendous growth in computing
over the past 40 years, and has played a major role in enabling computing
to be embedded into everyday life in devices such as cell phones, mp3
players, game machines sensors and more.

    After earning B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from
Southern Methodist University and a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University
in 1958, Dennard spent his entire professional career in various
positions at IBM, including earning the prestigious title of IBM Fellow
beginning in 1979. He was elected to the NAE in 1984. He continues his
exploration of science and computing today at IBM's T.J. Watson Research
Center in Yorktown Heights, NY.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA and REDMOND, WA, Feb 17 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the IT infrastructure performance
company for networks, applications and storage, announced today that it
has licensed Microsoft Windows Server 2008 for integration on the
Riverbed(R) Steelhead(R) appliance through the Riverbed Services Platform
(RSP). The RSP is a virtualized partition within the Steelhead appliance
that allows customers to deploy applications critical to the branch
office as virtualized services on the appliance, enabling them to further
consolidate their IT infrastructure.

    This agreement further strengthens Riverbed's relationship with Microsoft.
In August 2008, Riverbed joined the Microsoft Protocol Optimization
Licensing Program (POLP). Through this protocol implementation agreement,
Microsoft gives Riverbed access to its intellectual property so that
Riverbed can build on its expertise and success accelerating and
optimizing Windows-based applications over the wide area network (WAN).
Participation in POLP, combined with Riverbed's licensing of Windows
Server 2008, gives enterprises that have standardized on Microsoft a
proven platform for IT consolidation.

    "Many enterprises share a vision of a remote office with few or no servers
and IT centralized in the data center," said Zeus Kerravala, senior vice
president, Yankee Group. "The addition of Microsoft's Windows Server 2008
to the Riverbed Services Platform moves that vision closer to a reality.
Riverbed customers get proven and best-of-breed acceleration that can now
run the most common IT platform -- Windows Server -- for their critical
remote infrastructure services."

    Riverbed will offer the optional Windows Server 2008 operating system

branch office tremendously. Now, we are able to provide print services
and Active Directory logon services -- all with a standard Windows
server," according to Strand Associates' IT Coordinator, Justin
Marthaler. "With two of our most trusted vendors working hand-in-hand we
now have the ability to virtualize branch offices while using the best
solutions."

    "Through this relationship with Microsoft our joint customers are able to
get even more out of their Riverbed investment. The flexibility of our
virtualized solution is now further enhanced by the ability to run Windows

&lt;p&gt;Announcing Validation of Chordiant Decision Management on IBM`s New Service
Provider Delivery Environment (SPDE) Framework
CUPERTINO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chordiant Software, Inc. (Nasdaq:CHRD), the leading provider of Customer
Experience (Cx) software and services, has successfully completed validation of
its Chordiant Decision Management software for IBM`s SPDE Framework. As an
integral part of IBM`s new framework, Chordiant`s centralized predictive
decisioning software will help telecommunication companies rapidly implement
revenue-generating services that optimize the customer experience. Chordiant
Decision Management is a proven application for telecommunications that
currently enables some of the world`s largest providers to improve customer
satisfaction, reduce churn and increase profitability. 

"Through the SPDE Framework initiative, we are bringing together
platform-independent software vendors that deliver proven solutions designed and
built for service providers," said Jeff Smith, Vice President, Communications
Sector Solutions IBM. "Each of these vendors has undergone a rigorous assessment
to ensure that their solutions qualify as a next-generation,
open-standards-based environment. We are excited that Chordiant is one of the
select vendors to meet this high standard. We believe Chordiant solutions
deliver real business value to communication service providers that will help
successfully reduce churn, one of the most critical issues currently facing
providers. 

"IBM`s new framework provides an excellent platform for telecommunications
providers who want to get up and running fast with solutions that can drive
revenue within the installed base, and potential clients and improve customer
focus," said Lisa Caswell, Vice President, Global Alliances of Chordiant." SPDE
provides the end-to-end service delivery framework, and Chordiant enables the
services delivered to improve business results while personalizing the customer
experience and interactions. We think the telecommunications industry will
benefit tremendously from this exciting initiative." 

The IBM SPDE Framework is an open, scalable, flexible and SOA-based
telecommunications industry application framework. Several solution vendors and
their applications have been validated for integration into the framework. The
objective of this framework is to accelerate a telecommunications service
lifecycle from creation and execution of a service, service quality assurance,
security and ongoing management and maintenance of a service. 

Integrated into the SPDE Framework, Chordiant Decision Management comprises a
suite of predictive decisioning applications that form the core of Chordiant's
vertical Cx solutions for the telecommunications industry. With Chordiant
decisioning, companies can become more responsive to customer needs and more
agile in the face of market pressures by delivering consistent, Next-Best-Action
driven interactions across all channels. Business line managers and marketing
managers can create customer interaction and marketing strategies that help
build customer loyalty that have proven results of significantly reducing churn
at many of the world`s leading telecommunications providers while increasing
efficiency. In the contact center, Chordiant Decision Management guides agents
through proposition negotiations with real-time recommendations that take into
consideration the customer's history and likely behaviors. 

Agents can negotiate for retention or collections and make cross-sell or up-sell
offers that change on-the-fly depending on the customer's reaction. When the
moment is right, Chordiant Decision Management can even guide an agent through a
non-scripted, intelligent needs analysis Q with the customer. With only a
pre-determined first question, the system will dynamically determine subsequent
questions depending on the customer's history and current answers. With built in
telecommunication blueprints, the system can do real-time best plan advice
calculations that can be used as a cross-/up-selling or retention tool. 

Chordiant Decision Management's toolset used to design, test, and deploy these
real-time strategies can be understood and controlled by business users. This
gives business owners the ability to manage the success of marketing efforts in
real-time and measure that success in terms of impact on the bottom line. To
ensure operational safety, IT can set the parameters in which customer
strategies can be safely defined and deployed to ensure that existing systems
and processes are not negatively impacted. In addition, Chordiant Decision
Management is designed for the large enterprise, enabling hundreds of live,
self-learning models to be implemented across thousands of users and millions of
interactions without impacting overall system performance.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA and REDMOND, WA, Feb 17 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the IT infrastructure performance
company for networks, applications and storage, announced today that it
has licensed Microsoft Windows Server 2008 for integration on the
Riverbed(R) Steelhead(R) appliance through the Riverbed Services Platform
(RSP). The RSP is a virtualized partition within the Steelhead appliance
that allows customers to deploy applications critical to the branch
office as virtualized services on the appliance, enabling them to further
consolidate their IT infrastructure.

    This agreement further strengthens Riverbed's relationship with Microsoft.
In August 2008, Riverbed joined the Microsoft Protocol Optimization
Licensing Program (POLP). Through this protocol implementation agreement,
Microsoft gives Riverbed access to its intellectual property so that
Riverbed can build on its expertise and success accelerating and
optimizing Windows-based applications over the wide area network (WAN).
Participation in POLP, combined with Riverbed's licensing of Windows
Server 2008, gives enterprises that have standardized on Microsoft a
proven platform for IT consolidation.

    "Many enterprises share a vision of a remote office with few or no servers
and IT centralized in the data center," said Zeus Kerravala, senior vice
president, Yankee Group. "The addition of Microsoft's Windows Server 2008
to the Riverbed Services Platform moves that vision closer to a reality.
Riverbed customers get proven and best-of-breed acceleration that can now
run the most common IT platform -- Windows Server -- for their critical
remote infrastructure services."

    Riverbed will offer the optional Windows Server 2008 operating system
pre-installed on the RSP, allowing customers to leverage this open
platform to run Windows server. The Windows Server 2008 services that
will be offered on the Steelhead appliances initially include Domain Name
System (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Active
Directory, Windows streaming and print services.

    Riverbed has joined Microsoft's Server Virtualization Validation Program

&lt;p&gt;Chevron and Qatar Science &amp; Technology Park Partner to Advance Renewable and
Energy Efficiency Technologies
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) announced today plans to commit $20 million over
five years to form a partnership with the Qatar Science &amp; Technology Park (QSTP)
in Doha and establish a center of excellence in renewable power and energy
efficiency. 

The partnership with QSTP will create The Center for Sustainable Energy
Efficiency, which intends to focus on developing technologies in lighting and
cooling that work effectively in the Middle East climate. The center, expected
to open in late 2009, also anticipates conducting research in the development
and application of renewable power, such as solar, and developing and training
Qatari engineers, scientists and students to build expertise and capabilities
within the country. 

"Chevron believes that energy efficiency and conservation are the most immediate
and cost-effective sources of new energy, and we are proud to work in
partnership with Qatar to help achieve environmentally responsible development
and economic diversification - two important elements of Qatar`s National
Vision," said Chevron Vice Chairman Peter Robertson. "By bringing Chevron`s
global expertise in energy efficiency and renewable power to this premier center
for research, learning and entrepreneurship, we can identify specific energy
technologies that work well in the region`s desert climate and develop
capabilities within the country that ultimately will benefit Qatar and the
entire region." 

Said H.E., Qatar`s Deputy Premier &amp; Minister of Energy and Industry, Abdullah
bin Hamad al-Attiyah: "I am very pleased to welcome Chevron`s Center for
Sustainable Energy Efficiency to QSTP in Qatar, and we look forward to a long
partnership with Chevron. Establishment of this Center greatly enhances our
ability to utilize Chevron`s expertise and leadership in the area of energy
efficiency and renewable energy technologies in the future, and for training
Qatari engineers and scientists." 

Dr. Tidu Maini, executive chairman of QSTP, added: "Finding smarter ways of
using energy is no less important in Qatar than in the rest of the world. By
taking a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach to energy research,
Chevron`s QSTP center will help position Qatar at the forefront of environmental
technologies globally." 

The Center for Sustainable Energy Efficiency will be supported by expertise in
energy efficiency and renewable energy drawn from Chevron`s technology
companies, including Chevron Energy Solutions (CES), which has developed
hundreds of projects involving energy efficiency and renewable power facilities
for education, government and business customers across the United States. CES
markets both energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies such as
high-efficiency lighting, cooling, fuel cells, biomass and solar. Chevron
recently endowed the Chevron Chair in Energy Efficiency at the Energy Efficiency
Center at the University of California, Davis. The center is focused on
developing new energy efficiency technology that can be commercialized globally.


Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;Information in 10-Q Called "Dishonest" and "Misleading"


QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Chevron is deceiving shareholders and the financial markets by filing misleading
information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to downplay its
$27 billion potential liability in a environmental lawsuit in Ecuador,
representatives for the plaintiffs in that case asserted today. 

"We believe Chevron is distorting information in its public filings and thumbing
its nose at SEC regulators," said Pablo Fajardo, the lead lawyer for 30,000
rainforest residents, a CNN "Hero Award" winner. "The company's information is
dishonest and misleading." 

Texaco has admitted it dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste water
into Ecuador's Amazon waterways when it was the exclusive operator of an oil
consortium from 1964 to 1990. The waste included carcinogens such as benzene,
and five indigenous groups assert their traditional lifestyles have been
decimated by the contamination. 

Chevron bought Texaco in 2001 and will bear any liability in the case. A final
decision is expected later this year. 

A court-appointed expert, Professor Richard Cabrera, determined that 1,041
cancer deaths in an area the size of Rhode Island could be attributed to
Texaco's sub-standard operational practices. The Cabrera report - based on the
work of 14 independent scientists - concluded that damages could rise to $27
billion to cover environmental clean-up and compensation for cancers and other
health problems. 

In its November 10-Q filing with the SEC, Chevron included four assertions that
are easily proved false simply by examining the court record, said Fajardo. 

He said the four primary distortions in the 10-Q are:

* Chevron falsely claims that the Ecuador court lacks jurisdiction over the
company. In reality, Texaco stipulated before U.S. federal judge Jed Rakoff in
2002 that it would submit to jurisdiction in Ecuador as a condition of the court
granting its motion to have the case transferred. 
* Chevron misleadingly asserts that the lawsuit is barred by the statute of
limitations. Yet before Judge Rakoff, Texaco waived all defenses based on the
statute of limitations as a condition of having its motion granted to move the
case to Ecuador. 
* Chevron claims it was "released" from liability by Ecuador's government after
a partial remediation in the mid-1990s. In reality, the language of Chevron's
purported release expressly excludes the claims of the private individuals
bringing the lawsuit. Chevron also fails to disclose that two of its lawyers are
under indictment in Ecuador for lying to secure the release. 
* Chevron claims that the use of Ecuador's 1999 environmental law to bring the
case is wrong because the law cannot be applied to environmental damage that
occurred years earlier. In reality, as confirmed by the lawsuit, the plaintiffs
are bringing their claims based on a statute that dates to 1861.

Fajardo said other obvious distortions in Chevron's SEC filing include:

* Chevron tries to diminish the court expert, Richard Cabrera, by calling him a
"mining engineer". Chevron fails to disclose that Cabrera is also a respected
environmental scientist and university professor and that he worked on the
expert report with 14 independent scientists. In fact, Chevron was so impressed
with Cabrera's expertise that it paid him to work in an earlier part of the
case. 
* Chevron says in the 10-Q that it cannot estimate a possible loss in the case,
despite the fact the expert report identifies specific damage amounts in 4,000
pages of data that includes 64,000 chemical sampling results from dozens of oil
production sites.

"Chevron's strategy in Ecuador has been to deceive the authorities and then try
to cover it up when caught," said Fajardo. "Courts in both countries are being
defrauded and thousands of innocent people are the victims." 

Fajardo said lawyers for the plaintiffs were providing the SEC with more
detailed information from the court record documenting Chevron's deception. Even
though Chevron has faced a multi-billion dollar liability for several years in
Ecuador, the company did not disclose it to the SEC until the middle of 2008 and
even then refused to estimate the amount of potential loss despite the $27
billion liability cited in the Cabrera report. 

For the last two years Chevron has suffered a series of setbacks in the case,
which was originally filed in 1993 in U.S. federal court. Ecuador's trial court
denied a Chevron motion to dismiss the case, Ecuador's national prosecutor
indicted two Chevron lawyers and seven former government officials for lying
about the purported clean-up, and the U.S. Congress extended trade benefits to
Ecuador despite protests by Chevron. 

A U.S. federal judge recently denied Chevron's attempt to force Ecuador's
government into a binding arbitration over who should pay for further clean-up.

&lt;p&gt;DOHA Feb 17 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) is still in
talks with state-run Qatar Petroleum (QP) to build a
petrochemical cracker, a senior Exxon executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The slump in demand for petrochemicals as global economic
activity slows has raised doubts about plans for petrochemical
expansion. The Middle East has a slew of projects under
contruction and planning as the world's top oil exporters look
to develop their economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and QP have been talking about the plant for four
years after signing an initial deal in 2005. A final deal was
expected in 2006, but has yet to be struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's still under discussion," said Alex Dodds, Exxon's
Qatar country manager, when asked about the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plant, to be built in the industrial city of Ras Laffan,
was estimated in 2006 to cost around $3 billion and was slated
to start up in 2012. It would produce around 1.6 million tonnes
per year of ethylene products.

&lt;p&gt;Company introduces Microsoft-based Security platforms on Tier 1 hardware
platforms from Hewlett Packard 
MARLBOROUGH, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Portcullis Systems, Inc., a Microsoft and HP partner, brings new offerings to
the network security market with worldwide deployment and support options for
the company`s solutions featuring Microsoft Intelligent Application Gateway
(IAG) 2007 and Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2006. 

Portcullis Systems is pleased to announce their new security appliance product
lines based on hardware from HP. This enhances their current offerings and
brings tier 1 hardware choices for Microsoft ISA and IAG to their customers. 

"Portcullis Systems steps beyond the typical IAG and ISA Server solutions to
bring a higher function appliance to their customers. By combining these
advanced technologies on Enterprise-Class hardware from manufacturers like HP
and NEI - all backed by worldwide support options that include up to four-hour
onsite response," said John "JG" Chirapurath, director of marketing for
Microsoft Identity and Security. "Portcullis Systems solutions are ideal for a
wide range of enterprises that need to provide security and secure remote access
for their workforce." 

Portcullis CEO Michael Oldham founded the company to make it easier for
organizations to implement strong security without the need to make major
investments in technology and staff. "Our systems leverage the award-winning
Microsoft security solutions including IAG 2007 and ISA 2006 to provide the
strongest application-level security available. We enhance these great products
with additional software technologies, like those from Winfrasoft Corporation,
to boost the application value, and round this off with our advanced appliance
management technologies," Oldham said. "Today our focus is on strong, turn-key
security appliances that make deployment, and particularly ongoing management,
simple and efficient." 

Portcullis Solutions incorporate their PSAM (Portcullis Systems Appliance
Management) on each appliance to manage hardware and software alerts, enable
full patch management, provide detailed status reporting, reduce support time to
resolution with Virtual Engineer, Remote Support Access and add full backup and
restore capabilities. 

"We believe support is critical to the long-term relationships we build with our
customers," Oldham continued. "We provide 24 x 7 x 365 call center and email
support with a guaranteed callback within one hour. In addition, we can provide
our customers with up to 4-hour onsite hardware support services for our
products around the world." 

The Portcullis Systems Secure Remote Access Gateway appliances enable customers
to eliminate client-based VPN access by creating secure portals as the external
interface to their internal networks. This enables any device with a web browser
to establish secure access to applications using the SSL technology included in
every web browser. Remote access is controlled for each user based on the
organization`s security policies and the security posture of the user`s device.
This enables access to be dynamically adjusted for users operating endpoints,
including PCs, laptops, PDAs, and Internet kiosks.

&lt;p&gt;F5`s Application Ready Solutions Designed for Use with Microsoft Technologies
Accelerate the Market`s Fastest Growing Communications and Collaboration Tools,
Increasing Performance, Cutting Cost, and Improving Employee Productivity
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV), the global leader in Application Delivery
Networking, today announced a significant milestone in optimizing the delivery
of Microsoft Corp. unified communications and collaboration solutions. During
2008 more than 1,200 enterprise organizations deployed F5 Application Ready
Solutions for Microsoft technologies, including Microsoft Office SharePoint
Server 2007, Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, Microsoft Office Communications
Server 2007, and Windows Server 2008. Representing a wide variety of industries,
including government, healthcare, telecommunications, finance, manufacturing,
retail, non-profit, and transportation, these 1,200+ customers are using F5`s
suite of application delivery products to enhance the security, availability,
and performance of their Microsoft unified communications applications. 

"F5`s Application Ready Solutions provide deployment and optimization guidance
to help Microsoft customers get more from their application delivery
environments," said Greg Kirchoff, Director Global ISV Team, Microsoft. "By
taking a holistic view of applications and the network, and through
comprehensive interoperability testing with Microsoft solutions, F5 technologies
enable joint customers to configure their IT infrastructures to support their
unique business objectives." 

F5`s suite of application delivery products helps simplify infrastructure
management, reduce costs, and increase the ROI for Microsoft unified
communications deployments. F5 provides validated, documented solutions
specifically tailored to optimize the end-to-end performance, availability, and
scalability of individual Microsoft applications. With F5 Application Ready
Solutions, customers can quickly and efficiently deploy F5 and Microsoft
technologies in concert to achieve optimum network and application performance. 

"Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 is a critical business communication tool for
us," said Craig Wheeler, Director of Systems Development and Information
Services at Marine Resources Group, a Seattle-based holding and support company
that invests in tug, barge, and ancillary marine service companies. "With F5`s
Application Ready Solution for Exchange, we were able to cost-effectively add
advanced application delivery capabilities and immediate server failover for our
Exchange Server 2007 deployment. F5`s expertise with Microsoft solutions allowed
our technical team to move forward with confidence, and our users will benefit
from improved performance and application resiliency." 

Optimizing Office SharePoint Server 2007 with the F5 Application Ready Solution

An increasing number of global F5 customers are reporting significant
performance optimizations when pairing Office SharePoint Server 2007 with the F5
Application Ready Solution. 

"We made a significant investment in Office SharePoint Server 2007, and in
reviewing the market`s offerings, it became obvious that F5 had the best
collaboratively derived solution for optimizing Office SharePoint Server 2007
performance," said Hillol Nath, Network &amp; Security Architect at DP World, a
leader in international marine terminal operations and development, logistics,
and related services. "If employees were to experience poor performance with an
enterprise application like Office SharePoint Server 2007, user abandonment
would be high. F5`s Application Ready Solution ensures that we get top
performance from Office SharePoint Server 2007 so our employees can take full
advantage of a collaborative environment." 

Key benefits of deploying the F5 Application Ready Solution with Office
SharePoint Server 2007 include:

* 5x acceleration of Office SharePoint Server 2007 performance 
* 20-30x bandwidth reduction for remote Office SharePoint Server 2007 users 
* Over 25% server capacity increases with SSL and compression offload 
* 33% reduction in application deployment time

"We chose F5 because we wanted to be sure of compatibility between Microsoft
solutions and our application delivery infrastructure," said Jeremy Cointin,
Senior Network and Security Analyst at Rotary International, an Illinois-based
humanitarian service organization supporting more than 33,000 clubs in
approximately 200 countries and geographical areas. "After a thorough evaluation
process, we found that F5 devices enable us to perform server maintenance while
ensuring the vital website uptime our global users depend on. In addition, by
using the F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager&#8482; Application Delivery Controller to
increase the processing power of our web servers, we`re now able to redirect
those funds to other IT initiatives." 

"As organizations build out their infrastructures to meet the changing needs of
their business, they frequently deploy Microsoft`s unified communications
technologies to increase collaboration," said Jim Ritchings, VP of Business
Development at F5. "With Application Ready Solutions, customers can more
confidently introduce new applications-and optimize the performance of those
applications-to improve business agility."

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects speaker's title)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Feb 16 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil
(XOM.N) remains in talks with Russian gas export monopoly
Gazprom (GAZP.MM) about the possible export of gas from Exxon's
Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in east Russia, a senior
executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to talk to them about the potential for
exports," Russell Bellis, Exploration director for Europe,
Russia and North Africa told reporters at the sidelines of the
International Petroleum Week conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon believes it is entitled to export gas at world rates
under its contract with the government but Gazprom wants the
project to sell its gas to Gazprom at a lower, local price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's partners in Sakhalin-1 include Russia's Rosneft
(ROSN.MM) and India's ONGC (ONGC.BO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bellis added that Exxon, which has operations in Libya, was
not worried about recent comments by the Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi threatening possible nationalisation of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bellis said he had "No concerns," about such an outcome.
Other oil executives have also dismissed the threats and
analysts believe the Libyan leadership is simply trying to
extract better terms from oil companies in contract
negotiations.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Buy Durect Shares Up to $5

Durect Corp. (NASDAQ: DRRX) utilizes 6 proprietary drug delivery technologies to
develop pharmaceutical systems that enhance treatment capabilities in the areas
of chronic pain, cardiovascular diseases and central nervous system disorders.
The company received disappointing news when its lead pipeline candidate,
Remoxy, failed to receive FDA approval in December 2008. 

While this news is a setback for the company, we believe that the product will
ultimately receive approval and should see significant demand due to its ability
to reduce the potential of drug abuse / misuse. Meanwhile, we remain optimistic
on the remaining candidates in Durect's pipeline which consists of three
candidates in phase II development. 

Moreover, we were pleased to hear about Durect's partnership deal with King
(Alpharma [NYSE: ALO]) for Eladur. In our opinion, the current share price
represents an attractive entry point. We thus rate the shares a Buy with a price
target of $5. 

Journal Comms Cuts Dividend

Journal Communications, Inc. (NYSE: JRN) reported 4Q08 financial results that
were in line with the company`s guidance provided in December with its
announcement of November revenues. As the economy sinks, the fall in revenues is
accelerating, some of which may be lost forever to other forms of media. 

To reflect this permanent impairment, the company wrote-off nearly all of its
goodwill. The company cannot cut costs and capital spending fast enough to keep
pace with falling revenue, and announced a 75% cut in its dividend. 

Alexion a One-Drug Wonder

Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) reported 4th quarter financial
results yesterday. 

Soliris sales came in at $77.4 million, up 128.6% year over year, and 8.7%
sequentially. However, 4th quarter sales of Soliris were $3.6 million short of
our estimate of $81 million. 

The company achieved profitability in a 3rd quarter in a row based on strong
Soliris sales. Adjusted net income was $15.3 million, with diluted earnings per
share (EPS) of $0.17. Excluding share based expenses, Alexion achieved a net
income of $21.1 million, or EPS of $0.23 in 4Q08. However, 4th quarter net
income and EPS were less than our estimate of $16.9 million and $0.19 per share.


Another problem which Alexion is struggling with at the moment is the lack of
any visible pipeline products. The company suffered a major blow when Procter &amp;
Gamble (NYSE: PG) terminated the commercialization and development agreement for
the company`s phase III candidate, Pexelizumab, in 2007.

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Die Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) hat heute bekannt gegeben, dass die
Zug&#228;nge zu den nachgewiesenen Reserven im Jahr 2008 insgesamt 1,5 Milliarden
Barrel &#214;leinheiten ausmachten und somit 103 Prozent der F&#246;rdermengen ersetzten.
Ohne Einrechnung der Auswirkungen durch Abg&#228;nge aus Verk&#228;ufen ersetzten die
Reservenzug&#228;nge 110 Prozent der F&#246;rdermengen. Diese Zug&#228;nge basieren auf der
langfristigen Preisbasis, die das Unternehmen f&#252;r seine Anlageentscheidungen
zugrunde legt, und nicht auf dem Tagespreis am Ende des Gesch&#228;ftsjahres. 

&#8222;ExxonMobil erneuert seine F&#246;rdermengen weiterhin durch qualitativ hochwertige
zus&#228;tzliche Reserven und hat im Laufe der letzten 10 Jahre durchschnittlich 110
Prozent der F&#246;rdermengen ersetzt", sagte Rex W. Tillerson, Chairman und Chief
Executive Officer. &#8222;Diese solide Leistung spiegelt wider, dass unsere
strategischen Schwerpunkte bei der Erfassung neuer Ressourcen, der
disziplinierten Herangehensweise an Investitionen und herausragender
Projektabwicklung liegen." 

&#8222;Wir betrachten die Ressourcenentwicklung langfristig und investieren w&#228;hrend
des gesamten Rohstoffpreiszyklus. Die neuen Reserven stellen sicher, dass
ExxonMobil weiterhin neue Energiequellen erschlie&#223;en wird, die entscheidend f&#252;r
die zuk&#252;nftige Deckung des wachsenden weltweiten Bedarfs sein werden." 

Der j&#228;hrliche Bericht &#252;ber die nachgewiesenen Reserven ist das Ergebnis des seit
langem von dem Unternehmen angewandten rigorosen Prozesses, der die Kontinuit&#228;t
und die Verantwortung des Managements in Bezug auf alle Belegungen von Reserven
gew&#228;hrleistet. 

Die Reservenzug&#228;nge des Unternehmens im Jahr 2008 spiegeln sowohl neue
Erschlie&#223;ungen mit erheblichen Finanzierungsverpflichtungen als auch &#196;nderungen
und Erg&#228;nzungen bei bestehenden Feldern durch Bohrungen, Untersuchungen und
Analysen der Reservoirleistungen wider. Zus&#228;tzliche Reserven aus Phase 1 des
Kearl &#214;lsand-Projektes in Kanada machten insgesamt 1,1 Milliarden Barrel
&#214;leinheiten aus. Nachgewiesene Zug&#228;nge konnten auch in verschiedenen anderen
L&#228;ndern, wie den Vereinigten Staaten, Norwegen, Nigeria, Angola und Australien,
verbucht werden. Die Abg&#228;nge durch Verk&#228;ufe minderten die nachgewiesenen
Reserven 2008 um 0,1 Milliarden Barrel &#214;leinheiten. 

Auf Basis der Fl&#252;ssigkeiten- und Erdgaspreise vom 31. Dezember lag die
Erneuerung der nachgewiesenen Reserven im Jahr 2008 bei 2,0 Milliarden Barrel
&#214;leinheiten, was bei Einrechnung der Auswirkungen von Abg&#228;ngen durch Verk&#228;ufe
eine Erneuerungsrate von 136 Prozent der F&#246;rdermenge ausmacht. Die Preise eines
einzelnen Tages werden jedoch nicht in Betracht gezogen, wenn das Unternehmen
langfristige Investitionsentscheidungen trifft. Die j&#228;hrlichen Abweichungen bei
den Reserven auf Basis der Preise am Gesch&#228;ftsjahresende sind nicht in
&#220;bereinstimmung mit den tats&#228;chlichen Gesch&#228;ftspraktiken des Unternehmens. 

Langfristige Aussichten

Bei dem langfristigen Charakter der Branche und dem bedeutenden Umfang der
einzelnen Projekte, die einen wesentlichen Teil der Reservenzug&#228;nge des
Unternehmens ausmachen, ist bei Entscheidungen ein l&#228;ngerer Zeithorizont als ein
Jahr angemessen. Ohne Einrechnung der Auswirkungen der Tagespreise am Ende des
Gesch&#228;ftsjahres betrug die durchschnittliche Erneuerungsrate des Unternehmens
w&#228;hrend der letzten zehn Jahre 110 Prozent, wobei die Fl&#252;ssigkeitenerneuerung
bei 103 Prozent und die Gaserneuerung bei 119 Prozent lagen. W&#228;hrend der letzten
15 Jahre haben unsere Reservenzug&#228;nge unsere F&#246;rdermengen &#252;bertroffen. 

Die in diesem Zeitraum zus&#228;tzlich erworbenen Reserven erstrecken sich &#252;ber die
verschiedensten Arten von Ressourcen und ein breites geografisches Spektrum.
Ende 2008 erh&#246;hten sich die nachgewiesenen Reserven von ExxonMobil auf 22,8
Milliarden Barrel &#214;leinheiten, die sich etwa gleichberechtigt in Fl&#252;ssigkeiten
und Gase aufteilen. Die Reserven von ExxonMobil werden bei den aktuellen
F&#246;rderraten noch 15,3 Jahre halten. Der Anteil der bereits erschlossenen
nachgewiesenen Reserven betr&#228;gt 62 Prozent. 

Branchenf&#252;hrende Ressourcenmasse

ExxonMobil hat seine Ressourcenmasse 2008 um 2,2 Milliarden Barrel &#214;leinheit
erh&#246;ht, wobei die meisten Zug&#228;nge in Kanada, auf dem Festland der Vereinigten
Staaten, in der Tiefsee des Golfs von Mexiko und in Westafrika zu verzeichnen
waren. Die Gesamtmenge der Ressourcen des Unternehmens stieg, unter
Einberechnung der F&#246;rderung von &#196;nderungen bei den bereits entdeckten Reserven
und von Abg&#228;ngen durch Verk&#228;ufe, um 0,3 Milliarden Barrel &#214;leinheiten auf 72,4
Milliarden Barrel &#214;leinheiten. Diese Zahl beinhaltet auch die Auswirkungen der
erh&#246;hten Regierungsabgaben, wodurch sich die Ressourcenmasse 2008 um 0,5
Milliarden Barrel &#214;leinheiten reduzierte. Die Ressourcenmasse umfasst die
nachgewiesenen und wahrscheinlichen Reserven sowie auch entdeckte Ressourcen,
die voraussichtlich noch erschlossen werden. 

RECHTLICHER HINWEIS: Die Begriffe &#8222;Ressourcen" und &#8222;Ressourcenmasse" umfassen
die Menge des bereits entdeckten, aber noch nicht als nachgewiesene Reserven
klassifizierten &#214;l- und Gasvorkommen, die voraussichtlich zuk&#252;nftig noch
erschlossen werden. Soweit er in dieser Pressemitteilung verwendet wird,
beinhaltet der Begriff &#8222;Reserven" die nachgewiesenen Reserven aus
&#214;lsand-Arbeiten in Kanada, die derzeit in unseren Berichten an die
US-B&#246;rsenaufsichtsbeh&#246;rde SEC separat als Gewinnungsarbeiten aufgef&#252;hrt werden.
[Gem&#228;&#223; &#196;nderungen der SEC-Regularien, die voraussichtlich am 1. Januar 2010 in
Kraft treten werden, werden &#214;lsand-Reserven nicht mehr separat ausgewiesen.] Die
in dieser Pressemitteilung genannten Reserven stellten die Gesamtsumme der
Reserven sowohl der Konzerntochtergesellschaften als auch unserer Anteile an
Beteiligungsgesellschaften dar. Das Unternehmen wendet die gleichen
Gesch&#228;ftsauffassungen auf die Reserven von Beteiligungsgesellschaften wie auf
die Reserven von Konzerntochtergesellschaften an.

&lt;p&gt;MINAS, Indonesia Feb 17 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
will decide whether to move to the final design of the
deepwater Kutai Basin natural gas project off Indonesia's East
Kalimantan province by year-end, the U.S. major oil firm said
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Gehem and Gendalo natural gas projects in the Makassar
Strait would be the deepest offshore gas fields in Indonesia,
at water depths ranging from 2,500 to 6,000 feet (760-1,800
metres).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, Indonesia's biggest oil producer, had said it
planned to invest about $6 billion to develop gas fields off
the island of Borneo, including the Gehem and Gendalo projects,
which would help Indonesia crank up its flagging gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'll be entering FEED (front-end engineering and design)
likely early next year," Steve Green, managing director of the
IndoAsia unit of Chevron told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Green said it could then take 12-14 months to look at bids
for the work before making a final investment decision,
probably in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said last month it was reviewing its business plans
in Indonesia but was committed to Kutai, in Borneo's East
Kalimantan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's too early to speculate on the economics of the
project until we nail down the design, cost of the project",
Green said during a ceremony at the Minas oilfield in Sumatra
island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said the project had
agreed to supply up to 25 percent of gas to domestic users,
which could provide 0.7-0.8 million tonnes of LNG a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil companies throughout the world have been re-evaluating
energy developments given a collapse in oil prices, which has
made some projects uneconomic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deepwater projects are particularly expensive to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An official for energy watchdog BPMIGAS had said there was
no proposal to review the Makassar Strait project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combined natural gas reserves in the area covered by
the plan are estimated at more than 3 trillion cubic feet
(tcf).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, which has far more gas than oil, has pushed
companies to move faster in developing areas as the country
badly needs the gas for domestic industries and exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron currently produces gas from several other fields in
East Kalimantan, but the output is in decline.

&lt;p&gt; * Reorganization includes unknown number of job cuts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Imagineering, operations for U.S. parks consolidated
 (Recasts first paragraph; adds more background, share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said on
Wednesday it will streamline some behind-the-scenes operations,
including menu planning and ride design, at its two U.S. theme
parks to try to offset the effects of the global economic
downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reorganization is effective immediately and will result in
new job cuts, but the company would not specify how many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The changes to non-consumer facing services follow cost
cutting measures across the company, including hundreds of jobs
cut at Disney's media networks and parks executive ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Parks Chairman Jay Rasulo said "economic realities"
required the company to focus and streamline its operations in a
way that "eliminates redundancies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rasulo said that parks division managers were reviewing their
operations and considering "appropriate changes" in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Disney's parks division reported a 24
percent drop in quarterly operating income and a 4 percent revenue
decline in part due to slowing consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new organization calls for Walt Disney Imagineering, the
parks' engineering and design teams, to be consolidated into a
single group that handles attractions for all parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also will create a single domestic group to handle
behind-the-scenes services such as maintenance, menu planning and
security, for Walt Disney World and Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Disney Parks and Resorts offered voluntary buyouts
to 600 parks executives at the U.S. parks to trim its
administrative costs as hotel bookings slipped at its parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company received "a satisfactory response" to that offer
but did not divulge the number of executive positions that would
be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares closed down 1.2 percent or 21 cents at $17.63 on
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Disney shares most
recently traded that low in mid-2003.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM),
released the following statement today about the Obama Administration`s plan to
help struggling homeowners: 

We believe that the plan announced today by President Obama is good and strong,
comprehensive and thoughtful. I think it will be successful in modifying
mortgages in a way that`s good for homeowners. 

We applaud:

* The focus on making monthly payments affordable for borrowers 
* The creation of uniform national standards for mortgage modification to
provide consistent and fair treatment of customers across the industry. That
standard will include the common-sense application of full income and debt
verification 
* The partnership with government to reduce interest rates - and payments -- for
borrowers 
* The expanded ability of borrowers to take advantage of today`s lower rates
through refinancing 
* The inclusion of financially distressed borrowers even before they are
delinquent 
* The use of counseling for borrowers with the highest debt ratios

We look forward to working with the administration, Congress, the agencies and
other interested parties in implementing these initiatives to help families -
and the U.S. economy.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) may modify more than the 600,000 mortgages it has already singled out for restructuring, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and other major banks have announced plans to modify loans as unemployment has risen in recent months, heightening concern that more borrowers may start to miss payments on their mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's bank has agreed to renegotiate $70 billion in mortgages since October, in addition to $40 billion it modified since early 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
may modify more than the 600,000 mortgages it has already
singled out for restructuring, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told
CNBC in an interview on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and other major banks have announced plans to
modify loans as unemployment has risen in recent months,
heightening concern that more borrowers may start to miss
payments on their mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon's bank has agreed to renegotiate $70 billion in
mortgages since October, in addition to $40 billion it modified
since early 2007. He told CNBC the bank had expected to
renegotiate about 600,000 loans but that number may rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I wouldn't be surprised if that number was a million
because of new programs and incentives both to the homeowner
and to servicers of the mortgages," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon was on CNBC discussing President Barack Obama's
housing plan, which he described as "elegant" and
"well-designed."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A coalition of U.S. investors put companies including Exxon Mobil Corp and coal miner Massey Energy Co on a "Climate Watch" list on Wednesday, claiming the long-term competitiveness of the firms could be hurt by their lack of action on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For a company in a major emitting sector ... to not be thinking about how they are going to address a regulated environment creates red flags for investors," Mindy Lubber, the president of Ceres, a Boston-based coalition of investors and environmentalists, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lubber said the companies have lagged in taking action on climate change even though U.S. President Barack Obama plans to regulate emissions of gases blamed for warming the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Companies that miss this trend will be setting themselves up to fail in the 21st century low-carbon economy," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceres, whose institutional investors associated with the Climate Watch report manage a total of $1.9 trillion in assets, said the companies lag behind their peers who have taken actions including moving into alternative energy markets like wind and solar power or assessing their climate change risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceres said Exxon Mobil Corp has been "unresponsive to investor requests for a decade," on strategies on growing demand for diversified clean energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon spokesman Chris Welberry said in a email, "We reject this criticism," and that the company has led in energy efficiency investments to reduce emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceres put Massey Energy on the list, saying it had resisted shareholder resolutions requesting the company develop and disclose a strategy for responding to climate change. The company did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors at Ceres, which also directs the Investor Network on Climate Risk, a group of 75 institutional investors including the California State Teachers Retirement System, and financial firms focused on the business impacts of climate change, have filed 63 global warming resolutions with the nine companies on the climate list, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAR SANDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also targeted companies investing in Canada's tar sands, including Chevron Corp, which owns part of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, and Canadian Natural Resources, one of the largest producers in oil sands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberta's oil sands rival Saudi Arabia's conventional oil reserves in size, but environmentalists say mining and processing them releases huge amounts of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Obama visits Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper in Ottawa on Thursday, energy will be a key topic in the talks.

&lt;p&gt;  BIRCH RUN, MI, Feb 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walther Farms, the potato farming giant that started with a few acres of
vegetables in the 1940s, will sell approximately 784 acres -- including
the family's original farm property -- at auction Monday, March 16, as a
result of the family's increasing focus on the potato business. Schrader
Auction Company, of Columbia City, Ind., will manage the sale.

    "Grandma and Grandpa always believed in putting the land to its best
possible use, and we're following the same strategy by putting this
excellent land in the hands of people whose focus is on crops such as
sugar beets, soybeans, corn and wheat, for which the soil types are best
suited," said Jason Walther, president of Walther Farms.

    The sale will include seven farms between Saginaw and Flint, Mich.,
largely made up of high-quality farmland, according to Ed Boyer, who is
managing the project for Schrader. The land is well tiled and irrigated,
ensuring productivity during wet and dry periods, Boyer said.

    The sale also includes several sites suited for commercial, recreational
and development, as well as for building. The property also has six Valley
Center Pivot irrigators.

    "This land will sell in 27 different tracts, ranging from approximately
1.2 acres to approximately 228 acres. Bidders will have the opportunity to
purchase individual tracts as well as combinations of tracts, so there
will be opportunities for large and small buyers alike," said Boyer.

    Walther, whose firm was named Frito-Lay's National Potato Supplier of the
Year in 2008, has extensive operations in Michigan, Georgia, Florida,
Illinois, Indiana and Mexico, but the family's roots are in the Birch Run
area, where the family started as hobby farmers growing vegetables.

    Individuals seeking additional information about the sale may contact
Boyer at 269 641-7683 or visit Schrader's web site at

     Schrader Auction Company, headquartered in Columbia City, Ind., is one of
the nation's leading auctioneers specializing in the sale of farmland,
timberland and farm equipment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) fell more than 2 percent to $83.95 on Wednesday after CNBC reported that several partners in the firm were forced to borrow "tens of millions" of dollars to cover massive margin calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A top U.S. regulator on Wednesday backed the idea of giving public company shareholders a so-called say on pay on executive compensation, a concept gaining momentum among investors and lawmakers amid the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comments by SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter, a Democrat, come as banks and other companies receiving federal bailout money have been ordered to give shareholders such voting power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These votes are nonbinding on companies but seen as sending a strong signal about shareholders' attitudes about companies' pay decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other companies, including Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), have said they would voluntarily adopt say-on-pay voting as Corporate America faces pressure from angry investors about the size of executive pay packages at a time when the economy is in turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say-on-pay measures "can help restore investor trust" and lead to "increased shareholder participation," Walter said in a speech at a corporate governance forum in New York sponsored by the Practising Law Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter is one of five SEC commissioners who make decisions on federal securities rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new SEC chairman, Mary Schapiro, has also said it is appropriate to allow shareholders to cast an advisory vote on executives' compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Schapiro, Walter also said on Wednesday the commission should revisit the thorny issue of proxy access, or giving stockholders an easier way to put forward their own nominees for corporate board seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe the commission should move forward with proxy access," she said, adding that she believed the commission needed to "carefully consider" a range of possibilities on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders already have the right to put forth board nominees by waging a proxy fight.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 18 (Reuters) - A top U.S. regulator on
Wednesday backed the idea of giving public company shareholders
a so-called say on pay on executive compensation, a concept
gaining momentum among investors and lawmakers amid the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The comments by SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter, a Democrat,
come as banks and other companies receiving federal bailout
money have been ordered to give shareholders such voting power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These votes are nonbinding on companies but seen as sending
a strong signal about shareholders' attitudes about companies'
pay decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some other companies, including Intel Corp (INTC.O) and
Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), have said they would voluntarily
adopt say-on-pay voting as Corporate America faces pressure from
angry investors about the size of executive pay packages at a
time when the economy is in turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Say-on-pay measures "can help restore investor trust" and
lead to "increased shareholder participation," Walter said in a
speech at a corporate governance forum in New York sponsored by
the Practising Law Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter is one of five SEC commissioners who make decisions
on federal securities rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new SEC chairman, Mary Schapiro, has also said it is
appropriate to allow shareholders to cast an advisory vote on
executives' compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Schapiro, Walter also said on Wednesday the commission
should revisit the thorny issue of proxy access, or giving
stockholders an easier way to put forward their own nominees for
corporate board seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I believe the commission should move forward with proxy
access," she said, adding that she believed the commission
needed to "carefully consider" a range of possibilities on the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders already have the right to put forth board
nominees by waging a proxy fight. However, that route is
considered onerous and expensive, and shareholder advocates say
the SEC should allow investors to place their nominees for board
elections on the company's annual proxy document instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Business groups counter that such an idea only serves
activists who may not have a company's best interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter also said she wanted to see more disclosure from
companies in board election materials distributed to
shareholders about a nominee's qualifications to serve on the
board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, companies typically only list a nominee's
biography. It would be better, Walter said, if companies were
required to explain why they believe that director nominee would
"add value" the the company.

PLANVIEW INTRODUCES PLANVIEW OPENSUITE FOR IBM RATIONAL CLEARQUEST

Market`s Only Off-the-Shelf Portfolio Management Integration with IBM Rational
ClearQuest Creates a Unified View of All Development Work for Application
Development Organizations

Planview, a leading independent provider of enterprise-wide portfolio management
solutions, today introduced Planview OpenSuite for IBM Rational ClearQuest. The
newest addition to its Planview OpenSuite product line, this off-the-shelf
integration ties portfolio management to one of the market`s leading ALM
solutions. 

This offering is designed for IT organizations that want the benefits of one
consolidated view into project, maintenance, and resource reporting. This
enables them to better balance innovation and maintenance work, the demand
pipelines for which historically reside in separate issue tracking systems and
project systems. 

"By delivering one view into change requests and demand, development
organizations have the potential to boost productivity, improve prioritization,
make development more predictable, ease reporting, and shorten development
cycles, when coupled with strong process and organizational strategies," said
Melinda-Carol Ballou, program director, IDC. "In an increasingly volatile and
chaotic economy, resource constraints demand coordination of the demand pipeline
with effective prioritization to support application delivery." 

Planview OpenSuite for IBM Rational ClearQuest integrates approved innovation
and maintenance projects from Planview Enterprise Project Portfolio Management
with project-level tasks, bugs, and issues in IBM Rational ClearQuest to create
the unified view into development work these organizations demand. 

This integration delivers benefits for developers and leadership of product
organizations. Developers have one, centralized access point to all projects and
work to which they are assigned, eliminating misprioritized effort and wasted
time. Management can quickly communicate resource and project status and make
informed decisions by having an overall picture of project health, and can more
accurately plan for time spent on maintenance versus innovation work. 

Supporting the Planview OpenSuite vision of interoperability in heterogeneous
environments, Planview OpenSuite for IBM Rational ClearQuest enables customers
to leverage in-place technology investments while improving productivity.
Planview OpenSuite for IBM Rational ClearQuest represents the first of several
Planview OpenSuite ALM integrations, and will be available in Q1 2009.

&lt;p&gt;  DUSSELDORF, GERMANY and STUTTGART, GERMANY, Feb 18
(MARKET WIRE) --

&lt;p&gt;Time Chart Provides Composite Views of Past and Current Well Events
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
The Information Store&#174; (iStore) has expanded the capabilities of its PetroTrek&#174;
Toolkit of Web Parts and services with the introduction of Time Chart. This new
web visualization tool allows users running Microsoft&#174; Office SharePoint Server
2007 to access from a single location a wealth of production, operational, and
safety data and view relationships between past and current well events. By
making more data easily available and putting information in context, Time Chart
facilitates decision-making to help oil companies improve their operational
performance. 

With Time Chart technology, petroleum information workers are empowered with a
new level of data visualization. As a Web Part, Time Chart connects multiple
data sources through Web services, whether the data is stored locally or in a
database thousands of miles away. All data can be displayed together graphically
to form a composite view of information over any period of time. 

The Web Part solution, with its components that work together to enable
developers to create web pages for users to more easily access information,
provides an unprecedented ability to efficiently visualize well events. Among
these events are allocated production, annulus pressure, down time, choke size,
flowing and shut in pressures, reworks, recompletions, well treatments,
preventive maintenance, flow line temperature, attributed losses, well tests,
and production status. 

"Engineers and production managers truly light up when they see Time Chart,"
said Barry Irani, iStore`s president and CEO. "Users are excited about improved
data access, but the real benefit comes from seeing the data in context over
time, in ways that may never have occurred to them." 

Irani added, "We`ve taken away all the constraints of accessibility and
availability to give oil companies the freedom to create new ways of working
with information." 

The PetroTrek Toolkit is a collection of configurable Web Parts and services
specifically designed to meet the complex information needs of petroleum
engineers, geoscientists, and other members of an asset team. In addition to the
Time Chart, the Toolkit contains Web Parts for production decline curves, well
logs, field maps, KPI dials, well tests, directional surveys, graphs, and
tabular views of data. PetroTrek Toolkit Web Parts can be combined and
configured to quickly build production dashboards, operations reports, and
electronic well files. 

PetroTrek Toolkit Web Parts utilize Microsoft Silverlight technology to render a
graphically rich, highly interactive user experience. Users can pan, zoom, and
manipulate data as well as configure presentation elements from the Web Part.
And because the Web Parts use AJAX to stream data between browser and server,
users don`t have to wait for pages to reload to see changes take effect. 

"In order to stay productive, while being faced with a graying workforce and
increasingly difficult economic constraints, oil and gas teams need direct and
centralized access to a wealth of historic and current well data," said Craig
Hodges, U.S. energy industry solutions director at Microsoft. "Time Chart`s
integration with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and Microsoft
Silverlight enables PetroTrek users to more quickly find, use and share the
right information needed for well management in an engaging and collaborative
environment."

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA Feb 18 (Reuters) - After spending a month sewing the
beading on to her white satin gown, Russian student Emma Akopjan
is attending her first Vienna ball and hopes to forget the
economic downturn for just one magical night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The season is in full swing and showing few effects of the
crisis, with many of the city's 450 balls fully booked and
300,000 people attending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It does not depend upon whether it is a time of crisis or
not, balls were always in Vienna ... and you wish for just one
night which is a fairytale," said the 21-year old economics
student at the Moscow Ball in Vienna's neo-gothic city hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Moscow Ball is one of the newest additions and
highlights the Vienna season's international standing, with
dozens of young Russians like Akopjan flying in to make their
debut in a throw-back to a bygone era of imperial splendour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dancers twirl in gowns and black tails, or sip champagne and
listen to the orchestra at tables decorated with white roses and
scarlet amaryllis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Compared to last year's balls there is no difference.
People still like to have fun," said Roland Krupitza, out of
breath after dancing to Johann Strauss's "The Blue Danube".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Austria's economy declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 for
the first time in eight years and the downturn is just beginning
to make itself felt among the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Krupitza, 47, a tour operator, has seen a slowdown in
business but that did not deter him and hundreds of others from
dancing through the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are feeling the pinch in their wallets, but they
don't want to admit that something is happening ... they are
wearing blinkers, like horses," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUSINESS LEADERS AND POLITICANS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the balls are as well-attended as ever, Austria's
business leaders and politicians are keeping a low profile,
grappling with the fallout from the financial crisis which is
likely to spread as the quarterly earnings season approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Austrian companies such Voestalpine, a supplier to Europe's
car industry, have issued earnings warnings this year and
several banks are in talks with the government about drawing on
its rescue package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The only ball where you can tell the impact of the
financial crisis, a political impact, is the Opera Ball which
some politicians and chief executives have said they will not
attend," said Brigitte Jank, president of the Vienna Chamber of
Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Opera Ball on Feb 19, the high point of the season and
traditionally an event for high society to be seen, is shown
live on national television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ball is sold out, despite giddy prices ranging from 230
euros ($293.5) for a normal ticket to 17,000 euros for a box,
according to an official on the organising committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Company heads such as Telekom Austria's Boris Nemsic and
Raiffeisen Zentralbank's Walter Rothensteiner will not be
attending this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In times like these when you are talking to the government
about a capital injection, it just doesn't look very good to sit
there in public, sipping champagne at the Opera Ball," said a
banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Local politicians and organisers argue the show must go on
and the balls provide a stimulus to the economy, especially at
the start of the year when spending is sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For the whole season we are expecting a consumer investment
of 65 million euros, on average 215 euros per ball guest on the
tickets, clothes, shoes, hair, taxis, dinner before the ball
etc," said Jank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CITY'S BUSINESS CARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eva Dintsis, an organiser of the Opera Ball, said it would
be counterproductive to cancel or shun the usual festivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some 40 companies start work on the ball four months in
advance for the carpets, wallpaper, renovation ... and there is
an incredible number of people working at the ball itself,
caterers, musicians, etc," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Austria's ball tradition is proving a popular export, with
Viennese balls established in cities such as Johannesburg and
New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see Vienna balls as a form of business card for the
city," said Renate Brauner, deputy mayor of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We sometimes combine them with economic presentations, and
try to present Vienna as a tourist destination ... it is a
romantic and very Viennese way to present our city."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For most Viennese, however, the balls are a long-held
tradition, one they are not likely to forgo in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For us Austrians, it goes without saying that your wardrobe
includes black tie, tail coat or ball gown ... and that you
attend a dance school," said Renate Danler, managing director of
the Hofburg Palace, which is hosting 17 balls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danler, 50, herself a keen dancer, said Viennese would
rather spend less on other things than miss out on their beloved
balls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The last luxury the Viennese would give up would be their
balls, said Christian Rainer, 47, editor of Austrian weekly
magazine profil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Viennese would spend their last cent on balls because
it is the nucleus of Viennese social life ... we would dance
into disaster."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and HUNTSVILLE, AL, Feb 18 (MARKET WIRE) --

IBM (NYSE: IBM) and International Broadband Electric Communications, Inc.
(IBEC) -- an Internet Service Provider -- today announced they have begun
to establish Broadband over Power Line (BPL) networks for nearly 200,000
rural customers served by 7 electrical cooperatives in Alabama, Indiana,
Michigan and Virginia.

    Funded by low-interest Rural Broadband Access Loans from the United States
Department of Agriculture Rural Development Program, IBEC aims to bring
broadband Internet access to rural communities via existing power line
infrastructure. IBM, the first major systems integrator to enter this
market, is providing overall technical expertise, project management, and
training of the line crews who are installing the BPL technology.

    How it works: Broadband over power line technology modifies radio signals
to transmit voice and Internet data over electric utility power lines. All
a consumer needs is a modem that plugs into existing electrical outlets in
their home or business. With no new wires to install, setup is simple and
easy. Learn more from Cullman Electric CEO Grady Smith: "Broadband Over
Powerlines - Rural America's Key to Tomorrow's Broadband Services."

    "In the near-term, IBM and IBEC's effort promises to bring broadband
access to the scores of the nearly 45 percent of Americans that do not
have it today," said Raymond Blair, Director of Advanced Networks at IBM.
"In the long-term, the effort will lead to the expansion of small
businesses and creation of new industries, bringing new jobs to rural
Americans and driving net new economic growth."

    "While DSL and Cable modem service providers are competing head-to-head
in many urban areas, neither is feasible in low density, underserved
areas (both rural and urban), where DSL requires significant telephone
network upgrades, and cable data is not economically viable," said Scott
Lee, CEO of IBEC. "The only broadband choice for many consumers in rural
areas is satellite data service, which does not offer comparable data
rates and is more costly than wire line services."

    IBM and IBEC, with the aid of government funding, are building broadband
over power line networks in cooperation with member-owned electric utility
co-ops across the nation. The first seven co-ops to participate include:
Cullman Electric Cooperative in Alabama; Utilities District of Western
Indiana REMC, Parke Country REMC and South Central REMC in Indiana;
Midwest Energy Cooperative in Michigan; and BARC Electric Cooperative and
Central Virginia Electric Cooperative in Virginia. These are just seven
of nearly 900 electric cooperatives in the United States providing 45% of
the total electric grid and covering 75% of the land mass in the U.S.

    Bob Hance, CEO of Midwest Energy Cooperative in Michigan led an effort to
survey the Midwest's customers to determine if there was interest in
broadband Internet services. Within a week, the cooperative had a waiting
list of 4,000 customers practically pleading for service. "We were amazed
by the responses to the survey -- thousands of letters from citizens of
our community expressing their need for broadband in order to improve
everything from childhood education to the future of their family-owned
small businesses," said Hance. "We shared nearly 600 of these letters with
local legislators after we realized none of the major service providers
were going to answer their calls for help. Thanks to the help of those
legislators, IBM and IBEC were able to access the resources needed to help
our community. In less than two weeks, we've already deployed 400 live
miles with broadband access, or nearly 4,000 homes."

    Grady Smith, CEO of Cullman Electric Cooperative in Alabama believes BPL
technology can do for rural America today what the Rural Electric
Administration (REA) did for it in the 1930s. Cullman has 1,600 homes
wired for BPL technology thus far, and expects to pass nearly 7,000 homes
by the end of February. "Today, instead of electricity, it is broadband
service that is on course to change our lives. I do not believe it is an
exaggeration to say that broadband service is the single most important
technological issue of this generation, and that it will have the
greatest impact on society since basic electricity and telephone service."

    Bruce King, CEO of BARC Electric Cooperative in Virginia is looking
forward to bringing broadband access to his community of 11,000
households and small businesses in the coming months. "I cannot go to
church or rotary club meetings on the weekend without someone in the
community asking me when we'll have high speed Internet access. Our
members are orphans in the Internet world," said King. "I'm proud to be
able to tell our members that it will only take us 1 percent of the money
we invested in the electric system to begin with to enable it for
broadband. I am a financial guy, and that is an overwhelming reason to do
it."

&lt;p&gt;Market`s Only Off-the-shelf Portfolio Management Integration with a Leading
Lifecycle Management (ALM) Environment Creates a Unified View of All Development
Work for Application Development Organizations
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Planview, the leading independent provider of enterprise-wide portfolio
management solutions, today introduced Planview OpenSuite for IBM Rational
ClearQuest. The newest addition to the Planview OpenSuite product line, this is
the industry`s first off-the-shelf integration that ties portfolio management to
one of the market`s leading ALM solutions. 

This offering is designed for IT organizations that want the benefits of one
consolidated view into project, maintenance, and resource reporting. This
enables them to better balance innovation and maintenance work, the demand
pipelines for which historically reside in separate issue tracking systems and
project systems. 

"By delivering one view into demand, this new OpenSuite offering enables
development organizations to boost productivity, improve prioritization, make
development more predictable, ease reporting, and shorten development cycles,"
said Patrick Tickle, executive vice president of products, Planview. 

Planview OpenSuite for IBM Rational ClearQuest integrates approved innovation
and maintenance projects from Planview Enterprise Project Portfolio Management
with project-level tasks, bugs, and issues in IBM Rational ClearQuest to create
the unified view into development work these organizations demand. 

This integration delivers benefits for developers and leadership of product
organizations. Developers have one, centralized access point to all projects and
work to which they are assigned, eliminating misprioritized effort and wasted
time. Management can quickly communicate resource and project status and make
informed decisions by having an overall picture of project health, and can more
accurately plan for time spent on maintenance versus innovation work. 

Supporting the Planview OpenSuite vision of interoperability in heterogeneous
environments, Planview OpenSuite for IBM Rational ClearQuest enables customers
to leverage in-place technology investments while improving productivity.
Planview OpenSuite for IBM Rational ClearQuest represents the first of several
Planview OpenSuite ALM integrations, and will be available in Q1 2009.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

January Video Game Sales Up

Late last week, the NPD Group reported video game sales for the month of
January. Hardware sales increased 17% year-on-year. Driving those sales were the
Nintendo Wii with 670,000 consoles, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Xbox 360 with
390,000, and Sony`s (NYSE: SNE) Playstation 3 with 203,000. 

Accessories and software sales were strong as well with year-on-year growth of
11% and 10%, respectively. Nintendo owned most of the top spots in the software
sales. The Wii Fit, Wii Play, and Mario Kart were the top three sellers for the
month. Other titles in the top ten include Left 4 Dead (Xbox 360, Call of Duty:
World at War (Xbox 360), Guitar Hero World Tour (Wii). 

I think this data points to continued strength in video games even during
challenging economic times, and that will benefit video game retailer GameStop
(NYSE: GME), which we rate a Buy with a six-month target price of $34. 

Penn Virginia on Solid Ground

Penn Virginia Resource Partners (NYSE: PVR), like other master limited
partnerships (MLPs), is valued on different metrics than the typical publicly
traded corporation. The nature of an MLP is to distribute, to its unit holders,
a significant portion of cash generated from its operations each quarter. As
such, earnings per unit or price to earnings ratios have less significance. The
common and more appropriate valuation metrics are distributable cash flow, and
distribution yield. 

We are maintaining our Buy recommendation on PVR but decreasing our target price
from $25.00 per unit to $21.00 per unit. Although weak commodity prices will
likely impair frac margins in the partnership's midstream segment, growth in
throughput volumes and another year of favorable per-ton coal royalty prices
will help PVR grow operating income and distributable cash flow in '09. 

ATAI Getting Average Marks

Incorporated in 2006, ATA Inc. (NASDAQ: ATAI) is the leading provider of
computer-based testing services in China. The company offers its services for
the creation and delivery of computer-based tests based on its proprietary
testing technologies and test delivery platform. The Company also provides
career-oriented, test-based educational programs and test preparation solutions
in China. 

We maintain our Hold rating and price target on shares of ATAI following the
release of Q3 results. We believe that the delay in the implementation of a
testing contract with the Ministry of Culture provides a clear example of the
risk currently inherent in the company's business model.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks Avon Products (NYSE: AVP) as Bull of the Day and
Telmex (NYSE: TMX) as Bear of the Day. In addition, the analysts at Zacks Equity
Research discuss the latest on Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC)
and JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

Avon Products (NYSE: AVP) is benefiting from both the expansion into the
developing and emerging markets and its emphasis on the Beauty products
portfolio. Management aims to achieve high single-digit local currency revenue
growth supported by margin expansion over the long term. 

Over $200 million in costs savings have been achieved since 2002 by implementing
the multi-year supply chain cost reduction program. Management expects to
achieve cost savings of an additional $300 million in savings as the company
implements ERP in Europe and North America. 

Developing and emerging markets contribute over 50% of total sales. Management
expects the contribution to expand to 68% over the coming 10 years as
high-growth opportunities are pursued in developing markets. India, Central and
Eastern Europe, China, Russia, and Latin America are highlighted as high growth
areas. 

Bear of the Day

We are reiterating our Sell recommendation on Telmex (NYSE: TMX). The
competition in the Mexican market has been increasing, mainly from wireless
companies and VoIP providers. 

Telmex continues to experience endless price erosion. Fourth quarter 2008
results were weak and the current economic situation is not encouraging at all. 

The global credit crunch and the recession in the U.S. are a source of great
concern, since Mexico and the U.S. have strong economic ties. Lastly, Telmex`s
valuation seems excessive if compared to other Latin American operators. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

2 Goals of the Banking Bailout System

Since money is fungible [to be freely exchangeable], it is very hard to track
exactly what the banks did with exactly the dollars that the government injected
into them. However, we do know that they continued to spend money on a wide
variety of very wasteful things, such as billions in bonuses for mid- to
high-level executives (the C-level folks largely skipped their bonuses) and
expensive junkets for "employee recognition." Some of those were cancelled when
they came to light and the public was outraged. 

Others have been clamoring for regulatory forbearance and a suspension of the
mark-to-market rules for banks. Japan tried this, and it ended up with a bunch
of Zombie banks, still apparently alive but unable to really perform the
functions a modern economy needs its banks to perform. We also went down that
path with the S's in the 1980's and the problems simply got worse and worse,
and greatly increased the cost of the eventual bailout. 

However, that is not the worst thing about these proposals. They are proposing
that the banks be allowed to knowingly lie to investors about the condition of
the assets that they hold. There is a term for that, and the term is "securities
fraud." Why would anyone invest in a company where they knew that the books
belonged on the fiction shelf? We need more transparency in the banking system,
not to have it cloaked in secrecy like the most sensitive Pentagon projects. 

To my mind, the best approach is to do what the first round of the TARP did, but
do it right. That means that the government should get full value for its
investments in the banking system, just as if it were a private investor. For
$300 billion, at current market prices the government could own virtually the
entire U.S. banking system. No, that doesn't mean that it would own all 7,500
banks in the U.S. Most of the banks are too small to really matter. 

We have allowed a handful of "too big to fail" institutions to dominate most of
the banking system. If the Government were to inject capital worth the current
market capitalization of Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and JP
Morgan (NYSE: JPM), it would have a 50%+ stake (not counting its interest in the
banks from TARP 1.0) in all of them for a cost of $186.8 billion, which is
significantly less than it spent under TARP 1.0. To get to $300 billion, one
could also get most of the other substantial players in the financial system

&lt;p&gt; (Adds company comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria Feb 18 (Reuters) - Nigerian security
forces repelled an attack by gunmen on an Exxon Mobil (XOM.N)
housing compound in the Niger Delta state of Akwa Ibom, the
local unit of the U.S. energy giant said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The attack on the Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN) compound in
Eket, where security measures were reinforced in December
following a rise in violence in Akwa Ibom, took place at around
2200 GMT on Tuesday, security sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Government security forces successfully repelled
unidentified armed men in the vicinity of (MPN's) Eket compound
in Akwa Ibom state. During the incident, shots were fired," MPN
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No casualties have been reported."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The security sources said the shooting had lasted around 30
minutes but that the attackers had been repelled on the
waterways around the compound and had not got inside the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insecurity in the Niger Delta has largely focused on the
three main oil-producing states of Rivers, Delta and Bayelsa but
there have been a growing number of attacks in Akwa Ibom,
further east towards Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armed men attacked an Exxon oil platform off Akwa Ibom last
month, while in December gunmen attacked a convoy belonging to
Exxon's local unit MPN as it travelled towards the nearby Qua
Iboe oil terminal in an apparent failed kidnap attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND),
the region's main militant group, called off a 5-month-old
ceasefire at the end of January, warning of a "sweeping assault"
on Nigeria's oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group has not carried out any major strikes which have
had an impact on production since the end of the ceasefire, but
it has warned that kidnapping "high-value" U.S. and European oil
workers remains part of its strategy.

&lt;p&gt;PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria Feb 18 (Reuters) - Nigerian security forces repelled an attack by gunmen on an Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) housing compound in the Niger Delta state of Akwa Ibom, security sources said on Wednesday. The attack on the U.S. energy giant's compound in Eket, where security measures were reinforced in December following a rise in violence in Akwa Ibom, took place at around 2200 GMT on Tuesday, the sources said. The shooting lasted about 30 minutes ... All residents have been accounted for, one of the sources said, adding there were no civilian casualties. A second source said the attackers had been repelled on the waterways around the compound and had not got inside the site. Exxon Mobil officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Insecurity in the Niger Delta has largely focused on the three main oil-producing states of Rivers, Delta and Bayelsa but there have been a growing number of attacks in Akwa Ibom, further east towards Cameroon. Armed men attacked an Exxon oil platform off Akwa Ibom last month, while in December gunmen attacked a convoy belonging to Exxon's local unit MPN as it travelled towards the nearby Qua Iboe oil terminal in an apparent failed kidnap attempt. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), the region's main militant group, called off a 5-month-old ceasefire at the end of January, warning of a sweeping assault on Nigeria's oil and gas industry. The group has not carried out any major strikes which have impacted production since the end of the ceasefire, but it has warned that kidnapping high-value U.S. and European oil workers remains part of its strategy.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Hasbro will continue making toys for Marvel characters, and Lego will make building blocks based on Disney and Pixar properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Marvel deal announced Tuesday lengthens an existing relationship until 2017 and guarantees Marvel $100 million, with the potential for an additional $140 million depending on the popularity of toys based on such characters as Spider-Man, Iron Man, X-Men, Captain America and Thor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent Tuesday's deal, Hasbro might have ended its association with Marvel at the end of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multiyear deal between Disney and Lego begins with the release in 2010 of toys based on "Toy Story," "Cars" and "Prince of Persia: Sands of Time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasbro's deal with Marvel will help it maintain its edge over rival Mattel when it comes to toys based on films.

&lt;p&gt;GSMA Selects Visa as Provider for Mobile Money Transfer Solutions
BARCELONA, Spain--(Business Wire)--
Visa Europe and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), the world`s largest retail electronic
payments network1, today announced plans to work with the GSMA to advance the
delivery of mobile financial services around the world. 

As part of the continuing collaboration between the two organizations, the GSMA
has selected Visa as a provider for mobile money transfer solutions globally,
and is working to execute an agreement to formalize participation terms. Visa is
already a leading provider of money transfer solutions with active programs in
14 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. 

This announcement was made at the GSMA Mobile World Congress, the leading event
for the mobile communications industry, where Visa is showcasing a range of
mobile payment innovations. 

"By combining the world`s largest retail electronic payments network and the
world`s most popular wireless technology, we can take Visa beyond the card to
mobile handsets, a move that can help accelerate the deployment of mobile
payment services," said Elizabeth Buse, Global Head of Product for Visa Inc.
"Beyond growing our business, enabling money transfer and payments on mobile
handsets has the potential to make a profound difference in the lives of
hundreds of millions of people worldwide." 

Mariano Dima, EVP of Marketing at Visa Europe, stated: "Mobile phones are
lifestyle tools for a new generation of consumers in developing and developed
markets. The partnership between Visa and the GSMA is a clear signal that the
world is ready to embrace mobile financial services." 

A key aspect of the collaboration between Visa and GSMA will be the creation of
standards for mobile money transfer, mobile payments and related services. This
collaboration will allow carriers and financial institutions to deploy mobile
payments more rapidly and limit market fragmentation. Standardization also
benefits consumers by promoting interoperability among carriers and
institutions, ensuring a consistent and reliable experience and promoting faster
adoption of the technology. 

"The market is clearly ready for mobile payments and, importantly, the GSMA
believes that Visa is well positioned to help us drive the adoption of financial
services on mobile devices globally," said Bill Gajda, Chief Commercial Officer
for the GSM Association. "Visa`s comprehensive mobile strategy, its extensive
experience in enabling consumers to transfer funds across borders and
domestically, combined with its flexible approach, were deciding factors in our
selection of Visa as a provider for mobile money transfer solutions. We are
excited to advance our partnership with Visa to enable the delivery of these
services through the mobile channel." 

Ongoing Collaboration Delivers Results

Today`s announcement marks the latest development in the ongoing collaboration
between Visa and the GSMA. Recently, as part of the GSMA Pay-Buy-Mobile
initiative, Visa and several GSM mobile network operators launched mobile
payment trials in Canada, Switzerland, France and the UK, and completed
successful trials in Australia, Malaysia and Taiwan, which are all designed to
advance the development of mobile payments at the point of sale. Importantly,
many of these trials embed the Visa payment application into the SIM card
enabling Visa account holders to easily switch the application from one handset
to another. 

Covering more than a thousand test users and select merchants, all of these
trials demonstrated the ability to download and personalize payment software
over the air and make mobile payments using the same point of sale equipment
already in place at merchants to accept contactless card transactions. 

"Recent Visa programs conducted in partnership with GSM operators have enabled
us to refine the technology, security and processing requirements necessary to
make mobile payments a reality," said Buse. "Our experience has taught us that
consumers globally want access to secure, reliable and flexible payment options
that harness the power of mobile devices backed by the trust inherent in Visa`s
brand and network." 

Note to editors: Visa`s booth at the Mobile World Congress is in Hall 7 Stand
7B42, February 16-19, 2009. Visa mobile product demonstrations include:

* Visa Mobile on Android: In December, Visa launched the first commercial
service in the U.S. that bundles mobile offers, transaction alerts and a locator
service. Visa Mobile is available on mobile devices powered by Android,
including the T-Mobile G1 phone. 
* Mobile Visa payWave: Securemobile point of sale payments using Visa payWave
embedded in a mobile device. Visa will demonstrate both NFC-based and SIM-based
contactless payments. 
* Mobile Money Transfer: Demonstrations of money transfer between Visa accounts,
both handset-to-handset and online-to-handset. 
* Mobile Transaction Alerts: Near real-time notification of card purchase
activity delivered to the mobile device. 
* Mobile Offers: Targeted offers and coupons delivered directly to the mobile
device and redeemed at near-by merchants. 
* Mobile Merchant: Convenient cashless transactions on the move. Mobile
merchants, such as a pizza delivery service, can accept Visa payments with the
help of enhanced mobile handsets that double as a mobile acceptance device. 
* Smart Poster: Co-branded mobile posters, signposting nearby coffee shops with
the offer of exclusive mobile `buy one, get one free` offers.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. lawmakers criticized the United Arab Emirates on Thursday for not allowing Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer to compete at the Dubai Championships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democratic Representatives Shelley Berkley of Nevada and Eliot Engel of New York said the UAE should have granted Peer a visa despite concerns over security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we share concerns about security, it is unacceptable to refuse an athlete the access to play in a tournament hosted by your country," the lawmakers said in a letter to UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Host governments such as the UAE must do everything in their power to protect visitors, but denying them entry to the country at all is unacceptable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five days after Peer was denied a chance to compete at the $2 million tournament, Israeli Andy Ram was given special permission by UAE authorities to play in a men's tournament next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we are pleased that Andy Ram was ultimately allowed to enter the UAE, your government's decision to deny Ms. Peer entry undermines your nation's standing and could harm U.S.-UAE relations," said Berkley and Engel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As Congress considers the educational and energy partnerships between our two countries, we hope you will not repeat this unfortunate decision, and in the future will allow Israeli athletes and those of other peaceful nations entry into your country without bias."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Peter Cooney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates (UAE) will allow Israel's Andy Ram to play in the men's Dubai Championships next week, the state news agency WAM said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A UAE foreign ministry official was quoted as saying the doubles specialist would be given "special permission" to take part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This... does not politically imply any form of normalization with countries with which the UAE has no diplomatic relations," the official told WAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top Israeli player Shahar Peer had to forfeit her place in the women's tournament in Dubai this week after the UAE blocked her visa application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, on Thursday Women's Tennis Association (WTA) chief Larry Scott said he had been assured that all Israeli athletes would be given "a special permit" by the UAE government to enter the country if they have qualified for a tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We welcome the change of the UAE policy which will allow Andy Ram to play this week in Dubai and which clarifies that all Israeli athletes will be able to compete in future tournaments in UAE," Scott said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AN EXCUSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tournament officials defended the stance to exclude Peer, saying local fans would have boycotted the event if an Israeli was allowed to compete and that her safety could also have been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that people want to harm the (Israeli players) is simply an excuse," Ram's regular doubles partner Jonathan Erlich, who has been sidelined with an injury, told Israeli Army Radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As far as I'm concerned, they can surround the players with the entire army, the players need to be able to play."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UAE, like most Arab countries, has no diplomatic ties with Israel and routinely denies entry to its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions have been heightened after the three-week Israeli offensive against the Gaza Strip, which killed 1,300 Palestinians and 14 Israelis. Although the conflict ended in January it caused deep anger around the Arab and Muslim worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The refusal to issue a visa to Peer violated WTA Tour rules, which state any player should be able to compete where she wishes if she has the required ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After players, officials, Jewish leaders and even some sponsors condemned the UAE for excluding Peer, pressure mounted on the men's ATP tournament to be canceled if Ram was also denied entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am pleased that the UAE have today confirmed that I will be able to travel to their country next week to compete in the Dubai Tennis Championships," Ram said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a professional tennis player, I thrive on competing at the world's best events and next week will be no different."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIGHT DECISION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATP chief Adam Helfant added: "The UAE government has made the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No player, who qualifies to play an ATP World Tour event, should be denied their right to compete on the basis of ethnicity, nationality or religion and we are happy that the Dubai Tennis Championships and the UAE have shown that they share that view." If the ban on Israelis had persisted, tennis governing bodies warned future tournaments in Dubai could be scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the u-turn by UAE authorities on Thursday, Scott said the WTA would still take action against the women's tournament for barring Peer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shahar Peer is owed all of our thanks for her courage in challenging an unjust policy and for forcing action to be taken that resulted in today's announcement," Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is deeply regrettable that Shahar had to suffer the negative consequences of the UAE decision this past week in order for this policy to get turned around for the benefit of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What happened to Shahar last week was discriminatory, reprehensible and unacceptable, and the Tour will shortly be determining remedies for her, penalties to be imposed on the tournament, and the additional assurances we will require to guarantee all Israeli athletes entry to the UAE so that future tournaments in the UAE may take place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(additional reporting by Pritha Sarkar in London, editing by Tony Jimenez)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A U.S. federal court denied class action status to a lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) of misleading buyers about which computers could run expanded features that were part of the Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Judge Marsha Pechman of the U.S. District Court in Seattle allowed the suit to go forward on behalf of individual plaintiffs, according to court documents issued on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Microsoft authorized computer manufacturers to put a sticker on PCs indicating they were "Windows Vista Capable," meaning the then-current Windows XP operating system could upgraded to the Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs led by consumer Dianne Kelley said Microsoft's marketing campaign was misleading because a large number of these computers could only be upgraded to "Windows Home Basic," a version of Vista that lacks a number of features that the Premium version had. Those computers did not have a "Premium Ready" designation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the distinctions between the various versions of Vista were clear in its marketing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court ultimately ruled that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate that their claims were common to the entire class of consumers who bought computers marked with the "Windows Vista Capable" but without the "Premium Ready" label. But it also said the plaintiffs could continue their suit individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the court decertified the class today, it is careful to note that this ruling makes no comment on the merits" of the plaintiffs' claims, Pechman said in the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Dianne Kelley, et al. v.

&lt;p&gt;  AUSTIN, TX, Feb 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ManageEngine, makers of a globally renowned suite of cost effective
network, systems &amp; security management software solutions, today
announced the release of ADManager Plus version 4.3, enhancing the
popular Active Directory management and reporting solution by adding the
ability to easily create and modify multiple Active Directory Groups.

    Administrators use Active Directory groups to assign network and systems
access rights to multiple users simultaneously, as opposed to individually
configuring user accounts. Unfortunately, when using native Active
Directory tools, configuring groups and assigning various group attributes
becomes a complex procedure involving numerous steps. Furthermore, once
created, groups need to be maintained to ensure users have access to all
appropriate resources as the IT infrastructure evolves, while also
guarding against security vulnerabilities that may arise. As the number
of groups in the enterprise increases, so too does the management
complexity and risk for mistake.

    ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 4.3 centralizes and automates much of
this work across not just a single group, but now across multiple groups.
Through a single, central console, IT administrators can add (from a CSV
file) or remove multiple group members, define multiple attributes and
configure exchange attributes across multiple groups in the enterprise.
ADManager Plus also offers more than 100 reports out-of-the-box, including
security reporting, which allows administrators to analyze group
permission levels, an important part of network security assessments.

    "ADManager Plus has helped us identify the groups and group policy objects
that have not been used. We simply have to generate the reports to get all
these details," said Ronald Stoffels, Medewerker Server Cluster, Back
Office ICT Services. "Moreover I found ADManager Plus to be the best
amongst all the other tools I tested."

    "The new group management capabilities within ADManager Plus version 4.3
make this application even more valuable to IT administrators in the
larger enterprises," said Manikandan Thangaraj, product manager,
ADManager Plus. "We'll continue to provide management solutions that
simplify and secure the largest computing infrastructures, without
requiring customers to spend millions of dollars or take months to
install."

    ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 4.3 can be downloaded directly from
the website www.admanagerplus.com. A 30-day trial with full functionality
is available for evaluation. For further details on the product, customer
implementations, pricing and technical support, please visit

&lt;p&gt;Board of Directors Elects Javier Goizueta as Vice President
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company today approved the Company's
47th consecutive annual dividend increase, raising the quarterly dividend
approximately 8 percent from 38 cents to 41 cents per common share. This is
equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.64 per share, up from $1.52 per share in
2008. The dividend is payable April 1, 2009, to shareowners of record as of
March 15, 2009. 

The increase reflects the Board's confidence in the Company's long-term cash
flow. The Company returned $4.6 billion to shareowners in 2008, through $3.5
billion in dividends and $1.1 billion in share repurchases. In the past five
years, the Company's dividends have grown at a compound annual rate of more than
10 percent. 

The Board also elected Javier Goizueta as vice president of the Company. Earlier
this month, he was named president of The McDonald`s Division. In this role, he
will be responsible for building and strengthening the Company`s strategic

&lt;p&gt;  KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA and ARMONK, NY, Feb 19 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Malaysian Electronic Payment System (1997) Sdn Bhd (MEPS) and IBM (NYSE:
IBM) announced the completion of MEPS mainframe upgrade to the IBM System
z9 Business Class (BC) which will enable MEPS to create an advanced and
smarter Information Technology (IT) environment to cater to its explosive
growth for one of its core services, Interbank GIRO (MEPS IBG).

    MEPS IBG is an interbank funds transfer service that facilitates payments
and collections through the exchange of digitized transactions between
banks.

    Under the agreement signed early last year, IBM provided MEPS with a
System z9 BC for MEPS IBG's production and disaster recovery sites. The
mainframe is connected to an IBM System Storage DS6800 and the TS1120
tape solution. The IBM disk storage and tape solution will provide MEPS
with high availability, continuous operations, and data can be quickly
recovered in the event of any disaster.

    MEPS has invested more than RM 3.7 million (USD 1 million) in the total
IBM solution.

    The IBM solution will provide more than three times the bandwidth
previously available to MEPS. This higher bandwidth will enable MEPS to
focus on reducing overall business costs while consolidating and
simplifying its IT management. It will also enable MEPS to develop new
product features as well as provide faster and more efficient delivery to
customers.

    Group Managing Director of MEPS Dato' Mohd Hata Robani said, "We are
confident that this upgrade will further improve MEPS' processing
capability and provide the capacity to accommodate the accelerated growth
in IBG transactions. IBM Systems provides more stability and bandwidth as
well as security for enhancement initiatives in customer service quality."

    "Over the last three years, MEPS IBG has experienced a compounded growth
rate of 52%, and as of December 2008 over 36 million transactions worth
approximately RM90 billion were processed. MEPS is a strong supporter of
the Government's national agenda of migrating from paper-based payment to
electronic payment. With more organizations and government agencies
pushing and promoting the e-Payment, MEPS IBG volume is expected to
continue to grow aggressively," Dato' Mohd Hata added.

    IBM Global Technology Services successfully implemented all hardware setup
and installation services for both production and disaster recovery sites
without interruptions.

    IBM Malaysia's managing director Ou Shian Waei said, "With energy costs
rising, and power density of new electronics increasing, power-efficient
devices are increasing in importance with companies like MEPS. We provided
the relevant value propositions that have real short-term and long-term
impact on MEPS' business and helped them to realize their goals with our

&lt;p&gt;Feb 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal court denied class action
status to a lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) of
misleading buyers about which computers could run expanded
features that were part of the Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But Judge Marsha Pechman of the U.S. District Court in
Seattle allowed the suit to go forward on behalf of individual
plaintiffs, according to court documents issued on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2006, Microsoft authorized computer manufacturers to put
a sticker on PCs indicating they were "Windows Vista Capable,"
meaning the then-current Windows XP operating system could
upgraded to the Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs led by consumer Dianne Kelley said
Microsoft's marketing campaign was misleading because a large
number of these computers could only be upgraded to "Windows
Home Basic," a version of Vista that lacks a number of features
that the Premium version had. Those computers did not have a
"Premium Ready" designation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said the distinctions between the various
versions of Vista were clear in its marketing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court ultimately ruled that the plaintiffs could not
demonstrate that their claims were common to the entire class
of consumers who bought computers marked with the "Windows
Vista Capable" but without the "Premium Ready" label. But it
also said the plaintiffs could continue their suit
individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While the court decertified the class today, it is careful
to note that this ruling makes no comment on the merits" of the
plaintiffs' claims, Pechman said in the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Dianne Kelley, et al. v. Microsoft Corp, United
States District Court, Western District of Washington at
Seattle, No. C07-0475 MJP.

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day

New York &amp; Company, Inc. (NYSE: NWY), Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR), Altria Group,

International, Inc. (NYSE: SII).

the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

New York &amp; Co. Initiated a Hold

New York &amp; Company, Inc. (NYSE: NWY) was founded in 1918, is a leading specialty
retailer of fashion oriented, moderately-priced women's apparel, serving
customers for over 90 years. The retailer's proprietary branded New York &amp; Co
merchandise is sold exclusively through its national network of New York &amp;
Company retail stores. The company operates over 580 retail stores in 44 states.
Its target customers are fashion-conscious, value-sensitive women between the
ages of 25 and 45. 

We are initiating coverage of New York &amp; Co. with a Hold rating and six-month
target price of $2.50. The company's sales trends worsened throughout fiscal
2008, and we expect its sales trends to remain weak for the next several
quarters. 

Entergy Buy Rec Reiterated

Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) is shifting towards becoming a fundamentally strong
electric energy utility with the separation of its nuclear business. Higher
nuclear power prices, lower taxes, ongoing share repurchases, improving credit
markets, a reasonable valuation, and steady recovery from Hurricanes Gustav and
Ike damage will continue to deliver strong earnings and cash flow growth. 

However, pending regulatory approvals in New York and Vermont for the proposed
spin-off of its nuclear business is likely to relegate the spin-off transaction.
Therefore, we reiterate our BUY recommendation on ETR with a six-month target
price of $75.00. 

Altria Smoking the Competition

Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) presented at the CAGNY (Consumer Analysts Group of
New York) today in Boca Raton. Management reiterated guidance of $1.70 to $1.75
for 2009, representing a 3% to 6% increase from the adjusted base of $1.65 per
share in 2008. The company's forecast includes the expectations of higher
tobacco excise taxes, investment spending on UST, cost reduction initiatives,
increased pension expenses, and no share repurchases in 2009. 

Management continues to execute the company's Total Tobacco business model,
which leverages the market share dominance of the company's 4 major tobacco
brands: Marlboro, Copenhagen, Skoal and Black &amp; Mild. Altria is well-known as
being adept at capitalizing on the company's economies of scale through both
marketing prowess and cost management. 

Coca Cola Hellenic Stays a Buy

Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (NYSE: CCH) enjoys an attractive geographic
mix with 66% of revenues being derived from developing or emerging markets. In
addition, the company's product mix is less dependent on CSDs (carbonated soft
drinks) than other bottlers. 

Since the company conducts business and reports financial results in Euros, much
of the stock's performance is inversely correlated with US dollar's exchange
rate with the Euro. However, as management has a sound business strategy and
proven execution skills, the recent earnings weakness is providing a
valuation-based buying opportunity. 

Smith International Oversold

Houston-based Smith International, Inc. (NYSE: SII) is a major oilfield services
company, engaged in providing a comprehensive line of products and engineering
services to the oil and gas exploration and production industry, as well as to
the petrochemical and other related industries. 

Smith International's fourth quarter earnings, though weaker-than-expected, were
above year-earlier levels, driven by gains from its August acquisition of W-H
Energy's operations. Revenue and earnings grew 33% and 31%, respectively, on the
back of improved performance from all three segments.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jennifer Tan and Seng Li Peng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Feb 19 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp will
partially shut its mainland Singapore refinery and some
petrochemical units at its Jurong Island facility for a month
or more from March for routine maintenance, six industry
sources said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. energy giant will close a number of secondary
units in the 309,000 barrels per day (bpd) mainland refinery
from early-March to mid-April, the sources told Reuters. They
said none of the plant's crude units would be shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil's over 900,000 tonnes a year naphtha cracker --
the largest such unit in Southeast Asia -- and aromatics plant,
the core facilities in the Jurong Island petrochemical
operations, will also be shut during March, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said details of the maintenance plan at the two
refineries were not completely clear, although one industry
source said the visbreaking units at both the mainland and
Jurong Island refineries would be shut in stages during the
period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Jurong Island plant has a capacity of 296,000-bpd,
making Exxon's facilities in Singapore the fifth-biggest
refining complex in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The visbreaker processes residual fuels into more valuable
middle distillates, and the shutdown would lead to more fuel
oil flooding an oversupplied market but could help ease the
glut in the region's diesel supplies in the face of slow
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No CDUs will be shut, only the visbreaker. The impact will
be more on fuel oil," said a distillate trader, adding that the
overall impact on the diesel market will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Jurong Island, two sources said the March turnaround
would include the aromatics unit that can produce more than
300,000 tonnes of benzene a year, while a cracking facility
will start its month-long turnaround in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked about the planned maintenance, an ExxonMobil
spokesperson said: "It is not our practice to comment on the
operational status of our facilities. We are unable to confirm
or comment on the information you have received."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IMPACT ON NAPHTHA LIMITED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mainland refinery, which has two crude distillation
units (CDUs) -- one with a capacity of more than 200,000 bpd
and the other with up to 100,000 bpd -- was shut for major
maintenance in June 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery on Jurong Island, also called the Pulau Ayer
Chawan (PAC) facility, operates two CDUs with a capacity of
about 115,000 bpd and 185,000 bpd. The smaller one was shut for
over  two weeks in May 2007 after a fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said the shutdown of Exxon's cracking facility may
have only a small impact on the region's naphtha market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Generally, there shouldn't be any major impact on Exxon's
naphtha supply because they are net short. They import naphtha
to feed the cracker, which uses about 60 percent low-sulphur
waxy residue (LSWR) and 40 percent naphtha," a source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This means it needs around 90,000 tonnes of naphtha a month
to feed the cracker at full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, some traders are expecting the major to sell at
least one 30,000-tonne naphtha parcel if none of its CDUs on
Jurong Island is down for maintenance alongside the cracker.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Feb 19 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) will
partially shut its Singapore mainland refinery and
petrochemical units on Jurong Island from March to April for
routine maintenance, industry sources said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The sources said the U.S. energy giant will close a few
units in the 309,000 barrels per day (bpd) mainland refinery
from early-March to mid-April. Details of the units were not
immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil's naphtha cracker and aromatics plant, the core
facilities in the Jurong Island petrochemical operations, will
be shut for about a month starting in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked about the planned maintenance, an ExxonMobil
spokesperson said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is not our practice to comment on the operational
status of our facilities. We are unable to confirm or comment
on the information you have received."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cracking facility has a nameplate capacity of more than
900,000 tonnes a year, while the aromatics unit can produce
more than 300,000 tonnes of benzene a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil's Singapore facility, comprising the mainland
plant and its 296,000-bpd refinery on Jurong Island, is the
world's fifth largest such complex.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney Parks and Resortsissued pink slips Wednesday, with more are on the way, courtesy of a reorganization designed to eliminate redundancies at a unit that employs 80,000 workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney wouldn't say how many people were laid off or how many more layoffs are expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reorganization, said Parks and Resorts chairman Jay Rasulo, is not only a response to the weak economy but also a way to further the successful results of a shake-up four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasulo said a reorganization in 2005 led to speedier delivery of theme-park shows based on "High School Musical" and to the simultaneous openings of "Toy Story Mania" at parks in Florida and California, and he seeks more of the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Wednesday's announcement, resort development will merge with attractions and entertainment development and be led by Bruce Vaughn, the chief creative executive at Imagineering, Disney's main creative planning and development unit, and Craig Russell, the chief design and project delivery executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not mentioned by Rasulo was animation heavyweight John Lasseter, though insiders say he will remain principal creative adviser to Imagineering, a role he assumed when Disney purchased Pixar in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business development and real estate teams will combine, and the teams operating infrastructure at Walt Disney World and at Disneyland Resort will merge. Heads of the new departments are expected to make further cuts in staff in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Organization changes require difficult decisions, including the elimination of some roles," Rasulo said in a memo to employees. "These decisions were not made lightly and we know this will be a challenging transition. The people affected are our friends and colleagues, and they have made valuable contributions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reorganization comes just weeks after Parks and Resorts offered voluntary buyouts to 600 executives amid a 4 percent decline in quarterly revenue to $2.7 billion and a 24 percent drop in operating income to $382 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sheri Linden at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) sees extra-fast growth in sales to small to medium-sized Latin American businesses this year, as companies cut costs by using its tools and services, an executive told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, has about 200,000 small-business clients in Latin America after doubling its client base in the last three years, said Angelo Chirico, the company's regional director for small and mid-market solutions and partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this segment we're expecting growth of between 14 and 15 percent in 2009, even though in the overall IT (information technology) market growth is seen around 4 percent to 6 percent," Chirico said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still see opportunities for growth in the region, and we're seeing demand in the area of cost reduction and consolidation of platforms," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, stunned Wall Street with disappointing fourth-quarter results, plans to slash up to 5,000 jobs, and a warning that profit and revenue will almost certainly drop over the next two quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Argentina, the company forecasts 27 percent growth among small businesses this year, according to Diego Bekerman, an executive focused on Argentina and Uruguay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chirico said Argentine firms would lead the region in terms of expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Argentina has a faster pace of growth than all the rest, the country is showing itself to be somewhat immune to the (global) crisis. Business leaders see technology as a tool for overcoming the crisis, navigating its waters or even avoiding it altogether," Chirico said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Argentina's revenues surged 22 percent in the year ending June 30, 2008, to 330 million pesos, or some $91 million at the currency exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Chirico nor Bekerman was willing to specify how much of the company's revenue in Argentina and the region comes from small to medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has some 60,000 business partners in Latin America that develop and sell its services, including its operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=3.625 Argentine pesos)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Hilary Burke; editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tech icon Steve Wozniak, who co-founded Apple and helped popularize personal computing, is obviously unafraid to try new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His latest venture is competing in "Dancing with the Stars," ABC's reality TV show which returns for an eighth season on March 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wozniak may have dabbled in a slew of start-up companies since leaving Apple more than two decades ago, and most recently became chief scientist of Fusion-io, a fast-growing maker of data storage devices in Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nothing prepared the 58-year-old man, known to many as simply "the Woz," for a turn as a competitive dancer. Wozniak had previously turned down an invitation to appear on the prime-time TV show, which drew 19 million U.S. viewers last season, and only relented after a friend pressed him, he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had one day of practice, that one day of practice is the scariest thing of my life ever," Wozniak said in a phone interview on Friday. "I was already kind of shaking over nervousness. But I can't learn.

It's sometimes so surprising and shocking," Wozniak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He last talked with Jobs a couple of weeks before the Apple CEO announced his medical leave of absence in January.

They are faster, more energy efficient and more durable as they have no moving parts.

&lt;p&gt; * Apple co-founder nervous about "Dancing with the Stars"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Diving into solid-state drives at start-up Fusion-io&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Sees multi-touch displays, cloud computing gaining steam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gabriel Madway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Tech icon Steve Wozniak,
who co-founded Apple and helped popularize personal computing,
is obviously unafraid to try new things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His latest venture is competing in "Dancing with the
Stars," ABC's reality TV show which returns for an eighth
season on March 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wozniak may have dabbled in a slew of start-up companies
since leaving Apple more than two decades ago, and most
recently became chief scientist of Fusion-io, a fast-growing
maker of data storage devices in Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But nothing prepared the 58-year-old man, known to many as
simply "the Woz," for a turn as a competitive dancer. Wozniak
had previously turned down an invitation to appear on the
prime-time TV show, which drew 19 million U.S. viewers last
season, and only relented after a friend pressed him, he told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had one day of practice, that one day of practice is
the scariest thing of my life ever," Wozniak said in a phone
interview on Friday. "I was already kind of shaking over
nervousness. But I can't learn. It seems like some very, very
simple things are very difficult to learn and remember all
these things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Wozniak said he is having a ball practicing with
partner Karina Smirnoff. "I'm getting so sore and tired but I

&lt;p&gt;  *Sees 14-15 pct growth among Latin American small businesses   *Sees 27 percent growth in segment in Argentina &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Walter Bianchi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES Feb 20 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) sees extra-fast growth in sales to small to medium-sized Latin American businesses this year, as companies cut costs by using its tools and services, an executive told Reuters on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, has about 200,000 small-business clients in Latin America after doubling its client base in the last three years, said Angelo Chirico, the company's regional director for small and mid-market solutions and partners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "In this segment we're expecting growth of between 14 and 15 percent in 2009, even though in the overall IT (information technology) market growth is seen around 4 percent to 6 percent," Chirico said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We still see opportunities for growth in the region, and we're seeing demand in the area of cost reduction and consolidation of platforms," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last month, stunned Wall Street with disappointing fourth-quarter results, plans to slash up to 5,000 jobs, and a warning that profit and revenue will almost certainly drop over the next two quarters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But in Argentina, the company forecasts 27 percent growth among small businesses this year, according to Diego Bekerman, an executive focused on Argentina and Uruguay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Chirico said Argentine firms would lead the region in terms of expansion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Argentina has a faster pace of growth than all the rest, the country is showing itself to be somewhat immune to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(global) crisis. Business leaders see technology as a tool for overcoming the crisis, navigating its waters or even avoiding it altogether," Chirico said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft Argentina's revenues surged 22 percent in the year ending June 30, 2008, to 330 million pesos, or some $91 million at the currency exchange rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Neither Chirico nor Bekerman was willing to specify how much of the company's revenue in Argentina and the region comes from small to medium-sized businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has some 60,000 business partners in Latin America that develop and sell its services, including its operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ($1=3.625 Argentine pesos) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Hilary Burke; editing by Richard Chang) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((hilary.burke@thomsonreuters.com; +54 11 4318 0663; Reuters Messaging: hilary.burke.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MICROSOFT/LATINAMERICA  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt; *Russian government agency nixes Disney TV joint venture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Agency cited inaccurate information in application
 (Recasts, adds bylines, details on Russian market, share
price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Simon Shuster and Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOSCOW/LOS ANGELES, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Russia's
anti-monopoly agency on Friday blocked Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N)
local television venture, derailing the media giant's plan to
create a free, Disney-branded channel to expand in the
high-growth market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency, which also blocked Google Inc's (GOOG.O) bid
for a Russian company in October, said it refused to allow the
venture after receiving "false" or inaccurate information from
the companies applying to create Mo-Tv Holdings Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said in December it was partnering with broadcaster
Media-One Holdings Ltd to launch a nationwide, free TV channel
to carry locally created and Disney content in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman at Disney's headquarters in Burbank,
California had no comment on the government's statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ruling is a setback to Disney's aggressive efforts
since Chief Executive Robert Iger took over in 2005 to move
into the Russian and Eastern European markets, which had been
expected to buck the global economic downturn and offset slower
growth in the company's more established markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney had been counting on the TV channel to raise brand
awareness and support the local retail, theatrical
distribution, licensing, mobile and Internet businesses it
already operates in Russia -- a strategy it has employed with
some success in China and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture would have given Disney access to roughly 100
million Russian viewers, who it said were already familiar with
its stories and products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares closed down about 1 percent at $17.53 on
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'FALSE INFORMATION'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under Russia's strict laws governing the airwaves, foreign
investors must have a local partner, and Media-One was to hold
a 51 percent stake in the nationwide venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The anti-monopoly agency's strongly worded statement on
Friday did not mention the possibility of an appeal. Its press
department was not available late on Friday to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The documents, presented to the Federal Anti-Monopoly
Service of Russia, included false information," the agency said
in explanation of the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The anti-monopoly body takes the decision to refuse
applications if the relevant information they contain turns out
to be false," the agency said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency has been stepping up its presence over recent
months as part of a plan to build the service into one of the
government's most powerful agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russia's anti-monopoly service has been under the spotlight
since Vladimir Putin, Russia's Prime Minister, demanded the
anti-trust service become more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney operates 30 Disney Channels worldwide, mainly on
cable and other forms of pay TV, and sees them as crucial to
familiarizing international consumers with its theme parks,
movies and consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company faces regulatory, language and infrastructure
hurdles to rapid expansion in China and India, but had
considered Russia a desirable market because those issues were
viewed as less of a barrier to growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney had pledged to provide the Russian channel with an
undisclosed investment in cash and programming, as well as
marketing expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Media-One brought 30 owned and operated TV stations and a
knowledge of the Russian regulatory environment to the table.

&lt;p&gt;  TOKYO, Feb 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and CyberAgent (TSE: 4751) -- one of the largest Internet
media companies in Japan -- have developed technology that analyzes both
blog content and bloggers' behavior to recommend blogs of interest, and
to create cohesive communities around individual blogs.

    CyberAgent is rolling out this smart analysis feature on the company's
Ameba blog service in March 2009.

    By simultaneously analyzing user content and activity among its 4.5
million users, the Ameba blog site will offer more innovative services to
stimulate and accelerate participation in the blogosphere.

    "Our collaboration with IBM has been mutually beneficial," said Shinsuke
Usami, managing director of CyberAgent. "We combined IBM's composite data
analysis technology with CyberAgent's user activity log database. We hope
to continue our work with IBM to develop and deliver a new level of user
experience for bloggers."

    IBM's Tokyo Research Laboratory developed analytic technology that
combines behavioral data, such as blog viewing patterns and posting
frequency together with data, such as comments and blog post contents.
Together, those two elements provide an unprecedented understanding of
user interests.

    Based on this technology, CyberAgent plans to implement the following new
functions to its Ameba blog service:


--  Blog recommendation function: This introduces highly recommended blog
sites to bloggers based on personal interests. Previously, such
recommendations were limited to certain blog sites written by famous
persons. 
 

--  Blog supporter function: Frequent visitors to any of the some 3,500
celebrity and entertainer bloggers on Ameba will be introduced as official
"supporters" of those blogs, creating an identifiable community.

    
CyberAgent believes the new functions will help generate new
communication among blog users to further energize the Ameba blog
community.

    The collaboration is a part of IBM's First-of-a-Kind program, which brings
together IBM researchers with other companies to create unique, advanced
solutions that solve clients' business problems. IBM's Tokyo Research Lab
and CyberAgent launched the project in July 2008, and in December 2008,
IBM completed the design and development of the technology. CyberAgent
will embed the infrastructure on its Ameba blog site by March 2009.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed and assigned Rating Outlooks on JP Morgan 2001-CIBC2
commercial mortgage pass-through certificates as follows: 

--$27.1 million class A2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$561.4 million class A3 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$38.5 million class B at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$38.5 million class C at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$14.4 million class D at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$28.9 million class E at 'AA+'; Outlook Stable; 

--$12 million class F at 'AA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$25.3 million class G at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable; 

--$7.2 million class H at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$7.2 million class J at 'BB'; Outlook Stable; 

--$12 million class K at 'B+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$4.8 million class L at 'B'; Outlook Negative; 

--$4.8 million class M at 'B-'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch does not rate the $7 million class NR certificate. The A-1 Class has been
paid off since issuance. 

The affirmations reflect the stable performance of the pool since the last
rating action. The Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of rating
changes over the next one to two years. Forty one loans (34.9%) have fully
defeased. As of the February 2009 distribution date, the poll has paid down by
17.9% to $789.1 million from $961.7 million at issuance. 

Fitch has identified eighteen Loans of Concern (8.7%) including two specially
serviced loans (0.7%). The two specially serviced loans are secured by an office
building in Knoxville, TN and an apartment building in Tallahassee, FL. The
office building loan was transferred to the special servicer in January of 2009.
The special servicer is working to resolve a dispute between the master servicer
and borrower regarding forced placed insurance on the property dating back to
2004. The property continues to be 100% occupied by IT Corporation. Fitch does
not expect losses arising from this asset. The apartment building loan was
transferred to the special servicer in October of 2008. The special servicer is
negotiating a discounted pay off with the borrower which is expected to close in
February of 2009. Losses are expected upon the resolution of this asset. 

The Collin Creek Mall maintains its investment grade shadow rating. The loan is
secured by 332,055 square feet of in-line space within a regional shopping
center located in Plano, TX. Occupancy as of September 2009 was 92.5%, slightly
down from 97.5% at year-end (YE) 2007 and consistent with 91.3% at YE 2006. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Russia's anti-monopoly agency on Friday blocked Walt Disney's local venture, derailing the media giant's plan to create a free-to-air channel for Russian families, local media reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the anti-trust body said it rejected the venture after it was given false information by the parties applying to create Mo-Tv Holdings Ltd, which Russia's Interfax news agency identified as the Disney project, citing sources close to the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney corporate representative could not be reached immediately for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling is a setback to Disney's aggressive efforts since Chief Executive Robert Iger took over in 2005 to move into the Russian and Eastern European markets, which had been expected to buck the global economic downturn and offset slower growth in the company's more established markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney had been counting on the free-to-air television channel to raise brand awareness and support the local retail, theatrical distribution, licensing, mobile and Internet businesses it already operates in Russia -- a strategy it has employed successfully in China and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney announced plans in December to take a 49 percent stake in a Russian joint venture with Media-One Holdings Ltd, pledging to provide the channel with cash and programing, as well as marketing expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Russia's strict laws governing the airwaves, foreign investors must have a local partner, and Media-One was to hold a 51 percent stake in the nationwide venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The information and documents presented did not have all of the information necessary to make a decision with regard to statute 33 -- On protecting competition," the agency said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Moreover, the documents, presented to the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service of Russia included false information," it added in explanation of the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency's statement said it was blocking the acquisition of a 49 percent stake in Mo-Tv Holdings Ltd by Catalpa Investments Ltd, which Interfax news agency reported to be a unit of Walt Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Simon Shuster in Moscow and Gina Keating in Los Angeles; Editing by Andrew Macdonald)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil Giant Goes "Rogue" After 15 Years of Litigation
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Trying to make good on its promise of a "lifetime of litigation" for indigenous
groups in the Amazon, Chevron is using fraudulent tactics to delay an Ecuadorian
trial court from reaching a decision on a record $27 billion in environmental
damages, lawyers for local residents say. 

"Facing overwhelming evidence of that they caused a massive human rights
violation, Chevron is engaged in an absolute judicial fraud in Ecuador to keep
the trial going to avoid paying a judgment," said Pablo Fajardo, the lawyer for
30,000 Amazonian residents filed the case in 1993. "The company has gone rogue
and thousands of innocent people are the victims." 

"Chevron does not respect the law and refuses to accept the legitimacy of the
legal system because it knows it is about to lose the very trial that it fought
to have in Ecuador," said Fajardo, referring to the fact Chevron fought for nine
years in U.S. federal court to have the case shifted to Ecuador over the
objections of the plaintiffs. 

The lawsuit seeks damages for the dumping of more than 18 billion gallons of
toxic waste into Amazon waterways over a 26-year period when Texaco operated an
oil consortium. Five indigenous groups have had their traditional lifestyles
decimated and cancer rates in the area have skyrocketed, according to plaintiffs
and an independent, court-appointed expert. 

The court expert, Professor Richard Cabrera, worked with a team of 14
independent technical experts. They concluded it would take at least $27 billion
to remediate the rainforest to safe levels and compensate people for health
problems caused by the contamination. The amount would wipe out more than a year
of the company`s profits. 

Saying that Chevron`s knows the "game is up" and that if faces a multi-billion
dollar judgment, lawyers for the rainforest residents are asking that the trial
judge rule based on more than 250,000 pages of evidence and close to 80,000
chemical sampling results generated in the lawsuit. Chevron`s top lawyer,
Charles James, said recently that the company expects a "significant adverse
judgment" in Ecuador. 

"Chevron in this case has been granted more due process rights than probably any
defendant in the history of civil justice," said Julio Prieto, a lawyer who
works with Fajardo. "They have had 15 years to litigate, and they are still
looking for new courts that will accept their theories of junk science that
posit that known human carcinogens cannot cause harm to people if ingested. Once
one court rules against them, they look for another court to start the process
all over again. 

"The reality is that Chevron will never accept any adverse ruling from an
independent court," added Prieto. 

Fajardo said Chevron`s latest gambit is to seek eight additional field
inspections even through the evidentiary phase of the trial ended months ago.
Chevron`s lawyers refused to schedule the requested inspections for almost three
years, holding them back to be used as a vehicle to delay the trial in the
eleventh hour. 

It is unclear if the trial judge, Juan Nunez, will grant the eight inspections.
Fajardo said Chevron will cynically claim its own rights were violated if the
judge resists the company`s pressure. 

Some of Chevron`s other abuses of the judicial process include:

* Trying to drown the court with more than 200,000 pages of documents, most of
them repetitive. On several occasions, after losing a motion, the company has
re-filed the exact same motion and insisted the judge rule in its favor. 
* Claiming more field inspections need to be performed, even though the court
already has inspected 94 sites over a five-year period - with 100% of the sites
found to be contaminated, according to Richard Cabrera, the court expert. 
* Chevron continues to buy large advertisements accusing the independent court
expert, Professor Cabrera, of "fraud" without any supporting evidence - a smear
campaign that is intended to destroy the reputation of a respected Ecuadorian
scientist, said Fajardo. 
* Chevron also has refused to speak out against clear human rights abuses
intended to intimidate lawyers for the plaintiffs and court personnel. Lawyers
have received death threats, and the office of the court expert was mysteriously
robbed of case-related materials.

Fajardo said Chevron`s tactics not only violate the due process rights of the
plaintiffs, but they also violate international law principles that prohibit
parties from abusing the judicial process. The government of Ecuador has made
the same charge against Chevron in a related international arbitration.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/d835c9/reverse_engineerin) has
announced the addition of John Wiley and Sons Ltd's new report "Reverse
Engineering Deals on Wall Street with Microsoft Excel: A Step-by-Step Guide" to
their offering. 

A serious source of information for those looking to reverse engineer business
deals. It's clear from the current turbulence on Wall Street that the inner
workings of its most complex transactions are poorly understood. Wall Street
deals parse risk using intricate legal terminology that is difficult to
translate into an analytical model. Reverse Engineering Deals on Wall Street: A
Step-By-Step Guide takes readers through a detailed methodology of
deconstructing the public deal documentation of a modern Wall Street transaction
and applying the deconstructed elements to create a fully dynamic model that can
be used for risk and investment analysis. 

Appropriate for the current market climate, an actual residential mortgage
backed security (RMBS) transaction is taken from prospectus to model by the end
of the book. Step by step, Allman walks the reader through the reversing process
with textual excerpts from the prospectus and discussions on how it directly
transfers to a model. Each chapter begins with a discussion of concepts with
exact references to an example prospectus, followed by a section called "Model
Builder," in which Allman translates the theory into a fully functioning model
for the example deal. Also included is valuable VBA code and detailed
explanation that shows proper valuation methods including loan level
amortization and full trigger modeling. 

Aside from investment analysis this text can help anyone who wants to keep track
of the competition, learn from others public transactions, or set up a system to
audit one's own models. 

Key Topics Covered:

* Chapter 1. Introduction. 
* Chapter 2. Determining Dates and Setting Up Times. 
* Chapter 3. Creating Asset Cash Flow From Prospectus Data. 
* Chapter 4. Setting Up Liability Assumptions, Paying Fees, and Distributing
Interest. 
* Chapter 5. Principal Repayment and the Shifting Nature of a Wall Street Deal. 
* Chapter 6. Credit Enhancement Mechanisms to Mitigate Loss. 
* Chapter 7. Auditing the Model 
* Chapter 8. Conclusion of Example Transaction and Final Thoughts on Reverse
Engineering.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
CBS Corp. (NYSE: CBS), Chemed Corporation (NYSE: CHE), DTS (NASDAQ: DTSI),

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

CBS Revenues Drop Steeply

In the midst of a secular decline in print and broadcast media, which led to the
levering of balance sheets to fund massive stock buybacks, the deepening
recession has eviscerated ad revenue, industrywide. CBS Corp. (NYSE: CBS) has
reacted by cutting costs and eliminating more than one-third of its
poorest-performing mid-market radio stations to focus on large markets. 

Its latest move to conserve cash (about $600 million annually) was an 81%
dividend cut announced with 4Q08 earnings. The cut was imperitive as levered
free cash flow falls at an accelerating rate and the company faces a $1.6
billion debt maturity in 2010 - debt is now 45% of CBS` total capital. 

Chemed's Activist Shareholders

Chemed Corporation (NYSE: CHE), through its two primary subsidiaries of Vitas
and Roto-Rooter, is a major player in both the hospice and plumbing industries,
respectively. 

On February 12, 2009, MMI Investments, L.P., one of the largest stockholders of
CHE with 800,000 shares, or approximately 3.6% of its outstanding common stock,
announced that it had sent a letter to the Board of Directors of CHE in which
MMI argued that the combination of Roto-Rooter under the same corporate umbrella
as Vitas makes little strategic and economic sense and that the two should be
separated by means of a tax-free spin-off that would allow shareholders to
benefit from each company's value as a separate entity. 

DTS a Sell Pre-Earnings

DTS (NASDAQ: DTSI) is scheduled to report 4Q08 earnings on February 29th.
Management guidance, as of November 10th (at the release of 3Q08 financial
results) called for 2008 revenue in the range of $55-$59 million and EPS at the
low end of the existing guidance of $0.52-$0.58 range, assuming a share count of
18.3 million. 

Given accelerated decline in overall consumer spending in November and December,
with consumer electronics particularly hard hit, we think there is a risk that
DTS misses the low end of guidance. More importantly, 2009 consensus estimates
appear aggressive at $0.56 compared with our estimate of $0.52, and do not, in
our opinion, incorporate the risks posed by a potentially deep and protracted
consumer-led economic slowdown, which could choke demand from the auto and PC
markets. 

Sprint Races Past Consensus

Sprint Nextel, Inc. (NYSE: S) reported 4th quarter and full-year 2008 financial
results with net income performance better than the latest consensus estimates.
The company reported consolidated net operating revenues of $8.4 billion and a
diluted loss per share of 57 cents. 

In addition, Sprint Nextel recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of
approximately $1 billion in the quarter, which finalizes the accounting for the
goodwill related to the Sprint Nextel merger and other acquisitions. Removing
this one-time charge and other pro-forma items, adjusted earnings was a loss of
$0.01 for the quarter compared to a net gain of $0.23 per share for the
prior-year reporting period. 

P Presents at CAGNY

Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG) presented at the CAGNY (Consumer Analysts Group of
New York) today in Boca Raton. For fiscal 2009, management has dramatically
widened the guidance range for organic sales growth to 2% to 5% and EPS growth
to 6% to 11%. 

Short-term, the company has experienced negative sales and cost impacts from
foreign exchange fluctuations and higher commodity costs. In the global pursuit
of risk aversion, the US dollar has appreciated 22%.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Feb 23 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (XOM.N) has agreed to
sell PetroChina (0857.HK)(601857.SS) 2 million tonnes of
liquefied natural gas per year for 20-25 years from the
Australian Gorgon project, an industry source said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The deal, which still requires approval from China's State
Energy Administration, would be the second Gorgon LNG contract
for China's top oil firm, following a 20-year deal with Royal
Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) for 2 million tonnes per year (mtpa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and Shell both have 25 percent of Gorgon, which is
operated by Chevron Corp (CVX.N), owner of the remaining 50
percent. Gorgon's project size was recently increased to 15
mtpa, boosting Exxon's share to 3.75 mtpa from 2.5 mtpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one at the companies involved was immediately available
to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Eadie Chen, Editing by Tom Miles and Ken

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Feb 22 (Reuters) - An accounting error by
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has reportedly led the world's largest
software maker to notify some laid off employees last week that
they would need to give back part of their severance pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company laid off 1,400 workers last month, the first of
5,000 jobs Microsoft has said it plans to cut over the next 18
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The error is believed to have overpaid some former
employees and underpaid others. Those that were overpaid were
sent letters requesting them to refund the company by sending a
check or money order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An inadvertent administrative error occurred that resulted
in an overpayment in severance pay by Microsoft," a letter
obtained by the technology blog TechCrunch reads. "We ask that
you repay the overpayment and sincerely apologize for any
inconvenience to you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that the letter was
authentic. The company has not disclosed how many former
employees were affected or the total amount that was overpaid,
calling the incident "a private matter between the company and
the affected people."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Feb 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has
dropped an attempt to recoup some severance money from 25
recently fired workers it mistakenly overpaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company, which announced a
plan to cut up to 5,000 jobs in January, acknowledged on Sunday
that it had tried to get the overpaid workers to return the
extra money. But late on Monday, it reversed course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was a mistake on our part," said a Microsoft spokesman
in an e-mailed statement. "We should have handled this
situation in a more thoughtful manner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is "reaching out to those impacted to relay that
we will not seek any payment from those individuals," according
to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not say what caused the original error in
severance payments, or what the amounts involved were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker, feeling the downturn in
corporate and consumer spending, laid off 1,400 workers last
month, the first of the up to 5,000 jobs it plans to cut over

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co, the second-largest U.S. bank, slashed its common stock dividend 87 percent on Monday, a surprise move by a lender considered among the strongest in the U.S. financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank also said it has been "solidly profitable" this quarter, and that the outlook for the three-month period is "roughly in line" with analyst forecasts. Shares rose 5.5 percent in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said its decision to lower its quarterly dividend to 5 cents per share from 38 cents will save $5 billion of common equity a year.

the second-largest U.S. bank, slashed its common stock dividend
87 percent on Monday, a surprise move by a lender considered
among the strongest in the U.S. financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also said it has been "solidly profitable" this
quarter, and that the outlook for the three-month period is
"roughly in line" with analyst forecasts. Shares rose 5.5

&lt;p&gt;First Quarter Financial Performance Quarter-to-Date is Solidly Profitable;
Company Positioned Well for the Future

Dividend Action is Being Taken as a Precautionary Step to Maximize Capital and
Operational Flexibility and to Protect Fortress Balance Sheet Even If Conditions
Worsen Significantly


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase today announced that the Board of Directors has reduced the
company`s quarterly common stock dividend from $0.38 to $0.05 per share,
effective for the dividend payable April 30, 2009, to shareholders of record on
April 6, 2009. The Board anticipates maintaining this level for the time being.
This action will enable the company to retain an additional $5 billion in common
equity per year. 

First-quarter 2009 financial performance quarter-to-date is solidly profitable
even after significant additions to reserves, and the outlook for the quarter is
roughly in line with analyst expectations. 

"While we recognize our tremendous obligation to shareholders to maintain
dividend levels, we also understand that extraordinary times require
extraordinary measures. Our action today is being done as a strong precautionary
measure to help ensure that our fortress balance sheet remains intact - even if
conditions worsen significantly. As always, our highest obligation during an
economic crisis is to keep our company and franchise healthy, vibrant and strong
for the future," said Jamie Dimon, Chief Executive Officer. 

"While our performance and capital are already strong, today`s action provides
us with maximum flexibility to protect our company in a more highly stressed
environment and to continue to build and invest in our market-leading
businesses. Today`s capital action is not directly related to TARP. Our reason
for accepting TARP capital still holds -- namely to help stabilize the banking
system and economy. The decision to retain additional common equity does,
however, help position our company to repay TARP as soon as is prudent -- and
still maintain a strong capital position. Our repayment of TARP will ultimately
be worked out in consultation with the U.S. Treasury and other regulators, and
in consideration of the best interests of the banking system overall," Dimon
added. 

The company said it hopes to return to a more normalized dividend payout ratio
as soon as feasible after the environment has stabilized.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Foundation and The National Foundation For Teaching
Entrepreneurship Celebrate the 6th Annual Youth Entrepreneurship Expo
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
As world leaders, representatives from academia and government continue to agree
that entrepreneurship skills can indeed be taught, it becomes more important
than ever to teach and prepare the future workforce to succeed in an
ever-changing business environment. The National Foundation for Teaching
Entrepreneurship (NFTE) is dedicated to doing just that, by providing
entrepreneurial curriculum to students in low income communities to help build
excitement for the years ahead by connecting skills learned in the classroom to
real world business scenarios. 

On Monday, February 23rd student entrepreneurs from across the country will take
the stage to present their exciting business plans at the 6th Annual NFTE and
Goldman Sachs Foundation Youth Entrepreneurship Expo. Twenty-three aspiring
young entrepreneurs, whose businesses range from Caribbean snacks and urban
graphic t-shirts to grocery delivery services and organic cosmetics, will
compete to receive grants to apply towards launching their business or college
expenses. This year's Expo will be held from 5:00 pm - 7:30 pm, at Ricker
Auditorium, 180 Maiden Lane, New York, NY. 

"There are children all over the world who possess a special talent that has yet
to be discovered," said NFTE President and Founder Steve Mariotti. "Our role is
to help foster engagement in education, teach students invaluable lessons about
business, creativity, drive and hard work, and ultimately increase their chances
of success in business and life." 

The Youth Entrepreneurship Expo concludes months of hard work and creative
planning by high school students from around the country who have competed in
business plan competitions at several NFTE summer BizCamps funded by The Goldman
Sachs Foundation. 

"These students are the future business leaders and entrepreneurs," said
Stephanie Bell-Rose, President of the Goldman Sachs Foundation. "We at the
Goldman Sachs Foundation want to help build the pipeline of the next generation
of leaders." 

NFTE offers schools nationwide a hands-on entrepreneurship curriculum that
exposes students from all backgrounds to invaluable life lessons. By the end of
a NFTE course, students have developed a professional, well tested business
plan, gained presentation skills and experience interacting in a team and with
business professionals.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on new bonus guidelines)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Feb 23 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) is
awarding discretionary executive bonuses for 2008 and
abandoning a plan to use a formula based on individual and
company performance, according to a regulatory filing on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke said it abandoned the formula because it would require
the company to publicly disclose specific volume, net income
and pretax profit targets that would result in payments under
the bonus plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Rather than subject the company to the substantial
competitive harm that would result from the disclosure of the
targets comprising the business performance factor, the
compensation committee decided to award bonuses on an entirely
discretionary basis," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola said its compensation committee would use its
discretion and consider "a number of quantitative and
qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, volume
growth, earnings per share growth, global volume and value
share gains and overall company operating performance in the
current economic climate in order to make its decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Coca-Cola closed down 1.8 percent to $42.09 on
the New York Stock Exchange in a broader market decline.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An accounting error reportedly led Microsoft Corp to notify some laid off employees last week that they would need to give back part of their severance pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker laid off 1,400 workers last month, the first of 5,000 jobs the company plans to cut over the next 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The error is believed to have overpaid some former employees and underpaid others.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan (HASP), a cornerstone of
President Obama`s "broad, comprehensive strategy to get the economy back on
track," was unveiled on February 18 to much fanfare and debate. The plan focuses
on the current environment mostly from the perspective of homeowners (more
specifically, mortgage borrowers). 

On the advisability of the HASP, we paraphrase Tennyson: ours is not to reason
why, ours is but to analyze prepayment risk. While we have an opinion on whether
the HASP is a good idea, opinions don`t matter all that much. To date, we
haven`t weighed in on the matter of the large scale efforts to drive down
mortgage rates or propel the refinancing machine into full motion, because these
plans are driven by politics, not economics. Policymakers` headlong pursuit of a
solution for what ails our financial infrastructure and economy is fraught with
so many ambitions and risks that to criticize the practical and philosophical
shortcomings of one plan seems almost pointless and petty, so we won`t do it.
The reality is that the HASP has the full reputational weight of a new,
energetic administration behind it, it is going happen, and we have to deal with
it. 

But we will say this: Some of the policies that are being put in place right now
are designed to fix things that are broken-capitalize banks, reduce the overhang
of toxic assets, free up frozen markets-and we applaud them. Others, like the
HASP or the stimulus package, are designed to change behavior. In a free and
democratic society like ours, people cannot be forced to do what they do not
want to do, so policy prescriptions must have the proper incentives to change
behavior. Put cash in people`s pockets as part of the stimulus package and they
may choose to save it rather than spend it. Lower real deposit rates to zero or
less, however, and people might not save as much or save for as long a period of
time. Encourage people to buy American, but it won`t change their desire for
Toyotas or BMWs. Give huge tax incentives for buying GM cars, however, and it
might make car buyers think twice about their preferences. (Even then it might
not work, which leads to the wrong kind of incentives, like compensation caps,
protectionism, restricting immigration or changing contract law by government
fiat.) Without the proper incentives, people and companies may not behave the
way they are supposed to, rendering these kinds of policy programs a waste of
taxpayer money. 

Likewise, lowering mortgage rates isn`t guaranteed to spur refinancing or demand
for homes, and here the Federal Reserve`s $500 billion purchase program and the
HASP may fall short. Currently, the composite Housing Affordability Index,
calculated by the National Association of Realtors, stands at an all-time high
of 158.8, which means that a family earning the median family income has 158.8%
of the income necessary to qualify for a conventional 30-year fixed-rate loan
assuming 20% down on the median priced home ($174,700 as of the latest release;
we suspect the $34,940 down payment is the real problem for most families given
the savings rate over the last few years). The methodology for the Affordability
Index calls for a debt-to-income (DTI) of just 25%, which means that monthly
principal and interest cannot exceed 25% of the median family income. If we used
the more current, HASP-related DTI of 38%, the Housing Affordability Index would
be 241.4! Clearly, then, just as record lows in the Affordability Index in 2006
did not discourage homebuyers from buying, high affordability today is no
guarantee that homes will sell. Economic uncertainty and the deflationary
undertow of home prices are apparently such powerful disincentives that
homebuyers would still rather forsake a cheap purchase price today in favor of
an even cheaper price tomorrow. (Note that the Administration is paying
attention to incentives: the newly-minted stimulus package contains an $8,000
credit for any first-time homebuyer, as defined, willing to step up and buy a
home. It`s "free" money; doesn`t have to be paid back, at least not until it`s
taxed away by future municipal, federal and sales tax increases. But we
digress.) 

Back to the two pertinent issues we must evaluate: First, how will the HASP
affect prepayment speeds? And second, how effective will it be in achieving its
goals? Before we address these questions, let`s briefly review the three main
components of the plan (for readers who want more detail, it can be found on the
Department of Treasury`s website at
http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/tg33.htm). 

First, the plan focuses on creditworthy borrowers who have had difficulty
refinancing into lower mortgage rates due to the effect of falling house values.
Many conforming loan borrowers (i.e., borrowers with loans that conform to the
size limits for Fannie or Freddie guarantees) have had difficulty taking
advantage of today`s lower mortgage rates-5.16% on the day the plan was
released-because the value of their homes have declined, rendering their
loan-to-value ratios too high for approval or requiring expensive mortgage
insurance to obtain approval. The HASP essentially waives that requirement,
raising the LTV limit to 105% for borrowers who can make the payments. 

Second, the plan allocates $75 billion to address the challenges facing
borrowers who are not in bankruptcy yet need their mortgages modified in some
way because they don`t have sufficient income to make payments on their
mortgage, even at today`s lower rates. These borrowers need an even lower
interest rate and possibly even a reduction in principal amount in order to
manage their debt burden. The key metric in this process is reducing the
borrower`s debt service burden down to as low as 31%. This provision makes the
lender responsible for reducing the interest rate down to a point that gets the
borrowers DTI to 38%, and thereafter the Treasury and the lender will split the
cost of reducing payments to lower the DTI to 31%, with a floor interest rate of
2%. The rate will stay at that level for 5 years, after which it will gradually
adjust upward to the conforming rate. In addition, the lender has the ability to
reduce a borrower`s monthly payments by reducing principal balances; here, too,
Treasury would share in the costs. 

The loan modification part of this plan includes incentives for success. The
borrower is incentivized to stay current after modification-further principal
reductions of up to $1,000 a year for five years. Loan servicers receive $1,000
up front for modifying an eligible loan, and up to $1,000 for each year that the
borrower stays current (paid monthly, for up to three years). Servicers and
lenders are also rewarded for identifying eligible loans and modifying them
before they become delinquent-$500 for the servicer and $1,500 for the lender.
Also included in the modification program is a $10 billion insurance fund that
is intended to keep lenders from foreclosing on mortgages due solely to declines
in home prices. 

The HASP also addresses the potential for modifying mortgage loans after the
borrower has sought bankruptcy protection, aka judicial modification, aka
cramdown. Under this part of the plan, the amount of the mortgage that is in
excess of the current value of the home will now be treated as an unsecured
debt, just like a credit card debt (but only if the borrower has already asked
for a loan modification and has complied with all reasonable requests for
information from the servicer), essentially "cramming down" the loan principal
to the value of the house. Moreover, judicial modification is only available to
existing mortgages under the conforming Fannie/Freddie loan limits. The cramdown
is intended to allow for a more reasonable payment plan for the homeowner. 

Third, the HASP increases the explicit commitment to backstop Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac by stepping up the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements to $200
billion each from the current $100 billion each. It also gives the GSEs the
ability to increase their retained mortgage portfolios to $900 billion each from
the current $850 billion each (at December 31, 2008, Fannie`s and Freddie`s
retained portfolios totaled $787.3 billion and $804.8 billion, respectively). 

So how will this plan affect prepayment speeds? In brief, for Agency MBS, the
relaxation of LTV rules will likely increase speeds, but it is unclear how much
faster and over what time period they will speed up. Speeds should increase
because the plan expands the universe of potentially refinanceable mortgages to
include those that were unlikely or unable to refinance because LTVs were
between 80% and 105% due to declines in housing values. According to Barclays,
including this cohort would increase the number of potentially refinanceable
loans approximately 25% across the mortgage universe, or about four to five
million loans. This is generally consistent with the estimate of the Obama
Administration. All other things being equal, then, if all of those loans
refinanced, this would result in a 25% increase in the constant prepayment rate
(CPR) of the mortgage universe. However, not all things are equal in this
calculation, and therein lies the test of the marketplace. To begin with, the
marginal percentage of loans refinanceable would vary widely by coupon and
vintage. For example, mortgages originated in 2007 and 2008 would be more likely
to benefit because they have less equity built up than earlier vintages, and
higher coupon mortgages like 6s and 6.5s will tend to have more eligible
borrowers than lower coupon mortgages. 

But more to the point is the overall efficacy of the plan itself. How effective
will this plan be in putting people into new mortgages so they can avoid
foreclosure? The headline objective of the HASP is that it will "help up to 7 to
9 million families restructure or refinance their mortgages to avoid
foreclosure." That process, it is hoped, will have ripple effects that will help
to support the housing market by keeping people in their homes. We expect that
the program will have a measurable effect on the market, but it will likely fall
short of the hoped-for results. To date, prepayment speeds have come in far
slower than predicted solely on rate-related refinanceability. Despite the
different features and incentives of this plan and the different circumstances
today, we believe that the same will be true for HASP-related prepayment
expectations, for the following reasons:

* The process of refinancing and modification is a frictional, granular, labor
intensive process of identification, qualification and diligence by the
servicers and lenders and self-identification by the borrowers. It will not be
efficient, meaning it will take a long time and some deserving candidates will
fall through the cracks. 
* Not all borrowers will have the proper documentation or credit history to
qualify for the program. 
* The appraisal process for determining the current value of homes is unclear,
but by the time borrowers get to the appraisal step of the refinancing several
months from now, home values will likely have fallen even more, putting more
borrowers outside of the 105% LTV limit. 
* While it is okay for there to be a second lien on a house (the 105% limit only
applies to the first mortgage), the second lien holder still must be consulted,
providing a further step in the process. 
* Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac upfront guarantee fees have increased significantly
over the past year and are slated to increase again in April. These fees could
knock out the refinanceability of certain borrowers. 
* The capacity of mortgage lenders to handle incoming calls, not to mention
their willingness to make loans, will be tested and likely found wanting, at
least initially. 
* As pointed out by Laurie Goodman of Amherst Securities, in the last
refinancing wave of 2002-2003, refinancing behavior was driven by equity
extraction and the lure of no points. Neither of those options is likely to be
obtainable in today`s market, and may dampen the response to this program. 
* While there are incentives to servicers, lenders and borrowers to make this
program work, it remains to be seen whether the incentives are strong enough to
make this program any more successful than programs that have already been tried
or proffered. Hope for Homeowners, which was launched in October to help 400,000
homeowners avoid foreclosure, has only helped a tiny fraction of that amount.

Modifications have had mixed results at best. The Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision have gathered performance data
on loan modifications, and its report of February 13, 2009 showed that there is
a high incidence of re-default. Of the loans modified in the first quarter of
2008, almost 60% of them are delinquent again 8 months later. Loans modified in
the second quarter of 2008 are on a worse path, and the rates are even higher
for subprime and Alt-A loans. Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan asked
rhetorically why this recidivism rate was so high: "Is it because the
modifications did not reduce monthly payments enough to be truly affordable to
borrowers? Is it because consumers replaced lower mortgage payments with
increased credit card debt? Is it because the mortgages were so badly
underwritten that the borrowers simply could not afford them, even with reduced
monthly payments? Or is it a combination of these and other factors?" The
dominant answer to Comptroller Dugan is probably the first one. Assuming the
borrower remains employed, ultimately the most likely determinant of the success
of the HASP will be its ability to significantly reduce the monthly payment. If
it fails in this regard, the government`s capital commitment will be wasted. 

In conclusion, the job of the mortgage investor is to assess the implications
for the HASP on their portfolios. To an Agency MBS investor who will get back
100 cents on the dollar, the analysis begins and ends with the probability of
borrowers with refinanceable loans actually closing on new loans. For a
non-Agency MBS investor, the analysis is made more difficult by the need to
weigh the potential loss in a principal modification against the protection
offered by his portfolio`s credit subordination and weighted average acquisition
price. Politically and socially, we understand the appeal of efforts to keep
people in their homes, but expectations must be adjusted appropriately. From a
market perspective we should not expect the noble ambitions of the HASP to
outweigh market forces and human behavior. There are just too many houses for
sale right now.

&lt;p&gt;KEY WEST, Florida (Reuters) - Packed with cocaine and grimly christened "coffins," sleek jungle-built submarines are steaming their way north from Colombia through Pacific waters to deliver tons of illegal drugs headed for the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skimming just below the water line, with only a glimpse of a glass-enclosed cockpit or metal tubes visible from above, the semi-submersibles are the latest shipment method used by trafficking cartels to try to elude detection by authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pilot and three or four crewmen squeeze into the cramped hulls of the craft on voyages from Colombia's Pacific Coast up to Central America or Mexico, where their cargoes are offloaded for shipment to the United States, the U.S. Coast Guard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no bathroom or galley and the heat can be searing in the narrow space the smugglers share in the stern of the craft, just a few feet away from the throbbing diesel engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They call it either the coffin or the tomb," said Rear Admiral Joseph Nimmich, the officer who commands the U.S. Coast Guard's Joint Interagency Task Force South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The intent is to be as low-profile, and to make it as difficult for us to find, as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task force Nimmich heads, an umbrella group that includes the U.S. military, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI and Central Intelligence Agency, focuses on monitoring and detecting drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It estimates that some 60 to 75 of the fiberglass vessels, also known as "narco-subs" and capable of carrying upward of eight tons of cocaine when fully loaded, are built in clandestine jungle shipyards in northwest Colombia every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes the fleet big enough to handle almost all of Colombia's annual exports of cocaine, estimated by United Nations monitors to total about 600 metric tons a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMPROVING TECHNOLOGY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nimmich spoke to Reuters in an interview last week at a navy dock in Key West, Florida where one of the vessels is on display. Fity-nine feet long and about 12 feet wide, it was caught in the Pacific Ocean with its four-man crew and a payload of about seven tons of cocaine last September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "coffin" nickname for the vessels stems from the fact that some suffered catastrophic hull failures in the early stages of their development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nimmich said the boats, originally designed by Russian, Pakistani and Sri Lankan engineers, had since become increasingly sophisticated in their seaworthiness, propulsion systems and other features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smuggling runs from Colombia to Mexico or Guatemala, where the cocaine is offloaded for shipment to the United States, can take up to two weeks. But that is only because the boats slow their powerful engines to a crawl during the day, to avoid detection of their wakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other new features, the vessel lashed to the dock at the Key West Naval Air Station had an underwater exhaust cooling system to help the boat, painted light grey with speckles of blue, avoid producing a heat signature that could be spotted by infrared radar systems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Very low technological capabilities can have a high impact on our sensor system," Nimmich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, the vessels appear to have been used almost exclusively to run cocaine from the Pacific side of Colombia, Nimmich said. But at least one, with a very large cargo capacity and a twin-engine power plant, had been found on the eastern side of Colombia on the Guajira Peninsula, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POTENTIAL FOR TERRORIST USE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent reports of building activity in the Caribbean region have not been confirmed, Nimmich added. He said intelligence pointing to construction of at least one semi-submersible, to run cocaine to Europe out of Brazil's Amazon River Basin, could also not be confirmed, but that this would not be a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We clearly think that there's going to be an expansion of this technology into other vectors," the admiral said. The potential for terrorist attacks using the vessels was one possibility, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of his colleagues have voiced fears that drug smugglers could soon begin making full-fledged submarines capable of diving deep and navigating even more quietly than the current generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nimmich said such production was unlikely any time soon, even though a full-blown Russian-designed sub, capable of carrying about 150 tons of cocaine and diving to substantial depths, was found by Colombian police in a warehouse outside the Andean nation's high-elevation capital in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The technological advances to go from a semi-submersible to a submersible are dramatic. It is not easy," Nimmich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the semi-submersibles may already be as good as they need to be in countering beefed-up efforts to intercept drug-laden aircraft and speedboats running out of Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For every seizure of a semi-submersible vessel -- which cost about $500,000 each and are scuttled when they reach their final destinations -- Nimmich said four others were likely out plowing the seas northward with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At a very good pace this year, we are probably only about 20 percent effective in interdicting semi-submersibles at this point in time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Pascal Fletcher and Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Life Products Signs NASCAR Legend as Spokesman for Rejuvenate Auto Products,
Launches $20 Million National Advertising Campaign to Grow Product Sales


MIRAMAR, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Joe McDonnell, chief executive officer of For Life Products (FLP), today
announced the signing of three-time NASCAR Champion and FOX Lead Sports Analyst
Darrell Waltrip to a multi-year deal as official spokesman for FLP`s Rejuvenate
Auto product line. The home and auto surface-care products manufacturer and
marketer will feature Waltrip in a new national $20 million advertising campaign
with Waltrip`s endorsements in its new television commercial, new product
packaging and point-of-sale displays. 

FLP`s Rejuvenate brand, the leader in consumer-based, commercial-grade solutions
for cleaning, restoring and protecting flooring, cabinets and other home
surfaces, has the No. 1 selling floor-care product at the nation`s largest
do-it-yourself retailer. FLP is expanding Rejuvenate to include its eight
auto-care products under the "Rejuvenate Auto" umbrella. Foremost is Rejuvenate
Auto 15-Minute Wash &amp; Wax Renewer, which is endorsed by the National Corvette
Owners Association (NCOA) and provides showroom-quality auto detailing. 

"I was blown away when I tried Rejuvenate Auto on my car," Waltrip said. "With
an easy spray and wipe, it cleans and protects my cars without creating
scratches and swirls like every other car wash or soap-and-bucket approach. It
offers the best, longest-lasting shine. To tell you the truth, all of his
products were incredible, in fact, it`s the only car care product line I trust
for my cars." 

Added McDonnell: "Darrell`s endorsement resembles what car aficionados and
everyone who tries Rejuvenate Auto say: `Rejuvenate Auto is the best, and I
won`t use anything else.`" 

The Rejuvenate 15-Minute Wash &amp; Wax Renewer replaces drive-through car washes,
known to scratch and dull exteriors, and the soap-and-water approach, proven in
studies to scratch paint up to one-tenth of its thickness. The line also
includes a real leather scent spray, leather restorer that uses natural tannery
oils, anti-fog window cleaner, bioenzymatic carpet &amp; upholstery stain
remover/cleaner, replating chrome polish, a 30-second lens restorer kit, and an
enzyme-based cleaning product to remove oil stains from concrete surfaces such
as driveways and garages. The 15-Minute Wash &amp; Wax and the entire Rejuvenate
Auto product line will bear DW`s photo and his famous "Boogity, Boogity,
Boogity" that will now be followed by "Let`s go Rejuvenate" and will hit retail
shelves nationwide in April.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) is trading roughly 2% higher this morning on
a mix of strength in the price of crude oil and positive broker comments. Before
the open today, Deutsche Bank boosted its rating on the company from "hold" to
"buy." Overall, Wall Street is quite optimistic toward the oil giant, as 7 of
the 11 analysts following XOM rate it a "buy" or better. This is a concern
considering the security's lackluster technical performance, as there is ample
room for potential downgrades in the stock's future. 

What's more, the average 12-month price target for XOM stands at $82.78,
according to Thomson Reuters. This estimate implies that analysts are
forecasting a rally of more than 16% during the next 12 months. Any price-target
cuts from this smitten group could also have a negative impact on the shares.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, Feb 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and the Ontario Centres of Excellence today launched a
pilot project that gives university students, professors, and other
researchers anytime, anywhere access to some of IBM's leading business
software via cloud computing.

    Cloud computing is an emerging compute model for delivering and consuming
IT capabilities as a service. This Tools as a Service (TaaS) technology
showcase, which enables researchers to have 24/7 access to IBM's WebSphere
Integration Developer and Rational Software Architect over the Internet,
is a major milestone for the IBM Canada Centre for Advanced Studies and
its partners in the Centre of Excellence for Research in Adaptive Systems
(CERAS).

    Early adopters of this pilot include the University of Waterloo, York
University, Queen's University, University of Toronto, Carleton
University, the Ontario Cancer Institute, and developers from the IBM
Canada software lab.

    This Tools as a Service initiative will provide the participating research
institutions with tremendous productivity increases, along with cost, and
energy savings. The researchers will have access to some of the latest
enterprise software securely without needing to upgrade their own hardware
systems or expand their data centers, and without the need for on-site
expertise to install and get the tools running. TaaS provides the end user
with sufficient computing resources to use the software, regardless of the
capability of their own hardware. TaaS is able to preserve users' data
from their last session and restore it so they can continue from where
they left off with the software tools.

    "Traditionally, software development tools were installed and run on
workstations and students had access to them only during the Lab hours,"
says Dr. Marin Litoiu, Computer Science Professor, York University. "Tools
as a Service allows the students and researchers to access IBM software
tools anytime and from anywhere, using minimal web infrastructure. Besides
being very convenient for the end users, Tools as a Service enables better
use of university resources, as the same cloud infrastructure can be used
for teaching and research, and by many users."

    The software is deployed on the CERAS cloud computing infrastructure which
is an expandable collection of IBM BladeCenter servers physically located
on the campuses of some of the participating universities and virtualized
by a virtual machine monitor. All of the students and other researchers
participating in this pilot can access the tools on the CERAS cloud
through a single web portal.

    "Organizations of all kinds need smarter ways to manage their IT
infrastructure," says Martin Wildberger, Vice President, IBM Sensor
Solutions and Director, IBM Canada Software Lab. "This cloud computing
pilot enables the participating research institutions to more efficiently
manage their own IT resources, while providing their researchers with easy
and much needed access to industry-leading business software tools."

    CERAS is a research partnership established between IBM Canada's Centre
for Advanced Studies, the Ontario Centres of Excellence, and eight leading
universities to advance the development of next-generation software
services and applications, including software as a service. The fruitful
research results from this collaborative research body were applied in
this commercialized solution of TaaS, whose software engineering
implementation was done by the IBM Centre for Advanced Studies'
Technology Incubation Lab and a post-doctoral fellow and graduate
students of the participating universities.

    Other university related cloud deployments include the October 2008 IBM
and NC State University announcement of the availability of the Virtual
Computing Lab, made available to all educational institutions via the
Apache open source community.

    In addition to this initiative, in October 2007, IBM partnered with Google
to launch the Cloud Computing University Initiative -- an effort to
promote new software development methods and help students and
researchers address the challenges of internet-scale applications in the
future. Dozens of universities in the United States now have access to
this joint cloud computing cluster.

    Ontario Centres of Excellence (OCE) Inc. drives the commercialization of
cutting-edge research across key market sectors to build the economy of
tomorrow and secure Ontario's global competitiveness. In doing this, OCE
fosters the training and development of the next generation of innovators
and entrepreneurs and is a key partner with Ontario's industry,
universities, colleges, research hospitals, investors and governments.
OCE's five Centres work in communications and information technology,
earth and environmental technologies, energy, materials and manufacturing
and photonics.

&lt;p&gt;FULTON, Md.--(Business Wire)--
DocPoint Solutions, (www.docpointsolutions.com), a subsidiary of Quality
Associates, Inc., providing Microsoft SharePoint to organizations that are
looking to expand employee collaboration and increase the exchange of
information, today announced the successful implementation of an electronic
document sharing system for the New Jersey-based Newark Housing Authority. For
the project, DocPoint Solutions implemented Microsoft Office SharePoint Server
(MOSS), which is software that enables employee collaboration via a secure
intranet, along with a custom-designed electronic document management system
(EDMS). 

The MOSS system makes it possible for the 25 employees of Newark`s Housing
Choice Voucher program, which serves about 5,000 families in Newark, to share
documents and files on a secure intranet portal. The EDMS system enables staff
to search for, retrieve, and access needed documentation for program
participants directly from their desktop computers. Additionally, organization
staff now has the ability to readily convert about 850,000 pages of existing
hardcopy documents, which include inspection reports, recertification packages,
tenant and owner identification documents, correspondence, and hearing results. 

The Newark Housing Authority builds and maintains affordable housing to
encourage economic independence and healthy communities. DocPoint Solutions
performed the work under an existing contract with Quadel Consulting
Corporation, which is a national provider of outsourced management, consulting,
and training solutions to the affordable housing industry. In early 2008, the
Newark Housing Authority selected Quadel to assume day-to-day oversight and
management of its Housing Choice Voucher Program. 

Bob Dickerson, vice president, DocPoint Solutions, said, "Organizations that
oversee affordable housing programs typically handle records for thousands of
tenets. They are tasked with keeping track of what can ultimately add up to
millions of hard-copy documents that must be stored and continuously accessed
over the years by numerous staff. Managers are finding that too much of their
staff`s time and productive energy is spent retrieving and filing hard-copy
records. Rather than relying on printed documents, the Newark Housing Authority
Housing Choice Voucher staff has the means to retrieve documents in a matter of
seconds. They also have the ability to add a vast number of files into their new
digital document management system, and share and exchange specific information
using Microsoft SharePoint." 

DocPoint Solutions provides a full range of consultative services, support, and
software for enterprise content management, with a specific focus on providing
Microsoft SharePoint to organizations that are looking to expand employee
collaboration efforts and increase information exchange across the enterprise.
The company primarily provides its services to government agencies, nonprofits,
and corporations. DocPoint holds Certified status in Microsoft`s Partner
Program.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Feb 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has been honored by the Pro Bono
Partnership as an Outstanding Volunteer of 2008.

    The Pro Bono award was bestowed upon IBM in recognition of free legal
assistance the company's attorneys have provided to the Partnership's
clients, which are nonprofit organizations serving the disadvantaged or
working in the public interest in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. In
collaboration with the Pro Bono Partnership, IBM lawyers provide
important business legal services to nonprofits that otherwise are unable
to afford the assistance and counsel of an attorney.

    "IBM has long supported volunteerism and recognized the importance of
community service. During the current challenging economic environment, it
is more important than ever for companies to maintain their commitment to
pro bono activities on behalf of nonprofit organizations," said Robert C.
Weber, senior vice president, Legal and Regulatory Affairs and General
Counsel, IBM. "Working with the Pro Bono Partnership helps provide an
important dimension of our pro bono efforts worldwide. We are honored to
receive this award."

    IBM has been an active supporter of the Pro Bono Partnership since 1997.
In recent years, the company has substantially expanded its pro bono
participation with the Partnership, actively encouraging its lawyers to
volunteer. In addition, Robert Weber and Michelle Browdy, vice president
and assistant general counsel for IBM, joined the Partnership's Board in
2007.

    "We work with volunteers all the time and IBM is one of the best I have
had the pleasure of working with," said Joanna Straub, executive director
of The Volunteer Center of United Way. "Over a two-year period, IBM
helped us consider all the options in a sensitive situation involving a
copyright issue and finally brought the matter to a successful
resolution."

    During the last decade, IBM has been one of the largest corporate
contributors of cash, equipment, and people to nonprofit organizations and
educational institutions around the world and works hand-in-hand with
public and nonprofit organizations to design technology solutions that
address specific problems. This type of volunteer effort goes beyond
business as usual, requiring IBM and grantee organizations to make
significant commitments to work together, set clear benchmarks, and focus
on measurable, achievable goals.

    IBM's global volunteerism initiative is encouraged and supported worldwide
through its On Demand Community, which helps volunteers provide Web-based
solutions and assistance to their communities. Today, On Demand Community
includes 115,047 employees with 5,734,936 volunteer hours logged, and
12,649 retirees with 2,467,723 volunteer hours logged.

    On Demand Community offers access to both IBM technology and talent to
schools, not-for-profit organizations, economic development groups, and
focuses on communities threatened by the digital divide -- the gap between
those who have IT products and skills and those who don't.

infrastructure

    - Provide customers with the ability to create and to manage private
cloud computing

    - Provide customers with virtual storage pooling without the need for
storage area network

    - Provide customers with the ability to deploy remote sites and manage
them all centrally

can provide customers cost-effective storage pooling, both virtual and
physical, for Windows-based applications," said Zane Adam, senior
director of virtualization strategy at Microsoft Corp. "VMex Server
provides a high availability solution for customers deploying Windows
Server 2008 with System Center management suite. The broad Microsoft
software vendor ecosystem is helping break down barriers to

&lt;p&gt;With Full Support for IBM Virtual Client Solutions, Devon IT's Thin Clients
Provide Cost-Effective Approach To Managing and Accessing Virtualized Desktops
KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Devon IT today announced its new line of thin client solutions orderable with
IBM part numbers. Devon has worked directly with IBM to launch this complete
line of thin client solutions that complements IBM's Virtual Client Solutions
(VCS) infrastructure. 

"We are committed to providing industry-leading and cost-effective thin client
technology for users," explained Joe Makoid, President, Devon IT. "When a market
and technology leader like IBM is progressing thin client/hosted client
architecture and collaborate with leaders such as Citrix and VMware it is
obvious that the current approach to desktop computing is shifting. We have
always been proponents of server-centric computing and centralized management as
a way for IT managers to reduce costs dramatically. Devon Thin Clients provide
IBM customers an easy and cost-effective way to order complete hosted desktop
solutions from one source." 

"These economic times require new ideas to solve old problems. The benefits of
server-based desktops are compelling and will address problems like security and
operating costs," said Alex Yost, Vice President and Business Line Executive,
IBM Systems Technology Group. "This alternative to the traditional desktop PC
provides increased security, centralized management, and adds operational
flexibility to desktop computing. The variety of virtual client solutions,
coupled with Devon IT's thin client, is a potent combination that makes it easy
for IT managers to evaluate, assess, and ultimately implement their own
virtualized desktop environments." 

The IBM Virtual Client Solutions bring important benefits to the information
technology (IT) department. In addition to delivering security and control, the
Virtualized Hosted Client Infrastructure will enable companies to support more
users with fewer resources, while offering the best possible desktop experience
from virtually anywhere and on virtually any device. 

Devon's Line of Thin Clients with IBM part numbers provide a complete set of
desktop, mobile and specialized thin client solutions that will meet any end
user requirement. 

TC2

The ultra-small and inexpensive TC2 is an ideal desktop replacement for
businesses looking to downsize their infrastructure and reduce management and
power costs. The small form factor unit consumes only 8 watts and is completely
silent. Despite its size, it is fully-functioned and allows users to connect to
a variety of servers and virtual desktops. The TC2 is exclusively a Devon IT
product and is orderable through IBM using an IBM part number. 

TC5

The TC5 is a next-generation thin client from Devon IT for users who need high
performance from a small footprint client. The TC5 gives users the capability to
use multiple displays with one stateless unit. This ultra-advanced desktop
appliance supports dual DVI video, internal wireless (Optional) and comes with
either the DeTOS Operating System or Windows XP Embedded. The TC5 is exclusively
a Devon IT product and will be orderable through IBM using an IBM part number. 

TC10

The TC10 is the highest performance desktop access device in the world. It is
the first desktop access device that gives the end user a true PC experience
with instant screen updates, full multimedia support, and full USB
compatibility. It connects to IBM's HC10 Workstation Blade using PC-over-IP(tm),
a technology that changes the desktop computing model by enabling desktop
consolidation benefits to be realized across the enterprise. Unlike a
traditional RDP thin client, the TC10 is for demanding users that require real
time PC-like capability such as financial traders and power users such as CAD
engineers. The TC10 is equivalent to the IBM CP20. 

SafeBook LVO

The SafeBook LVO is the next-generation mobile thin client notebook. Built on
the Lenovo ThinkPad platform the SafeBook LVO is available with Windows XP
embedded software and is compatible with Lenovo ThinkPad docking stations and
accessories. The SafeBook LVO is a mobile thin client laptop with no hard drive,
so all sensitive data is protected against loss or theft. With its low purchase
price, low operating and maintenance costs, and reinforced security functions,
the SafeBook LVO offers the latest thin client technology in a lightweight,
mobile notebook. The SafeBook LVO is exclusively a Devon IT product, and is
orderable through IBM using an IBM part number. 

Devon Thin Client Software

Devon's software, which includes its DeTOS operating system and its Thin Manage
management suite allows IT managers to easily create, deploy and manage their
virtual desktop infrastructure. VDI is complex and therefore requires a holistic
management framework to orchestrate the many components required for successful
virtual desktop delivery and management. Devon's suite of software streamlines
and simplifies desktop virtualization deployments, enabling IT organizations to
gain greater management and control, ensure data and asset security, deliver a
superior end-user experience, and provide enterprise business continuity and
cost reductions. 

"We are partnering with IBM to accelerate hosted client solutions like the VCS,"
concluded Makoid. "Our thin clients that are orderable from IBM can help
customers immediately access any application without changing the architecture,
touching the infrastructure or rewriting code and that is exactly what they are
looking for in a secure access hosted client solution."

&lt;p&gt;Panorama Consulting Group Issues Second Part of 2008 ERP Report
DENVER--(Business Wire)--
Tier II enterprise resource planning (ERP) software offers many of the same
benefits as Tier I software but often at a lower cost, according to part two of
a study issued today by Panorama Consulting Group, an independent ERP consulting
firm in Denver. The report reveals that while the majority (77 percent) of
companies surveyed chose Tier I ERP solutions (including SAP, Oracle and
Microsoft products), Tier II solutions actually took less time across the board
and cost significantly less than Oracle and SAP. Further, only the vendor SAP
garnered a higher satisfaction rating (73 percent) than Tier II solutions (70
percent). 

"Tier II vendors have clearly stepped up their strategies to compete with the
`big boys` of Tier I," says Eric Kimberling, president of Panorama Consulting
Group. "But now that the field has more qualified players, the burden is on the
buyer. Savvy companies must take the time to analyze, plan and evaluate all of
their software options before signing with any vendor - no matter how impressive
their pitch." 

Although Tier I and Tier II ERP solutions took similar times to implement, SAP
averaged the longest duration (20 months) while Tier II solutions averaged the
shortest (17.8 months). Of the vendors mentioned in the survey, SAP and Oracle
cost the most with totals averaging $16.8 million and $12.6 million,
respectively. Tier II packages averaged $3.5 million and Microsoft averaged $2.6
million. 

"While it would be easy to speculate that the high ratings and low cost of Tier
II solutions mean they are automatically the best choice for a company, it is
important to note that they also had the highest business risk factor at 61.8
percent. Conversely, the two most popular - and expensive - vendors in our
survey, SAP and Oracle, had the lowest business risk factors (50 percent and
56.9 percent, respectively), " says Kimberling. "When it comes to ERP software
selection, there is just no easy answer or `one-size-fits-all` software. For
instance, although Oracle packages are typically implemented in less time and at
a lower cost than SAP packages, customers are generally more satisfied with SAP.
Third-party consultants can cut through the confusion and help companies
evaluate the risk and reward factors for each option to make the choice that
best suits their needs, expectations and budget."

To offer further analysis of the study results, Kimberling will present the free
webcast, Not All ERP Software is Created Equal: A Comparison of Leading Tier I
and Tier II ERP Software Solutions, on February 26 at 1 p.m. EST.Register for
the seminar athttp://www.panorama-consulting.com/ERPWebcasts.html.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks Williams Companies Inc. (NYSE: WMB) as Bull of the
Day and Waddell &amp; Reed Financial Inc. (NYSE: WDR) as Bear of the Day. In
addition, the analysts at Zacks Equity Research discuss the latest on Citigroup
(NYSE: C), JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and American International Group (NYSE:
AIG). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

Williams Companies Inc.'s (NYSE: WMB) fourth-quarter 2008 earnings were down
significantly from the year-earlier level due to sharp decline in energy
commodity prices, leading to weak results for the E and Midstream businesses. 

Management also lowered guidance and capex budget for 2009, largely in response
to the commodity-price weakness. However, we reiterate our Buy rating on the
company given its strong business mix, attractive growth opportunities in its
low-risk E model, and relatively stable fee-based midstream services. 

Williams also made significant additions to its reserves base while keeping
costs competitive. Our 12-month target price is $20 per share. 

Bear of the Day

Waddell &amp; Reed Financial Inc.'s (NYSE: WDR) 4Q08 adjusted net income came in at
$0.21 per diluted share, 7 pennies below our estimates and consensus. 

The downside was attributable to weaker sales volume across all revenue channels
resulting from sharp decline in assets under management (AUM), heightened by
increased redemptions. AUM declined 20.6% sequentially with 41.8% decline in
overall sales (net of commissions). We anticipate the decline in AUM to continue
to hurt the top line for the next few months, in view of the continued downturn
in the global markets. 

After reviewing the results, we have reduced our FY09 estimate to $0.96 per
share and installed FY10 estimate at $1.17 per share. We maintain a Sell
recommendation on the shares with a 6-month target price of $13.50 per share. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

More Thain in the Forecast

[New York Attorney General Andrew] Cuomo has been investigating whether the
Merrill Lynch's investors were properly informed about the firm's finances and
the $3.6 billion in bonuses its executives received, considering in excess of$15
billion in losses were reported in 4Q08. 

Recently, Mr. Cuomo sent a letter sent to U.S. House Financial Services Chairman
Barney Frank, in which he claimed the bonuses were irresponsible and that BAC
was basically complicit with the awarding of bonuses at Merrill Lynch. We would
expect additional executives from both entities will be required to give
"testimony in due course." 

Also, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper has made a request for
documents regarding BAC's bonuses. Earlier this month, that state's Department
of Justice issued an 11-page "investigative demand" seeking records. BAC is
required to respond by March 4, 2009, as well as a list of Merrill Lynch
employees who received bonuses. 

Consider that BAC and Merrill received government aid several times to offset
losses BAC would absorb with the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. As the CEO of BAC
exhibited trepidation with completing the deal, which the government was
instrumental in orchestrating, we would not be surprised if additional
investigations into other financial institutions that received government funds
will to develop over time. These could include, but would not be limited to,
Citigroup (NYSE: C), JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and American International
Group (NYSE: AIG).

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp outlined plans to offset revenue declines as the PC market shifts to low-cost netbooks, but it failed to announce more cost cuts, sending its shares to an 11-year low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told an analysts' meeting in New York on Tuesday that Microsoft will offer robust versions of its yet-to-be-released Windows 7 operating software for netbooks, as the company looks to boost revenue from these hot-selling, low-cost computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft shares fell more than 3 percent after Ballmer quashed the hopes of some investors for accelerated cost cuts. Microsoft had announced plans to lay off 5,000 workers on January 22 as part of a plan to save $1.5 billion in annual costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it makes sense for us to come back and say, 'Could we take out another $2 billion in costs?'" Ballmer said at the analysts' meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avian Securities Jeff Gaggin said investors were disappointed with Ballmer's decision to hold off on further cost cutting measures, and that he chose not to reassure them that the board will maintain the company's current dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a lot left to interpretation," Gaggin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which a month ago blamed netbooks for weaker-than-expected quarterly profits, said it is planning to ship a low-end version of Windows 7 for netbooks, and make it easy for users to upgrade to more expensive editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will have high market share on netbooks," Ballmer said as he painted a grim outlook for the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I often think of this as an economic reset. It's not a recession from which you recover," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also said he still wants to team up with Yahoo Inc to compete against Internet search giant Google Inc, though he is not interested in buying Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he hopes to discuss a possible search partnership with Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz, and added that he expects Google to start competing with the Windows operating system by offering a version of its Android operating system for laptop computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google launched Android last year as an operating system for smart phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NETBOOK TREND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had partly blamed last quarter's profit shortfall on a shift in personal computer sales to netbooks from full-featured machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the low pricing of netbook software is hurting Windows profits, and estimate that Microsoft only reaps about half the revenue from PC makers for each netbook sold, compared to what it earns on sales of more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Ballmer said he disagreed that growing netbook sales represent "downside" for his company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's goal is to boost its average revenue per netbook by persuading users to pay to upgrade low-end versions of the software to gain features included with more expensive ones in full-featured PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software maker will encourage that by limiting the functionality of low-end versions of the new Windows 7. As an example, Ballmer said Microsoft will restrict the number of programs that a user can run at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netbook sales took off last year as the economy weakened, making their low pricing of $200 to $400 more attractive to consumers. Ballmer said he expects netbook sales to continue to grow as cash-strapped buyers avoid big-ticket, discretionary purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is certainly going to be an economic effect on PC sales," he said. "We cannot control it. It will affect our revenue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most netbooks are now shipped with a stripped down copy of an older generation of Microsoft's operating system, Windows XP, because those machines don't have the computing resources needed to run Windows Vista, the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross Research analyst Richard Williams estimates that Microsoft gets about $35 for each netbook sold with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect Windows 7 to be released before this year's holiday shopping season. Microsoft has declined to give a specific release date, only saying it will be out by January 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 33 cents to $16.88, after hitting an 11-year low of $16.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

law after it combined its Internet Explorer browser and the
Windows operating system. The most serious violations of the law
were upheld on appeal, but the company continued to bundle its
operating system and browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google competes with Microsoft in several markets,
including online search engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pichai wrote that the company hopes its perspective in
launching Chrome will "be useful as the European Commission
evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer
consumers real choices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intervenors traditionally provide background information,
legal theories and proposed remedies to the Commision in cases.

&lt;p&gt;LAKE JACKSON, Texas--(Business Wire)--
In a reversal of the estimate issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce that
retail sales were down 7.7 percent for October through December 2008, in
comparison to the same time period last year2, TDECU saw a 112 percent increase
in its sales of Visa Gift Cards over figures in 2007. Additionally, the load
value increase on TDECU cards was an even more impressive 131 percent, meaning
that not only were consumers buying more gift cards, but they were also spending
more per card. 

In 2007 and 2008, TDECU`s 15 branches were in the top 10 in gift card sales, as
compared across more than 900 financial institutions (some with more than 200
branch locations) served with a gift card program by Meta Payment Systems. 

"We are very pleased with the results of the Visa Gift Card Program this holiday
season," said Ronald O. Wright, Vice President, Payment Systems &amp; Line of Credit
at TDECU. "We saw great gift card sales in 2007, and had high expectations for
2008. The simplicity of the program for both our staff and our members created a
positive retail experience, and has lead to attracting new members as well." 

"It is exciting to see the success TDECU experienced with their holiday Visa
Gift Card Program," commented Mick Conlin, Senior Vice President of Agent
Products at Meta Payment Systems. "Their retail-centric marketing approach of
connecting existing and new credit union members with a valuable gift solution
resulted in record gift card sales volume for TDECU. We are pleased to serve as
a business resource for TDECU, providing and supporting their Visa Gift Card
Program, and we wish them continued success."

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) fell today to its lowest price since
January 1998, after CEO Steve Ballmer warned that challenging market conditions
will persist through the second half of 2009. "I think the economy will be
relatively weak for a relatively long time," predicted Ballmer, speaking at a
financial analysts' meeting in New York. 

Specifically, the software giant expects its second-half earnings and revenue
will decline on a year-over-year basis, and Ballmer said he's continuing to
manage costs carefully -- though he's wary of cutting the budget too deeply, for
fear of hampering innovation.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has dropped an attempt to recoup some severance money from 25 recently fired workers it mistakenly overpaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company, which announced a plan to cut up to 5,000 jobs in January, acknowledged on Sunday that it had tried to get the overpaid workers to return the extra money. But late on Monday, it reversed course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was a mistake on our part," said a Microsoft spokesman in an e-mailed statement. "We should have handled this situation in a more thoughtful manner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is "reaching out to those impacted to relay that we will not seek any payment from those individuals," according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not say what caused the original error in severance payments, or what the amounts involved were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker, feeling the downturn in corporate and consumer spending, laid off 1,400 workers last month, the first of the up to 5,000 jobs it plans to cut over the next 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Full versions of Windows 7 will run on netbooks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * CEO says no immediate plans for more cost cuts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares drop to 11-year low&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft wants to team with Yahoo on search&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft expects Google to offer Android for laptops
 (Adds comments from Ballmer, analysts, share move, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) outlined
plans to offset revenue declines as the PC market shifts to
low-cost netbooks, but it failed to announce more cost cuts,
sending its shares to an 11-year low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told an analysts' meeting in
New York on Tuesday that Microsoft will offer robust versions
of its yet-to-be-released Windows 7 operating software for
netbooks, as the company looks to boost revenue from these
hot-selling, low-cost computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Microsoft shares fell more than 3 percent after Ballmer
quashed the hopes of some investors for accelerated cost cuts.
Microsoft had announced plans to lay off 5,000 workers on Jan.
22 as part of a plan to save $1.5 billion in annual costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think it makes sense for us to come back and say,
'Could we take out another $2 billion in costs?'" Ballmer said
at the analysts' meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Avian Securities Jeff Gaggin said investors were
disappointed with Ballmer's decision to hold off on further
cost cutting measures, and that he chose not to reassure them
that the board will maintain the company's current dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There was a lot left to interpretation," Gaggin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which a month ago blamed netbooks for
weaker-than-expected quarterly profits, said it is planning to
ship a low-end version of Windows 7 for netbooks, and make it
easy for users to upgrade to more expensive editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will have high market share on netbooks," Ballmer said
as he painted a grim outlook for the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I often think of this as an economic reset. It's not a
recession from which you recover," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer also said he still wants to team up with Yahoo Inc
(YHOO.O) to compete against Internet search giant Google Inc
(GOOG.O), though he is not interested in buying Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said he hopes to discuss a possible search partnership
with Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz, and added that he expects Google to
start competing with the Windows operating system by offering a
version of its Android operating system for laptop computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google launched Android last year as an operating system
for smart phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NETBOOK TREND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft had partly blamed last quarter's profit shortfall
on a shift in personal computer sales to netbooks from
full-featured machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say the low pricing of netbook software is hurting
Windows profits, and estimate that Microsoft only reaps about
half the revenue from PC makers for each netbook sold, compared
to what it earns on sales of more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Ballmer said he disagreed that growing netbook sales
represent "downside" for his company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's goal is to boost its average revenue per
netbook by persuading users to pay to upgrade low-end versions
of the software to gain features included with more expensive
ones in full-featured PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software maker will encourage that by limiting the
functionality of low-end versions of the new Windows 7. As an
example, Ballmer said Microsoft will restrict the number of
programs that a user can run at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Netbook sales took off last year as the economy weakened,
making their low pricing of $200 to $400 more attractive to
consumers. Ballmer said he expects netbook sales to continue to
grow as cash-strapped buyers avoid big-ticket, discretionary
purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is certainly going to be an economic effect on PC
sales," he said. "We cannot control it. It will affect our
revenue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most netbooks are now shipped with a stripped down copy of
an older generation of Microsoft's operating system, Windows
XP, because those machines don't have the computing resources
needed to run Windows Vista, the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cross Research analyst Richard Williams estimates that
Microsoft gets about about $35 for each netbook sold with
Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect Windows 7 to be released before this year's
holiday shopping season. Microsoft has declined to give a
specific release date, only saying it will be out by January
2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares fell 33 cents to $16.88, after hitting an
11-year low of $16.36.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs maintained its "cautious"
stance on the U.S. commercial real estate investment trust
(REIT) industry, and said it was shifting its concerns to
retail REITs given the challeges that affect U.S. consumers in
the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While the commercial REIT industry faces refinancing risks,
falling rents and continued dividend cuts on top of high
leverage, retail REITs have to contend with retailers forced to
close underpeforming stores or, worse, file for bankruptcy,
analyst Jonathan Habermann wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commercial real estate trends were eroding at a pace that
suggests occupancy and rental declines should match the deep
recession of the early 1990s, Habermann said, adding that the
industry was likely to enter a prolonged downturn, exacerbated
by high leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For retail REITs, the brokerage said it was concerned over
the reduced demand for space and rent reductions and an
oversupply of community and power centers in growth markets in
the U.S. and retailer bankruptcy risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we like the long lease terms of retail REITs, we
believe the risk of sharply higher vacancy exists with rising
store closing as retailers scale back their store counts," he
noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Habermann also warned that fundamentals for apartment REITs
would worsen far more compared to other property types over the
near-term and said he expects a sharp decline in earnings with
FFO forecasts to fall roughly 30 percent over the next two
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haberman, however, had a "neutral" rating on office REITs,
selectively favoring downtown office REITs over companies with
more suburban office exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haberman said that a change in rating for the industry,
would largely depend on investment returns, or the spread

&lt;p&gt;(Adds more comments from J.P. Morgan and Credit Suisse)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Antonita Madonna Devotta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE Feb 24 (Reuters) - The SP 500 index .SPX
could rise as much as 8 percent in the near term, according to
a JP Morgan Securities strategist who believes the recent sell
off in the index owes more to a capitulation by investors than
fears of nationalization of banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strategist Thomas Lee set a "trading buy" rating and
short-term target of 800 on the index, with a stop-loss at 725.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, the SP 500 index ended at 743.33 points, its
lowest close in 13 years, as concerns grew that the
nationalization of banks is not the right approach to bring the
battered U.S. economy back on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But strategist Lee said the KBW Bank index .BKX has been
relatively flat, while the SP 500 has declined 5 percent since
the middle of last week. If nationalization fears were behind
the sell-off, the KBW Bank index should be lower, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike equities, credit markets have not significantly
declined after the U.S. stimulus package was unveiled. Lee
views this divergence as a positive as credit markets have led
almost every stock market rebound since 1900.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds, seen as a safe haven, have
rallied on deepening concerns about the fragile banking system
and global economy. Recently, they have also risen on
speculation about the nationalization of banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, which
on Monday started higher with speculation of a larger
government stake in Citigroup (C.N), touched a 12-year low on
fears that the bank stabilization plan would not be enough to
keep the economy from sliding into a deeper crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stocks briefly came off lows after the White House
reiterated that a privately held banking system regulated by
the government was still the best way to operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Credit Suisse said on Tuesday stock prices will
largely follow company results until the United States showed
clear signs of a workable scheme for "bad" banks and
insurances, and Japan was willing to pursue aggressive fiscal
easing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cut its target on the SP 500 index to 920
from 1050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to prefer corporate bonds, convertibles and
index linked to equities, but believe investors should be a
small overweight of equities," analyst Andrew Garthwaite wrote
in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stocks may have hit a bottom at current levels as the
geo-political backdrop, corporate cost-cutting policy response
and broader monetary and fiscal policy response are all better
than historic norms, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garthwaite, who believes credit offers "excellent" value,"
echoed J.P. Morgan's Lee's views on the relation between credit
and equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When credit rallies, so normally do equities," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 index rose about 2 percent to 758.39 points
Tuesday morning.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, Calif. &amp; ALBANY, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and the
College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) of the University at Albany
(UAlbany NanoCollege) today announced an agreement to jointly develop process
modeling technology for manufacturing 22 nanometer (nm) logic and memory chips.
The project will combine IBM`s semiconductor technology research and development
leadership and computer modeling expertise with Applied`s semiconductor
processing knowledge to develop predictive models that can help minimize process
variation, reduce development cost, and improve time to market for 22nm
semiconductors. 

FinFET transistors - vertical transistors with fin-shaped silicon channels -
will be used to validate the technology. FinFETs are considered a potential
successor to conventional planar transistors for 22nm chips. 

Today`s most advanced semiconductors have circuitry at 45 nanometers and larger.
Producing circuits at 22nm becomes more challenging since current lithography
methods - the process for creating circuit patterns on silicon wafers - present
physical limitations for critical chip layers. To help overcome these
limitations, IBM has led an initiative known as Computational Scaling.
Computational-based processes developed by IBM use advanced mathematical
techniques, software tools and high-performance computing systems to enable the
production of complex, powerful and energy-efficient semiconductors at 22
nanometers and beyond. 

"IBM pioneered the use of high-performance computing and predictive modeling to
overcome the physical limitations of optical lithography," said Gary Patton,
vice president, IBM Semiconductor Research and Development Center. "To meet the
challenges of 22nm, we need to model the entire physical structure of the
transistor, and this is now possible with the advent of ultra-powerful,
petascale computer processing. By combining Applied`s thin film deposition and
etch processing expertise and CNSE`s fundamental science know-how with IBM`s
capabilities, we can extend our modeling beyond lithography to help deliver a
more complete and validated manufacturing process." 

IBM brings to the collaboration more than 50 years of semiconductor technology
experience and a proven track record of technology development and manufacturing
that can help accelerate development of 22nm technology and beyond. End-to-end
integration - from design to manufacturing to characterization and test - gives
IBM the ability to leverage process insights for outstanding modeling and
excellent results in hardware. 

Developing a chip manufacturing process for a new technology node involves
complex interactions among multiple process variables, fabrication disciplines,
and circuit requirements. With circuit features just a few hundred atoms across,
the interactions of each process variable must be taken into account. For
advanced technology nodes, this can lead to costly production experiments that
consume many thousands of semiconductor wafers. The goal is to develop
computational models to perform most of these experiments in a "virtual"
laboratory, greatly reducing the need for actual wafer processing. 

"The next big scaling challenge is to give these ultra-small transistors
consistent geometry and electrical properties which define the speed,
reliability and power consumption of a device," said Hans Stork, Group Vice
President and Chief Technology Officer of Applied`s Silicon Systems Group. "The
key to reducing this variability is to integrate and optimize every fabrication
step to precisely construct and repeat the critical transistor geometry. By
using Applied`s process knowledge to validate and refine IBM`s predictive
modeling, we plan to bring this new technology to market in a shorter time, with
less risk and at a lower development cost than traditional experimental
methods." 

Applied has production-proven processing systems and a wealth of technology
expertise covering the additional steps that are to be included in the FinFET
model. Applied`s award-winning Producer APF and Producer PECVD systems will
deposit the Advanced Patterning Film (APF), oxide and nitride hard mask layers
with tunable thickness, density, reflectivity and stress, while the Applied
Centura Enabler and AdvantEdge etch systems offer closed-loop CD trim, and
optimum etch rate and selectivity for excellent global profile control and CD
uniformity. 

"The UAlbany NanoCollege looks forward to building on our relationship with IBM
and Applied Materials for the development of leading-edge process modeling
methods that are critical for the development and manufacturing of 22nm chips,"
said Richard Brilla, Vice President for Strategy, Alliances and Consortia at
CNSE. "This collaboration will extend current research at CNSE`s Albany NanoTech
to validate fundamental process modeling work for future technology nodes,
accelerating the integration of advanced processing and innovative
nanoelectronics research and development that is necessary for scaling amid the
growing complexity of next-generation transistors." 

The research will be carried out primarily at CNSE`s Albany NanoTech Complex in
Albany, NY, where Applied has a full suite of leading-edge processing tools and
a staff of engineers and scientists. Additional modeling and process
characterization will be performed at IBM`s facilities in East Fishkill and
Yorktown, NY, Applied`s Maydan Technology Center in Sunnyvale, CA and the
Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations (CCNI) at the Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Feb 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM's (NYSE: IBM) Global Supply Chain study, based on face-to-face
interviews with nearly 400 supply chain executives in 25 countries,
reveals that 70 percent say their number one challenge is overwhelming
and fragmented data, as well as a lack of ability to make sense out of
the information. However fixing this "visibility" problem is low on
action plans because it is costly, difficult, silos are worse than ever
and respondents say they are just too busy.

    Supply chain leaders understand the threat of information blind spots, but
they are only cautiously optimistic that they are taking steps to use
their valuable information for real competitive advantage. Just 16 percent
indicated that they are effective at integration and visibility of
information across the supply chain with external partners.

    The study shows the greatest opportunity for these executives are smart
devices and integrated ERP systems that capture real time visibility:
forecasts/orders, schedules/commitments, pipeline inventory, and shipment
lifecycle status. Automating real-time detection with smart devices
increases flexibility, speed and accuracy to promote better
decision-making.

    The Global Supply Chain study, titled The Smarter Supply Chain of the
Future, was developed by IBM Global Business Services' Supply Chain
Management Practice in conjunction with the IBM Institute for Business
Value, which develops fact-based strategic insights for senior business
executives. Supply chain executives in 29 industries participated in
structured interviews and candidly talked about their most serious
challenges.

    Risk Management - A Looming Concern

    According to the study, the number two issue for these executives is the
having the visibility and flexibility to manage risk, with 60 percent of
respondents saying risk is escalating as a concern. The last decade has
been peppered with wake-up calls: tainted food and toys, random acts of
terrorism and, most recently, the dramatic downturn in global economics,
which will destabilize supply chains as trading partners retrench or fail.

    Among the respondents, 38 percent manage risk and supply chain performance
in some manner, but with separate tools and processes. Executives cite the
lack of standardized processes, insufficient data and inadequate
technologies as the chief stumbling blocks preventing effective risk
management. The most successful supply chain executives are incorporating
risk management into their plans, and using analytical predictive tools to
mitigate risk, and identify new opportunities.

    "As important as cheaper, faster, better is, this year, we're beginning to
hear a new verse -- a clear message about the overwhelming need for
greater visibility and flexibility to manage risk," said Sanjeev Nagrath,
Global Leader, Supply Chain Management, IBM Global Business Services. "A
crisis in one country or region can now ripple very quickly across the
world economy, creating tremendous turbulence. As supply chains have
become more complex, global and stressed, the executives we spoke with
believe they must drive far more intelligence throughout their supply
chains if they are going to anticipate, rather than react."

    IBM's report calls for a future supply chain that is thoroughly
instrumented, interconnected and intelligent. It brings together the
ability of human know-how and technological excellence to make optimal use
of machine-generated data -- flowing out of sensors, RFID tags, meters,
actuators, and GPS. The entire supply chain will be connected -- not just
among customers, suppliers and IT systems in general, but also parts,
products and other smart objects used to monitor events within the supply
chain. In addition, supply chain decisions will be more intelligent on two
fronts -- automated for real time responses to a range of external stimuli
and also removing latency and increasing the certainty about the outcomes
of actions taken by business decision makers.

    In addition, the leadership function will become more strategic. According
to the supply chain executives who were interviewed for the study, most
are overseeing traditional functions like distribution and logistics (77
percent), demand/supply planning (72 percent), and sourcing and
procurement (63 percent). But some are rising to the level of a chief
supply chain officer, taking a place in the C-Suite and orchestrating
strategy through execution in the complexities of today's global supply
chains in an ever-increasingly volatile marketplace.

    IBM says the evolving role of the chief supply chain executive will also
become "chief collaborator," bringing together stakeholders (even those
outside the extended supply chain, like regulators, financial
organizations and governments) and facilitating joint planning and risk
mitigation. Negotiation and stakeholder management skills will be
components of the future supply chain expertise.

&lt;p&gt;It is Estimated That This Program Could Create 400,000 New Jobs for US Workers
and Inject $20 Billion into the US Economy over the Next Five Years
BOCA RATON, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
At a time when many US companies are finding it difficult to obtain business
finance, immigrants from all over the world could be coming to the rescue if the
EB-5 immigrant investor visa pilot program, that promotes such investment, is
extended by Congress. The EB-5 visa pilot program is set to expire on March 9th
2009. 

The current rules of the program require each immigrant investor to show that
the invested funds will create ten American jobs. In addition, applicants have
to pass extensive background checks and prove the source of their investment to
qualify. Immigrants investing $500,000 in a federally designated regional center
can be eligible for a Green Card and ultimately US citizenship. 

"With so many EB5 regional center investments to choose from, immigrant
investors fearful of choosing the wrong investment and potentially losing their
money, are turning more now to independent specialists to guide them," said
Stephen Parnell joint managing partner of Which EB5, (www.WhichEB5.com) an
organization specializing in assisting immigrant investors. 

Regional centers already approved by the USCIS (the government agency overseeing
the program) range from restoration of ship yards, funding restoration of
redundant military facilities, dairy farming, warehouse conversions, film
studios and more. 

"European investors wishing to immigrate to the US have described the program as
a win-win for everyone," said Andrew Bartlett an independent relocation
consultant. Mr. Bartlett`s clients have found that other immigration options,
"just don`t offer enough options to those looking to live and be self-supporting
in the USA."

About Which EB5 

The Principals of Which EB5 are advocates of immigrant investors and have chosen
to be independent by not representing any one regional center. They have worked

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co, the second-largest U.S. bank, slashed its common stock dividend 87 percent on Monday, a surprise move by a lender considered among the strongest in the U.S. financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank also said it has been "solidly profitable" this quarter, and that the outlook for the three-month period is "roughly in line" with analyst forecasts. Shares rose 5.5 percent in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said its decision to lower its quarterly dividend to 5 cents per share from 38 cents will save $5 billion of common equity a year. It hopes the lowered payout will help it pay back the $25 billion of capital it got in October from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Extraordinary times must call for extraordinary measures," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call. He said JPMorgan was "not asked by anybody" to cut the payout, but did so out of a "normal abundance of caution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan, a Dow Jones industrial average .DJI component, rose $1.08 to $20.59 after-hours, after falling 39 cents during regular trading. The New York-based lender announced the dividend cut after U.S. markets closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will accept a lower dividend if they are able to repay the government faster," said Chris Armbruster, senior analyst at Al Frank Asset Management in Laguna Beach, California, which owns JPMorgan shares. "The sooner they get out from that, the better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan expects in the first quarter to record about $2 billion of credit costs and writedowns at its investment bank, to boost reserves for credit cards and home lending, and to write down about $400 million in its private equity business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said earnings expectations are "on track" from its September purchase of the banking units of failed lender Washington Mutual Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, expected JPMorgan to post a quarterly profit of 35 cents per share on revenue of $21.96 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTHER BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan's largest rivals, have slashed their quarterly dividends to a penny per share since November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each has gotten $45 billion of TARP money since October, and unlike JPMorgan also got a government bailout that capped losses on billions of dollars of toxic assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the dividend cut reflects the potential, not the certainty, for a "highly stressed environment" of a two-year economic recession where the U.S. unemployment rate rises above 10 percent, and home prices fall 40 percent from their peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it hopes to return to a "more normalized" dividend when the environment stabilizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It puts us in a position to do it sooner," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a prudent use of capital," said Bill Fitzpatrick, an analyst at Optique Capital Management in Milwaukee, which owns the bank's shares. "It's difficult to raise new capital, so this is an excellent source of funds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts have said Wells Fargo  Co, which is the fourth-largest U.S. bank and received $25 billion of TARP money, may cut its 34 cents per share quarterly dividend, which equates to a 12.3 percent yield. Spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would not be surprised in the slightest to see more dividend cuts, especially from banks that haven't done it, and those heavily reliant on government funds," Armbruster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by Euan Rocha, Jonathan Spicer and Dan Wilchins; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Bernard Orr, Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SHELTON, CT, Feb 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CYA Technologies, an enChoice(R) company, today announced the
availability of CYA SmartRecovery(TM) version 3.0.1 for IBM(R) FileNet(R)
P8 4.0. This new release empowers FileNet P8 4.0 customers using the IBM
DB2 data server to protect their P8 investment and facilitate compliance
by ensuring the continuous integrity, recoverability and accessibility of
repository information.

    CYA SmartRecovery, also available for IBM FileNet P8 3.5, gives P8 users
confidence in the integrity of their information assets by performing hot,
synchronized backups that preserve the relationships between content and
its associated metadata (audit trails, digital signatures, workflows,
etc.). It safeguards organizations against information loss and corruption
caused by logical failures, enabling one, several, or thousands of objects
to be restored back into the repository in their original state without
taking P8 offline. Furthermore, it complements existing backup solutions
by enabling companies to significantly improve recovery time objectives
(RTOs), and achieve recovery point objectives (RPOs) of 15 minutes in the
event of a disaster.

    "Obtaining synchronized backups of repository information within stringent
or non-existent backup windows is a thorn in the side of many P8
customers," said Mike Fernandes, director of product management and
services for CYA Technologies. "Adding support for DB2 furthers our
commitment to provide all P8 users with the means to fully protect their
information assets from compliance risk, revenue loss, and other
ramifications of logical failures without impacting their ability to do
business."

million writedown in private equity)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Dividend cut to 5 cents per share from 38 cents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan expects "solidly profitable" first quarter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares rise 5.5 percent after-hours
 (New throughout, adds byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N),
the second-largest U.S. bank, slashed its common stock dividend
87 percent on Monday, a surprise move by a lender considered
among the strongest in the U.S. financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also said it has been "solidly profitable" this
quarter, and that the outlook for the three-month period is
"roughly in line" with analyst forecasts. Shares rose 5.5
percent in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said its decision to lower its quarterly dividend
to 5 cents per share from 38 cents will save $5 billion of
common equity a year. It hopes the lowered payout will help it
pay back the $25 billion of capital it got in October from the
government's Troubled Asset Relief Program faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Extraordinary times must call for extraordinary measures,"
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call. He said
JPMorgan was "not asked by anybody" to cut the payout, but did
so out of a "normal abundance of caution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan, a Dow Jones industrial average .DJI
component, rose $1.08 to $20.59 after-hours, after falling 39
cents during regular trading. The New York-based lender

write down about $400 million in its private equity business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said earnings expectations are "on track" from its
September purchase of the banking units of failed lender
Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expected JPMorgan to post a quarterly
profit of 35 cents per share on revenue of $21.96 billion,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OTHER BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N),
JPMorgan's largest rivals, have slashed their quarterly
dividends to a penny per share since November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each has gotten $45 billion of TARP money since October,
and unlike JPMorgan also got a government bailout that capped
losses on billions of dollars of toxic assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said the dividend cut reflects the potential, not the

dividend cuts, especially from banks that haven't done it, and
those heavily reliant on government funds," Armbruster said.

&lt;p&gt;Wheatstone Moves a Step Closer to Commercialization
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced the successful results of a
seven-well exploration and appraisal program for the Wheatstone and Iago fields
in northwest Australia. Following the completion and analysis of the appraisal
program, the fields are estimated to hold enough natural gas resources to
support a two-train Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) and domestic gas
project. 

George Kirkland, executive vice president, Chevron Global Upstream and Gas,
said, "The success with the recent appraisal program moves the Wheatstone
project a step closer to commercialization. The Wheatstone project offers a
strategic opportunity for Chevron and third parties to develop natural gas
resources in the western Carnarvon Basin, as well as deliver energy, jobs and
economic benefits to Australia." 

Chevron announced plans to locate the Wheatstone project at Ashburton North near
Onslow in late 2008 and expects to enter front-end engineering and design in the
second half of 2009. 

"The Wheatstone project, together with Gorgon, is an important part of Chevron`s
strategy to develop its large natural gas resource base in Australia and be a
leading supplier of LNG. In support of these two major capital projects, the
company intends to undertake its largest-ever drilling campaign in Australia,"
Kirkland added. 

Discovered in 2004, the wholly owned Wheatstone Field is located in the WA-253-P
and WA-17-R permit areas. The field is 125 miles (200 kilometers) north of
Onslow in water depths of around 650 feet (200 meters). The adjacent Iago Field
was discovered in 2000 and spans two retention permits, WA-17-R, which is wholly
owned by Chevron Australia, and WA-16-R, in which Shell Development (Australia)
Pty Ltd. has a one-third share, with Chevron holding the remainder. 

The offshore northwest shelf of Australia is one of four exploration focus areas
for Chevron. During 2009, Chevron plans to conduct a large drilling program with
two rigs scheduled to drill multiple exploration and appraisal wells in its
operated acreage. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

 (Recasts first paragraph, updates prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks headed for a
modest bounce at the open on Tuesday, with investors likely to
scour  the market for beaten-down shares in sectors such as
financials after Wall Street skidded to a 12-year low a day
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark SP 500 index .SPX will start the regular
session less than three points from a fresh bear market low,
raising the potential for the market to sink on any fresh signs
of economic gloom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gains from bargain-hunting could be tempered by caution,
however, with key economic reports set to show consumer
confidence again hit a record low in February and further
deterioration in housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even so, shares of JPMorgan (JPM.N) climbed 5.2 percent to
$20.53 before the bell after Citigroup raised its first-quarter
profit view on the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the bell on Monday JPMorgan announced an 87 percent
cut in its dividend to conserve capital and said it has been
"solidly profitable" this quarter. Bank of America (BAC.N) rose
2.6 percent to $4.01 before the bell while Citigroup (C.N)
shares added 4.7 percent to $2.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a little bit of a bounce after yesterday's steep
declines on bargain hunting," said Peter Cardillo, chief market
economist at Avalon Partners in New York. "But again we are in
a technical breakdown. The market is full of fear. The downward
trend has still not been broken."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 rose 1.70 points, and were above
fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 climbed
17 points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures gained 4.75 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Year-to-date, the SP 500 index is down 17.7 percent, and
off 52.1 percent from the October 2007 record peak, a drop
stemming largely from worries about the deepening recession and
concerns about the health of the banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In earnings news, leading U.S. home improvement retailer
Home Depot Inc (HD.N) posted a fourth-quarter operating profit
above Wall Street's estimates. For more see [ID:nN24342453].
The stock was up almost 6 percent to $19.80 before the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Reuters data, the SP 500 is at its most
oversold in three months when measured by its 50-day relative
strength index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Testimony from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
may offer clues on additional steps that could be taken to halt
a sharp dive in the economy and he will likely be pressed on
government plans to clean up the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is due to deliver the Fed's semiannual monetary policy
report to Congress over two days, starting at 10 a.m. (1500
GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP/Case-Shiller Home Price Index for December and the
fourth quarter is due at 9 a.m. (1400 GMT), while a report on
consumer confidence is due at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).

The decision to terminate these programs will enable the Business Unit to
allocate additional resources to higher-potential development programs as part
of its continuing effort to deliver greater value to patients and Pfizer
shareholders. 

After reviewing the results of the first Phase 3 study for PD 332,334 for the
treatment of GAD and the existing data for esreboxetine for the treatment of
fibromyalgia, along with current market dynamics, it was considered unlikely
that either compound would provide meaningful benefit to patients beyond the
current standard of care. Neither compound was terminated due to safety reasons.


"While confident in the safety of these compounds, we don`t believe that they
provide significant benefit over other therapies," said Pedro Lichtinger,
President and General Manager, Pfizer`s Primary Care Business Unit. 

Mr. Lichtinger continued, "In Primary Care, we continually review our portfolio
to ensure we are developing medicines in areas of unmet need and have found
significant potential opportunities to bring more value to patients and our
company. For example, we are advancing the investigational compound tanezumab
into areas of pain management beyond osteoarthritis and see potential
opportunities for other investigational compounds in other areas of significant
patient need, including Alzheimer`s disease and thrombosis. Our goal is to use
our resources efficiently and effectively to continue to deliver medical
innovations to the global health community." 

Pfizer will continue to pursue an indication for Lyrica (pregabalin) CV in the
treatment of GAD,a chronic disorder characterized by persistent anxiety,
exaggerated worry and tension that results in impairment of daily function. 

Pfizer is a pioneer in the study of treatments for fibromyalgia, a condition of
chronic widespread pain. In June 2007, Lyrica (pregabalin) CV became the first
FDA-approved treatment for the management of fibromyalgia, and Pfizer continues
to support research and education in this complex pain condition. 

Pfizer is notifying all clinical trial investigators involved in studies of both
esreboxetine and PD 332,334 to determine the best course of action for their
patients. Patients participating in any of these studies should contact their
clinical investigational site should they have any questions or concerns. --

&lt;p&gt;New Solution Extends Application Lifecycle Capabilities to Oracle Database
Professionals
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Quest Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: QSFT) announced today at VSLive! San Francisco
that it will offer an Oracle Database Schema Provider for the upcoming release
of Microsoft Visual Studio Team System (VSTS) 2010. Quest`s new tool provides
Oracle support for VSTS, enabling Oracle developers to fully participate with
other VSTS team members throughout the entire application lifecycle. 

"We are pleased to have Quest Software supporting Visual Studio Team System
2010," said Jason Zander, general manager of Visual Studio Developer Division,
Microsoft Corp. "With this forthcoming solution, Oracle developers will be able
to take full advantage of the benefits of Visual Studio Team System." 

Previously, Oracle professionals could not benefit from the vast improvements in
communication and workflow that VSTS offers. Oracle development in VSTS was
limited, involved time-consuming manual processes, and did not support the
system`s new offline database development and design paradigm. With Quest`s new
tool, VSTS can now support both Oracle and SQL Server databases. 

The new Database Schema Provider enables Oracle developers to perform offline
design, development and change management in VSTS, and integrate their changes
into the application`s automated build schedule. This capability ensures that
all database changes are managed and tracked in the system, unifying Oracle
professionals with the rest of their organization`s VSTS team. 

"We see a real need in the developer community for Oracle support on Visual
Studio Team System, and are working closely with Microsoft to provide a solution
that will allow Oracle developers to work alongside other Visual Studio Team
System users," said Larry Humphries, vice president and general manager of
database management, Quest Software. "The release of the Database Schema
Provider will bring real value to this market, and underscores Quest Software`s
continued support for Oracle database professionals." 

To find out more about the Database Schema Provider for Oracle databases or to
register for the upcoming beta program, visit www.quest.com/VSTS. Additional
information may also be found at www.TeamFuze.net, the new community for Oracle
professionals working in VSTS.

&lt;p&gt;SecureSphere Database Gateway for z/OS Monitors All Activity by Privileged
Users, Network Users, and Applications on DB2 Platform
REDWOOD SHORES, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Imperva&#174;, the leader in application data security, today announced SecureSphere
Database Gateway for z/OS (DGZ), which provides comprehensive monitoring,
auditing, and protection for DB2 databases running on z/OS mainframes. Imperva
DGZ monitors local and network activity by privileged users, non-privileged
users, and applications to prevent data loss, fraud, and automate regulatory
compliance reporting. 

According to a Forrester Research report, "Today, database security is a lot
more challenging than it was a decade ago largely because compliance
requirements are more pressing and more complex. Enterprises are dealing with
tougher regulatory compliance requirements such as the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA),
the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard (PCI DSS). In addition, since compliance requirements do not offer
guidelines, confusion exists around what needs to be done to make databases more
secure in order to comply."1

Mainframe environments, which contain the crown jewels of an organization and
support transactional and financial enterprise applications, present unique
security and audit challenges since they cannot afford downtime or system
latency. SecureSphere DGZ provides comprehensive security and an iron-clad audit
trail covering all paths into and out of DB2 databases on the z/OS platform.
Network activity is captured directly by SecureSphere, while local activity by
privileged users and administrators is collected through the integration of IBM
Audit Management Expert (AME), a native tool specifically developed for IBM z/OS
environments. 

"Mainframes typically house an organization`s most critical IT assets -
sensitive data, financial and human resources applications, and enterprise
resource planning (ERP) systems," said Amichai Shulman, CTO of Imperva.
"Traditional approaches for monitoring and auditing activity, especially by
privileged users, on mainframe databases often require installing agents that
can impact performance and availability. SecureSphere Database Gateway for z/OS
combines native and very stable IBM technology to capture local activity with
Imperva`s award-winning network-based security platform to provide complete
visibility and protection for DB2 on the mainframe." 

360 Degree Visibility for Compliance and Protection

To automate regulatory compliance tasks, SecureSphere DGZ maintains a complete
and tamper proof record of all activity on DB2 databases. The SecureSphere DGZ
audit trail includes details on schema changes (DDL), data changes (DML),
privilege granting and revoking (DCL), and security exceptions such as failed
logins and SQL errors. The audit trail is supported by a powerful reporting
engine that includes regulation-specific reports for PCI DSS, SOX, HIPAA, as
well as customizable analytics. 

To prevent data breaches and data loss, SecureSphere DGZ monitors inbound and
outbound DB2 traffic for suspicious activity. Network-based traffic, including
queries and responses from web applications, is inspected and audited by
SecureSphere, while local activity is collected by IBM AME. These integrated
capabilities provide comprehensive visibility for auditing activity from any
source, with minimal impact on monitored z/OS systems. 

When deployed together, the SecureSphere DGZ and web application firewall (WAF)
is the only integrated platform that can correlate and protect against attacks
that span multiple application tiers, such as a complex SQL injection string. 

Availability

The Imperva SecureSphere Database Gateway for z/OS is available now from Imperva
and its business partners worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;Now Customers Can Confidently Improve Efficiency of Existing Third-Party Storage
Environments With NetApp V-Series
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In an effort to help customers maximize the value of their existing storage
investments, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) today announced the industry`s first-ever
Guarantee* Program for installed third-party storage. As an addition to NetApp`s
existing Virtualization Guarantee Program, which was introduced in September
2008, NetApp is offering a guarantee that customers will decrease their
non-NetApp primary storage capacity for virtual server environments by 35% using
NetApp V-Series and deduplication technology. 

Now customers have more ways to save with NetApp`s Virtualization Guarantee
Program. Customers can take advantage of NetApp`s guarantee that they will use
50% less storage in their VMware, Citrix, and Microsoft virtual environments
with NetApp storage compared to traditional storage arrays. Alternatively, for
customers that already own EMC, IBM, HP, or HDS storage systems, NetApp will
reduce redundant copies of their primary data by at least 35% with NetApp
V-Series. 

"Customers are stretching their budgets and looking to lower their overall
infrastructure costs while minimizing the risk of their IT investments," said
Jay Kidd, chief marketing officer of NetApp. "While server virtualization is a
way for customers to achieve greater efficiency in the data center, NetApp
further fulfills this promise with our storage efficiency capabilities that help
not only save space and cost but also minimize risk of their storage
investments. Now we`re assuring customers that they can realize efficiencies
with our competitors' storage using NetApp V-Series. No other storage vendor is
willing or able to match this guarantee." 

Now NetApp customers can achieve greater storage capacity utilization on
inefficient systems that they already purchased and deployed and tap into the
unrealized potential of their existing storage infrastructures. NetApp provides
the most complete storage efficiency technologies for virtual server
environments so that customers can improve protection of their data assets, buy
less storage, and reduce their overall power, space, and cooling costs in their
data centers. 

NetApp V-Series is an open storage controller that unifies NetApp and non-NetApp
storage under a common storage architecture. V-Series enables customers to take
full advantage of the benefits of the powerful features of Data ONTAP such as
deduplication, thin provisioning, and Snapshot technology, to improve storage
efficiency and dramatically simplify data management. NetApp deduplication has
become one of the fastest growing technologies in the company's history, with
more than 28,000 systems deployed across all tiers of data, including primary,
backup, and archival. 

Availability and Requirements

Customers anywhere in the world who purchase a new V-Series system for their
virtual desktop and server environment, including Citrix XenServer, VMware ESX,
and Microsoft Windows Server Hyper-V, can take advantage of this program. If
customers don't improve their storage capacity on competitive storage systems by
at least 35% with NetApp V-Series and deduplication (and after following
established best practices implemented by NetApp Professional Services), NetApp
will provide the additional storage capacity needed to meet customers`
shortfall, valued up to 35% of the original controller purchased, at no
additional charge*. Qualifying service delivery is available from NetApp Global
Services or participating Authorized Professional Service Partners in networked
storage for virtualized platforms. 

For more information, visit www.netapp.com/guarantee, where you can access
program details including FAQs, technical resources, best practices, and the new
NetApp Storage Efficiency Calculator to evaluate your current environment and
learn how NetApp storage efficiency technologies can lead to higher storage
utilization.

&lt;p&gt;First Quarter Financial Performance Quarter-to-Date is Solidly Profitable;
Company Positioned Well for the Future

Dividend Action is Being Taken as a Precautionary Step to Maximize Capital and
Operational Flexibility and to Protect Fortress Balance Sheet Even If Conditions
Worsen Significantly


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan Chase today announced that the Board of Directors has reduced the
company`s quarterly common stock dividend from $0.38 to $0.05 per share,
effective for the dividend payable April 30, 2009, to shareholders of record on
April 6, 2009. The Board anticipates maintaining this level for the time being.
This action will enable the company to retain an additional $5 billion in common
equity per year. 

First-quarter 2009 financial performance quarter-to-date is solidly profitable
even after significant additions to reserves, and the outlook for the quarter is
roughly in line with analyst expectations. 

"While we recognize our tremendous obligation to shareholders to maintain
dividend levels, we also understand that extraordinary times require
extraordinary measures. Our action today is being done as a strong precautionary
measure to help ensure that our fortress balance sheet remains intact - even if
conditions worsen significantly. As always, our highest obligation during an
economic crisis is to keep our company and franchise healthy, vibrant and strong
for the future," said Jamie Dimon, Chief Executive Officer. 

"While our performance and capital are already strong, today`s action provides
us with maximum flexibility to protect our company in a more highly stressed
environment and to continue to build and invest in our market-leading
businesses. Today`s capital action is not directly related to TARP. Our reason
for accepting TARP capital still holds -- namely to help stabilize the banking
system and economy. The decision to retain additional common equity does,
however, help position our company to repay TARP as soon as is prudent -- and
still maintain a strong capital position. Our repayment of TARP will ultimately
be worked out in consultation with the U.S. Treasury and other regulators, and
in consideration of the best interests of the banking system overall," Dimon
added. 

The company said it hopes to return to a more normalized dividend payout ratio
as soon as feasible after the environment has stabilized.

&lt;p&gt;  BURBANK, CA, Feb 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Diskeeper Corporation, innovators in performance and reliability
technologies, today announced it has again attained Gold Certified
Partner status for 2009 and 2010 in the Microsoft Partner Program. With
competency in ISV (Independent Software Vendor) Solutions, Infrastructure
Solutions and Small Business Specialist, Diskeeper Corporation is
recognized for expertise and impact in the technology marketplace. As a
Gold Certified Partner, Diskeeper Corporation has demonstrated expertise
with Microsoft technologies and a proven ability to meet customers'
needs. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners receive a rich set of benefits,
including access, training and support, giving them a competitive
advantage in the channel.

    As the manufacturers of the number one automatic defragmentation(1)
software in the world, Diskeeper Corporation has had a long-standing
rapport and relationship with Microsoft, attaining Gold Partner status
once the program was unveiled. As a source code licensee, Diskeeper
Corporation has been with Microsoft since the very release of Windows
3.51 -- even writing the operating system API hooks that allow
defragmentation to take place safely online. Other recent partnerships
with Microsoft include Windows Home Server and Hyper V. Attaining Gold
Partner Certification for the eighth year in a row is a testament to
Diskeeper Corporation's commitment to providing their customers with
unparalleled products and support.

    "We are extremely pleased to have achieved Gold Certified Partner status
in the Microsoft Partner Program for yet another year. This allows us to
clearly promote our expertise and relationship with Microsoft to our
customers," said Warren Brunk, Vice President of Information Technology.
"The benefits provided through our Gold Certified Partner status will
allow us to continue to provide our customers with exceptional products,
service and support."

    "Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap
between their business demands and technology capabilities," said Allison
Watson, Corporate Vice President of the Worldwide Partner Group at
Microsoft Corp. "They need to trust in a company that can act as an expert
adviser for their long-term strategic technology plans. Microsoft Gold
Certified Partners, which have certified expertise and direct training and
support from Microsoft, can build a positive customer experience with our
technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes Diskeeper Corporation again as a
valued Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its expertise in providing
customer satisfaction using Microsoft products and technology."

    As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status,
Diskeeper Corporation had to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft
Competencies are designed to help differentiate a partner's capabilities
with specific Microsoft technologies to customers looking for a particular
type of solution. Each Competency has a unique set of requirements and
benefits, formulated to accurately represent the specific skills and
services that partners bring to the technology industry. Within select
competencies, there are specializations that focus on specific solution
areas that recognize deeper expertise within that competency. Serving as a
specialized path to earning those competencies, specializations give
direct access to the tools and resources that support that specific area
of focus.

    The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and focus
partners bring to a particular solution set. Microsoft Gold Certified
Partners that have obtained this competency have a successful record of
developing and marketing packed software based on Microsoft technologies.

    "Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to better
enable ISVs to meet customer needs," said Sanjay Parthasarathy, Corporate
Vice President of the Developer and Platform Evangelism Group at
Microsoft Corp. "They allow ISVs to keep and win customers through their
deep knowledge of solutions-based Microsoft platform technologies.
Microsoft has a long history of working closely with ISV partners to help
them deliver compelling solutions and applications to our mutual
customers, and the Microsoft Competencies are an important step in
continuing to enhance vital relationships with ISVs worldwide."

    The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and represents
Microsoft's ongoing commitment to the success of partners worldwide. The
program offers a single, integrated partnering framework that recognizes
partner expertise, rewards the total impact that partners have in the
technology marketplace, and delivers more value to help partners'
businesses be successful.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades two classes of J.P. Morgan Commercial Mortgage Finance
Corp.'s mortgage pass-through certificates, series 1998-C6, as follows: 

--$19.9 million class G to 'CCC/DR1' from 'B-'; 

--$2.4 million class H to 'C/DR6' from 'C/DR5'. 

Additionally, Fitch affirms and revises the Outlook for the following class: 

--$39.8 million class F at 'BBB-'; Outlook to Negative from Stable. 

Fitch also affirms the following with a Stable Outlook: 

--Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; 

--$1.3 million class C at 'AAA'; 

--$47.8 million class D at 'AAA'; 

--$15.9 million class E at 'AAA'. 

Classes A1, A2, A3 and B have paid in full. 

The downgrades and Negative Outlook are due to the transfer of the second
largest loan (20.3%) to special servicing on Feb. 18, 2009, and also due to the
concentrated nature of the pool. 

The affirmations and Stable Outlooks are warranted due to increased credit
enhancement since issuance as a result of paydown. As of the February 2009
distribution date, the pool's aggregate balance has decreased 84% to $127.1
million from $796.4 million at issuance. 

The recently transferred specially serviced loan is secured by a retail plaza in
Deptford, NJ. The loan transferred to special servicing for imminent default and
the borrower and special servicer are currently discussing workout options.
Occupancy at the property as of September 2008 was 56%. The property had a large
space vacated by Circuit City. Another space was vacated by Sam's Club; however,
they plan to continue paying rent through rent expiration in August 2010. Fitch
will continue to monitor this loan. 

Of the original four shadow-rated loans in the pool, three have paid in full and
one (36.6%), which is the largest remaining loan, maintains its investment grade
shadow-rating. The Crystal Gateway Marriott is a 697-room full-service hotel in
Arlington, VA. The servicer reported the September 2008 occupancy at 76.5%,
average daily rate (ADR) at $184 and revenue per available room (RevPAR) at $141
compared to year-end (YE) 2007 occupancy of 79.4%, ADR of $179 and RevPAR of
$142. 

Loan maturities range from 2012 to 2018 with the majority of the loans scheduled
to mature in 2017 (66.3%). The weighted average interest rate for the remaining
loans is 7.66%. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of

&lt;p&gt;  PARIS, Feb 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Primagaz, a major player in designing sustainable gas energy solutions in
France, has selected IBM (NYSE: IBM) to manage the evolution of its data
processing systems by signing an information technology (IT) outsourcing
contract for an additional five years. The agreement with IBM is part of
Primagaz' initiative to reposition itself as "a modern player in the
world of modern energy."

    "The transformation of the energy market, and in particular, the continued
development of renewable energies as well as the increasing needs, is
pushing us to capitalize on our 150 years of experience in order to
continue progressing and become a designer of energy solutions," commented
Myriam Maestroni, General Manager, Primagaz. "Our mission to become a
modern player in the energy world requires that we surround ourselves with
trusted partners, like IBM. Beyond IT services, this relationship with IBM
is the start of a long-term partnership to think about the key issues and
challenges of our industry, particularly environmental ones."

    "We are very pleased to support the strategic transformation of an
innovative company that is involved in environmental matters and is able
to reinvent and anticipate the energy needs of its consumers," explained
Nicolas Sekkaki, General Manager, IBM Global Technology Services.
"Clients, like Primagaz, understand that in order to maintain a
competitive advantage, they must turn disparate data into smarter,
actionable information; find more efficient ways of working and serving
customers; scale and adapt their entire IT infrastructure; and transform
their operations to become greener."

    IBM responded to Primagaz' outsourcing requirements in the following ways:


--  Respect for the environment - The Primagaz information system will be
hosted in IBM's new green data center in Montpellier, France.
--  Reinforced security - The solution benefits from splitting the
environment between two sites and by integrating the highly available ERP
architecture into the current environment. 
--  Flexible infrastructure needed for business - The solution includes the
availability of scalable services and technologies to support current and
future Primagaz needs. 
--  Governance for sustainable innovation - Primagaz and IBM will introduce
governance at various levels within the company to allow the sharing of
strategies and challenges and to make room for innovation and improved
services. 

    
The agreement was signed in December 2008.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc has added its voice to the case against Microsoft Corp as the European Commission probes antitrust charges related to the software giant's Internet Explorer browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive, which holds back innovation for users," Sundar Pichai, Google vice president product manager, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google introduced the Chrome browser last year, which has taken little market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet company joins the Mozilla foundation, producer of the Firefox Web browser, and Norway's Opera, a privately held company. Google adds the voice of a significant and well-financed player in the case against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, European regulators brought formal charges against Microsoft for abusing its dominant market position by bundling its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows operating system, which is used in 95 percent of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the preliminary views expressed in the EC's Statement of Objections are confirmed, Microsoft could be subject to a fine and an order requiring it to cease bundling its browser and operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, European Union courts upheld the European Commission's finding that Microsoft violated antitrust law by bundling its Windows Media player with the Windows operating system. It also found Microsoft used illegal tactics against RealNetworks real player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has been fined more than $2 billion for its violations and for failing to carry out remedies imposed by the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, a U.S. judge decided that Microsoft had broken the law after it combined its Internet Explorer browser and the Windows operating system. The most serious violations of the law were upheld on appeal, but the company continued to bundle its operating system and browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google competes with Microsoft in several markets, including online search engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pichai wrote that the company hopes its perspective in launching Chrome will "be useful as the European Commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interveners traditionally provide background information, legal theories and proposed remedies to the Commision in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic and David Lawsky, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MEXICO CITY, Feb 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE: KOF) (BMV: KOFL) ("Coca-Cola
FEMSA" or the "Company"), the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America
and the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world in terms of sales
volume, announces results for the fourth quarter of
2008.


--  Total revenues reached Ps. 22,752 million in the fourth quarter of
    2008, an increase of 23.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007; the
    acquisition of Refrigerantes Minas Gerais ("Remil") contributed
    approximately 35% of this growth.

--  Consolidated operating income grew 25.7% to Ps. 4,053 million for the
    fourth quarter of 2008 mainly driven by double-digit operating income
    growth recorded in our Mercosur and Latincentro divisions. Our operating
    margin reached 17.8% for the fourth quarter of 2008.

--  Consolidated majority net income decreased 69.7% to Ps. 585 million in
    the fourth quarter of 2008, mainly reflecting the devaluation of the
    Mexican peso as applied to our U.S. dollar-denominated debt, resulting in
    earnings per share of Ps. 0.32 in the fourth quarter of 2008.
    

    
"Despite of facing a challenging economic environment and pressures
in our U.S. dollar-denominated raw material cost, our company delivered
solid volume, revenue, and EBITDA growth for the quarter.
Revenue-management and multi-segmentation strategies across our
territories, combined with the acquisitions we made during the year,
drove our operations' top-and bottom-line growth. The successful
integration of the Remil franchise territory in Brazil, the acquisition
of the Agua de los Angeles jug water business in the Valley of Mexico and
the consolidation of the Jugos del Valle line of business, especially in
Mexico and Colombia, provided new avenues of growth for the company. This
year, turbulent market and economic conditions present our company with
the challenge of continuing to work relentlessly -- without losing our
focus -- to achieve our goals. Our business is in a significantly better
position to capture the opportunities that lie ahead in the beverage
industry," said Carlos Salazar Lomelin, Chief Executive Officer of the
Company.

&lt;p&gt;  RENO, NEVADA, Feb 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Western Lithium Canada Corporation ("Western Lithium" or the "Company")
(TSX VENTURE: WLC) is pleased to announce that additional drilling on the
upper more northerly lenses (WLC Stages II through V), which were
originally identified by Chevron Resources ("Chevron") in the early
1980's, has confirmed the presence of lithium. WLC had previously
announced the southern-most Stage I (PCD) lens contained Indicated
Resources of 48.1 million tonnes grading 0.27% lithium, or the lithium
carbonate equivalent (LCE) of 688,000 tonnes LCE and Inferred Resources
of 42.3 million tonnes grading 0.27% lithium, for an equivalent of
606,000 tonnes LCE, both at a cut-off grade of 0.20% Lithium.

    "The results of this recent drilling on the upper lenses gives a greater
level of confidence in what Chevron originally reported, and positions
the Company with a potentially very significant lithium deposit," said
Western Lithium's President, Jay Chmelauskas. "This drilling on the upper
lenses supports the envisioned staged development of the project."

    Western Lithium is a Canadian based resource company focused on the
development of a large potential lithium resource located in the
McDermitt Caldera in northwestern Nevada through its wholly owned
subsidiary, Western Lithium Corporation. The company is positioning
itself to become a reliable and scalable, United States based strategic
supplier of battery grade lithium carbonate to support the development of
electric/hybrid cars and mobile electronics of the future.

    WLC has completed drilling a series of exploration core holes in the
northern four lithium lenses previously identified by Chevron. These are
the North, North Central, South Central and South lenses referred to by
WLC as Stages II through V. They are located from approximately 8 to 24
km north of the Stage I (PCD) lens and are approximately 300 meters
higher in elevation. The purpose of the drilling program, carried out in
late 2008, was to help verify Chevron's initial results and thereby
reinforce the confidence level of their original findings. WLC's previous
detailed evaluation and drilling program on the Stage I (PCD) lens in
2008 supported Chevron's estimate of grade and extent of lithium
mineralization for the southernmost lens. A total of five holes were
drilled in this most recent program, one each in the North, North Central
and South Central, and two holes in the South lens. The South lens is the
largest lens identified by Chevron as having over one million tons of
lithium metal.

    To minimize surface disturbance and permitting requirements the five
holes were all drilled along existing roads. Locations were chosen that
were in relatively close proximity to known Chevron holes so comparisons
could be made.

    Results of WLC's drilling confirm the presence of lithium in the upper
Chevron lenses.

    - Drill hole Li-01 was in the North lens (Stage V) and averaged 1600 ppm
lithium over a 50 meter interval starting at a 4 meter depth. This hole
was within 200 meters of an original Chevron hole that averaged 2100 ppm
lithium over a 60 meter interval.

    - Drill hole Li-02 was in the North Central lens (Stage IV) and averaged
2400 ppm lithium over a 40 meter interval starting at a depth of 8
meters. This hole was within 15 meters of an original Chevron hole that
averaged 2600 ppm lithium over a 61 meter interval.

    - Drill hole Li-03 was in the South Central lens (Stage III) and averaged
2600 ppm lithium over a 40 meter interval starting at a depth of 21
meters. This hole was within 6 meters of an original Chevron hole that
averaged 2600 ppm lithium over almost the identical interval.

    - Drill hole Li-04 was in the South lens (Stage II) and averaged 2000 ppm
lithium over a 46 meter interval starting at a depth of 8 meters. This
hole was within approximately 90 meters of an original Chevron hole that
averaged 2400 ppm over an interval of 64 meters.

    - Drill hole Li-05 was also in the South lens (Stage II) and averaged
2400 ppm lithium over a 33 meter interval starting at a depth of 8
meters. This hole was within 30 meters of an original Chevron hole that
averaged 2900 ppm lithium over a similar interval.

    The upper four lenses (WLC Stages II through V) comprise relatively
unaltered claystones and volcaniclastic sandstone which are the dominant
rock types. Lithium-rich beds are generally 1 to 10 meters thick with
some as much as 30 meters thick. Much of the area encompassing the upper
lenses has little or no overburden with the claystone outcropping in
places. Colluvium up to 10 meters thick occasionally covers the
claystone. 

    Further engineering work is currently underway to determine scoping level
economics, expected later this year, to process the lithium bearing clay
and determine an optimal process flow sheet for development.

    Forward Looking Statements

    Certain of the statements made and information contained herein is
"forward-looking information" within the meaning of the Ontario
Securities Act. Forward-looking information is subject to a variety of
risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or results to
differ from those reflected in the forward-looking information,
including, without limitation, risks and uncertainties relating to
foreign currency fluctuations; risks inherent in mining including
environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected
geological formations, ground control problems and flooding; risks
associated with the estimation of mineral resources and reserves and the
geology, grade and continuity of mineral deposits; the possibility that
future exploration, development or mining results will not be consistent
with the Company's expectations; the potential for and effects of labour
disputes or other unanticipated difficulties with or shortages of labour
or interruptions in production; actual ore mined varying from estimates
of grade, tonnage, dilution and metallurgical and other characteristics;
the inherent uncertainty of production and cost estimates and the
potential for unexpected costs and expenses, commodity price
fluctuations; uncertain political and economic environments; changes in
laws or policies, foreign taxation, delays or the inability to obtain
necessary governmental permits; and other risks and uncertainties,
including those described in each management discussion and analysis.
Forward-looking information is in addition based on various assumptions
including, without limitation, the expectations and beliefs of
management, the assumed long term price of lithium; that the Company can
access financing, appropriate equipment and sufficient labour and that
the political environment where the Company operates will continue to
support the development and operation of mining projects. Should one or
more of these risks and uncertainties materialize, or should underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from
those described in the forward-looking information. Accordingly, readers
are advised not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information.

    Cautionary Notes to Investors - Reserve and Resource Estimates

    In accordance with applicable Canadian securities regulatory
requirements, all mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates of the
Company disclosed in this release have been prepared in accordance with
Canadian National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral
Projects ("NI 43-101"), classified in accordance with Canadian Institute
of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum's "CIM Standards on Mineral Resources
and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines" (the "CIM Guidelines").

    The Company uses the terms "mineral resources", "measured mineral
resources", "indicated mineral resources" and "inferred mineral
resources". While those terms are recognized by Canadian securities
regulatory authorities, they are not recognized by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the SEC does not
permit U.S. companies to disclose resources in their filings with the
SEC.


 
 Pursuant to the CIM Guidelines, mineral resources have a higher
degree of uncertainty than mineral reserves as to their existence as well
as their economic and legal feasibility. Inferred mineral resources, when
compared with measured or indicated mineral resources, have the least
certainty as to their existence, and it cannot be assumed that all or any
part of an inferred mineral resource will be upgraded to an indicated or
measured mineral resource as a result of continued exploration. Pursuant
to NI 43-101, inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of any
economic analysis, including any feasibility study. Accordingly, readers
are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a mineral resource
exists, will ever be converted into a mineral reserve, or is or will ever
be economically or legally mineable or recovered.

&lt;p&gt;FORT WORTH, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Entech Solar (OTC BB:ENSL.OB) today announced that Dr. Walter J. Hesse, a member
of the Company`s Board of Directors and a co-founder of ENTECH, Inc., has died.
He was 85 years old. 

"We are deeply saddened by this news," said Frank Smith, CEO of Entech Solar.
"Walter, one of the co-founders of ENTECH in 1983, was known as a visionary
whose accomplishments were well regarded throughout the solar industry. His work
- spanning more than 60 years - laid the foundation for our Company and the
proprietary technology which we are now in the process of commercializing.
Walter built a solid team of engineers dedicated to bringing our patented solar
power solutions to market, and it is unfortunate that he will not live to see
the impact that these technologies will have on alternative energy generation.
On behalf of the Board, we send our condolences to his family and thank him for
all that he has given to the solar field." 

Dr. Hesse had been involved in the development of high-tech solar power systems
since 1977, including the Fresnel lens concentrating technology that is now the
centerpiece of the Entech Solar business. He also served in key positions in
several national organizations, including Chairman of the Board and President of
the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA). He served on the Boards of the
U.S. Solar Energy Research Institute and the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) and was also a member of the Scientific Panel to the
Congressional House Committee on Science and Astronautics, a member of the
Advisory Board for Joint Task Force Two of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a member
of the Texas Commission on Atomic Energy, and Chairman of the Board of the
Aerospace Education Foundation of the Air Force Association. Dr. Hesse published
more than 100 technical papers and was the author of two college textbooks in
the field of jet propulsion.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp outlined plans to offset revenue declines as the PC market shifts to low-cost netbooks, but it failed to announce more cost cuts, sending its shares to an 11-year low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told an analysts' meeting in New York on Tuesday that Microsoft will offer robust versions of its yet-to-be-released Windows 7 operating software for netbooks, as the company looks to boost revenue from these hot-selling, low-cost computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft shares fell more than 3 percent after Ballmer quashed the hopes of some investors for accelerated cost cuts. Microsoft had announced plans to lay off 5,000 workers on January 22 as part of a plan to save $1.5 billion in annual costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it makes sense for us to come back and say, 'Could we take out another $2 billion in costs?'" Ballmer said at the analysts' meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avian Securities Jeff Gaggin said investors were disappointed with Ballmer's decision to hold off on further cost cutting measures, and that he chose not to reassure them that the board will maintain the company's current dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a lot left to interpretation," Gaggin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which a month ago blamed netbooks for weaker-than-expected quarterly profits, said it is planning to ship a low-end version of Windows 7 for netbooks, and make it easy for users to upgrade to more expensive editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will have high market share on netbooks," Ballmer said as he painted a grim outlook for the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I often think of this as an economic reset. It's not a recession from which you recover," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also said he still wants to team up with Yahoo Inc to compete against Internet search giant Google Inc, though he is not interested in buying Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he hopes to discuss a possible search partnership with Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz, and added that he expects Google to start competing with the Windows operating system by offering a version of its Android operating system for laptop computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google launched Android last year as an operating system for smart phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NETBOOK TREND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had partly blamed last quarter's profit shortfall on a shift in personal computer sales to netbooks from full-featured machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the low pricing of netbook software is hurting Windows profits, and estimate that Microsoft only reaps about half the revenue from PC makers for each netbook sold, compared to what it earns on sales of more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Ballmer said he disagreed that growing netbook sales represent "downside" for his company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's goal is to boost its average revenue per netbook by persuading users to pay to upgrade low-end versions of the software to gain features included with more expensive ones in full-featured PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software maker will encourage that by limiting the functionality of low-end versions of the new Windows 7. As an example, Ballmer said Microsoft will restrict the number of programs that a user can run at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netbook sales took off last year as the economy weakened, making their low pricing of $200 to $400 more attractive to consumers. Ballmer said he expects netbook sales to continue to grow as cash-strapped buyers avoid big-ticket, discretionary purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is certainly going to be an economic effect on PC sales," he said. "We cannot control it. It will affect our revenue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most netbooks are now shipped with a stripped down copy of an older generation of Microsoft's operating system, Windows XP, because those machines don't have the computing resources needed to run Windows Vista, the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross Research analyst Richard Williams estimates that Microsoft gets about $35 for each netbook sold with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect Windows 7 to be released before this year's holiday shopping season. Microsoft has declined to give a specific release date, only saying it will be out by January 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 33 cents to $16.88, after hitting an 11-year low of $16.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

More Dividend Cuts on the Way

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) yesterday announced a reduction in its
quarterly dividend from 38 cents a share to 5 cents a share, in an effort to
preserve capital. The dividend cut would enable the company save about $5
billion a year. 

While JP Morgan has suffered tremendously due to the economic downturn, it is
still in a much better position than many other big banks, like Citigroup (NYSE:
C) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), which had to reduce their quarterly dividend
to a penny after receiving a second round of bailout funds from the Government.
(Unfortunately, the Treasury did not put any conditions on the first round of
bailout funds regarding a dividend reduction.) 

Onyx Pharma Gleaming Brighter

On February 23, 2009, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ONXX) reported 4Q08
earnings. Worldwide Nexavar sales came in at $176.5 million, up 41% from $125
million in 4Q07. US sales were $52 million in 4Q08, up 21% compared to $43
million in 4Q07, and up 8% sequentially compared to $48 million in 3Q08.
International sales reached $124.5 million in 4Q08, up 52% from $82 million in
4Q07. 

While US sales were in line with our estimate, international sales fell short of
our expected $145 million. International sales continued to outgrow the US
sales. We believe the trend will continue in the coming quarters. 

Einstein Noah Needing More Dough?

Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: BAGL) announced that it will
report 4th quarter earnings on March 2nd, after the market closes. We think
comps, which turned negative in the 3rd quarter for the first time in four
years, will continue to slide and weigh on earnings into 2H09 or longer,
depending on the economy. 

For the last 5 years, price increases have been supporting comps, as traffic
declined. Though management has changed the product mix to add more lunch
offerings, including salads, and some higher-priced items such as smoothies,
comps will likely worsen as consumer spending on dining outside the home
continues to fall.

&lt;p&gt;Reaffirms 2009 Earnings Guidance
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE: POR) today reaffirmed full-year 2009
earnings guidance of $1.80 to $1.90 per diluted share. Net income for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2008 was $87 million, or $1.39 per diluted share,
compared to $145 million, or $2.33 per diluted share, in 2007. The decrease in
net income resulted primarily from the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC)
Trojan refund order and losses on non-qualified benefit plan trust assets both
in 2008; and a benefit recorded in 2007 from the deferral of a portion of
Boardman replacement power costs. In 2008 the company had excellent plant and
utility operations. Fourth quarter earnings for 2008 were $0.32 per diluted
share compared to $0.40 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2007. 

"2008 was an exceptional year for operations," said Jim Piro, President and CEO
of Portland General Electric (PGE). "Our plants and distribution system
performed well, and according to J.D. Power and Associates, PGE ranks highest in
the Western region in overall business customer satisfaction as well as power
quality and reliability. 

"Looking ahead, we believe that sound financial management combined with ongoing
opportunities for investment in rate-based assets gives us solid prospects for
growth as we remain focused on providing value to our customers and our
shareholders." 

Full Year 2008 Highlights

* Received the final OPUC general rate case order in January 2009 which approved
an overall price increase of 7.3% consisting of a $95 million increase for net
variable power costs (NVPC) and a $26 million increase for other costs. Received
authorization for a new decoupling mechanism, with the condition that the return
on equity (ROE) be reduced by 0.1 percent to 10 percent reflecting the OPUC`s
view of reduced company risk. 
* Total customers served increased by approximately 1% from 803,788 at year-end
2007 to 810,197 at year-end 2008. Total retail energy deliveries in 2008
increased by approximately 2% from 2007. 
* Achieved a high level of generation performance and had excellent plant
availability with thermal at 89 percent, wind at 93 percent and PGE-owned hydro
at 99 percent. 
* Achieved a high level of system reliability exceeding our power reliability
goals. 
* Ranked number one in the Western region in overall business customer
satisfaction, according to J.D. Power and Associates 2009 Electric Utility
Business Customer Satisfaction StudySM. 
* Achieved the highest rating level of residential customer satisfaction in more
than a decade with the ratings among the top quartile in the industry according
to an independent quarterly survey. 
* Received OPUC approval in May 2008 for the company`s smart meter project and
began system acceptance testing. Full deployment of 850,000 meters will begin in
2009 and is expected to be completed by year-end 2010. 
* Began construction of the second phase of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm. Phase
II is expected to be completed in 2009 and Phase III is expected to be completed
in 2010. 
* Effectively operated our utility system through a series of storms in late
December that brought freezing rain and the heaviest snowfall seen in our
service area in 40 years. Handled more than 400,000 customer outages. 
* Put in place additional liquidity by adding a $125 million, 364-day revolving
credit facility in December 2008 and by issuing $130 million of First Mortgage
Bonds in January 2009. 
* Increased the quarterly common stock dividend in May from 23.5 cents per share
to 24.5 cents per share, an increase of 4.3%.

2009 Earnings Guidance

PGE is reaffirming full-year 2009 earnings guidance of $1.80 to $1.90 per
diluted share. Guidance assumes normal hydro conditions and plant operations.
Guidance also reflects steps taken to align operating costs with the recent OPUC
general rate case order. Currently the regional Hydro forecast indicates below
normal conditions. Given that it is early in the year the company assumes
average hydro in guidance, and will be actively monitoring hydro conditions
through the year. PGE is also reaffirming its long-term annual earnings growth
expectation of 6 to 8 percent beginning with 2009. 

General Rate Case

In January 2009, the OPUC issued its final order in PGE's general rate case with
tariffs effective January 1, 2009. The OPUC approved an average price increase
of 7.3 percent and a cost of capital that provides for a debt-to-equity capital
structure of 50/50. The order authorizes $121 million of increased revenues
consisting of approximately $95 million for net variable power costs and $26
million for other costs. Certain customer credits, including those related to
2007 results of the power cost adjustment mechanism (PCAM), reduced the average
overall price increase to approximately 5.6 percent. 

The OPUC also authorized PGE`s proposed decoupling mechanism effective for a
period of two years. The condition of this authorization is that the company`s
allowed ROE be reduced by 0.1 percent to 10 percent reflecting the OPUC`s view
of reduced company risk. On January 30, 2009 the company filed an application
with the OPUC for deferred accounting of revenues associated with the decoupling
mechanism, effective February 1, 2009. 

Liquidity

In December 2008, PGE obtained an unsecured $125 million revolving credit
facility (credit facility) with a group of banks. The credit facility, which
matures in December 2009, is for general corporate purposes, including back-up
for the issuance of commercial paper, potential refinancing of certain existing
indebtedness and support for collateral requirements under energy purchase and
sale agreements. This supplements the company`s existing $370 million revolving
credit facility with a separate group of banks. $360 million of this facility
matures in July 2013, with the remaining $10 million maturing in July 2012. 

As of February 20, 2009, PGE had $53 million of commercial paper outstanding and
borrowings of $61 million under the credit facility. The company also had issued
$153 million in letters of credit. As of February 20, 2009, the company had an
aggregate remaining borrowing capacity of $228 million available under the two
credit facilities and a cash balance of $1 million. Higher levels of short-term
borrowings and outstanding letters of credit are the result of additional margin
deposit requirements related to power and natural gas contracts. As of February
20, 2009, PGE had posted margin deposits of $363 million. Margin deposits create
a cash flow timing difference but have minimal impact on earnings. 

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures in 2009 are estimated to be $722 million, a decline of
approximately $38 million from our previous forecast of 2009 capital
expenditures. The decrease is primarily from reductions in ongoing expenditures
for production, transmission, and distribution facilities as well as smart
meters and Biglow Canyon Phases II and III. Current estimated 2009 capital
expenditures consist of:

* $230 million for Phase II of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm 
* $176 million for Phase III of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm 
* $224 million in ongoing expenditures for production, transmission and
distribution facilities 
* $66 million for smart meters 
* $24 million for hydro licensing projects 
* $2 million for Boardman emissions controls

Capital expenditures in 2010 are estimated to be $526 million, consisting of:

* $232 million in ongoing expenditures for production, transmission and
distribution facilities 
* $201 million for Phase III of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm 
* $53 million for smart meters 
* $25 million for Boardman emissions controls 
* $15 million for hydro licensing projects

Financing Plans

To fund a portion of capital expenditures, PGE issued $130 million of First
Mortgage Bonds in January 2009, consisting of $67 million with interest at 6.8
percent per annum, maturing January 2016, and $63 million with interest at 6.5
percent per annum, maturing January 2014. In 2009 PGE plans to issue
approximately $170 million in additional debt, remarket $142 million in
pollution control bonds and issue approximately $175 million to $200 million in
equity also in 2009. The timing of new issuances is subject to market
conditions. 

Full Year 2008 Summary

Net income for the full year 2008 was $87 million, or $1.39 per diluted share,
compared to $145 million, or $2.33 per diluted share, for 2007. 2008 was marked
by excellent plant and utility operations which were offset by items such as the
provision taken for the Trojan refund order and losses from the non-qualified
benefit plan trust assets. Key drivers impacting 2008 net income results
relative to 2007 are as follows: 

2008

* $20 million after-tax loss or $0.32 per diluted share from the regulatory
liability recorded to provide for a future refund to customers, related to the
Trojan order, not including impacts of Senate Bill 408 (SB 408). 
* $12 million after-tax loss or $0.19 per diluted share from a decline in the
fair market value of the non-qualified benefit plan trust assets during 2008. 
* $6 million after-tax gain or $0.10 per diluted share from oil sales from the
Beaver plant. 
* $6 million after-tax loss or $0.10 per diluted share from customer refunds
related to SB 408.

2007

* $16 million after-tax gain or $0.26 per diluted share from the 2007 deferral
of a portion of Boardman replacement power costs. 
* $11 million after-tax gain or $0.18 per diluted share from a customer
collection related to SB 408. 
* $4 million after-tax gain or $0.06 per diluted share from the settlement with
certain California parties involving wholesale energy transactions in 2000-2001.

* $3 million after-tax gain or $0.05 per diluted share from an increase in the
fair market value of the non-qualified benefit plan trust assets during 2007.

Fourth Quarter 2008 Financial and Operating Highlights

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $20 million, or $0.32 per diluted
share, compared to $24 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the fourth
quarter of 2007. Results for 2008 were positively impacted by excellent thermal
plant operations and lower gas prices. Partially off-setting these results were
a decline in hydro generation and a 1.7 percent quarter-over-quarter decrease in
retail energy deliveries. Key drivers impacting fourth quarter 2008 net income
results relative to fourth quarter 2007 are as follows: 

Fourth Quarter 2008

* $5 million after-tax loss or $0.08 per diluted share from the decline in the
fair market value of the non-qualified benefit plan trust assets during the
fourth quarter 2008. 
* $2 million after-tax loss or $0.03 per diluted share from customer refunds
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to SB 408. 
* $1 million after-tax loss or $0.02 per diluted share from storm restoration
costs net of transmission and distribution insurance.

Fourth Quarter 2007

* $4 million after-tax gain or $0.06 per diluted share from a customer
collection related to SB 408. 
* $1 million after-tax loss or $0.02 per diluted share from a decline in the
fair market value of non-qualified benefit plan trust assets.

Fourth Quarter 2008 Summary

* Total revenues decreased by 4 percent to $449 million in the fourth quarter
2008 from $470 million in 2007. The decrease was due primarily to the following
factors:

* A decrease of $9 million related to SB 408, consisting of a $3 million refund
recorded in 2008 compared to a $6 million collection recorded in 2007. 
* A $10 million decline in wholesale revenues due to a 14 percent decrease in
sales volume and a 7 percent lower average sales price.

* Purchased power and fuel expense fell by 13 percent to $226 million in the
fourth quarter 2008 from $259 million in the fourth quarter 2007. The decrease
was due to the net effect of the following key factors:

* 9 percent decrease in average power cost, which was driven primarily by lower
power and natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
* $10 million decrease due to a 4 percent reduction in total system load.

* Production, distribution, administrative and other expenses increased by 3
percent to $92 million in the fourth quarter 2008 from $89 million in the fourth
quarter 2007 due primarily to increased labor expense and increased costs
related to storm restoration. 
* Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 15 percent to $54 million
in the fourth quarter 2008 from $47 million in 2007 due primarily to increased
amortization related to the smart meter project and increased depreciation due
to Phase I of Biglow Canyon Wind Farm coming into service. 
* Other income (expense) decreased by $7 million primarily due to a decline in
the fair market value of non-qualified benefit plan trust assets.

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft CFO sees economic contraction for year or two&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Company cuts rates paid to temp agencies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * CFO sees possible bump in PC sales next year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft not basing plans on Yahoo search deal
 (Adds Dell, Hewlett-Packard comments on Windows 7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) chief
financial officer forecast at least another year of tough
trading in all areas on Thursday, as the economy shows no
immediate sign of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, the world's largest software company
confirmed that it had cut the rate it pays agencies supplying
temporary office workers by 10 percent, as it looks to trim
costs as demand wanes for its applications and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A contraction of some substance is the way that we are
thinking about it," said Microsoft Chief Financial Officer
Christopher Liddell at a Goldman Sachs technology conference in
San Francisco, which was broadcast on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "How long the contraction's going to be and how deep none
of us know," he added. "Despite what politicians and others are
saying, it's probably for the next year or two that we're going
to see a difficult trading environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Microsoft confirmed that it had cut rates paid
to agencies supplying temporary office staff, saying it was
part of a broad cost-cutting plan announced in January, which
included slashing 5,000 staff over the next 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move was motivated by "the need to achieve greater cost
reductions," a Microsoft spokesman said, adding that the cuts
did not affect more skilled contract workers such as
programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Redmond, Washington-based company, which employs about
95,000 people, does not break out numbers of temporary or
contract workers and did not say how much the move would save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PC SALES MAY REBOUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the Goldman Sachs conference, Liddell said that the
roll-out of its new Windows 7 operating system might help
personal computer sales rebound next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We might see a bump (in PC sales) next year, just as a
result of lower demand this year," said Liddell, who expects
some users will delay buying a new computer to wait for Windows
7, expected early next year. "It will be helpful, but it will
not outweigh the general macro-economics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PC makers themselves disagreed over the potential of
Windows 7 to boost sales, as it replaces Microsoft's unpopular
Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're starting to get pretty excited about Windows 7 and
believe it's going to be an important catalyst for growth,"
said Dell Inc DELL.O chief executive Michael Dell in a
conference call after the world No. 2 PC maker's latest
earnings on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the Goldman Sachs conference, the chief financial
officer of Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), the No. 1 PC maker,
played down prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are not expecting that there's going to be this huge
hockey stick effect when Windows 7 comes out," said Kathie
Lesjak. "The good news is we're hearing positive things about
Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOT BANKING ON YAHOO DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liddell was neutral on the prospects for a deal with Yahoo
Inc (YHOO.O) over its rival's Internet search business, which
the executives of both companies appeared to be warming to in
comments made this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have to have a plan that excludes Yahoo, we can't be
dependent on that," said Liddell. "Even though we've suggested
it would be great to get together, we don't work on the basis
that's going to happen. If it does that's great, but if it
doesn't, that's fine too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo rebuffed a $47.5 billion acquisition bid from
Microsoft last year, and saw a deal to form a search
advertising partnership with Google Inc (GOOG.O) fall apart
amid antitrust concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's shares closed down 3.2 percent at $16.42 on
Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gabriel Madway in San Francisco)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Bernard Orr)

&lt;p&gt; (Adds revenue, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Feb 26 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa on Thursday posted a nearly flat fourth-quarter net
profit despite a rise in revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grupo Televisa (TLVACPO.MX)(TV.N) earned 2.84 billion pesos
($206 million) in the October-December period compared with
2.83 billion pesos in the same quarter of the previous year,
according to a filing with the Mexican stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results exceeded analysts' expectations of a 2.523 billion
peso quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quarterly revenue rose 17 percent, far above analysts'
expectations, to 14.5 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa, whose tear-jerker soap operas have made it a
staple in living rooms across the globe, is the world's largest
producer of Spanish-language television content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prior to its earnings release, Televisa shares slipped 0.62
percent to close at 35.37 pesos in Mexico City while its New
York-traded stock fell 1.43 percent to $11.69.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said on Thursday it is cutting up to 14,000 jobs, more than previously disclosed, as it tries to reduce costs in the face of a slumping economy and higher credit losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank said it now expects to shed as many 12,000 jobs from integrating the former Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK, up from 9,200 announced in December. It also expects to cut up to 2,000 investment banking jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan announced the cuts in an all-day presentation to investors. The New York-based lender expects the cost cuts to help it weather the current economic turmoil, as customers struggle with falling house prices, tight credit and increasing mortgage and credit card defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are scared about the future like everybody else," but the bank has "enormous earnings power," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said. "I always remind myself that we really have no idea what 2009 is going to look like, but we're going to make an awful lot of money in 2011."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan expects $2.75 billion of savings from Washington Mutual, offset by $750 million of new investments. Retail banking chief Charlie Scharf expects most of the savings by the end of 2009, sooner than originally thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank in September paid $1.9 billion for the banking units of Washington Mutual, the largest U.S. bank or thrift ever to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined company is shutting several hundred branches, but plans to open 120 new branches this year. JPMorgan has more than 5,000 branches, up from 539 as recently as 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRESS TEST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, JPMorgan's investment bank expects to reduce its 28,000-person staff to between 26,000 and 27,000 by year-end, with cutbacks focused in technology and infrastructure, the unit's co-chief executive, Steve Black, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staffing could fall further if market conditions worsen, though it is "hard to imagine" a worse year for the unit than 2008, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial companies have announced close to 350,000 job cuts since August 2007, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray  Christmas has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank got $25 billion of capital last fall from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, and Dimon said it is possible JPMorgan could repay that this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, JPMorgan unexpectedly cut its dividend 87 percent to help save $5 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the government plan to subject large U.S. banks to "stress tests" to see how well they hold up in a worsening economy, Dimon said: "We think we'll do fine under any stress test measurement," even without "heroic" cost cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed up $1.32, or 6.1 percent, at $23.05 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. The KBW Bank Index .BKX of large U.S. lenders rose 4.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOME EQUITY, CREDIT CARDS UNDER PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said that excluding Washington Mutual, it expects losses of $1 billion to $1.4 billion in each quarter this year from home equity loans to more creditworthy borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said as many as 41 percent of these borrowers will owe more than their homes are worth by the end of 2010, up from 27 percent at the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scharf said California's housing market is showing signs of a bottom in home price deterioration, but Florida's is not. He also said that "we know New York is going to deteriorate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "There will be an end in sight, just figuring out where it is  not the easiest thing as we sit here today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing problems and rising unemployment are also boosting losses in JPMorgan's credit card business and may result in lower sales volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives expect card losses to increase "materially" and are preparing for a 9 percent U.S. unemployment rate by year end from January's 7.6 percent. Dimon said "I'll be happy" if the business makes money in the next year; it lost $371 million in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The American consumer feels much poorer than in previous recessions," credit card chief Gordon Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by John Wallace; Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds CEO comments, closing prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elinor Comlay and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said
on Thursday it is cutting up to 14,000 jobs, more than previously
disclosed, as it tries to reduce costs in the face of a slumping
economy and higher credit losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. bank said it now expects to shed as
many 12,000 jobs from integrating the former Washington Mutual Inc
WAMUQ.PK, up from 9,200 announced in December. It also expects
to cut up to 2,000 investment banking jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan announced the cuts in an all-day presentation to
investors. The New York-based lender expects the cost cuts to help
it weather the current economic turmoil, as customers struggle
with falling house prices, tight credit and increasing mortgage
and credit card defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are scared about the future like everybody else," but the
bank has "enormous earnings power," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon
said. "I always remind myself that we really have no idea what
2009 is going to look like, but we're going to make an awful lot
of money in 2011."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan expects $2.75 billion of savings from Washington
Mutual, offset by $750 million of new investments. Retail banking
chief Charlie Scharf expects most of the savings by the end of
2009, sooner than originally thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank in September paid $1.9 billion for the banking units
of Washington Mutual, the largest U.S. bank or thrift ever to
fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combined company is shutting several hundred branches, but
plans to open 120 new branches this year. JPMorgan has more than
5,000 branches, up from 539 as recently as 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STRESS TEST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, JPMorgan's investment bank expects to reduce its
28,000-person staff to between 26,000 and 27,000 by year-end, with
cutbacks focused in technology and infrastructure, the unit's
co-chief executive, Steve Black, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staffing could fall further if market conditions worsen,
though it is "hard to imagine" a worse year for the unit than
2008, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial companies have announced close to 350,000 job cuts
since August 2007, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray  Christmas
has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank got $25 billion of capital last fall from the
government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, and Dimon said it is
possible JPMorgan could repay that this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, JPMorgan unexpectedly cut its dividend 87 percent
to help save $5 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Referring to the government plan to subject large U.S. banks
to "stress tests" to see how well they hold up in a worsening
economy, Dimon said: "We think we'll do fine under any stress test
measurement," even without "heroic" cost cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares closed up $1.32, or 6.1 percent, at $23.05 on
the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. The KBW Bank Index .BKX
of large U.S. lenders rose 4.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOME EQUITY, CREDIT CARDS UNDER PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said that excluding Washington Mutual, it expects
losses of $1 billion to $1.4 billion in each quarter this year
from home equity loans to more creditworthy borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said as many as 41 percent of these borrowers will owe more
than their homes are worth by the end of 2010, up from 27 percent
at the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scharf said California's housing market is showing signs of a
bottom in home price deterioration, but Florida's is not. He also
said that "we know New York is going to deteriorate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added: "There will be an end in sight, just figuring out
where it is is not the easiest thing as we sit here today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Housing problems and rising unemployment are also boosting
losses in JPMorgan's credit card business and may result in lower
sales volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executives expect card losses to increase "materially" and are
preparing for a 9 percent U.S. unemployment rate by year end from
January's 7.6 percent. Dimon said "I'll be happy" if the business
makes money in the next year; it lost $371 million in the fourth
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The American consumer feels much poorer than in previous
recessions," credit card chief Gordon Smith said.

&lt;p&gt;Peter Robertson to retire after distinguished 35-year career;

Charles James named Executive Vice President
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) announced today that Chevron Vice Chairman Peter
J. Robertson will retire from the company and its board after more than 35 years
of distinguished company service. Robertson will be succeeded by John S. Watson,
currently executive vice president of Strategy and Development. 

The company also named Charles A. James, currently vice president and general
counsel, executive vice president of Chevron Corporation. These executive
changes are effective April 1. 

"By any measure, Peter`s contributions inside and outside Chevron have been
remarkable," said Chevron chairman and chief executive officer Dave O`Reilly.
"As vice chairman, Peter established himself as one of our industry`s most
tireless, passionate and effective emissaries. For me personally, Peter has been
a valued partner and a tremendous source of support in helping lead Chevron." 

Robertson, 62, joined Chevron in 1973. Over the course of his career, he
advanced through a number of leadership positions in finance, strategic
planning, exploration and production. He was appointed vice president, Finance,
for Chevron U.S.A. in 1989, and president of Warren Petroleum Co. (Chevron`s
former natural gas liquids subsidiary) in 1991. In 1994, he was appointed vice
president, Strategic Planning, for Chevron Corporation. He held this post until
being named president of Chevron U.S.A. Production Company in 1997. In 2000,
Robertson became president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc. He has served as
vice chairman since 2002. 

Robertson is a native of Edinburgh, Scotland. He holds several leadership
positions with various organizations, including United Way of the Bay Area, the
Bay Area Council, the U.S.-Russia Business Council, Resources for the Future,
and the American Petroleum Institute. He serves on the Corporate Advisory Board
of the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. He is
past chairman of the U.S. Energy Association, co-chairman of the U.S.- Saudi
Arabian Business Council, and vice chairman of the Leon Sullivan Foundation. 

Watson, 52, joined the company in 1980 as a financial analyst after earning a
master's degree in business administration from the University of Chicago. He
assumed his current position in 2008. As vice chairman, Watson will add
Corporate Compliance and Policy, Government and Public Affairs to his broad
portfolio of responsibilities that includes Business Development, Mergers and
Acquisitions, Strategic Planning, Procurement and the Project Resources Company,
which supports the development of major capital projects with Chevron. 

"John`s breadth of corporate and operational experience, combined with his
strategic vision, make him ideally qualified to assume this important leadership
position," O`Reilly said. 

Since joining the company, Watson has held positions of increasing
responsibility. He was appointed president of Chevron Canada Ltd. in January
1996 and in February 1998 became vice president, Strategic Planning, for Chevron
Corporation. Watson served as the integration executive for the merger of
Chevron and Texaco, and in October 2001 he was named vice president and chief
financial officer of the corporation. He became president of Chevron
International Exploration and Production in 2005, where he oversaw the company`s
production and exploration activities outside the United States. 

James, 54, will assume the expanded responsibility of executive vice president
of Chevron Corporation, overseeing the company`s Legal, Corporate Governance,
Human Resources and Security organizations. James joined Chevron in 2002 after
serving as assistant attorney general in charge of the Antitrust Division at the
U.S. Department of Justice. Earlier in his career, James practiced law at Jones,
Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue in Washington, D.C., where he chaired the firm`s worldwide
antitrust and trade regulation practice. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt; * Processed transactions maintain growth rate in January&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cross-border volumes fell in January&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares rise 1 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's
largest credit card network, said on Thursday that processed
transactions kept growing at high single-digit rates in
January, despite a global economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total processed transactions, which represent transactions
handled by VisaNet, increased 8 percent in the company's fiscal
first quarter, which ended Dec. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The growth opportunity remains substantial," Chief
Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said at a Goldman Sachs
conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, cross-border volumes fell in January, as companies
and consumers around the world trimmed travel expenses, he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa is partially insulated from the credit crisis because
it processes transactions rather than lends itself. The company
posted higher-than-expected results for its fiscal first
quarter, helped by lower expenses and an increase in the prices
it charges to banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the company lowered its outlook for net annual revenue
growth to a high-single digit percentage from the low end of a
prior 11 to 15 percent range, amid the fall in consumer
spending and a fast deterioration of the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pollitt reiterated he was "cautiously optimistic" that Visa
could achieve its revenue growth target, assuming some recovery
in the U.S. economy and in cross-border volumes by early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa shares were up 99 cents or 1.8 percent to $56.41 in
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Feb 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Capella Healthcare, Memorial Hermann
Hospital System, Trillium Health Centre and Vanderbilt University Medical
Center have turned to IBM to help build a smarter healthcare system for
ensuring patient safety, improving efficiency and reducing medical errors
through electronic medical records (EMR).

    Reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care through innovative
systems for handling patient records is a major priority in The American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, calling for $19 billion in grants
and incentives for practices to invest in health IT. This is an effort to
help cut waste, reduce the need to repeat expensive medical tests, and
most importantly, to save lives. Deadly but preventable medical errors
kill nearly 100,000 people each year -- costing the U.S. as much as $29
billion annually. These issues are illustrated in a new video on YouTube
explaining the opportunities for creating a smarter Health system
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_CcCTUpFBM.

    IBM is helping more than 1,000 hospitals worldwide integrate and access
new intelligence, making EMR become smarter with open technology. This
can help them deliver smarter healthcare through real-time access to
clinical and business information spanning multiple systems, as well as
many sources of information such as digital imaging and laboratory
results. The healthcare systems are built on IBM open technology for
integrating and managing medical data, as well as business intelligence
tools for gaining new insight. The technology can also be used for
medical personnel that can now have instant access to pertinent
information to respond more quickly to patient requirements.

    "Now is an important time for industry leaders to step up and contribute
to healthcare reform and transformation. To accelerate achievement of such
goals, IBM is teaming with our many business partners, alliances and key
clients to drive the creation of integrated delivery systems, including
electronic medical records, that help the worldwide healthcare system
become more interconnected, instrumented and intelligent," said Dan
Pelino, general manager, IBM Healthcare &amp; Life Sciences Industry. "In
this regard, the enablement of EMRs as envisioned by the Obama
Administration will help to link diagnosis, drug discovery and healthcare
delivery systems to insurers, employers, communities and patients
themselves."

    Announced today, the hospitals collaborating with IBM include:

    Memorial Hermann Hospital System

    Memorial Hermann Hospital System (MHHS) adopted IBM software and services
in concert with IBM Business Partner CGI's Sovera solution to help it
improve patient care and efficiency as well as lower costs. The solution
provides convenient 24/7 Web-based access to MHHS patients' financial
information, such as copies of patients' insurance cards, which are
scanned into the system at registration sites across more than 25
locations. Similarly, the Health Information Management department uses a
high-volume, centralized scanning center to capture the full range of
clinical documentation related to patient care. In just 20 months, MHHS
realized more than $1.2 million in operational cost savings. MHHS has an
advanced integration between its IBM-CGI Sovera content management
solution and its Cerner Millennium EMR clinical application providing
physicians and clinicians access to information anywhere and anytime.

    Capella Healthcare

    Capella Healthcare partners with communities to build strong local
healthcare systems known for quality patient care. Mineral Area Regional
Medical Center (MARMC), one of 14 Capella hospitals, is located in
Farmington, Missouri, and has been serving that community for over 50
years. With more than 100 physicians on staff, MARMC securely shares
digitized information for all of its outpatient services, including
laboratory services, electrocardiograms (EKGs), diagnostic imaging, as
well as physician and nursing notes. Any record, of any patient, can be
viewed and shared on the same day as it was updated. Utilizing IBM and IBM
Business Partner BlueWare's Wellness Connection offerings, MARMC has
realized administrative cost and time savings associated with using an
electronic system. With a manual system, it could take days to receive and
view the information. With the electronic system, a patient's medical
records, including results from blood tests or MRIs, are immediately
available for off-site physician offices to view -- lowering the risk of
patient test duplication, therefore, improving patient care while saving
the patient both time and money.

    Trillium Health Centre

    One of Canada's largest hospitals, Trillium Health Centre is using IBM
business intelligence to provide real-time, accurate insight into patient
length of stay, patient safety, service accessibility, staff retention
and budgets. With this information, Trillium can maximize cost savings,
improve patient care, and understand the critical success factors in
improving patient and staff satisfaction. For example, by looking at
trends in emergency patient volumes by day of week and by hour, staffing
patterns can be adjusted to meet the anticipated demand and ensure that
patients receive the care they need.

    Staff can also properly link the key performance indicators that impact
one another to identify potential problems and show process gaps. They
can also map into external databases from the Canadian Institute of Health
Informatics and the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to benchmark
their performance and understand the health needs of the community they
serve. With business intelligence, rather than share performance
information with only 100 people, more than 3,000 staff can be engaged in
understanding and working towards a shared vision of being an organization
of choice for their staff and community.

    Vanderbilt University Medical Center

    Vanderbilt University Medical Center is using IBM technology, built on
ILOG, for the organization's new alerts and notifications system with
which Vanderbilt doctors are automatically informed when lab results
indicate a critical situation, replacing a traditional process that
spanned a chain of communication involving lab technicians, bed-side
nurses and providers. Using 21 decision tables in ILOG JRules, the
application determines whom to notify, and by which method based on test
results, the time of day, patient location and other factors. Vanderbilt
University comprises 10 schools, a public policy institute, a
distinguished medical center and The Freedom Forum First Amendment Center.

The corrected release reads: 

BAUM, HEDLUND, ARISTEI &amp; GOLDMAN FILES LAWSUIT FOR CHILDREN OF SPIRITUAL LEADER,
SUSAN WEHLE, KILLED IN THE CONTINENTAL CONNECTION COMMUTER PLANE CRASH

The aviation disaster lawyers of Baum, Hedlund, Aristei &amp; Goldman have filed a
wrongful death lawsuit today on behalf of Jonah and Jacob Mink, whose mother,
Susan Wehle, of Amherst, was killed in the February 12 Continental Connection
Flight 3407 crash at Clarence Center, New York. 

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court, Western District of New York
in Buffalo against Continental Airlines, Inc. (Texas); Pinnacle Airlines Corp.
(Tennessee); Colgan Air, Inc. (Virginia); and Bombardier Aerospace Corporation
(Texas). 

The complaint alleges that the flight crew lost control of the aircraft due to,
among other things, a combination of airfoil icing, negligent actions of the
flight crew and an inadequate, defective, de-icing system and flight control
system of the aircraft. 

Details of the lawsuit include allegations that the airline negligently,
carelessly, and recklessly operated and monitored flight 3407 and flew it into
icing conditions, knowing the aircraft was equipped with ineffective de-icing
equipment, and had negligently failed to properly train the crew of flight 3407
to operate the aircraft in such circumstances. 

The suit alleges that, among other things, Bombardier`s Dash 8-Q400 aircraft
which crashed, was defective in its design and manufacture, had a defective
de-icing system, a defective flight control system and was unreasonably
dangerous to fly in such dangerous icing conditions as was the case on the night
of the crash. 

An absence of adequate warnings and instructions regarding such dangers were
among the allegations as well. 

The Continental Airlines flight was actually operated by Colgan Air under the
name Continental Connection. Pinnacle owns and operates Colgan Air. Each of
those airlines are authorized air transport common carriers and owed a duty to
operate the flight and maintain the aircraft with the utmost of care and to the
highest degree of safety. 

The family`s attorney, Ronald L.M. Goldman, a pilot and veteran airline disaster
attorney, said there are two primary reasons this lawsuit was filed. "This
lawsuit will enable us to explore the causes of this needless tragedy. From the
moment flight 3407 was dispatched into known icing conditions with an antiquated
de-icing system, to the time the pilots deployed the aircraft's flaps, and at
several points in between, the flight was doomed as a result of the negligent
conduct of the parties we sued. A primary objective will be to expose the
conduct that brought about this catastrophe, toward the end that a crash of this
nature will never again occur. Of equal importance, we are also seeking
reasonable, fair and just compensation for Jonah and Jacob`s enormous loss." 

"Their mother was well known and loved throughout the Amherst community. She was
the primary support for these young men, whose future has now been brutally
altered by this tragedy." Goldman also believes the facts will show that there
were a host of reasons this crash was avoidable. 

About Susan Wehle

Susan Wehle, 55, mother, spiritual leader, actress and musician, was a beloved
cantor at Williamsville`s Temple Beth Am synagogue for the past seven years. Six
hundred people gathered at the temple to mourn her loss less than 24 hours after
the crash when they learned she was one of the passengers onboard the commuter
flight. More than a thousand people attended her funeral just days later. 

Wehle, known for her interfaith work, had a Judaic Studies degree and taught
musical and spiritual workshops, conducted youth and adult choirs, and performed
in concerts in the U.S, Canada and Israel. She also had a degree in acting and
performed with theater companies in New York and Chicago. 

She had recorded a CD called "Songs for Healing and Hope" inspired by her visits
to the sick and dying. She was the daughter of Holocaust survivors and had
previously served as a cantorial soloist at Temple Sinai in Amherst for 9 &#189;
years. She left a legacy of peace and understanding. 

In addition to her sons, Wehle is survived by two sisters, Eva Friedner and Dana
Wehle, and a brother, John Wehle. 

About Ronald L. M. Goldman

Ronald L. M. Goldman is a New York native, pilot and a veteran trial lawyer
based in Los Angeles. He is a board certified civil trial lawyer, certified by
the National Board of Trial Advocacy, with 37 years of experience handling
airline disasters. 

Mr. Goldman created and taught the course on Aviation Accident Law at Pepperdine
School of Law where he worked as an adjunct law professor for 21 years. 

He is a senior partner and lead trial counsel for the national mass disaster law
firm of Baum, Hedlund, Aristei &amp; Goldman, which handles aviation and other
commercial transportation accidents across the U.S. and abroad. The firm has
handled over 500 aviation accident cases and has improved aviation safety and
changed aviation case law through key aviation litigation victories. 

Ron was the lead negotiator in one of the firm`s most significant aviation
litigation achievements when he won, as part of the settlement agreement from
the January 8, 2003 Air Midwest Flight 5481 crash in Charlotte, NC, the
agreement of the airline and maintenance company, in an organized ceremony, to
deliver an unprecedented official public apology to the families for the crash.
Goldman also served on the Plaintiffs' Executive Committee for the September 11,
2001 aviation tort litigation.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Feb 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and PDF Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: PDFS) have announced an
agreement to develop an integrated circuit (IC) design platform to
mitigate the effects of escalating design and manufacturing process
complexity at the 32-, 28-, and 22-nanometer (nm) dimensions.

    By leveraging IBM's leading-edge semiconductor design and process
development expertise and PDF Solutions' innovative pdBRIX(TM) IC design
solution, the two companies plan to develop a software and design IP
platform that can provide efficient and cost-effective design templates to
give designers more design flexibility and creativity at advanced process
nodes.

    This effort is part of an IBM-led initiative called Computational Scaling,
a process that uses mathematical techniques -- including design rules and
models -- to enable the production of complex, powerful and
energy-efficient semiconductors at advanced technology nodes.

    IBM and PDF Solutions' planned IC design platform will use a
template-based solution to form all logic circuits by assembly of a
small, manageable set of chip layout building blocks, replacing the need
for complex design rules. The physical layouts that result from this
approach are expected to improve both manufacturability and designability
of advanced ICs -- all while helping to reduce the cost and time of
hardware qualification.

    "Enabling cost-effective scaling to advanced technology nodes will require
innovation spanning the entire design-to-silicon flow," said Gary Patton,
vice president IBM Semiconductor Research and Development Center. "PDF
Solutions' pdBRIX(TM) IC design approach is a strong complement to IBM's
proven strength in technology optimization, and aligns closely with the
goals of IBM's Computational Scaling initiative."

    "PDF Solutions is proud to announce this agreement with IBM," said John
Kibarian, president and CEO of PDF Solutions. "IBM's investment in
advanced process R can provide a world class manufacturing process that
a broad set of manufacturers and fabless firms can utilize. The
co-optimized design platform based on pdBRIX(TM) can then layer on top of
the manufacturing process solutions developed by IBM."

    This agreement is a continuation of the long relationship between PDF
Solutions and IBM, extending from the 90nm through 32nm nodes. Initial
results demonstrating the feasibility of creating a competitive design
from logic templates is planned to be presented at the SPIE Design for
Manufacturability through Design-Process Integration conference.

    PDF Solutions and IBM plan to initially develop a set of templates to
assist designers in the creation of IP at the 32nm node.

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court, Western District of New York
in Buffalo against Continental Airlines, Inc. (Texas); Pinnacle Airlines Corp.
(Tennessee); Colgan Air, Inc. (Virginia); and Bombardier Aerospace Corporation
(Texas). 

The complaint alleges that the flight crew lost control of the aircraft due to,
among other things, a combination of airfoil icing, negligent actions of the
flight crew and an inadequate, defective, de-icing system and flight control
system of the aircraft. 

Details of the lawsuit include allegations that the airline negligently,
carelessly, and recklessly operated and monitored flight 3407 and flew it into
icing conditions, knowing the aircraft was equipped with ineffective de-icing
equipment, and had negligently failed to properly train the crew of flight 3407
to operate the aircraft in such circumstances. 

The suit alleges that, among other things, Bombardier`s Dash 8-Q400 aircraft
which crashed, was defective in its design and manufacture, had a defective
de-icing system, a defective flight control system and was unreasonably
dangerous to fly in such dangerous icing conditions as was the case on the night
of the crash. 

An absence of adequate warnings and instructions regarding such dangers were
among the allegations as well. 

The Continental Airlines flight was actually operated by Colgan Air under the
name Continental Connection. Pinnacle owns and operates Colgan Air. Each of
those airlines are authorized air transport common carriers and owed a duty to
operate the flight and maintain the aircraft with the utmost of care and to the
highest degree of safety. 

The family`s attorney, Ronald L.M. Goldman, a pilot and veteran airline disaster
attorney, said there are two primary reasons this lawsuit was filed. "This
lawsuit will enable us to explore the causes of this needless tragedy. From the
moment flight 3407 was dispatched into known icing conditions with an antiquated
de-icing system, to the time the pilots deployed the aircraft's flaps, and at
several points in between, the flight was doomed as a result of the negligent
conduct of the parties we sued. A primary objective will be to expose the
conduct that brought about this catastrophe, toward the end that a crash of this
nature will never again occur. Of equal importance, we are also seeking
reasonable, fair and just compensation for Jonah and Jacob`s enormous loss." 

"Their mother was well known and loved throughout the Amherst community. She was
the primary support for these young men, whose future has now been brutally
altered by this tragedy." Goldman also believes the facts will show that there
were a host of reasons this crash was avoidable. 

About Susan Wehle

Susan Wehle, 55, mother, spiritual leader, actress and musician, was a beloved
cantor at Williamsville`s Temple Beth Am synagogue for the past seven years. Six
hundred people gathered at the temple to mourn her loss less than 24 hours after
the crash when they learned she was one of the passengers onboard the commuter
flight. More than a thousand people attended her funeral just days later. 

Wehle, known for her interfaith work, had a Judaic Studies degree and taught
musical and spiritual workshops, conducted youth and adult choirs, and performed
in concerts in the U.S, Canada and Israel. She also had a degree in acting and
performed with theater companies in New York and Chicago. 

She had recorded a CD called "Songs for Healing and Hope" inspired by her visits
to the sick and dying. She was the daughter of Holocaust survivors and had
previously served as a cantorial soloist at Temple Sinai in Amherst for 9 &#189;
years. She left a legacy of peace and understanding. 

In addition to her sons, Wehle is survived by two sisters, Eva Friedner and Dana
Wehle, and a brother, John Wehle.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, Calif. &amp; ALBANY, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and the
College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) of the University at Albany
(UAlbany NanoCollege) today announced an agreement to jointly develop process
modeling technology for manufacturing 22 nanometer (nm) logic and memory chips.
The project will combine IBM`s semiconductor technology research and development
leadership and computer modeling expertise with Applied`s semiconductor
processing knowledge to develop predictive models that can help minimize process
variation, reduce development cost, and improve time to market for 22nm
semiconductors. 

FinFET transistors - vertical transistors with fin-shaped silicon channels -
will be used to validate the technology. FinFETs are considered a potential
successor to conventional planar transistors for 22nm chips. 

Today`s most advanced semiconductors have circuitry at 45 nanometers and larger.
Producing circuits at 22nm becomes more challenging since current lithography
methods - the process for creating circuit patterns on silicon wafers - present
physical limitations for critical chip layers. To help overcome these
limitations, IBM has led an initiative known as Computational Scaling.
Computational-based processes developed by IBM use advanced mathematical
techniques, software tools and high-performance computing systems to enable the
production of complex, powerful and energy-efficient semiconductors at 22
nanometers and beyond. 

"IBM pioneered the use of high-performance computing and predictive modeling to
overcome the physical limitations of optical lithography," said Gary Patton,
vice president, IBM Semiconductor Research and Development Center. "To meet the
challenges of 22nm, we need to model the entire physical structure of the
transistor, and this is now possible with the advent of ultra-powerful,
petascale computer processing. By combining Applied`s thin film deposition and
etch processing expertise and CNSE`s fundamental science know-how with IBM`s
capabilities, we can extend our modeling beyond lithography to help deliver a
more complete and validated manufacturing process." 

IBM brings to the collaboration more than 50 years of semiconductor technology
experience and a proven track record of technology development and manufacturing
that can help accelerate development of 22nm technology and beyond. End-to-end
integration - from design to manufacturing to characterization and test - gives
IBM the ability to leverage process insights for outstanding modeling and
excellent results in hardware. 

Developing a chip manufacturing process for a new technology node involves
complex interactions among multiple process variables, fabrication disciplines,
and circuit requirements. With circuit features just a few hundred atoms across,
the interactions of each process variable must be taken into account. For
advanced technology nodes, this can lead to costly production experiments that
consume many thousands of semiconductor wafers. The goal is to develop
computational models to perform most of these experiments in a "virtual"
laboratory, greatly reducing the need for actual wafer processing. 

"The next big scaling challenge is to give these ultra-small transistors
consistent geometry and electrical properties which define the speed,
reliability and power consumption of a device," said Hans Stork, Group Vice
President and Chief Technology Officer of Applied`s Silicon Systems Group. "The
key to reducing this variability is to integrate and optimize every fabrication
step to precisely construct and repeat the critical transistor geometry. By
using Applied`s process knowledge to validate and refine IBM`s predictive
modeling, we plan to bring this new technology to market in a shorter time, with
less risk and at a lower development cost than traditional experimental
methods." 

Applied has production-proven processing systems and a wealth of technology
expertise covering the additional steps that are to be included in the FinFET
model. Applied`s award-winning Producer APF and Producer PECVD systems will
deposit the Advanced Patterning Film (APF), oxide and nitride hard mask layers
with tunable thickness, density, reflectivity and stress, while the Applied
Centura Enabler and AdvantEdge etch systems offer closed-loop CD trim, and
optimum etch rate and selectivity for excellent global profile control and CD
uniformity. 

"The UAlbany NanoCollege looks forward to building on our relationship with IBM
and Applied Materials for the development of leading-edge process modeling
methods that are critical for the development and manufacturing of 22nm chips,"
said Richard Brilla, Vice President for Strategy, Alliances and Consortia at
CNSE. "This collaboration will extend current research at CNSE`s Albany NanoTech
to validate fundamental process modeling work for future technology nodes,
accelerating the integration of advanced processing and innovative
nanoelectronics research and development that is necessary for scaling amid the
growing complexity of next-generation transistors." 

The research will be carried out primarily at CNSE`s Albany NanoTech Complex in
Albany, NY, where Applied has a full suite of leading-edge processing tools and
a staff of engineers and scientists. Additional modeling and process
characterization will be performed at IBM`s facilities in East Fishkill and
Yorktown, NY, Applied`s Maydan Technology Center in Sunnyvale, CA and the
Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations (CCNI) at the Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.

sequel to the award-winning Girl Gourmet Cupcake Maker, which was nominated for
the Activity Toy of the Year Award. With the Girl Gourmet Cake Bakery young
chefs can create elaborate mini 2-tiered fondant cakes after baking them for
just 30 seconds in the microwave. 

"I am excited to work with JAKKS Pacific and be a part of the Girl Gourmet Cake
Bakery line to introduce kids to the world of baking and all the cool, creative
ways kids can express themselves," said Duff Goldman, who bakes and creates
cakes that defy explanation on his hit series, Ace of Cakes, seen every Tuesday
and Thursday night on Food Network. "Now young bakers can pretend to be just
like me and make beautiful fondant cakes for their friends and family, but
without all the mess that I make! I wish we had this product when I was a kid!" 

Jennifer Richmond, SVP of Licensing and Media, JAKKS Pacific, said JAKKS
recognized Goldman as the perfect partner for the Girl Gourmet Cake Bakery. 

"We knew Duff Goldman would be the perfect partner for the Girl Gourmet Cake
Bakery because he really took extreme cake making to a whole new level with Ace
of Cakes," said Richmond. "We love encouraging kids to push the limits in the
kitchen and think they`re going to have fun creating elaborate and wacky fondant
cakes just like Duff."

cake flavors, stir and pour into the double cavity cake molds, and then place
into the microwavable safe container and microwave for 30 seconds. No hot ovens
involved! Next add water to one of the colorful fondant mixes, stir and roll out
onto the non-stick mat. Remove the cakes from their molds once they have cooled
and cover the cakes with sweet fondant. Finally, place the mini masterpiece on

beautifully finished 2-tiered mini fondant cake! Ages 8+, Suggested Retail Price

stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Foreign Exchange &amp; Big Pharma

Large-cap pharmaceutical companies, like many companies with significant
international operations, saw financial results in 2008 affected by foreign
currency translation. 

U.S. companies with significant European operations benefit when the U.S. dollar
weakens. A stronger Euro or British Pound means more U.S. dollars when European
currency denominated revenues are repatriated to the U.S. and converted to
dollars. The opposite is true when the U.S. dollar strengthens. 

Schering-Plough (NYSE: SGP) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) with 70% and 58% of total
2008 sales, respectively, coming from outside the U.S. were among the largest
beneficiaries of a weaker U.S. dollar in the large-cap pharmaceutical space. 

Bristol-Myers (NYSE: BMY) is one of the least-exposed large-cap pharma companies
to currency volatility with only 41% of revenues coming from overseas. 

Last Move Before Nationalization?

The window of opportunity appears to be closing for financial institutions with
respect to correcting their ills before the potential for some entities to be
nationalized becomes a reality. With the government willing to increase its
stake in Citigroup (NYSE: C) up to 40%, this creates substantial doubt as to the
ability of the company to remain independent. 

As of this juncture, we would submit there still a window of opportunity for
financial institutions to significantly self-correct. 

Credit Suisse Estimates Lowered

On February 11, 2009, Credit Suisse Group (NYSE: CS) posted a net loss from
continuing operations of CHF5.5 billion, which was worse than our estimate,
largely reflecting higher-than-expected trading losses and CHF833 million in
costs related to accelerated implementation of CS`s strategic plan to
restructure the investment bank. Results benefited from CHF2.1 billion
accounting gain from the widening of credit spreads on CS`s own debt. 

The investment bank will reduce risk-weighted assets by 43%, headcount will be
cut by 5,300 (of which 2,600 was reflected in 2008, with the balance in first
half 2009), and total costs will fall by CHF2 billion. In other news, Credit
Suisse raised CHF11.2 billion in Tier 1 capital, resulting in a 13.3% Tier 1
capital ratio at 2008 year-end, and cut the dividend to CHF0.10 from CHF2.50 in
2007.

billion, according to a filing by the oil company on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company said it expects to make a total of $4.6 billion
in contributions to the plans in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end of 2007, Exxon had the largest pension deficit
among companies in the Standard  Poor's 500, with a $6.7
billion shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's U.S. pension plans, which are 73 percent invested
in equities, were hit particularly hard in 2008, with the
deficit growing to $6.6 billion from $1.4 billion a year
before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our plans are down with the market," spokesman Chris
Welberry said. "Regardless of the current funding status of the
underlying plans, all our defined benefit pension obligations
are supported by the financial strength of the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's non-U.S. pension deficit grew to $8.7 billion from
$5.3 billion, the company said in the regulatory filing. Of the
non-U.S. pension assets, 63 percent were held in equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A month ago, the world's largest listed company reported a
full-year profit of $45.2 billion, setting a new company and
U.S. record.

to differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by, or underlying the
forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause
actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements:
the risk that our perception of the cyclicality of the markets we primarily
serve is incorrect or there are recessionary economic cycles and downturns in
customers' business cycles; increases in the prices paid for new revenue
equipment and changes in the resale value of our used equipment causing our gain
on disposition to fluctuate; excess tractor or trailer capacity in the trucking
industry; decreased demand for our services or loss of one or more of our major
customers; our ability to maintain profitability in or continue to grow our
logistics business; surplus inventories; strikes, work slow downs, or work
stoppages at the company, customers, ports, or other shipping related
facilities; increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices as well as
fluctuations in surcharge collection; the volume and terms of diesel purchase
commitments; interest rates, fuel taxes, tolls, and license and registration
fees; increased indebtedness, and associated interest expense, arising from
upgrading our fleet of equipment; shortages in supply of new equipment from
manufacturers; increases in compensation for and difficulty in attracting and
retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors; elevated experience in
the frequency and severity of claims relating to accident, cargo, workers'
compensation, health, and other claims; changes in management's estimates of
liability based upon such experience and development factors; increases in
insurance premiums and deductible amounts; seasonal factors such as harsh
weather conditions that increase operating costs; decreases in productivity that
may offset or eliminate potential savings from the installation of auxiliary
power units or unexpected maintenance or other costs associated with such units;
competition from trucking, rail, and intermodal competitors; and regulatory
requirements that increase costs or decrease efficiency, including new emissions
standards for engines and the adoption of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. Viewers
of conference material should review and consider these factors along with the
various disclosures by the company in its press releases, stockholder reports,
and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is seeking licensing deals to help turn its burgeoning business focused on generic drugs into a growth engine for the world's largest drug maker over the next several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, whose own products have been eroded by competition from low-cost generic versions, plans to make a big advance into off-patent medicines both in developed and emerging markets, said company executive David Simmons, who is overseeing the push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's current roster of its own medicines that have lost patent protection already amounts to $10 billion in annual sales, and it plans to boost its portfolio by marketing generic versions of other drugmakers' medicines, Simmons said. It has already started selling versions of antibiotics that were not originally made by Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker is seeking to expand its portfolio of generic versions of hospital-based injectable drugs, a market which has fewer rivals and in which Pfizer already has a competitive cost structure, Simmons said, as well as significantly broadening its array of generic pills and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons said Pfizer decided to create a unit focused on off-patent medicines after determining, when CEO Jeff Kindler took over in 2006, that global growth of such drugs would outstrip that of on-patent medicines through 2012, especially as developing markets demand low-priced medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we looked at this off-patent market, especially in the developing world but also in the U.S., we saw it very poorly served, especially from a quality standpoint," said Simmons, general manager of Pfizer's established product business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not saying all generics are poor quality. There are some very high-quality generic companies. However, there's a lot of noise -- how do you know?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You start to put those pieces together and we say there's a societal need for this and there's a huge market opportunity that flows from that," said Simmons, a steel industry veteran who has been with Pfizer for 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which struck a $68 billion deal in January for rival Wyeth WYE.N to shore up profits, plans to turn the off-patent unit from a deteriorating business to a "growth story" over the next four years, Simmons said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's new focus on off-patent medicines already has reversed revenue slides for some products, Simmons said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons said the company is hiring regulatory executives to steer the business, but plans to strike licensing deals for access to supplies of generic medicines. An acquisition is unlikely in the near term, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He plans to prioritize deals for injectable products, and hopes to increase Pfizer's U.S. portfolio from about 18 products now to 100 perhaps in five years. Pfizer is already efficient at producing the injectable products, Simmons said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Compared to what a top-notch generic company would make it for, there's not much cost differential," he said. "Generally, the belief is their cost structure is much lower than ours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, he said, fewer competitors are in the injectable space: "You can literally go through these on about one hand. Where if you get into how many people are selling (Pfizer's off-patent blood-pressure pill) amlodipine in this country you have to go to all your fingers all your toes and then your neighbors' fingers and toes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons also hopes to boost Pfizer's U.S. portfolio of generic pills to 200 from 60-80 currently. It has previously sold versions of Pfizer drugs out of its Greenstone unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond injectables and pills, Simmons hopes to spur growth through reformulations of existing medicines. For example, the company is developing a citrus-flavored version of the anxiety pill Xanax that dissolves under the tongue. In addition to dissolving versions, future reformulations may be designed to cut the number of pills a patient must take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also seeking how Pfizer can retain more revenue once patents lapse on its products. His first such task is mammoth: mitigating the decline for Lipitor, the $12 billion-a-year cholesterol fighter that loses U.S. patent protection in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons is optimistic Pfizer can stem the decline of Lipitor sales somewhat more than with past Pfizer products, but cautions the boost will not be huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm confident we'll create value outside of the predicted erosion curve," Simmons said. "It's not billions, though."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons said the company was evaluating whether to get involved with generic versions of biotechnology medicines, in which some pharmaceutical companies already are investing, but it currently is "not in the game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's desire to separate itself as a quality manufacturer in the generics arena could be timely amid concerns over contaminated medicines made in China and U.S. generic manufacturers disrupting supplies over regulatory problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Simmons eschews the term "generic" because he says it has a connotation of questionable quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want them to see Pfizer as the resolution to their dilemma," he said. "I want them to see that they get an affordable medicine and not sacrifice quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Feb 27 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) now
expects a Nigerian plant that will convert gas to liquids (GTL)
to be operational by 2012, the second-largest U.S. oil company
said in a filing, which would be a year later than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; South Africa's Sasol Ltd (SOLJ.J), the world's top GTL
company, was reviewing the Escravos plant last July as it saw
costs doubling to $6 billion and completion delayed by a year
to 2011. In September, it cut its Escravos stake to 10 percent,
selling 27.5 percent to Chevron, which now owns 75 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plant, located 60 miles (100 km) southeast of Lagos,
will produce 34,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said a Phase 3A expansion of the Escravos Gas
Plant, which will feed the $5.9 billion GTL plant, was now
expected to start production in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron also said in the filing on Thursday the cost of the
first phase of its Agbami project, an offshore Nigerian field
of which it owns 68.2 percent, would be $7 billion, up from
$5.4 billion previously expected. After starting production
last July, its total output of crude oil and natural gas
liquids is expected to reach 250,000 barrels per day this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Ramon, California-based company has said it expects
total worldwide 2009 production of 2.63 million barrels of oil
equivalent per day, assuming oil prices at $50 per barrel.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from Pfizer) By Mike Oboh KANO, Nigeria, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Nigeria is close to a settlement in a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) over a 1996 drug trial it says caused the death of 11 children and left dozens more disabled, lawyers said on Friday. Nigeria's federal government and its northern state of Kano sued Pfizer in May 2007 for a total of $8.5 billion in damages over the testing of the antibiotic Trovan in Kano during a 1996 meningitis epidemic, which killed 12,000 children. The New York-based drugmaker denies all charges and argues meningitis, not Trovan, killed the children or damaged their health. It said Trovan saved lives and was as effective as a more established drug used for comparison in the study. We have presented our final position to Pfizer and what we are going to do at the next meeting is to cross the 'T's and dot the 'I's, Kano state's Attorney-General Aliyu Umar said. I can assure you we are going to resolve the issue before the next April court date ... If Pfizer refuses to agree with our terms we will continue with the case, but I doubt that very much, he told Reuters. Pfizer's lead counsel in the case, Anthony Idigbe, also said he was confident a deal would be reached in the coming weeks. I would not say there is a deal as at today, but we are close to a deal and I expect that before the end of March or maybe even sooner we will have arrived at some deal in principle, he told Reuters by telephone. Pfizer said it continued to make serious efforts to reach an amicable resolution of the federal and Kano state cases, and again said it was prepared to stay at the negotiating table until agreements were reached. We believe that settlement is in the best interest of all parties, will avoid the continued cost and distraction of litigation, and can help improve and expand health care for the people of Nigeria, the company said in a statement.  LEGAL TANGLE The civil and criminal cases launched by the Nigerian authorities have grown into a tangle of unresolved petitions and side issues, dragging from one adjournment to the next. No witness has been heard and no substantive issue tackled. Pfizer said in October it hoped to reach an out-of-court settlement with Nigeria, but talks over a settlement have been slowed by disagreements over liabilities and compensation. Court sources said almost a year ago that Pfizer had proposed to pay $10 million in compensation, rehabilitate the hospital where the Trovan study took place, and upgrade Kano's state-owned drug manufacturing company. But Umar, Kano's lead attorney, said last April the government wanted a better package for the victims. Pfizer has said in the past that prosecution lawyers have failed to provide evidence to support their monetary claims but that it wants an amicable resolution. The company has said it has proposed to set up a fund for participants in the study, underwrite projects to improve and expand healthcare in Nigeria, and provide assistance to cover legitimate legal expenses incurred by the government.

&lt;p&gt;   * Microsoft to invest strongly in cloud computing    * Says made major changes to Windows Vista &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Jon Hurdle &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA Feb 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has suffered declining revenues in the recession and sees continued challenges in coming months, the president of its business division said on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But Stephen Elop said the software giant will continue to invest aggressively, particularly in Internet-based applications, or so-called cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are pretty pessimistic in the near-term, we see tough times in the months ahead," Elop said in an interview with Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft revenue has been challenged but we will continue to invest very aggressively in the future of technology during this period," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Elop rejected a suggestion that Microsoft is struggling to catch up with competitors like Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) in terms of cloud-computing applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He argued that Microsoft's cloud-computing applications have been endorsed by major clients including Nokia (NOK1V.HE) and Coca-Cola (KO.N), and that the company's Windows Azure operating system for online applications was endorsed by other developers at a conference in October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are absolutely leading at this point," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has developed browser versions of programs such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint within its Office product, which is in private testing, Elop said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He declined to say when the online version of Office would be released to the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Elop acknowledged there had been "a lot of criticism" of the Windows Vista operating system but said Microsoft had made "very major architectural changes" in such areas as security and performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The improvements to Vista will also enhance the performance of the to-be-launched Windows 7 operation system that will succeed it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are cautiously optimistic about how Windows 7 will land," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Phil Berlowitz) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((tiffany.wu@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 223 6142; Reuters Messaging: tiffany.wu.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MICROSOFT/ELOP  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;  KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA, Feb 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
EON Bank Group has implemented the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Power 550 Express
server to accelerate the bank's transaction process and improve its
back-end system, allowing faster data access with applications running 24
by 7. The RM20 million (USD5.5 million) investment was done to upgrade
the group's core banking applications and disaster recovery site, which
is expected to further improve the banking group's commitment, delivery
and efficiency to its customers.

    Speaking at a press conference with IBM Malaysia and Silverlake Group to
announce the implementation, EON Bank Group Chief Executive Officer Albert
Lau Yiong said, "We are proud to be the first financial institution in
Malaysia to acquire this new system, which will improve business
responsiveness and customer service efficiency."

    EON Bank Group has been emphasizing higher customer satisfaction through
the introduction and implementation of various initiatives in the past
year as part of its 'Project Quantum Leap,' where strategic initiatives
including improving the bank's underlying organization structure and
systems and processes were formulated.

    "In order to serve our customers better and become the customers' bank of
choice, it is critical that we continuously improve our performance and
service level. We have tested the IBM Power 550 Express and found it to be
stable, scalable and flexible, which are the three necessary criteria to
support EON Bank Group's projected business growth in the next 5 years,"
Mr. Lau commented. "This system upgrade establishes new benchmarks for
innovations and responsiveness that others in the local banking sector
will be challenged to match."

    The IBM Power 550 Express allows more applications to run on fewer
servers, hence reducing the infrastructure cost. The system reduces
management, maintenance and licensing costs, and can be easily scaled to
suit EON Bank's expansion plans.

    "This system makes it possible for EON Bank Group's applications to run
faster and be more responsive, which can result in added business
advantages and higher client satisfaction. The near-continuous application
availability also enables EON Bank to improve the efficiency and ensure
business continuity," said Ou Shian Waei, Managing Director of IBM
Malaysia.

    "IBM is committed to helping EON Bank Group grow and transform their
business through our most advanced, proven solutions and rich industrial
experience."

    The system, which will go live on March 8, 2009, is being implemented by
EON Bank Group jointly with Silverlake Group.

    Ronnie Tan, President of Silverlake Group, added, "Silverlake Group is
recognized as the market leader in providing and implementing core banking
solutions in the banking and finance industry in Asia Pacific. As a
strategic IT partner of the EON Bank Group, we will leverage on these
successful experiences and expertise to continuously help EON Bank Group
in enhancing their Silverlake integrated core banking solution to support
the Bank's business strategy."

world's fastest chip.

&lt;p&gt;  KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA, Feb 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
EON Bank Group has implemented the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Power 550 Express
server to accelerate the bank's transaction process and improve its
back-end system, allowing faster data access with applications running 24
by 7. The RM20 million (USD5.5 million) investment was done to upgrade
the group's core banking applications and disaster recovery site, which
is expected to further improve the banking group's commitment, delivery
and efficiency to its customers.

the introduction and implementation of various initiatives in the past
year as part of its 'Project Quantum Leap,' where strategic initiatives
including improving the bank's underlying organization structure and
systems and processes were formulated.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) said Friday
production was not affected by the mid-week shutting of a gasoline-making
fluid catalytic cracker CO boiler at its 348,500 barrel-per-day Beaumont,
Texas, refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We anticipate no impact to production ... the shutdown of the CO
boiler will not impact production," Kathleen Jackson, a spokeswoman for
Exxon, said when asked about a company filing late Thursday on the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A malfunction of the boiler feedwater pump caused the shutdown of the
CO Boiler on Wednesday, noted the filing with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality.

&lt;p&gt;  MEXICO CITY, Feb 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE: KOF) (BMV: KOFL) ("Coca-Cola
FEMSA"), the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America and the second
largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world in terms of volumes, announced
today that it has successfully closed the transaction with Bavaria, a
subsidiary of SABMiller, to jointly acquire with The Coca-Cola Company,
the Brisa bottled water business (including the Brisa brand and
production assets).

    This transaction will enable us to increase our presence in the water
business and complement our portfolio. Brisa sold 47 million unit cases in
2008 in Colombia.

    The purchase price of US$92 million was shared equally by Coca-Cola FEMSA
and The Coca-Cola Company. The parties have also agreed a transition
arrangement after closing, during which Bavaria will still be producing,
selling and distributing Brisa.

    Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. produces and distributes Coca-Cola,
Sprite, Fanta, Lift and other trademark beverages of The Coca-Cola
Company in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico
City and southeast Mexico), Guatemala (Guatemala City and surrounding

(nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide),
Brazil (greater Sao Paulo, Campinas, Santos, the state of Mato Grosso do
Sul, part of the state of Goias and Minas Gerais) and Argentina (federal
capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas), along with bottled water,
beer and other beverages in some of these territories. The Company has 31
bottling facilities in Latin America and serves over 1,500,000 retailers
in the region. The Coca-Cola Company owns a 31.6% equity interest in
Coca-Cola FEMSA.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) chief financial officer forecast at least another year of tough trading in all areas on Thursday, as the economy shows no immediate sign of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the world's largest software company confirmed that it had cut the rate it pays agencies supplying temporary office workers by 10 percent, as it looks to trim costs as demand wanes for its applications and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A contraction of some substance is the way that we are thinking about it," said Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Christopher Liddell at a Goldman Sachs technology conference in San Francisco, which was broadcast on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How long the contraction's going to be and how deep none of us know," he added. "Despite what politicians and others are saying, it's probably for the next year or two that we're going to see a difficult trading environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Microsoft confirmed that it had cut rates paid to agencies supplying temporary office staff, saying it was part of a broad cost-cutting plan announced in January, which included slashing 5,000 staff over the next 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move was motivated by "the need to achieve greater cost reductions," a Microsoft spokesman said, adding that the cuts did not affect more skilled contract workers such as programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company, which employs about 95,000 people, does not break out numbers of temporary or contract workers and did not say how much the move would save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Goldman Sachs conference, Liddell also said that the roll-out of its new Windows 7 operating system might help personal computer sales rebound next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We might see a bump (in PC sales) next year, just as a result of lower demand this year," said Liddell, who expects some users will delay buying a new computer to wait for Windows 7, expected early next year. "It will be helpful, but it will not outweigh the general macro-economics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell was neutral on the prospects for a deal with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) over its rival's Internet search business, which the executives of both companies appeared to be warming to in comments made this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to have a plan that excludes Yahoo, we can't be dependent on that," said Liddell. "Even though we've suggested it would be great to get together, we don't work on the basis that's going to happen. If it does that's great, but if it doesn't, that's fine too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo rebuffed a $47.5 billion acquisition bid from Microsoft last year, and saw a deal to form a search advertising partnership with Google Inc (GOOG.O) fall apart amid antitrust concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares closed down 3.2 percent at $16.42 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby)&lt;/p&gt;

more personalized and highly targeted Web experiences to people
everywhere.

    Coremetrics for IBM WebSphere Portal will position enterprises to
understand exactly what customers are doing when they visit a WebSphere
Portal Web site -- be it a B2B site or a corporate intranet -- that
develops, manages and delivers customized content. Businesses will now be
able to understand precisely how all elements of a customized portal are
performing. As a result, they can easily create and manage highly targeted
and effective sites based on customer and employee needs and behavior,
directly within the WebSphere Portal software. Metrics-based targeting of
portal content will lead to highly relevant content and ultimately to
greater revenue for the company. The automatic tuning of portal content
and better designs will translate into greatly decreased infrastructure
costs.

    IBM and Coremetrics are partnering to create a solution that will drive
high productivity for web teams by providing specially designed reports
that present actionable information for measuring success across all
WebSphere Portal-driven sites. Comprehensive behavioral data drives the
solution's online marketing and business optimization applications,
automating traditionally time-intensive activities such as content
management and behavioral targeting.

    "To create exceptional web experiences that attract, serve, and retain
customers, companies are increasing their focus on web analytics to
constantly improve and differentiate themselves to customers. It's all
about serving your customers better, and Coremetrics and IBM are making it
a lot easier for companies to delight their customers through the web,"
said Larry Bowden, vice president, Portals and Mashups, IBM.

    Coremetrics' participation in IBM's UEOI builds on the companies'
long-standing partnership to develop and deliver the Coremetrics for IBM
WebSphere Commerce solution. In fact, IBM recently awarded Coremetrics the
2008 WebSphere Commerce Leadership Award for ISV Partner Innovation in
recognition of its ongoing commitment to deep integration and mutual
support of the WebSphere Commerce offering.

    "The ideal portal embraces personalization because that's the best way to
quickly deliver useful information to vastly different people," said John
Squire, chief strategy officer for Coremetrics. "Anything short of that
goal is a huge waste of money for the business and an equal waste of time
for the people who rely on portals for critical information. The best way
to get to that goal is to leverage analytics and take a metrics-based
approach to building and maintaining your portal. IBM and Coremetrics are
working together to make this vision a reality for WebSphere Portal
customers everywhere."

&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
WebTrends, a leading provider of web analytics and online marketing solutions,
today announced an integration partnership with IBM which will incorporate the
collection and analysis of visitor behavior data into IBM WebSphere Portal
software, creating a closed-loop content performance management solution. 

WebTrends' data collection technologies enable IBM's portal software to
accurately pass relevant portlet output to the selected data collection option,
which is called the SmartSource Data Collection Server. This allows customers to
make better marketing decisions using social-based technologies. It also makes
it possible to start using performance data from WebTrends to drive optimization
processes within WebSphere Portal. 

"IBM is a valuable long-term partner and we are looking forward to the
integration of WebSphere Portal with WebTrends analytics," said James McDermott,
vice president partners, WebTrends. "More and more of our customers have come to
expect better analytics performance with the portals they use internally, to
gauge performance management and drive marketing and business objectives." 

"IBM has designed its portal software with easy-to-use, social-based
technologies that put people in control of IT. WebTrends shares that same vision
through its Web analytics products," said Larry Bowden, vice president, IBM
portals and mashups. "This partnership is a big leap forward in incorporating
analytics data with a single view." 

Ultimately, the initiative will enable a customer to simply select the WebTrends
analytics package they are familiar with and WebSphere Portal will start passing
data for the selected system. This will address cumbersome tag management and
deployment issues bringing analytics data into the environment needed to drive
marketing action.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Leads Recycling, Education Effort at World Famous Street Festival
MIAMI--(Business Wire)--
What happens when you combine the world`s favorite sparkling beverage, one
million people, 200 recycling bins and the largest street festival in the United
States in one of the hottest cities in America? For Calle Ocho, you get one of
the most intensive recycling efforts in South Florida. On March 15, Coca-Cola
Recycling will join the Kiwanis Club of Little Havana to create a recycling
initiative at this year`s Calle Ocho in Miami and generate greater awareness
about recycling among consumers. 

"Coca-Cola is committed to meeting its goal of recycling and reusing 100 percent
of the bottles and cans it produces in the U.S.," said Alejandro Gomez,
multicultural marketing manager, southeast region, Coca-Cola North America. "We
are thrilled to join forces with the Kiwanis Club to bring recycling to Calle
Ocho and help us meet our goal. Calle Ocho is an amazing event where people can
have fun, enjoy a Coke and celebrate life while recycling one bottle at a time."


Coca-Cola Recycling will place 200 recycling bins along the event route for
attendees to recycle their aluminum cans and PET plastic beverage bottles. In
addition, Coca-Cola Recycling will have an interactive recycling station
designed to educate the community about the importance of recycling. Volunteers
at the recycling station will provide giveaways to festival goers who visit the
station to recycle their beverage containers. Giveaways will include coupons for
a free 20-ounce Coca-Cola product that can be redeemed at participating
retailers. 

As an extra incentive, a "Caught Red Handed" program will be employed at the 8th
minute of every hour. Two lucky people who get caught recycling will receive a
backstage pass for the Coca-Cola Stage entitling them to attend the Coca-Cola
VIP area, meet some of the artists and experience Calle Ocho Coca-Cola style. 

"Coca-Cola has been a valued partner of Calle Ocho for more than 30 years," said
Ricardo Gonzalez, president of the Kiwanis Club of Little Havana. "Calle Ocho is
the crown jewel of all Hispanic celebrations in the U.S. and we are excited to
be working with Coca-Cola to help educate festival goers on the importance of
recycling." 

Waste Services of Florida, Inc. (WSI), a multi-regional, integrated solid waste
services company, will play a crucial role in these efforts by collecting the
recycled materials and transporting them back to their facility for processing. 

"With two hundred barrels in place, we have the opportunity to recover a
significant number of used beverage containers," said Mike Tewey, district
manager, WSI. "I`m confident that South Florida residents will take advantage of
this opportunity to reduce waste and recycle these valuable resources." 

In January, Coca-Cola opened the world`s largest plastic bottle-to-bottle
recycling plant in Spartanburg, S.C. and launched a multi-million dollar
marketing effort supporting recycling called "Give it Back." The "Give it Back"
program is designed to remind consumers that Coca-Cola bottles and cans are
valuable recyclables. 

Calle Ocho

"El Festival de la Calle Ocho," as it is known to many, is a 16-city block event
that closes down S.W. 8th Street from 11th to 27th Avenue in Little Havana.
Ethnic food kiosks line the north and south sides of the street while
intersecting avenues showcase musical stages featuring top recording artists and
groups featuring merengue, salsa, pop, reggeton, and Caribbean music.
