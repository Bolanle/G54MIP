&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said on Saturday his government could not afford to pay General Electric for its services and rebuked parliament for failing to allow a $3 billion bond sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, Iraq's cabinet approved the sale of the treasury bonds, of which $2.4 billion was meant to pay to revamp Iraq's dilapidated electricity sector.

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD Aug 1 (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki said on Saturday his government could not afford to
pay General Electric (GE.N) for its services and rebuked
parliament for failing to allow a $3 billion bond sale.&lt;/p&gt;

STELLUNGNAHME VON REX W. TILLERSON, VORSTANDSCHEF VON EXXONMOBIL: 

&#8222;Die weltweite wirtschaftliche Situation beeinflusst die Energiebranche sowohl
durch die Schwankungen der Rohstoffpreise als auch durch die geringere Nachfrage
nach Produkten.Trotz dieser Herausforderungen erreichte ExxonMobil stabile
Ergebnisse.Wir konnten unser Kapitalinvestitionsprogramm auf fast
rekordverd&#228;chtigem Niveau fortsetzen und in der ersten H&#228;lfte des Jahres mehr
als 16 Milliarden USD an unsere Aktion&#228;re zur&#252;ckgeben."

&#8222;Die Ertr&#228;ge von ExxonMobil im zweiten Quartal 2009 ohne Sonderposten beliefen
sich auf 4,1 Milliarden USD, ein R&#252;ckgang von 66 % gegen&#252;ber dem zweiten Quartal
2008. Der Ertrag je Aktie ohne Sonderposten verzeichnete eine Abnahme von 63 %
und spiegelte die gesunkenen Ertr&#228;ge und den Gewinn aus dem
Aktienr&#252;ckkaufprogramm wider. Die Ertr&#228;ge im zweiten Quartal 2009 beliefen sich
auf 4,0 Milliarden USD und fielen damit 66 % gegen&#252;ber dem Vorjahr und
enthielten eine Sonderbelastung in H&#246;he von 140 Millionen USD f&#252;r Zinsen aus dem
Valdez Schadensersatz-Urteil. Die Ertr&#228;ge im zweiten Quartal 2008 enthielten
eine Zahlung von 290 Millionen USD bez&#252;glich des Valdez Schadensersatz-Urteils."

&#8222;Die Ertr&#228;ge ohne Sonderposten fielen in den ersten 6 Monaten gegen&#252;ber der
ersten Jahresh&#228;lfte 2008 um 62 % und spiegelten so die gesunkenen Realisierungen
von Roh&#246;l und Erdgas wider. Die Ertr&#228;ge in der ersten Jahresh&#228;lfte 2009 sanken
gegen&#252;ber 2008 ebenfalls um 62 %."

&#8222;ExxonMobil setzte sein stabiles Kapitalinvestitionsprogramm fort. In der ersten
Jahresh&#228;lfte 2009 betrugen die Ausgaben f&#252;r Kapital- und Explorationsvorhaben
12,3 Milliarden USD, was unserem langfristigen Plan entspricht."

&#8222;Das Unternehmen sch&#252;ttete im zweiten Quartal durch Dividenden und
Aktienr&#252;ckk&#228;ufe insgesamt 7,0 Milliarden USD an seine Aktion&#228;re aus, um die im
Umlauf befindlichen Aktien zu verringern."

DIE WICHTIGSTEN DATEN DES ZWEITEN QUARTALS

* Die Ertr&#228;ge ohne Sonderposten beliefen sich auf 4.090 Millionen USD, ein
R&#252;ckgang von 66 % oder 7.880 Millionen USD gegen&#252;ber dem zweiten Quartal 2008. 
* Der Gewinn pro Aktie ohne Sonderposten betrug 0,84 USD, eine Abnahme von 63 %.

* Die Ertr&#228;ge fielen 66 % gegen&#252;ber dem zweiten Quartal 2008. Die Ertr&#228;ge im
zweiten Quartal 2009 enthielten eine Sonderbelastung in H&#246;he von 140 Millionen
USD f&#252;r Zinsen im Zusammenhang mit dem Valdez Schadensersatz-Urteil. Der Ertrag
im zweiten Quartal 2008 enthielt Ausgaben in H&#246;he von 290 Millionen USD im
Zusammenhang mit dem Valdez Schadensersatz-Urteil. 
* Der Kapital- und Explorationsaufwand belief sich auf 6,6 Milliarden USD, eine
Verminderung von 6 % gegen&#252;ber dem zweiten Quartal 2008, was vor allem auf das
Erstarken des US-Dollar zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren ist. 
* Der effektive Einkommenssteuersatz stieg von 49 % auf 50 %. 
* Die Produktion von &#214;leinheiten fiel um 3 % gegen&#252;ber dem zweiten Quartal 2008.
Ohne die Auswirkungen von Anspruchsvolumen, OPEC-Raten und Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen
verringerte sich die Produktion um circa 2,5 %. 
* Der Cashflow aus betrieblichen T&#228;tigkeiten und der Ver&#228;u&#223;erung von
Verm&#246;genswerten betrug 3,0 Milliarden USD, einschlie&#223;lich der Ver&#228;u&#223;erung von
Verm&#246;genswerten in H&#246;he von 0,8 Milliarden USD. 
* Der R&#252;ckkauf von Aktien im Wert von 5,0 Milliarden USD verringerte die im
Umlauf befindlichen Aktien um 1,5 %. 
* Qatargas 2 Train 4, die erste von zwei LNG (Fl&#252;ssigerdgas) Anlagen f&#252;r dieses
Projekt, hat die volle Produktion aufgenommen. Mit einer Leistung von 7,8
Millionen Tonnen pro Jahr ist es die gr&#246;&#223;te, in Betrieb genommene
LNG-Produktionsanlage der Welt. 
* Start des Piceance Phase 1 Projekts in West-Colorado wurde eingel&#228;utet. Mit
den neuen Anlagen k&#246;nnen bis zu 200 Millionen Kubikfu&#223; (ca. 5.664 Millionen
Liter) Erdgas pro Tag verarbeitet werden. Die Produktion wurde auf &#252;ber 80
Millionen Kubikfu&#223; (ca. 2.265 Millionen Liter) pro Tag erh&#246;ht und es wird
erwartet, dass sie auch in der zweiten Jahresh&#228;lfte weiter steigt. 
* Das Joint Venture von ExxonMobil in der chinesischen Provinz Fujian gab den
Start der Roh&#246;l- und Vakuumdestillation mit einer Kapazit&#228;t von 160.000 Barrel
pro Tag in dem neuen kombinierten Raffinierungs- und petrochemischen Komplex
bekannt.

Zweites Quartal 2009 im Vergleich zum zweiten Quartal 2008

Der Upstream-Gewinn betrug 3.812 Millionen USD und fiel um 6.200 Millionen USD
gegen&#252;ber dem zweiten Quartal 2008. Schuld an dem R&#252;ckgang sind niedrigere
Roh&#246;l- und Erdgasrealisierungen, die die Ertr&#228;ge ca. 6,1 Milliarden USD fallen
lie&#223;en. 

Auf Basis von &#214;leinheiten fiel die Produktion um ca. 3 % gegen&#252;ber dem zweiten
Quartal 2008. Ohne die Auswirkungen von Anspruchsvolumen, OPEC-Raten und
Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen verringerte sich die Produktion um circa 2,5 %. 

Die Produktion von Fl&#252;ssigstoffen belief sich auf 2.347 kbd (Tausend Barrel pro
Tag) und fiel um 44 kbd gegen&#252;ber dem zweiten Quartal 2008. Ohne die
Auswirkungen von Anspruchsvolumen, OPEC-Raten und Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen war die
Produktion von Fl&#252;ssigstoffen gleichbleibend, da der R&#252;ckgang im Feldertrag
durch eine erh&#246;hte Produktion bei Projekten in den Vereinigten Staaten und
West-Afrika und weniger Wartungsarbeiten kompensiert wurde. 

Die Produktion von Erdgas im zweiten Quartal betrug 8.013 mcfd (Millionen
Kubikfu&#223; pro Tag) und fiel um 476 mcfd gegen&#252;ber 2008. Neue Produktionsvolumen
aus Projekten in Katar, den Vereinigten Staaten und der Nordsee wurden durch
R&#252;ckg&#228;nge im Feldertrag und eine niedrigere europ&#228;ische Nachfrage mehr als
ausgeglichen. 

Der Ertrag der amerikanischen Upstream-Betriebe betrug 813 Millionen USD, 1.221
Millionen USD niedriger als im zweiten Quartal 2008. Der nicht-amerikanische
Upstream-Gewinn betrug 2.999 Millionen USD, 4.979 Millionen USD niedriger als im
Vorjahr. 

Der Downstream-Gewinn von 512 Millionen USD fiel um 1.046 Millionen USD
gegen&#252;ber dem zweiten Quartal 2008. Niedrigere Gewinnspannen waren f&#252;r den
R&#252;ckgang verantwortlich und reduzierten den Ertrag um ca. 1,0 Milliarden USD, da
st&#228;rkere Marketingspannen durch schw&#228;chere Raffineriespannen mehr als
ausgeglichen wurden. Der Verkauf von Erd&#246;lerzeugnissen in H&#246;he von 6.487 kbd war
um 288 kbd niedriger als die Verk&#228;ufe im zweiten Quartal des Vorjahres und
spiegelte haupts&#228;chlich den Verkauf von Verm&#246;genswerten und die gesunkene
Nachfrage wider. 

Die amerikanischen Downstream-Betriebe verzeichneten einen Verlust von 15
Millionen USD, ein R&#252;ckgang von 308 Millionen USD gegen&#252;ber dem zweiten Quartal
2008. Der nicht-amerikanische Downstream-Gewinn von 527 Millionen USD war 738
Millionen USD niedriger als letztes Jahr. 

Der Ertrag in der Chemiesparte von 367 Millionen USD fiel 320 Millionen USD
niedriger aus als im zweiten Quartal 2008. Niedrigere Volumen reduzierten den
Ertrag um ca. 150 Millionen USD, w&#228;hrend schw&#228;chere Spannen den Ertrag nochmals
um ca. 100 Millionen USD fallen lie&#223;en. Reparaturkosten von Orkansch&#228;den und
ung&#252;nstige Umrechnungskurse reduzierten den Ertrag ebenfalls. Der Verkauf von
Premium-Produkten von 6.267 kt (Tausend metrische Tonnen) war 451 kt niedriger
als im Vorjahr, was vor allem auf die schw&#228;chere Nachfrage zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren ist. 

Die betrieblichen und finanziellen Ausgaben ohne Sonderposten betrugen 601
Millionen USD, eine Steigerung von 314 Millionen, die vor allem durch niedrigere
Zinseink&#252;nfte verursacht wurde. 

W&#228;hrend des zweiten Quartals 2009 kaufte die Exxon Mobil Corporation 75
Millionen Aktien ihrer Stammaktien f&#252;r die eigenen Aktien zu Bruttokosten in
H&#246;he von 5,2 Milliarden USD. Diese K&#228;ufe beinhalteten 5,0 Milliarden USD zur
Reduzierung der Anzahl der im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien. Die restlichen Aktien
wurden verwendet, um die in Verbindung mit den Leistungspl&#228;nen und -programmen
des Unternehmens ausgegebenen Aktien zu kompensieren. Die im Umlauf befindlichen
Aktien wurden von 4.880 Millionen am Ende des ersten Quartals auf 4.806
Millionen am Ende des zweiten Quartals reduziert. Gegenw&#228;rtig wird mit
Aktienr&#252;ckk&#228;ufen von 4,0 Milliarden USD im dritten Quartal 2009 gerechnet, um
die Anzahl der im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien zu verringern. Die K&#228;ufe k&#246;nnen auf
dem offenen Markt und durch ausgehandelte Transaktionen erfolgen und k&#246;nnen
jederzeit ohne vorherige Ank&#252;ndigung erh&#246;ht, verringert oder eingestellt werden.


Erste Jahresh&#228;lfte 2009 im Vergleich zur ersten Jahresh&#228;lfte 2008

Der Ertrag von 8.500 Millionen USD (1,73 USD pro Aktie) fiel um 14.070 Millionen
USD im Vergleich zu 2008. Der Ertrag f&#252;r 2009 enthielt spezielle Ausgaben in
H&#246;he von 140 Millionen USD f&#252;r Zinsen in Verbindung mit dem Valdez
Schadensersatz-Urteil. Die Ertr&#228;ge im Jahr 2008 enthielten Zahlungen in H&#246;he von
290 Millionen USD bez&#252;glich des Valdez Schadensersatz-Urteils. Ohne diese
Auswirkungen fielen die Ertr&#228;ge 2009 um 14.220 Millionen USD. 

DIE WICHTIGSTEN DATEN DER ERSTEN JAHRESH&#196;LFTE

* Die Ertr&#228;ge ohne Sonderposten beliefen sich auf 8.640 Millionen USD, 62 %
weniger. 
* Der Gewinn pro Aktie ohne Sonderposten fiel 59 % auf 1,76 USD und spiegelt den
gesunkenen Ertrag und die fortlaufende Reduzierung der Anzahl der sich im Umlauf
befindlichen Aktien wider. 
* Die Ertr&#228;ge fielen im Vergleich zu 2008 um 62 %. Die Ertr&#228;ge f&#252;r 2009
enthielten eine Sonderbelastung in H&#246;he von 140 Millionen USD f&#252;r Zinsen im
Zusammenhang mit dem Valdez Schadensersatz-Urteil. Der Ertrag f&#252;r 2008 enthielt
eine Zahlung in H&#246;he von 290 Millionen USD bez&#252;glich des Valdez
Schadensersatz-Urteils. 
* Die Produktion von &#214;leinheiten fiel um weniger als 2 % gegen&#252;ber 2008. Ohne
die Auswirkungen von Anspruchsvolumen, OPEC-Raten und Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen war die
Produktion ausgeglichen. 
* Der Cashflow aus betrieblichen T&#228;tigkeiten und der Ver&#228;u&#223;erung von
Verm&#246;genswerten betrug ca. 12,0 Milliarden USD, einschlie&#223;lich der Ver&#228;u&#223;erung
von Verm&#246;genswerten in H&#246;he von 0,9 Milliarden USD. 
* Das Unternehmen sch&#252;ttete in der ersten H&#228;lfte 2009 insgesamt 16,0 Milliarden
USD durch Dividenden und Aktienr&#252;ckk&#228;ufe an die Aktion&#228;re aus, um die im Umlauf
befindlichen Aktien zu vermindern. 
* Die Dividende von 0,82 USD pro Aktie stieg um 9 %. 
* Der Kapital- und Explorationsaufwand belief sich auf 12,3 Milliarden USD, ein
R&#252;ckgang von 1 % gegen&#252;ber 2008 durch den starken US-Dollar.

Der Upstream-Gewinn betrug 7.315 Millionen USD, ein R&#252;ckgang von 11.482
Millionen USD im Vergleich zu 2008. Niedrigere Realisierungen von Roh&#246;l und
Erdgas dr&#252;ckten den Gewinn um ca. 11,0 Milliarden USD, w&#228;hrend h&#246;here
Betriebskosten den Gewinn nochmals um 600 Millionen USD reduzierten. 

Auf Basis von &#214;leinheiten fiel die Produktion um weniger als 2 % im Vergleich
zum Vorjahr. Ohne die Auswirkungen von Anspruchsvolumen, OPEC-Raten und
Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen war die Produktion ausgeglichen. 

Die Produktion von Fl&#252;ssigstoffen belief sich auf 2.411 kbd und fiel um 19 kbd
im Vergleich zu 2008. Ohne die Auswirkungen von Anspruchsvolumen, OPEC-Raten und
Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen stieg die Produktion mehr als 1 %, da neue Kapazit&#228;ten bei
Projekten in den Vereinigten Staaten und West-Afrika sowie weniger
Wartungsarbeiten teilweise durch einen R&#252;ckgang im Feldertrag wettgemacht
wurden. 

Die Produktion von Erdgas von 9.094 mcfd (Millionen Kubikfu&#223; pro Tag) fiel um
265 mcfd gegen&#252;ber 2008. H&#246;here Produktionsvolumen aus Projekten in Katar und
der Nordsee wurden durch R&#252;ckg&#228;nge im Feldertrag und eine niedrigere europ&#228;ische
Nachfrage mehr als wettgemacht. 

Der Ertrag der amerikanischen Upstream-Betriebe betrug 2009 1.173 Millionen USD,
ein R&#252;ckgang von 2.492 Millionen USD. Der nicht-amerikanische Gewinn betrug
6.142 Millionen USD, 8.990 Millionen USD niedriger als letztes Jahr. 

Der Downstream-Gewinn von 1.645 Millionen USD fiel 1.079 Millionen USD niedriger
aus als 2008. Niedrigere Gewinnspannen reduzierten den Ertrag um ca. 300
Millionen USD. Niedrigere Volumen und Raffinerieoptimierung im Zusammenhang mit
einer schw&#228;cheren Nachfrage reduzierten den Gewinn um ca. 500 Millionen USD.
Auch h&#246;here Betriebskosten f&#252;r geplante Arbeiten sorgten f&#252;r einen R&#252;ckgang des
Gewinns. Der Verkauf von Erd&#246;lerzeugnissen in H&#246;he von 6.461 kbd fiel von 6.798
kbd im Jahr 2008 und spiegelte haupts&#228;chlich den Verkauf von Verm&#246;genswerten und
die gesunkene Nachfrage wider. 

Die amerikanischen Downstream-Gewinne betrugen 337 Millionen USD, ein R&#252;ckgang
von 354 Millionen USD. Der nicht-amerikanische Downstream-Gewinn belief sich auf
1.308 Millionen USD, 725 Millionen USD niedriger als letztes Jahr. 

Der Ertrag in der Chemiesparte von 717 Millionen USD fiel um 998 Millionen USD
im Vergleich zu 2008. Niedrigere Mengen reduzierten den Ertrag um ca. 450
Millionen USD, w&#228;hrend schw&#228;chere Spannen den Ertrag nochmals um ca. 350
Millionen USD fallen lie&#223;en. Ung&#252;nstige Umrechnungskurse und Kosten aus
Orkansch&#228;den reduzierten den Ertrag ebenfalls. Der Verkauf von Premium-Produkten
von 11.794 kt war 1.502 kt niedriger als 2008. 

Die betrieblichen und finanziellen Ausgaben ohne Sonderposten betrugen 1.037
Millionen USD, eine Steigerung von 661 Millionen, die vor allem durch niedrigere
Zinseink&#252;nfte verursacht wurde. 

Der Brutto-R&#252;ckkauf von Aktien belief sich im ersten Halbjahr 2009 auf 13,1
Milliarden USD und verringerte die im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien um 3,4 %. 

Sch&#228;tzungen der wichtigsten Finanz- und Betriebsdaten folgen.

in einem Webcast am 30. Juli 2009 um 10.00 Uhr Central Time diskutieren. Auf

&lt;p&gt;In the latest shot fired in Google Inc.'s ongoing battle with Microsoft Corp., Google announced today that it's taking this fight to the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is kicking off a month-long ad campaign for its online suite of enterprise office applications. The campaign will have the search giant leasing billboard space in four major U.S. cities -- New York, San Francisco, Chicago and Boston. Each work day will have a different message for commuters to take in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes less than a week after Microsoft announced it is partnering with Yahoo on a search and online ad deal. The two companies announced that they had finalized negotiations on a long-anticipated deal that will have Microsoft's Bing search engine powering Yahoo's sites, while Yahoo sells premium search advertising services for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is geared to hit Google with a united force much greater than either Microsoft or Yahoo could muster alone. Individually, neither company has much of an affect on Google and its overwhelming search market share. Together, though, they hope to at least make a dent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezra Gottheil, an analyst at Technology Business Research Inc., noted that while Microsoft is busy going after Google's search market, Google is using the billboard campaign it go after Microsoft's bread-and-butter Office suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each company is targeting the other right now," said Gottheil. "They're laying the groundwork for what they both see as an inevitable collision in the future. Right now, neither company is deriving much revenue from its presence in the other's space... Microsoft is more vulnerable because they must cannibalize some of their current application revenue to expand their application market, where Google only has to maintain a rough technical equivalence with Microsoft to maintain its search franchise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's ad campaign and Microsoft's deal with Yahoo are just the latest moves in this ongoing fight between industry giants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Microsoft unveiled its new search engine, Bing, an update to its far-from-beloved Microsoft Live Search. And with Microsoft's advertising power and a lot of media attention behind it, Bing has shown strong numbers just out of the gate. But with only 8.23% of the market, Bing has done little more than nibble away at Google share, which is just over more than 78% of the search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;StatCounter CEO Aodhan Cullen described Bing's progress in the market as "steady, if not spectacular."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Yahoo two weeks ago unveiled a beta of its newly overhauled homepage, whose promised features include the ability to integrate with social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and Myspace. The changes are an apparent attempt to recapture some of the hip cachet the site had during its heyday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem for Microsoft and Yahoo is that despite their efforts, Google still looms far ahead of both. And Google is aiming its sights on the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Google took the training wheels off several key hosted Google Apps offerings that have spent years in beta-test mode. The beta label came off some main Google Apps services, including Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Talk and Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts were quick to note that it's a move geared to making Google Apps more appealing to enterprise users. With similar intent, Google this year also has come out with offline access and support for BlackBerry and Outlook users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) plans to double the size of its new consulting team in China to help a growing number of firms that want to emerge from the global economic crisis stronger and more international.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Kern, president of Global Business Services (GBS), IBM's consulting arm, told Reuters in an interview on Monday that the new China Analytics Solution Center would help Chinese businesses that are interested in making acquisitions at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center will initially will be staffed with 300 consultants, software specialists and mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company plans to increase the staff to 600 as demand grows, Kerns said at the opening ceremony for the center. He did not give a specific target date, but said the expansion would occur within a "reasonable timeframe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As companies look to get more productive, to compete globally, to be world-class, we do see more and more opportunities for the consulting business," said Kern, who oversaw IBM's business in Asia Pacific region between 2003 and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has been working with some Chinese clients, such as COSCO Logistics, to help them transform their business, Kern said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOCUS SHIFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, which last month announced a $1.2 billion plan to buy business analytics firm SPSS Inc SPSS.O, has shifted its focus from hardware to software and services over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It posted an 11 percent rise in second-quarter net profit and sharply raised its full-year earnings forecast thanks to its higher-margin businesses in software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are similar centers in Berlin and Tokyo, and another three analytics centers are set to open soon -- in London, New York and Washington -- and IBM plans to hire a total of 4,000 consultants for these offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from GBS accounts for roughly 20 percent of the Armonk, New York-based firm's total earnings last year, GBS chief Kern said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GBS and IBM's software unit together form its analytics business, which is expected to see double-digit growth despite the weak economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is also benefiting from a more general increase in demand for consulting services as companies that have weathered the recession begin to think about how to position themselves for the recovery, Kern said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing now a lot of clients asking for advice and work on business models, on transformations, on how to create a new model for the future," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the world improves, it's going to be a different world, it's going to be more competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Karen Foster)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * GBS chief says to double China consulting staff to 600 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Says staff increase to be done in "reasonable timeframe" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Sees more firms asking advice on going global &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Michael Wei and Simon Rabinovitch &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    BEIJING, Aug 3 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) plans to double the size of its new consulting team in China to help a growing number of firms that want to emerge from the global economic crisis stronger and more international. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Frank Kern, president of Global Business Services (GBS), IBM's consulting arm, told Reuters in an interview on Monday that the new China Analytics Solution Centre would help Chinese businesses that are interested in making acquisitions at home and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The centre will initially will be staffed with 300 consultants, software specialists and mathematicians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company plans to increase the staff to 600 as demand grows, Kerns said at the opening ceremony for the centre. He did not give a specific target date, but said the expansion would occur within a "reasonable timeframe". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "As companies look to get more productive, to compete globally, to be world-class, we do see more and more opportunities for the consulting business," said Kern, who oversaw IBM's business in Asia Pacific region between 2003 and 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM has been working with some Chinese clients, such as COSCO Logistics, to help them transform their business, Kern said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    FOCUS SHIFT &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM, which last month announced a $1.2 billion plan to buy business analytics firm SPSS Inc SPSS.O, has shifted its focus from hardware to software and services over the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It posted an 11 percent rise in second-quarter net profit and sharply raised its full-year earnings forecast thanks to its higher-margin businesses in software and services. [nN16369660] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    There are similar centres in Berlin and Tokyo, and another three analytics centres are set to open soon -- in London, New York and Washington -- and IBM plans to hire a total of 4,000 consultants for these offices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Revenue from GBS accounts for roughly 20 percent of the Armonk, New York-based firm's total earnings last year, GBS chief Kern said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    GBS and IBM's software unit together form its analytics business, which is expected to see double-digit growth despite the weak economy. [nN28170828] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM is also benefitting from a more general increase in demand for consulting services as companies that have weathered the recession begin to think about how to position themselves for the recovery, Kern said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are seeing now a lot of clients asking for advice and work on business models, on transformations, on how to create a new model for the future," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "As the world improves, it's going to be a different world, it's going to be more competitive." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Karen Foster) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((michael.wei@thomsonreuters.com; +86 138 1177 7665; Reuters Messaging: michael.wei.reuters.com@reuters.net)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((If you have a query or comment on this story, send an email to news.feedback.asia@thomsonreuters.com))   Keywords: IBM/CHINA  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Google will use billboard advertising to promote Google Apps, the company's enterprise productivity suite. Google will use giant billboards in four U.S. cities to encourage business users to consider using the Google Apps package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Monday, commuters in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and Boston will see a different message promoting Google Apps each weekday throughout August. Called "Going Google", the campaign targets IT managers stuck in traffic and informs on the benefits of switching to Google Apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google introduced the Apps enterprise suite in 2007 and the company says over 1.75 million customers are now using it. But the undisputed king of online advertising is now turning a leaf from the more traditional marketing books with billboard advertising. Google said it doesn't plan to advertise in other print or broadcast media for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In aid of the campaign, the company also launched a Google Apps "Spread the Word" site, which offers promotional materials for enthusiasts such as posters, fact sheets and weekly giveaways. Next to that, a Twitter account has been created for the campaign (@GoogleAtWork) and a matching hashtag (#gonegoogle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Google used sparingly traditional ads, a more recent example being the Google Chrome TV spots. But the new campaign for Google Apps can be widely seen as a direct stab at Microsoft's productivity and email offerings, explaining the benefits of using cloud-computing solutions. Microsoft is also planning to launch Office Web Applications, free of charge, together with the 2010 of its desktop productivity suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a video preview from Google, showing how the billboard ads will look like throughout the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/169475&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY &amp; DENVER--(Business Wire)--
U.S. Bank is the first card issuer in the United States to add Visa&#174; payWave&#174;
technology to an unembossed debit card that is issued instantly to an account
holder upon opening an account. The instant-issue Visa payWave pilot is being
tested at select U.S. Bank branches in Denver and Salt Lake City as part of U.S.
Bank`s on-going innovation in payments. 

"Exploring smart and convenient ways to streamline payments is one of our top
priorities," said Dominic Venturo, chief innovation officer at U.S. Bank Retail
Payment Solutions. "Our customers have demonstrated great interest in any
development that makes their lives easier, whether it`s by giving them a debit
card the minute they open their account, or speeding up their time in a check
out line. Our goal is to continue to innovate and provide them with proven
payment tools now and in years to come." 

The pilot allows U.S. Bank and its customers to explore the benefits of
combining three new technologies into one card - instant issuance, unembossed
personalization and contactless payment. The instant issue debit card provides
many benefits to the customer because the permanent debit card can be issued in
the branch at the time the customer opens a checking account, rather than that
same customer getting an initial temporary card, then waiting for the permanent
one to arrive days later in the mail. Unembossed personalization provides
greater security and customer satisfaction and Visa payWave allows the customer
to pay for purchases by simply waving the card in front of a reader instead of
swiping it, speeding up the payment process. 

U.S. Bank chose the metropolitan areas of Denver and Salt Lake City for its
strong U.S. Bank presence in both cities and because customers there are
familiar with contactless payment. Many merchants currently offer Visa payWave
readers as a payment option. 

Visa provides the Visa payWave feature in this program, while Dynamic Card
Solutions (www.instantissuance.com) is providing the software and hardware
necessary to personalize and issue the debit cards instantly at the branches. 

The U.S. Bank branches participating in the pilot in Utah are located at 4135
South Redwood Road, 170 South Main Street and 888 East 4500 South in Salt Lake
City, as well as 1884 North University Parkway in Provo and 7080 South Redwood
Road in West Jordan. In Colorado, U.S. Bank branches at 950 17th Street in
Denver and 8441 West Bowels Avenue in Littleton are participating. 

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), with $266 billion in assets, is the parent company of
U.S. Bank, the 6th largest commercial bank in the United States. The company
operates 2,850 banking offices and 5,173 ATMs in 24 states, and provides a
comprehensive line of banking, brokerage, insurance, investment, mortgage, trust
and payment services products to consumers, businesses and institutions. Visit

&lt;p&gt;Facing Adverse Ruling, Company Chooses to Avoid Litigation over Controversial
Legal Release
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chevron has quietly withdrawn a key legal claim in U.S. federal court against
Ecuador`s government over a $27.3 billion environmental liability in the Amazon,
casting doubt about the company`s public statements that it will not pay for a
clean-up and raising questions about the effectiveness of its legal strategy,
according to court records and lawyers representing indigenous communities in
Ecuador. 

Chevron`s withdrawal of the claim, which resulted in a dismissal of the case
recently by a U.S. federal judge in Manhattan, was the fifth consecutive time
since 2007 that U.S. federal courts have failed to accept the company`s
arguments that Ecuador`s government is responsible for the clean-up in Ecuador`s
Amazon rainforest. Experts consider the damage caused by Texaco (now Chevron),
which operated a large oil concession in Ecuador from 1964 to 1990, to be the
world`s largest oil-related remediation project. 

Chevron withdrew the claim before Judge Sand because it feared a decision would
interfere with its political campaign in the U.S. to discredit Ecuador`s courts,
said Steven Donziger, an American who advises the plaintiffs in a separate civil
lawsuit filed against Chevron in Ecuador by an estimated 30,000 rainforest
residents. The Ecuador civil lawsuit is where the oil giant faces the $27.3
billion damages claim. 

"A negative decision by a U.S. court was too great a risk for Chevron`s public
relations and lobbying campaign, which is based on the illusion that the company
does not have to pay damages in Ecuador because of an earlier clean-up when in
fact such a clean-up has been proven to be a sham," Donziger said. 

"Chevron now has lost every important legal decision in the U.S. and Ecuador for
the last three years over environmental damage in Ecuador," added Donziger. "The
company`s latest decision to bail out of a U.S. court is a telling indication of
how Chevron`s lawyers actually feel about the merits of their own case." 

With no public announcement or filing with securities regulators, Chevron in
late July notified U.S. federal judge Leonard B. Sand that it was withdrawing
its claim against Ecuador`s government that a release received in 1995 immunized
it from liability. The claim asserted that a limited environmental remediation
by Texaco in the 1990s, which the plaintiffs have claimed was fraudulent,
shifted responsibility for any further clean-up to Ecuador`s government. 

In effect, Chevron is giving up on its strategy to use a U.S. federal court to
try to trump an expected adverse decision in the civil case in Ecuador, said
Donziger. If Chevron had won before Judge Sand, it could have used the U.S.
court decision as a defense to any enforcement action in the U.S. of an expected
multi-billion dollar Ecuador judgment. Chevron has announced it will not pay any
judgment in Ecuador, even though the company agreed to jurisdiction in the
country as a condition of getting the case transferred there from U.S. federal
court in 2002. 

In the civil lawsuit in Ecuador, which has been ongoing since 2003 and is
expected to end later this year, Chevron`s primary defense also is that Texaco`s
purported remediation and release immunizes it from liability. The plaintiffs
also assert the release does not apply to their claims, as they never signed off
on it. 

Chevron`s withdrawal of the legal claim over the release from the U.S. court
means that Ecuador`s courts alone will determine the issue. To this point, no
court in either the U.S. or Ecuador has accepted Chevron`s interpretation of the
release, despite multiple rulings dating to 1995. 

Donziger characterized Chevron`s withdrawal of the legal claim as a "major
setback" for the company`s prospects. 

"Chevron`s voluntarily withdrawal of its main claim suggests company lawyers
recognize privately that their case has serious deficiencies, despite public
statements to the contrary," said Donziger. "If Chevron`s defense over the
release had merit, Chevron`s lawyers would be thrilled for a U.S. court to hear
the claim. 

"What is increasingly risky for Chevron is that respected U.S. federal courts
are starting to agree with the very Ecuador trial courts that Chevron is trying
to discredit," said Pablo Fajardo, the lead Ecuadorian lawyer for the
plaintiffs. "This suggests that Chevron`s claims about bias in Ecuador`s courts
are being contrived in anticipation of an adverse decision." 

The five instances that Chevron`s claims have failed before U.S. federal courts
include two instances before a U.S. federal judge, two instances before a
federal court of appeals, and one instance when the U.S. Supreme Court denied
Chevron`s petition for review. In each instance, Chevron had presented arguments
designed to make Ecuador`s government the responsible party. 

Chevron claims that between 1995 and 1998 Texaco remediated a small portion of
the 916 waste pits it built in Ecuador. Yet scientific evidence in the Ecuador
trial demonstrates that the so-called remediated sites are extensively
contaminated, with several containing cancer-causing toxins at levels hundreds
of times higher than U.S. and Ecuadorian laws allow, according to a Special
Master report on liability and damages.

LE PR&#201;SIDENT DU CONSEIL D`ADMINISTRATION d`EXXONMOBIL REX W. TILLERSON A FAIT LE
COMMENTAIRE SUIVANT: 

&#171; Les conditions &#233;conomiques mondiales continuent &#224; avoir un impact sur le
secteur &#233;nerg&#233;tique en termes de volatilit&#233; des prix des mati&#232;res premi&#232;res et
de demande r&#233;duite pour les produits finis. Malgr&#233; ces d&#233;fis, ExxonMobil a
obtenu des r&#233;sultats solides. Nous avons poursuivi notre programme de
capital-investissement &#224; des niveaux proches du record tout en redistribuant
plus de 16 milliards de dollars &#224; nos actionnaires durant le premier semestre de
l`ann&#233;e.

Le b&#233;n&#233;fice d`ExxonMobil pour le second trimestre hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels a
atteint 4,1 milliards de dollars, soit une baisse de 66 % par rapport au second
trimestre 2008. Le b&#233;n&#233;fice par action hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels a baiss&#233; de
63 %, refl&#233;tant la r&#233;duction des revenus et l`apport imputable au programme de
rachat des actions. Le r&#233;sultat net pour le second trimestre 2009 s`est &#233;lev&#233; &#224;
4,0 milliards de dollars, soit une baisse de 66 % par rapport &#224; l`exercice
pr&#233;c&#233;dent. Ce r&#233;sultat a compris une charge sp&#233;ciale de 140 millions de dollars,
refl&#233;tant les int&#233;r&#234;ts li&#233;s aux dommages punitifs du proc&#232;s Valdez. Le r&#233;sultat
du second trimestre 2008 a compris une charge de 290 millions de dollars,
refl&#233;tant les dommages punitifs du proc&#232;s Valdez.

Le r&#233;sultat net du premier semestre hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels a baiss&#233; de 62 %
par rapport au premier semestre 2008, refl&#233;tant des r&#233;alisations moindres de
p&#233;trole brut et de gaz naturel. Le r&#233;sultat net du premier semestre 2009 a
&#233;galement baiss&#233; de 62 % par rapport &#224; 2008.

ExxonMobil a poursuivi son solide programme de capital-investissement. Pour le
premier semestre de 2009, les d&#233;penses d`investissement et d`exploration se sont
&#233;lev&#233;es &#224; 12,3 milliards de dollars, dans la ligne de notre plan &#224; plus long
terme.

Au cours du second trimestre, la compagnie a distribu&#233; un total de 7,0 milliards
de dollars &#224; ses actionnaires sous forme de dividendes et d`achats d`actions
pour r&#233;duire le nombre des actions en circulation &#187;.

FAITS MARQUANTS DU SECOND TRIMESTRE

* Les b&#233;n&#233;fices hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels ont atteint 4 090 millions de
dollars, un recul de 66 % ou 7 880 millions de dollars par rapport au second
trimestre 2008. 
* Le b&#233;n&#233;fice par action hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels a atteint 0,84 dollar, un
recul de 63 %. 
* Les b&#233;n&#233;fices ont baiss&#233; de 66 % par rapport au second trimestre 2008. Les
b&#233;n&#233;fices du second trimestre 2009 incluaient une charge sp&#233;ciale de 140
millions de dollars refl&#233;tant les int&#233;r&#234;ts li&#233;s aux dommages punitifs du proc&#232;s
Valdez. Le r&#233;sultat du second trimestre 2008 a compris une charge de 290
millions de dollars, refl&#233;tant les dommages punitifs du proc&#232;s Valdez. 
* Les d&#233;penses d`investissement et d`exploration se sont &#233;lev&#233;es &#224; 6,6 milliards
de dollars, soit une baisse de 6 % par rapport au second trimestre de 2008 en
raison principalement du renforcement du dollar am&#233;ricain. 
* Le taux d`imposition effectif a augment&#233; de 49 &#224; 50 %. 
* La production sur une base d`&#233;quivalent-p&#233;trole a baiss&#233; d`environ 3 % par
rapport au second trimestre 2008. Hors l`impact des volumes admissibles, des
effets des quotas de l`OPEP et des d&#233;sinvestissements, la production a baiss&#233;
d`environ 2,5 %. 
* Le flux de tr&#233;sorerie issu de l`exploitation et des cessions d`actifs a &#233;t&#233;
d`environ 3,0 milliards de dollars, dont 0,8 milliard de dollars en cessions
d`actifs. 
* Les achats d`action de 5,0 milliards de dollars ont r&#233;duit le nombre d`actions
en circulation de 1,5 %. 
* Le train 4 de Qatargas 2, le premier des deux trains de liqu&#233;faction associ&#233;s
&#224; ce projet a entam&#233; sa phase de production &#224; plein r&#233;gime. Avec une production
annuelle de 7,8 millions de tonnes, c`est le train de liqu&#233;faction de GNL le
plus important en service dans le monde. 
* Dans l`ouest du Colorado, la phase 1 du projet Piceance a &#233;t&#233; lanc&#233;e avec
succ&#232;s. Les nouvelles installations ont la capacit&#233; de traiter jusqu`&#224; 5,66
millions de m3 (200 millions de pieds cubiques) de gaz naturel par jour. La
production qui traite actuellement plus de 2,25 millions de m3 (80 millions de
pieds cubiques) par jour devrait continuer &#224; augmenter durant le second semestre
de l`ann&#233;e. 
* Dans le nouveau complexe p&#233;trochimique de raffinage int&#233;gr&#233; situ&#233; dans la
province chinoise de Fujian, la coentreprise &#224; laquelle participe ExxonMobil a
annonc&#233; la mise en service des unit&#233;s de distillation sous vide pouvant traiter
jusqu`&#224; 160 mille barils de p&#233;trole brut par jour.

Second trimestre 2009 par rapport au second trimestre 2008

Le b&#233;n&#233;fice en amont s`est &#233;lev&#233; &#224; 3 812 millions de dollars, soit une baisse de
6 200 millions de dollars par rapport au second trimestre de 2008. Des
r&#233;alisations moindres de p&#233;trole brut et de gaz naturel ont fait baisser le
b&#233;n&#233;fice d`environ 6,1 milliards de dollars. 

Sur une base d`&#233;quivalent-p&#233;trole, la production a baiss&#233; d`environ 3 % par
rapport au second trimestre de 2008. Hors l`impact des volumes admissibles, des
effets des quotas de l`OPEP et des d&#233;sinvestissements, la production a baiss&#233;
d`environ 2,5 %. 

La production de liquides a atteint au total 2 347 kbj (milliers de barils par
jour), soit une baisse de 44 kbj par rapport au second trimestre de 2008. Hors
l`impact des volumes admissibles, des effets des quotas de l`OPEP et des
d&#233;sinvestissements, la production de liquides est rest&#233;e inchang&#233;e, le d&#233;clin
des champs ayant &#233;t&#233; compens&#233; par la production plus &#233;lev&#233;e des projets aux
&#201;tats-Unis et en Afrique occidentale ainsi que par une activit&#233; de maintenance
r&#233;duite. 

La production de gaz naturel au second trimestre s`est &#233;lev&#233;e &#224; 8 013 mpcj
(millions de pieds cubiques par jour), soit une diminution de 476 mpcj par
rapport &#224; 2008. De nouveaux volumes de production dus &#224; l`ajout de projets au
Qatar, aux &#201;tats-Unis et en mer du Nord ont &#233;t&#233; largement contrebalanc&#233;s par le
d&#233;clin des champs et une demande europ&#233;enne moins importante. 

Le b&#233;n&#233;fice des op&#233;rations en amont aux &#201;tats-Unis a atteint 813 millions de
dollars, 1 221 millions de dollars de moins qu`au second trimestre de 2008. Le
b&#233;n&#233;fice en amont en dehors des &#201;tats-Unis a atteint 2 999 millions de dollars,
soit une diminution de 4 979 millions de dollars par rapport &#224; l`ann&#233;e derni&#232;re.


Le b&#233;n&#233;fice en aval de 512 millions de dollars a diminu&#233; de 1 046 millions de
dollars par rapport au second trimestre de 2008. Les marges plus faibles ont
fait baisser le b&#233;n&#233;fice d`environ 1,0 milliard de dollars, les marges de
raffinage plus faibles prenant nettement l`avantage sur les marges plus &#233;lev&#233;es
de marketing. Les ventes de produits p&#233;troliers de 6 487 kbj ont diminu&#233; de 288
kbj par rapport au second trimestre de l`ann&#233;e pr&#233;c&#233;dente, refl&#233;tant
essentiellement des cessions d`actifs et une demande moins importante. 

Le b&#233;n&#233;fice en aval aux &#201;tats-Unis a atteint 15 millions de dollars, soit une
baisse de 308 millions de dollars par rapport au second trimestre de 2008. Le
b&#233;n&#233;fice en aval en dehors des &#201;tats-Unis a atteint 527 millions de dollars,
soit un recul de 738 millions de dollars par rapport &#224; l`ann&#233;e pr&#233;c&#233;dente. 

Le b&#233;n&#233;fice des produits chimiques de 367 millions de dollars a diminu&#233; de 320
millions de dollars par rapport au second trimestre de 2008. Des volumes plus
bas ont r&#233;duit le b&#233;n&#233;fice d`environ 150 millions de dollars tandis que des
marges moins &#233;lev&#233;es l`ont r&#233;duit d`environ 100 millions de dollars. Les co&#251;ts
des r&#233;parations suite &#224; l`ouragan et les effets d`un taux de change d&#233;favorable
ont &#233;galement fait baisser le b&#233;n&#233;fice. Les ventes de produits de base de 6 267
kt (milliers de tonnes m&#233;triques) au second trimestre ont diminu&#233; de 451 kt par
rapport &#224; l`ann&#233;e pr&#233;c&#233;dente du fait d`une demande moins importante. 

Hors &#233;l&#233;ments exceptionnels, les charges d`entreprise et les charges de
financement ont atteint 601 millions de dollars, soit une hausse de 314 millions
de dollars en raison principalement de produits d`int&#233;r&#234;ts plus bas. 

Au cours du second trimestre de 2009, Exxon Mobil Corporation a achet&#233; 75
millions d`actions ordinaires pour sa tr&#233;sorerie au co&#251;t brut de 5,2 milliards
de dollars. Ces achats incluent les 5,0 milliards de dollars qui ont permis de
r&#233;duire le nombre d`actions en circulation, le solde ayant servi &#224; compenser les
actions &#233;mises dans le contexte des plans et programmes de r&#233;mun&#233;ration de la
soci&#233;t&#233;. Le nombre d`actions en circulation qui &#233;tait de 4 880 millions &#224; la fin
du premier trimestre a &#233;t&#233; r&#233;duit &#224; 4 806 millions &#224; la fin du second trimestre.
On estime &#224; pr&#233;sent que les achats d`actions en vue de r&#233;duire les actions en
circulation &#233;quivaudront &#224; 4,0 milliards pendant le troisi&#232;me trimestre 2009.
Les achats peuvent &#234;tre r&#233;alis&#233;s &#224; la fois sur le march&#233; ouvert et par le biais
de transactions n&#233;goci&#233;es et peuvent augmenter, diminuer ou cesser &#224; tout
moment, sans pr&#233;avis. 

Premier semestre 2009 par rapport au premier semestre 2008

Le b&#233;n&#233;fice de 8 500 millions de dollars (1,73 dollar par action) a diminu&#233; de
14 070 millions de dollars par rapport &#224; 2008. Les b&#233;n&#233;fices de 2009 incluaient
une charge sp&#233;ciale de 140 millions de dollars refl&#233;tant les int&#233;r&#234;ts li&#233;s aux
dommages punitifs du proc&#232;s Valdez. Les b&#233;n&#233;fices de 2008 incluaient une charge
de 290 millions de dollars refl&#233;tant les dommages punitifs du proc&#232;s Valdez.
Hors ces d&#233;penses, le b&#233;n&#233;fice de 2009 a baiss&#233; de 14 220 millions de dollars.

d`entretien moins importantes &#233;tant partiellement compens&#233;e par le d&#233;clin des
champs. 

La production de gaz naturel de 9 094 mpcj a diminu&#233; de 265 mpcj par rapport &#224;
2008. De nouveaux volumes fournis par les projets du Qatar et de la mer du Nord
ont &#233;t&#233; plus que contrebalanc&#233;s par le d&#233;clin des champs et une demande
europ&#233;enne moins importante.

raffinage associ&#233;s &#224; une demande moins forte ont r&#233;duit le b&#233;n&#233;fice d`environ
500 millions de dollars. Les co&#251;ts d`exploitation plus &#233;lev&#233;s associ&#233;s
principalement aux activit&#233;s planifi&#233;es ont &#233;galement r&#233;duit le b&#233;n&#233;fice. Les
ventes de produits p&#233;troliers de 6 461 kbj ont diminu&#233; par rapport aux 6 798 kbj

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft's offer to settle a decade-long battle with EU antitrust regulators cements the European Commission's reputation as one of the world's toughest watchdogs and could force other firms to follow its example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. software giant (MSFT.O) last month yielded to the Commission's demand to let users choose their own browser and to provide more information that would let third parties design programs compatible with its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said that the case underlined the difference in approach of regulators in Europe and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the last 10 years compared with the United States, Europe has been effectively prosecuting antitrust cases. The U.S. has been taking a cautious approach," said competition expert Robert Stillman at consultancy CRA International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Microsoft interoperability case is an example where the Commission got it right. In the United States, there is no interest in that case," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU executive has slapped fines totaling 1.68 billion euros ($2.37 billion) on Microsoft over the years for infringing EU antitrust rules, may levy another hefty penalty if it were to rule against the company in the current case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators have generally taken a slightly softer line than their European counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly appointed head of the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust department, Christine Varney, said in May the unit had "not been as active as it could have been" under former President George W. Bush and vowed tougher enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the European Commission's firm stance has to do with its sweeping mandate, said antitrust lawyer Jonas Koponen at law firm Linklaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission is tough in different fields, in state aid, cartels, antitrust. Not many regulators have that broad a regulation portfolio," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLEAR SIGNAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Commission having shown its willingness to dig in for a long battle, companies on the regulator's radar screen should take heed of Microsoft's decision to settle, said antitrust lawyer Stephen Kinsella at Sidley Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it is possible to resolve a case with both parties agreeing ... and then give some forward-looking commitments designed to resolve problems for the future as well, that has to be the way to try to deal with issues in this area," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Microsoft can settle with the Commission, presumably others can," Kinsella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. wireless chip and technology company Qualcomm (QCOM.O), under scrutiny in Brussels for anti-competitive behavior, is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If people look at the willingness of the Commission to close cases through commitments, that certainly remains am option for Qualcomm if it feels it is likely to end up with a decision against it," Adam Collinson at law firm Eversheds said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Certainly in terms of the time and cost of pursuing these investigations, if there isn't a huge commercial impact to offering these commitments, then that may be a very sensible thing to do," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies with interoperability issues and facing regulatory scrutiny would likely look at Microsoft's concessions to get an idea of the Commission's concerns, said Linklaters' Koponen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are issues in there that could be relevant for other cases, for example Oracle ORCL.O and Sun Microsystems JAVA.O. IBM could be an issue," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World No. 3 software maker Oracle sought Brussels' approval on Monday on its plan to buy computer maker Sun, the world's fourth-largest maker of server computers and also the developer of Java and Solaris software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. computer firm T3 Technologies filed a complaint with the Commission in January, accusing IBM (IBM.N) of abusing its power in the mainframe computer industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits to companies looking to settle are significant. Not only do they escape fines from the Commission but the possibility of court actions by competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But companies could face an uphill battle if the Commission wants to set a precedent in complex and groundbreaking cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sometimes, they really want a decision, even a judgment, because they want to establish a principle without a doubt," said Kinsella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAKING ON BANKS, GOVERNMENTS, CARTELS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since her appointment in 2004, Neelie Kroes, Europe's competition czar, has taken on political leaders looking to prop up their countries' ailing car industries and banks as well as conglomerates seeking to block rivals or run cartels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from weakening regulatory oversight as some expected, the credit crisis and economic downturn have boosted antitrust authorities' resolve to uphold the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Competition authorities both in Europe and the United Kingdom have maintained a pretty hard face even in the difficult economic and financial climate," said Eversheds' Collinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They do not want companies to be able to use the economic and financial crisis as an excuse to engage in anti-competitive practices which in the long term will be damaging to the economy and to consumers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by David Brunnstrom and Sitaraman Shankar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeowners Can Save Thousands, Shorten Their Mortgage by a Number of Months
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chase, one of the nation`s leading consumer banks, today announced 1% Mortgage
Cash Back, an innovative new benefit from Chase Exclusives, the program that
rewards checking account customers for using the bank`s other products and
services. 

Each year, the 1% Mortgage Cash Back allows enrolled Chase Exclusives customers
to earn 1% of their scheduled monthly principal and interest mortgage payment.
They must simply 1) get a Chase mortgage to buy or refinance their home and 2)
have their monthly mortgage payment automatically deducted from their Chase
checking account. 

"Today, consumers want to get more from their money and our innovative 1%
Mortgage Cash Back program does just that. It is a great example of how Chase
Exclusives rewards you for having both a Chase checking account and a Chase
mortgage," said David Lowman, Chief Executive Officer of Chase Home Lending "We
talked to many customers and prospects, and they really liked the idea of having
their bank help them pay down their mortgage. They also liked the option of
getting the reward in cash." 

Chase will pay customers 1% of their total scheduled monthly principal and
interest payment on each annual anniversary of the loan`s origination as long as
payments are made automatically and in full from their Chase checking account.
Customers can apply that annual payment directly to their mortgage principal or
receive a cash deposit in their checking account. The program can save customers
thousands of dollars over the life of their loan. 

The 1% Mortgage Cash Back allows a homeowner with a 30-year, fixed-rate $210,000
mortgage at 6 percent to save almost $12,000 and pay off their mortgage nine
months early. 

The 1% Mortgage Cash Back program is available as a Chase Exclusives offer to
checking account customers in most Chase bank branches and via phone at
1-888-789-1714. 

"Chase Exclusives make a Chase checking account a smart choice for consumers
because we provide special offers on mortgage, credit cards, savings accounts
and debit cards," said Michael Cleary, Chief Marketing Officer for Chase Retail
Banking. "These can be worth thousands of dollars to our customers as we say
thank you for their continued business and help them with their financial needs.


"The bottom line is that a Chase checking account saves customers money -- and
that's very important in times like these," he said. 

Chase Exclusives benefits also include:

* Richer rewards for a Chase Freedom credit card
* A free rewards program on a Chase debit card
* A discount up to 0.50 percent on the interest rate of an auto loan
* A discount up to 0.50 percent on the interest rate of a home equity loan
* Higher interest rates on certificates of deposits
* The waiver of an IRA annual fee
* Free review of an investment portfolio

About Chase:

Chase is the U.S. consumer and commercial banking brand of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.
(NYSE: JPM), which operates more than 5,100 branches and 14,000 ATMs nationally
under the Chase and WaMu brands. Chase has 151 million credit cards issued and
serves consumers and small businesses through bank branches, ATMs and mortgage

universities. It also serves 26,000 commercial banking clients, including
corporations, municipalities, financial institutions and not-for-profit
entities. More information about Chase is available at www.chase.com. 

About 1% Mortgage Cash Back:

When Chase researched its patent-pending 1% Mortgage Cash Back, consumers
preferred it 2 to 1 over a rate reduction or closing cost discount, and also
liked deciding how the reward would be paid. With the offer, customers must
decide at enrollment between the principal pay down option or the cash back
option. The 1 percent annual award is calculated based on the standard schedule
of principal and interest. If the customer makes extra principal payments in a
calendar year, those payments do not count towards the 1 percent award.
Customers must set up Automatic Mortgage Payments (ACH) at time of closing,
remain active in automatic payments and stay current on their loan payments.
Customers also must maintain an active Chase checking account. For more about

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, Aug 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Skytap, Inc., the leading provider of cloud-based IT labs, today
announced support for application compatibility testing on Windows 7,
Microsoft's highly anticipated follow up to Vista. Using Skytap,
customers can quickly and cost-effectively spin up a virtual sandbox in
the cloud to ensure applications run correctly on the new operating
system. For a limited time, Skytap is offering team access to Skytap's
Virtual Lab SaaS application, Windows 7 virtual machine templates and
1,000 hours of testing time for $250 per month.

    Skytap is the first cloud computing platform to offer support for Windows
7 which enables Microsoft partners and enterprise IT departments to
identify and eliminate potential software conflicts with Windows 7 before
releasing application upgrades. Using Skytap's cloud development and test
solution, customers can ensure compatibility of applications across
multiple versions of Windows. Skytap provides a fast and affordable way
to test new and existing applications on Windows 7 before broad rollout
this fall.

    "Testing and development is one of the biggest use cases for the cloud,"
said William Fellows, Principal Analyst at 451 Group. "Support for this
extremely popular new operating system will be critical for any
cloud-based testing lab and Skytap is well-positioned to handle this
demand from the Microsoft community."

    Compatibility testing is often a headache for development and testing
organizations because they don't have the spare hardware or testing cycles
to set-up dedicated testing environments. This leaves critical testing to
the last minute, which often results in unanticipated bugs and conflicts
once a new version of Windows is released. By using the cloud, these
organizations can conduct early testing to gain insight into potential
challenges before an operating system is released, leaving ample time to
resolve compatibility issues with complex application and middleware
stacks that will run on Window 7.

    "Application development and testing organizations are notorious for
leaving compatibility testing until the last minute," said Chris Menegay,
president of Notion Solutions, a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner. "With a
large upgrade like Windows 7, companies that don't execute a Windows 7
test pass ahead of time will run the risk of compatibility issues. As a
software vendor and Microsoft consulting partner, we're using the Skytap
cloud to test our software on Windows 7 and ensure our clients are well
prepared for its release this year."

    Skytap provides organizations with a scalable, on-demand IT lab in the
cloud for application development and IT testing. Skytap is the only cloud
platform that enables IT organizations to utilize their existing MSDN
licenses, providing the convenience of pre-installed Windows 7 templates
in a virtual machine library. Using Skytap's cloud-based lab manager,
which is delivered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application,
development and test teams can eliminate IT provisioning delays and
set-up and tear-down test environments in minutes.

    "One of the many benefits of a cloud-based lab is the ability to quickly
spin up multiple operating systems as needed for compatibility testing,
and run all the testing in parallel if needed," said Scott Roza, CEO of
Skytap. "Using Skytap's cloud hosting platform and lab manager
application, developers and testers can collaborate in real time with
other team members while allowing customers and business users to
validate their software works correctly. This gives software teams the
capability to deploy applications on Windows 7 with the highest degree of
confidence possible."

Skytap's "Windows 7 Testing in the Cloud" Webinar on Tuesday, August 11
from 11:00 - 11:30 AM Pacific Time. Register for the event at

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) increased its

&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) today reported net income of $24
million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2009,
compared to $39 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the second quarter of
2008. 

Net income in the second quarter of 2009 was impacted by a decline in retail
energy deliveries, resulting from both a slow economy and mild weather, along
with the sale of excess power into low-priced wholesale markets. Also
contributing to the decrease in net income was the effect of estimated customer
refunds recorded in the second quarter of 2009 related to Senate Bill 408 (SB
408) due to lower expected earnings. The Company also recorded a gain in 2008 on
the sale of fuel oil at its Beaver plant. 

Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2009, was $55 million, or $0.77 per
diluted share, compared to $67 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, for 2008.
This decrease was largely driven by the factors described above with respect to
the second quarter of 2009. 

"The national recession continues to impact Oregon`s economy and, as a result,
we saw a decline in retail energy deliveries, primarily in our industrial
customers` electricity use. In addition, a depressed wholesale energy market
made it difficult to offset reduced revenue with the sale of excess power," said
Jim Piro, president and CEO of PGE. 

"During this quarter customer satisfaction remained high and we made progress on
significant capital projects. Our smart-meter technology is in full-deployment
stage, and construction of Phase II and III of our Biglow Canyon Wind Farm is on
time and on budget. We are well positioned for growth that will provide
long-term benefits to our shareholders." 

Second Quarter 2009 Highlights

* Total retail customers increased by 0.5% from 813,000 at the end of the second
quarter 2008 to 817,000 at the end of the second quarter of 2009. 
* Total retail energy deliveries decreased by approximately 8% from the second
quarter of 2008 as a slow economy impacted the energy usage of industrial and
commercial customers and milder weather impacted the energy usage of residential
customers. 
* Revenues declined from $425 million in the second quarter of 2008 to $389
million in the second quarter of 2009. The decline was primarily the result of
the following items:

* $32 million increase due to higher retail prices in the second quarter of 2009
compared to the second quarter 2008 as a result of a price increase that went
into effect on January 1, 2009. 
* $19 million decrease from a decline in retail energy deliveries. 
* $23 million decrease in wholesale revenues driven by a 51% decrease in average
price and slightly offset by a 1% increase in wholesale energy sales. 
* $10 million decrease due to fuel oil sales in the second quarter of 2008 ($7
million realized gain in the second quarter of 2008 net of $3 million in costs).

* $10 million decrease as lower income taxes resulted in increased customer
refunds under SB 408. Refunds were recorded in the second quarter of 2009
compared to collections recorded in the second quarter of 2008.

* Purchased power and fuel expense decreased by $1 million in the second quarter
of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008. This reflects the impacts of
higher average variable power costs being offset primarily by a reduction in
total system load and refunds to customers booked in the second quarter of 2008
under the power cost adjustment mechanism. 
* The fair market value of non-qualified benefit plan trust assets increased by
$5 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared to a nominal loss in the
second quarter of 2008. 
* Two turbine rotors were found to be damaged during the scheduled 2009
maintenance outage of Colstrip Unit 4, in which PGE has a 20% ownership
interest. Based on input from the Colstrip operator, we expect that the outage
will extend from late-May to mid-November 2009. PGE`s share of the repair costs
are estimated to be approximately $2 million. Incremental replacement power
costs are estimated to be approximately $11 million through mid-November 2009,
with $1 million incurred in the second quarter of 2009. 
* The scheduled 2009 maintenance outage at PGE`s Boardman coal plant has been
extended due to generator rotor issues. The plant is expected to be in service
by mid-August. Incremental power costs related to the extended outage are
estimated to be approximately $5 million, with minimal impact in the second
quarter 2009. The Company`s repair costs are not expected to be material. 
* As of June 30, 2009, approximately 100,000 new smart meters have been
installed. It is expected that 400,000 smart meters will be installed by the end
of 2009. 
* During the quarter, the first wind turbines at Biglow Canyon Phase II began
generating electricity. As of June 30, 2009, fifteen wind turbines had been
placed in service, with the remaining fifty turbines scheduled for completion by
the end of summer 2009.

2009 Earnings Guidance

PGE`s full-year 2009 earnings guidance is $1.35 to $1.45 per diluted share.
Guidance was revised to the current range on July 22nd, 2009, from $1.80 to
$1.90 per diluted share. Key drivers for the revision of guidance on July 22nd,
2009, include:

* Decline in retail margins due to the reduction in load primarily in the
industrial sector from the economic recession and the sale of excess power into
low-priced wholesale markets (approximately $0.15 per diluted share); 
* Replacement power and repair costs due to the extension of the scheduled 2009
maintenance outages at the Colstrip Unit 4 and Boardman coal plants. In
addition, hydroelectric results are lower than forecasted (approximately $0.15
per diluted share); and 
* Impacts from the above items results in lower income taxes which requires
increased customer refunds under SB 408, an Oregon utility tax law
(approximately $0.15 per diluted share).

PGE expects long-term average annual earnings growth of 6 to 8 percent starting
from 2010 earnings results, as 2009 reflects the near-term impacts of the
economic recession on load and energy markets. 

Liquidity

During the quarter PGE secured an additional $30 million in revolver capacity to
bring total borrowing capacity under revolving credit facilities to $525
million. As of June 30, 2009, the company had an aggregate remaining borrowing
capacity of $324 million available under the credit facilities. As of July 31,
2009, the aggregate borrowing capacity was $296 million. PGE posts or receives
margin deposits related to power and natural gas contracts. These contracts are
used to meet load requirements and are reflected in customer prices. As of June
30, 2009, PGE had posted margin deposits of $309 million, consisting of $127
million in cash and $182 million in letters of credit. Provided market prices
remain unchanged from June 30, 2009, the Company anticipates that approximately
32% of collateral deposits at the end of the second quarter would roll-off by
the end of 2009 and approximately 52% is expected to roll off by the end of
2010. As of July 31, 2009, margin deposits were $331 million. 

Capital Expenditures

* Capital expenditures in 2009 are estimated to be $720 million. The majority of
these expenditures are related to Phases II ($230 million) and III ($176
million) of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm, smart meters ($59 million) and ongoing
expenditures for production, transmission and distribution ($226 million). 
* Capital expenditures in 2010 are estimated to be $520 million, the majority of
which are for Phase III of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm ($198 million), smart
meters ($60 million) and ongoing expenditures for production, transmission and
distribution ($223 million).

Financing Plans

PGE issued $300 million in First Mortgage Bonds in April 2009 to fund capital
expenditures related to Biglow Canyon and smart meters and to refinance $142
million of Pollution Control Bonds. The Company anticipates issuing
approximately $375 million of debt through 2010, most of which will be used for
the last phase of the Biglow Canyon wind projects and to refinance approximately
$186 million in debt maturities in 2010.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Aug 5 (Reuters) - Shares in China Railway Group

By 0303 GMT, the stock was up 8.9 percent at HK$7.70 after
scaling a 14-month high of HK$7.76 earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to "buy" from "neutral" and
nearly doubled its traget price to HK$10.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China Railway Group (601390.SS) said over the weekend it

Here are highlights from Monday`sAnalyst Blog: 

ISM Continues to Improve

It looks like the economy could be on the cusp of moving from a series of
vicious cycles to a series of virtuous cycles. There will still be substantial
headwinds from consumers who have lower incomes and a greater desire to same
more of what they do earn. However, the prospect of the economy falling off the
cliff now seems very remote. 

I would still prefer to be a bit on the cautious side, and play the improving
economy with conservative, well-capitalized firms. One name worth considering in
the industrial part of the economy is 3M (NYSE: MMM), where analysts have been
busy raising their sights. 

In the Tech sector, there are several names that are well capitalized and which
would participate nicely in an economic recovery, even one that is anemic.
Analysts have been raising their sights for Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and IBM (NYSE:
IBM) recently, as well as some of the chip companies like Texas Instruments
(NYSE: TXN), for example. 

BXP Chief Sells a Million Shares

According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Chairman Mort Zuckerman of
Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE: BXP), a leading real estate investment trust
(REIT), intends to sell 9% of his total stake in the company. 

The deal would involve a sale of about 1 million shares of the company and is
likely to generate $50 million for Zuckerman. The proceeds would be utilized to
purchase printing presses for his New York daily, The Daily News. 

The timing of the sale has raised speculation among investors about the
profitability of Boston Properties. Most of the investors view the sale as a
move by the Chairman to have a better investment profile, raising fears that
probably the newspaper was a better investment than the REIT.

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI Aug 4 (Reuters) - The Dutch arm of the Abu Dhabi
National Energy Co TAQA.AD has bought a 15 percent stake in
Dutch North Sea assets from a group including U.S. major Chevron
Corp (CVX.N), Taqa said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Taqa took control this week as operator of the North Sea
Brent crude system, which has global significance as part of a
pricing benchmark used to value millions of barrels per day of
oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UAE company has amassed over $2 billion of North Sea
assets in just a few years. The company is one of the investment
vehicles Abu Dhabi uses to invest oil money, and is 75 percent
owned by the emirate's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taqa acquired 15 percent of assets owned by the L11b group,
Taqa said in the statement. The purchase comes as the L8-D
group, of which Taqa is a member, bought the entire 100 percent
interest in the L11b group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The L11b group includes Chevron, DSM Energie (DSMN.AS) and
EBN, Taqa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taqa would become the operator of the L11b-A gas production
platform from Aug. 1, it said. Cirrus Energy Corp's CYR.V
Dutch unit would become the L11b licence operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cirrus said in its own statement that payment for the
transaction would be royalty from any future natural gas and
condensate sales from the depleted L11b-A field plus assumption
of any liability should the platform be abandoned in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The assets included the gas platform and a pipeline to the
Noordgastransport pipeline.

&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GA, Aug 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Infor today announced the availability of Infor CRM i Edition, a new
solution that provides enhanced customer relationship management (CRM)
capabilities to customers with Infor enterprise resource planning (ERP)
solutions on IBM System i platforms. The new solution can help Infor's
more than 14,000 System i customers create growth and loyalty through
heightened customer dialogue, increased revenue, reduced costs, and
enhanced customer service.

    CRM i Edition, linked with Infor's ERP products, provides Infor customers
a single, integrated view of customer-related information such as credit
limits, financial transactions, orders, quotes, shipments, and more. End
users can access the solution via their Internet browser, ensuring data
availability anywhere, anytime. The solution further simplifies use by
providing CRM data to users through a single access point. CRM i Edition
has robust capabilities for campaign management, opportunity management,
sales process management, and quotation and order management.

    "Infor CRM i Edition helps our System i customers leverage their ERP data
with new capabilities that will help them increase sales revenue, reduce
sales costs, expand data visibility, enhance forecast accuracy, and
improve customer service," said Kevin Piotrowski, director of System i
solution marketing, Infor. "Providing innovation and support to our large
installed base of System i customers is an important priority and
commitment for Infor and a major factor behind our recent establishment
of a business unit dedicated to our worldwide base of customers who use
IBM System i."

    CRM i Edition enables companies to manage campaigns using CRM and ERP data
to easily target subsets of their customers with offers tailored to
specific wants and needs. Using e-mail, call lists for telesales and the
mail merge function, the solution enables companies to better define and
execute campaigns. Additionally, the solution provides the ability to
manage marketing events, such as invitations, response tracking and
post-event surveys, and also measure a campaign's success.

    With the solution's sales process management functionality, companies can
use multiple sales practices as part of an overall CRM program.
User-defined sales processes include additional sales to an existing
customer, service without a contract, maintenance renewal, sales to a
prospect, sales through a partner or reseller, and major account sales. In
each instance, a record is created for every opportunity, enabling users
to review status using various parameters such as deal value, predicted
close date and others.

    Additional functionality in Infor CRM i Edition enables users to manage
quotations and orders by taking advantage of the abundant information
contained in the company's existing ERP system. This data includes
pricing, discounting, promotions, sourcing, and more. Using this data,
the solution simplifies the prospect-to-customer and quote-to-order
conversion processes, enabling users to increase the number of inquiries
that become orders. This conversion rate is also boosted by the
solution's opportunity management capabilities, which helps improve close
rates and shorten sales cycles.

&lt;p&gt;RICHMOND, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Mechanics Bank, headquartered in Richmond, California, and one of the oldest and
largest independent community banks in Northern California, has sent the
following letter to the parties in dispute over Chevron's Richmond refinery
upgrade: 

"For almost 100 years, Mechanics Bank has proudly called Richmond its home. As
an organization that is committed to helping build prosperous communities as
their trusted financial partner, we have always supported Richmond's businesses,
non-profits, and provide employment to many of its residents. In the spirit of
that commitment, we add our voice today to the growing chorus of those calling
for an end to the impasse over Chevron's refinery upgrade project. Richmond,
which calls itself the "City of Pride and Purpose," is in danger of losing both
if it cannot find a way to reach a swift and equitable agreement that allows it
to move forward. 

With the city's unemployment at its highest level since the Great
Depression--estimated to exceed 17%--and the state's financial difficulties
about to lead to a loss of millions from its redevelopment funds, Richmond is
facing one of its greatest challenges. By bringing the refinery project to a
halt, Communities for a Better Environment and its allies may think they have
won the day, but from our viewpoint, it appears to be a hollow victory. A
century of serving this community has taught us that opportunities such as that
posed by the Chevron plant upgrade don't come along very often--and they are
especially rare in a time of recession. A failure to find a compromise that is
fair to all would squander a chance to revive Richmond's struggling economy, and
likely would eliminate future jobs and prosperity, too. 

Because no agreement was reached by the July 30 deadline set by the court, more
than 1100 local workers have lost their jobs. Their families have lost
healthcare and other benefits. The city itself stands to lose over $61 million
in promised community benefits to support a variety of much-needed programs.
From job training for low-skill workers to funding that bolsters desperately
needed police and fire services, from support for free and subsidized health
services to construction of the missing link of the Bay Trail, and much, much
more, Richmond comes out a loser. 

Worst of all, the reason given for opposing Chevron's plant upgrade doesn't
stand up to scrutiny. Despite opponents' claims of environmental degradation,
the City of Richmond, the State Attorney General's office, and the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District concluded after four years of review that the
refinery upgrade would actually reduce emissions! 

We did not speak with Chevron prior to preparing this letter, nor did they
request that we take a position on the dispute. But given our deep roots in this
community we felt it was imperative to speak out. Richmond has been a big part
of the growth and success of Mechanics Bank, for which we will always be
grateful. Together, we've survived the Great Depression and a dozen other
boom-and-bust cycles. We have always believed in a bright future for this city,
but if the naysayers kill this opportunity, it may well be decades before
Richmond makes up what it will have lost. 

It is imperative for our community that all parties reach a swift, reasonable
resolution so that Richmond and its citizens can get back to work quickly." 

Sincerely,
Steven K. Buster
CEO, Mechanics Bank

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will add a file format "ballot" to Office 2010, part of a wider move to fend off European Union (EU) antitrust regulators and block massive fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a proposal submitted to the European Commission two weeks ago, Microsoft spelled out a range of promises related to Office, its desktop and server software, and other products to address antitrust concerns first expressed by officials in January 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time, the commission announced it had launched a pair of probes into Microsoft's business practices after receiving complaints. One of the investigations revolved around Microsoft's bundling of Internet Explorer (IE) with Windows, and was triggered by a protest filed by Norwegian browser maker Opera. The other -- prompted by a complaint submitted by the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, a trade group that has been vocal about Microsoft's behavior -- involved Office, Microsoft's market-dominant productivity suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been accused in the past of favoring its own Office formats to the exclusion of rivals in a way that could hinder the interoperability of its software with other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 24, Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, announced two deals to the commission, one each on IE and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is so confident that its IE proposal will be accepted by the Brussels-based regulators that it has dumped plans to sell a special browser-free version of Windows 7 in the EU this fall. That deal centers around a "ballot screen" which will let Windows users download and install rival browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its proposal for Office includes a stipulation similar to the IE ballot; for the suite, it will let European customers select the default file format from an unspecified number of choices. Office 2010 is slated to hit the streets next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beginning with the release of Office [2010], end users that purchase Microsoft's Primary PC Productivity Applications in the EEA [European Economic Area] in both the OEM and retail channel will be prompted in an unbiased way to select default file format (from options that include ODF) for those applications upon the first boot of any one of them," Microsoft said in its proposal [ download Word document]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not spell out how the file format "ballot" will appear to users, or what choices, other than ODF (Open Document Format), the open-source word processing, spreadsheet and presentation document standard, will be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company did promise to provide a tool to corporate IT departments that would let them set the default file format for Office 2010. "Beginning with the Office Customization Tool released with Office [2010], an updated Office Customization Tool that will have a mandatory prompt to affirmatively select the default format for file saving for Microsoft's Primary PC Productivity Applications will be made available to IT administrators in EEA," said Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft made concessions in May 2008 to support ODF -- it made good on them in Office 2007 Service Pack 2 (SP2), which shipped in late April 2009 -- EU officials reacted cautiously. "The commission would welcome any step that Microsoft took toward genuine interoperability, more consumer choice and less vendor lock-in," the antitrust agency said last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's newest offer may hint at an impending resolution to the Office investigation. On the day Microsoft delivered its proposals, the commission said the plan needed "further investigation before the Commission reaches any conclusion as to the next steps," phrasing that the group had not used before when discussing the interoperability inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other parts of the proposal outlined additional measures Microsoft will commit to taking, including publishing information on Office's older proprietary file formats as well as the Office Open XML (OOXML) formats that it introduced with Office 2007, and which will be used in Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc lost its argument in a dispute over an advertising campaign by Coca-Cola Co which claimed that PepsiCo's Gatorade sports drink was missing crucial electrolytes, a U.S. judge ruled this week.&lt;/p&gt;

Lawyers for Coke said the campaign was short-lived and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SVC complains about Coca-Cola's claims regarding the presence of calcium and magnesium in Powerade ION4, but it has made virtually identical claims about calcium and magnesium in its own Gatorade Endurance Formula," the judge's ruling said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SVC cannot, having jumped on the bandwagon of calcium and magnesium first, now jump off and claim that Coca-Cola must get off too," the ruling said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement responding to the ruling, Gatorade spokesman Pete Brace said: "We accomplished what we set out to do.

&lt;p&gt; * Dispute over electrolyte claims in sports drinks
 (Adds statements from both companies, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Grant McCool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 5 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) lost its
argument in a dispute over an advertising campaign by Coca-Cola
Co (KO.N) which claimed that PepsiCo's Gatorade sports drink

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government has queried Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) about its compensation practices and credit derivative instruments, the firm said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, in a regulatory filing, said it was cooperating with the requests -- tied to hot button issues that have captivated Wall Street and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Goldman reported robust net earnings of $3.4 billion for the second quarter, soon after repaying a $10 billion bailout received from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm set aside $6.65 billion in the quarter for compensation expenses, adding to a firestorm of criticism about pay practices on Wall Street. So far this year Goldman has set aside $11.3 billion for compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the firm faces unwanted attention for its bonus pool, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein told his staff to be cautious about making large purchases, the New York Post reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Holland, a money manager with Holland  Co in New York City, called the government's inquiry about compensation "a symbol" of Washington's interest in curbing Wall Street pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Politics is a major part of the life of Lloyd Blankfein and his cohorts," said Holland. "I think this is a preview of things to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the regulatory filing, Goldman's board has received several letters from shareholders about compensation. It said the letters have included demands that the board investigate compensation in recent years, begin recouping so-called excessive compensation, and consider reforming pay practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board is considering the letters, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is seeking information about Goldman's credit default instruments amid a regulatory battle in Washington over such products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit derivatives have been blamed for exacerbating last year's near collapse of the financial markets. Some lawmakers say trading in the instruments should be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The turnaround for Goldman, though, largely resulted from its trading desks, which produced 46 days of more than $100 million in trading revenue during the second quarter, according to the filing. Trading losses were reported on only two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Tuesday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Marathon Misses on Lower Prices

Marathon Oil Corporation`s (NYSE: MRO) second-quarter 2009 results came in
sharply weaker-than-expected, with the contribution from increased oil and
natural gas production and improved refining margins more than offset by lower
realized commodity prices. Earnings per share, excluding mark-to-market and
divestment gains, came in at 35 cents, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53
cents. 

As has been the case with the other oil majors that have already reported --
Exxon (NYSE: XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) --
earnings and revenue comparisons with the year-earlier period were even worse.
Marathon`s adjusted earnings per share plunged 71%, while sales declined 40% to
$13 billion. 

Income from the upstream segment totaled $220 million during the quarter, down
more than 73% from the year-ago level. 

The company reported production (available for sale) of 411,000 oil-equivalent
barrels per day (BOE/d), in-line with its interim guidance last month. This is a
12% year-over-year production growth, reflecting strong operating performance
from the company's Alvheim/Vilje oil field in the North Sea and natural gas
assets in Equatorial Guinea. 

Lower realized oil and natural gas prices offset the significant upstream volume
gains. Marathon's worldwide realized crude oil price of $55.49 per barrel was
more than 50% below the year-earlier level, while natural gas realizations
dropped 57% to $2.21 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). 

WellPoint Profit Declines

Health insurer WellPoint Inc. (NYSE: WLP) reported second quarter GAAP results
of $693.5 million or $1.43 per share that were in-line with the Zacks Consensus
Estimate. Non-GAAP earnings, excluding net investment losses of 7 cents per
share, came in at $1.50 per share. On a GAAP basis, profits declined 7.6% from
the year-ago period. 

Total operating revenues declined 1.4% to $15.265.8 million. Operating gains
from the Commercial Business segment declined 31.2% to $582.8 million. Results
were affected by the increasing unemployment rate. The Consumer Business
reported an operating gain of $382.1 million, up 67.7% from the year-ago period.
Operating improvements in the Senior business helped drive growth in this
segment. The Other segment reported a 12.5% year-over-year increase in operating
gain, which was driven by growth in the company`s NextRx pharmacy benefit
management operation. 

We were disappointed to see a significant decline in medical enrollment in the
reported quarter. Medical enrollment fell by 1.1 million people, or 3%, to 34.2
million members. Rising unemployment led to the decline in enrolment. With the
increasing trend in unemployment rates, we expect medical enrolment to decline
further. The company cut down its year-end membership expectations to 33.6
million.

&lt;p&gt; * Government also asks about credit derivative instruments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Firm says it is cooperating with requests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Trading revenue topped $100 million on 46 days in Q2
 (Adds details on trading revenue)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. government has queried
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) about its compensation practices
and credit derivative instruments, the firm said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, in a regulatory filing, said it was cooperating
with the requests -- tied to hot button issues that have
captivated Wall Street and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Goldman reported robust net earnings of $3.4
billion for the second quarter, soon after repaying a $10
billion bailout received from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled
Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm set aside $6.65 billion in the quarter for
compensation expenses, adding to a firestorm of criticism about
pay practices on Wall Street. So far this year Goldman has set
aside $11.3 billion for compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the firm faces unwanted attention for its bonus pool,
Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein told his staff to be cautious about
making large purchases, the New York Post reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Holland, a money manager with Holland  Co in New
York City, called the government's inquiry about compensation
"a symbol" of Washington's interest in curbing Wall Street
pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Politics is a major part of the life of Lloyd Blankfein
and his cohorts," said Holland. "I think this is a preview of
things to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the regulatory filing, Goldman's board has
received several letters from shareholders about compensation.
It said the letters have included demands that the board
investigate compensation in recent years, begin recouping
so-called excessive compensation, and consider reforming pay
practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The board is considering the letters, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government is seeking information about Goldman's
credit default instruments amid a regulatory battle in
Washington over such products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit derivatives have been blamed for exacerbating last
year's near collapse of the financial markets. Some lawmakers
say trading in the instruments should be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The turnaround for Goldman, though, largely resulted from
its trading desks, which produced 46 days of more than $100
million in trading revenue during the second quarter, according
to the filing. Trading losses were reported on only two days.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 5 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) may book a
gain of as much as $1.3 billion if investors take the firm up
on its offer to buy back up to $3.4 billion in trust preferred
securities, analysts at CreditSights said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan on Tuesday offered to buy back up to $3.4 billion
in trust preferreds, or TruPS, offering 60 percent of the par
value for some issues and 63 percent of the par value of other
bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If all bondholders agree to the tender offer, JPMorgan
could book earnings of around $840 million after tax, or $0.21
per share, analysts David Hendler, Pri de Silva and Kristine
Lanspa said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are of the view that the company may have offered the
tender to opportunistically improve the quality of its capital
in light of continued credit losses and also rescue its
investors who are earning around 1 percent on their floating
rate TruPS," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan indicated to us that the trust preferreds that
the company tendered for are largely less liquid-to-illiquid,
privately held capital instruments. As a result, investors have
limited options to exit their investments," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is the only bank deemed by the U.S. Treasury to
have adequate capital to tender for its junior debt,
CreditSights said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trust preferreds sit below senior debt but above common
equity in a company's capital structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The tender offer provides an opportunity for the company
to improve the quality of its regulatory capital at the expense
of quantity," CreditSights said. "We believe that most
investors would have a strong incentive to accept the tender
offer and reinvest their proceeds elsewhere."

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delays in spending the U.S. stimulus plan have changed the historic measure's effect on the country's economic growth, Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday, predicting that the plan will likely have a greater impact later in its two-year life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a report, Goldman Sachs projected that the $787 billion stimulus package's impact on real Gross Domestic Product Growth will peak at 3.3 percentage points on an annualized basis in the third quarter of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank now expects a greater effect in subsequent quarters following a slower than expected uptake in the spending to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the country's employment and income levels have worsened, requiring more from stimulus spending programs such as extended unemployment benefits, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the administration may speed up spending for certain programs, and the Build America Bonds included in the package have boosted state and local outlays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most likely scenario is that after delays in start-up, spending gets back on track with our projections, and that the shortfall in spending we have seen so far is made up over the next three quarters," said the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is expecting the plan's annualized effect on real GDP growth will be 2.0 percentage points in the fourth quarter of the year, compared to the much slimmer 1.1 percentage points it projected in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman estimates the effect on growth in the first quarter of 2010 at 1.5 percentage points, compared to its original forecast of 0.5 percentage points, followed by 1.1 percentage points in the second quarter, up from an earlier 0.7 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drag created by the end of the program will be larger than originally estimated, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the federal government made an advance estimate that the U.S. GDP shrank 1.0 percent in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said the federal government would likely send $10 billion more to states for education than it anticipated when the plan was passed in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said the taxable Build America Bonds, the form of debt created by the stimulus plan that gives bond issuers a federal subsidy, helped restart the municipal debt market, which encouraged states and local governments to spend more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state and local sector contributed 0.3 percentage points to growth in the second quarter, "following two quarters of negative contribution and despite a worsening fiscal situation," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if only a small portion of the $15 billion in BABs went to new construction activity in the quarter, this could have accounted for a meaningful amount of the growth in state and local outlays reported for the quarter," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, "the pace of issuance has declined significantly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act covers a two-year span and will create a "fiscal drag" as spending Goldman has "penciled in $250 billion in additional funds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The political resistance to a large amount of new stimulus appears higher now than it did a few months ago, but the relatively broad support for additional auto scrappage funding suggests that there is still an appetite for programs that appear to work," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman did not include any effect from the "Cash for Clunkers" program, where people receive a federal grant for scrapping an old car and buying a new one, in its calculations.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Aug 5 (Reuters) - Delays in spending the U.S.
stimulus plan have changed the historic measure's effect on the
country's economic growth, Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday,
predicting that the plan will likely have a greater impact
later in its two-year life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a report, Goldman Sachs projected that the $787 billion
stimulus package's impact on real Gross Domestic Product Growth
will peak at 3.3 percentage points on an annualized basis in
the third quarter of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the bank now expects a greater effect in subsequent
quarters following a slower than expected uptake in the
spending to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, the country's employment and income levels
have worsened, requiring more from stimulus spending programs
such as extended unemployment benefits, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the administration may speed up spending for certain
programs, and the Build America Bonds included in the package
have boosted state and local outlays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The most likely scenario is that after delays in start-up,
spending gets back on track with our projections, and that the
shortfall in spending we have seen so far is made up over the
next three quarters," said the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is expecting the plan's annualized effect on real
GDP growth will be 2.0 percentage points in the fourth quarter
of the year, compared to the much slimmer 1.1 percentage points
it projected in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman estimates the effect on growth in the first quarter
of 2010 at 1.5 percentage points, compared to its original
forecast of 0.5 percentage points, followed by 1.1 percentage
points in the second quarter, up from an earlier 0.7 percentage
points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drag created by the end of the program will be larger
than originally estimated, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, the federal government made an advance estimate
that the U.S. GDP shrank 1.0 percent in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said the federal government would likely send $10
billion more to states for education than it anticipated when
the plan was passed in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said the taxable Build America Bonds, the form of
debt created by the stimulus plan that gives bond issuers a
federal subsidy, helped restart the municipal debt market,
which encouraged states and local governments to spend more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state and local sector contributed 0.3 percentage
points to growth in the second quarter, "following two quarters
of negative contribution and despite a worsening fiscal
situation," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even if only a small portion of the $15 billion in BABs
went to new construction activity in the quarter, this could
have accounted for a meaningful amount of the growth in state
and local outlays reported for the quarter," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, "the pace of issuance has declined
significantly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act covers a
two-year span and will create a "fiscal drag" as spending
Goldman has "penciled in $250 billion in additional funds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The political resistance to a large amount of new stimulus
appears higher now than it did a few months ago, but the
relatively broad support for additional auto scrappage funding
suggests that there is still an appetite for programs that
appear to work," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman did not include any effect from the "Cash for
Clunkers" program, where people receive a federal grant for
scrapping an old car and buying a new one, in its calculations.
It said there could be a boost to growth around half a point in
the third quarter if auto companies push up production from the
increased demand.

mostly lower on Wednesday afternoon, after mixed economic data,
with stocks little changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment bank Goldman Sachs revised up its forecast for

"some of the steam out of Treasuries", Guggenheim Securities'
analyst Jason Rogin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it raised its forecast for GDP growth in the
second half of 2009 to 3.0 percent from 1.0 percent at an
annual rate, but the bank expected "a return to below-trend
growth in 2010."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it had made no significant changes to its
forecasts for unemployment, inflation, or Federal Reserve
policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman cited second-quarter inventory liquidation, a boost

spurs for changing its near-term outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury note price US10YT=RR

&lt;p&gt;New Corporate Location and US-based Management Team Aligns with Large U.S.
Customer Base
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
RAND Worldwide announces today that it has completed the move of its global
corporate headquarters to Waltham, MA in the United States. The move is a
further step in the process begun with the acquisition of RAND Worldwide by the
US-based venture capital firm, Ampersand Ventures. The new RAND Worldwide
corporate headquarters are located at 1601 Trapelo Road, Suite 162, Waltham, MA,
02451. The Company`s Canadian headquarters remain in Mississauga, Ontario. 

Marc Dulude, chairman, president, and CEO at RAND Worldwide states, "As a US
owned company, with a new US-based management team, it was important for us to
formally establish our headquarters in the US, our largest market, in order to
better service and support our US customers. We remain focused on growing our
Canadian operations and providing the best service to our Canadian customers and
we will retain our Canadian headquarters in Ontario. After making these
significant changes and with the worst of the economic slowdown behind us, we
are ideally poised for future growth in both important markets." 

In support of this transition, RAND Worldwide is pleased to announce two key
additions to the senior leadership team in the Waltham location. Greg Magoon has
joined the company as executive vice president and chief financial officer.
Previously, Mr. Magoon spent seven years at publicly held Moldflow Corporation
where he most recently served as the company`s executive vice president and
chief financial officer. 

In addition to Mr. Magoon, Lori Henderson joined the RAND Worldwide team as
executive vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel.
Prior to joining the company, Ms. Henderson served as general counsel at
Moldflow Corporation from 1999 until the Autodesk acquisition of Moldflow in
2008. To further facilitate the establishment of a US headquarters, functional
department heads have been hired to lead the finance and accounting, human
resources, information technology and marketing departments from the Waltham
office. 

In conclusion, Dulude adds, "We pride ourselves on being able to offer our
clients a wide range of best-in-class technology solutions and we deliver those
with an exceptionally high level of support through our training and
implementation services. We expect this headquarters transition to be seamless
and that our clients will continue to receive the high quality of service they
have come to expect from us. Each of the RAND Worldwide business units retains
the same locations for their operations and headquarters including RAND IMAGINiT
Technologies, one of Autodesk`s largest, direct value-added resellers."

Elmore, Coca-Cola Consolidated President and Chief Operating Officer. "This
investment of more than $9 million includes a new bottling line at our downtown
Roanoke manufacturing plant on Shenandoah Avenue and the opening of our new
warehouse and logistics center at Valley Gateway." 

"The Roanoke Valley is a great place to do business and we are pleased to be a
part of this vibrant community," he added. In addition to expanding our
facilities, we were also able to create 10 new jobs for citizens in the Roanoke
Valley."

PPM Center). The report also provides a technical comparison matrix that
evaluates the capabilities of each of the eight vendors' PPM solutions based on
a five metric scale (i.e. No Support up to Extensive Support). 

Who should read: 

This report is a must have resource for those seeking to evaluate select PPM
solutions and ultimately create a short list of suitable candidates for further

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) attracted some brisk options trading on Tuesday, as nearly
500,000 contracts changed hands on the pharmaceutical concern. This surge in
volume is more than eight times the equity's average daily trading volume,
according to data from WhatsTrading.com. What's more, roughly 94% of the volume
traded on the call side. 

Despite yesterday's spike in call trading, options players have recently favored
puts on the stock. The Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio for PFE stands
at 1.05, as put open interest outnumbers call open interest among options slated
to expire in less than three months. This reading is also higher than 96% of all
those taken during the past year, indicating that short-term options speculators
have been more skeptical of the shares only 4% of the time during the past 12
months.

Analysts, on average, expected PG to earn 78 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 11 percent to $18.7 billion and volume fell 5 percent, including a 1 percent hit from divestitures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company still forecast earnings of $3.65 to $3.80 per share from continuing operations this year.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney XD, formerly known as Toon Disney, has renewed its flagship comedy series "Zeke and Luther" for a second season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Zeke" launched in June with the highest-rated primetime debut among kid demos in the 10-year history of the channels: 305,000 in kids 6-14 and 183,000 in tweens 9-14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show, starring Hutch Dano and Adam Hicks as lifelong buddies determined to become world-famous skateboarders, ranks as boys-centered Disney XD's No. 1 program among kids 6-14 and boys 6-14. It also scored big in its sampling airing on Disney Channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by dean.goodman at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Aug 5 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the
biggest oil producer in Indonesia, has signed a preliminary
deal worth $2.5 billion to buy gas from ConocoPhillips (COP.N)
on Sumatra island, officials said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron needs the gas to support technology used to coax
more oil from its Duri field in Central Sumatra. The
technology, known as steamflood, can enhance recovery on oil
fields where output is declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gas deal will replace a previous agreement under which
Chervon swapped around 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude
oil from Duri with around 400 million cubic feet per day of
natural gas from ConocoPhillips' gas field in South Sumatra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect the final purchasing deal to be signed as soon
as possible," said Amir Hamzah, an official at Indonesia's
energy watchdog, BPMIGAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gareth Johnstone, a Chevron spokesman, said in an email the
deal would help Chevron maintain oil production targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This agreement will secure a reliable gas supply for
steamflood facilities, which is critically needed to optimise
the crude oil production from Rokan Block," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Duri field is in the Rokan block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another BPMIGAS official, who declined to be identified by
name, said Chevron was currently producing around 300,000 bpd
of crude from its Duri and Minas fields in Sumatra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has turned into a net importer of crude in recent
years, as production has slumped after a failure to tap new
fields fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Southeast Asian country was producing around 1.5
million bpd about a decade ago, but production has now slumped
to below 1 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia's crude oil production slipped to 826,600 bpd in
July, from 829,200 bpd in June, after several wells were shut
for technical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The country's condensate output was 120,000 bpd in July,
unchanged from June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Muklis Ali; Editing by Ed Davies)

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO Aug 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said it had
an upset at an alkylation unit at its 238,600 barrel per day
refinery in Joliet, Illinois, on Thursday which resulted in two
people being taken to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil said the cause was a propane leak at about
12:30 p.m. CDT (1730 GMT) that resulted in a release of
hydrofluoric acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Impact on the refinery's operations was not immediately
available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hydrofluoric acid is used in alkylation units, which make
high-octane blending components for gasoline. It can cause
severe burns and cause significant damage to heart, lungs and
bones in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An explosion in an alkylation unit at Citgo Petroleum
Corp's Corpus Christi, Texas, refinery on July 19, triggered a
release of hydrofluoric acid vapor within the refinery. One
worker was severely injured and remains hospitalized.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 6 (Reuters) - A small fire at Exxon Mobil

afternoon was in the chemical plant and not the adjoining
refinery, according to a trade source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 572,500-barrel per day (bpd) refinery's units were

second-quarter profit rose 48 percent due to an increase in
electronic payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income rose to 364.8 million reais ($199 million),

Here are highlights from Wednesday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Microsoft: The Bing Thing

Recent numbers put out by analytics firm StatCounter indicate that Microsoft`s
(Nasdaq: MSFT) new search engine, Bing, gained market share in July. The
company`s share of U.S. search engine users increased 14.3%, mostly at the cost
of Yahoo (Nasdaq: YHOO) and smaller players. Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) continues to
dominate, with a three-quarter`s share of the market. 

Last month, Microsoft announced a ten-year agreement with Yahoo that allows it
to power, control and process search-related information. Yahoo gets to collect
advertisements and keep 88% of the revenue. While management of both companies
expressed enthusiasm on the deal, investor responses varied. 

Microsoft shareholders were happy since the company was not making any upfront
payment, while Yahoo shareholders were disappointed for the same reason.
Meanwhile, shareholders of market leader Google appeared concerned at the
prospect of increased competition. 

Consumer Bankruptcies Soar

Since the start of the year, 802,000 individuals have filed for bankruptcy. The
July rate would equate to 885,000 people going bankrupt, so clearly we are still
in an uptrend, and historically the number of bankruptcies peaks well after a
recession is over. 

The report did not specify the causes of the bankruptcies, but clearly the
rapidly rising unemployment rate and uninsured medical expenses are likely to be
significant factors. The ABI is predicting there will be 1.4 million filings
this year. I suspect it will be higher than that. 

One of the major problems in the economy is that the consumer has too much debt.
If there is not enough income to service and repay the debt, then debt will come
down through bankruptcy. Rising levels of delinquencies on all forms of consumer
credit, such as mortgages and credit cards indicate that there will be more
filings in the future. This is not good news for the credit card heavy banks
like Capital One (NYSE: COF) and American Express (NYSE: AXP).

Freddie Mac Issues 3-yr Notes

Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE) announced its plans to issue a new series of 3-year
Reference Notes that will be due September 21, 2012. The issue will be priced
today and will settle tomorrow at a benchmark size. The company refrained from
disclosing the size of the issue. 

J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Barclays Capital, Inc. (NYSE: BCS) and Deutsche
Bank Securities, Inc. (NYSE: DB) have been appointed as dealers and managers to
the sale. The company also plans to apply to list the security on the Euro MTF
market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. 

Freddie Mac has been among the hardest hit financial firms by the housing slump,
credit crisis and ongoing recession. We do foresee the current expansion of the
Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) to bring down losses from foreclosures
in the upcoming quarters.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Option players are beginning to reveal a bullish bias toward JPMorgan Chase &amp;
Co. (NYSE: JPM). On Wednesday, for example, traders on the International
Securities Exchange (ISE) bought to open 11,491 calls on JPM, compared to 6,358
puts. In other words, speculative investors snapped up 1.81 times more calls
than puts during the course of the day's trading. 

Yesterday's bias toward bullish bets represented an exaggeration of the recent
trend in JPM's option pits. During the past week, ISE option players have bought
to open 16,126 calls and 13,489 puts on the banking issue, resulting in a
five-day call/put volume ratio of 1.20.

&lt;p&gt;August 5th Ceremony Celebrated Structural Completion of Facility That Will Treat
Soldiers Suffering from Traumatic Brain Injuries
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
SmithGroup, a leading architecture and engineering firm and The Intrepid Fallen
Heroes Fund (IFHF), a non-profit organization supporting the men and women of
the United States Armed Forces and their families, celebrated the overall
structural completion of the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE), an
advanced facility dedicated to research, diagnosis and treatment of military
personnel and veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI). 

The $65 million NICoE project broke ground at Walter Reed National Military
Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland in June, 2008 and will be completed in
spring, 2010. Turner Construction Company is the general contractor. Upon
completion, the IFHF will transfer ownership of the NICoE to the Department of
Defense for staffing and ongoing operation. 

SmithGroup and IFHF designed the 72,000-square-foot, two-story facility to
provide the most advanced services in diagnostic imaging, clinical care and
rehabilitation, staff and patient education, and clinical research in the
treatment of TBI. The world-class Center will also support continued innovation
and technological advances in military medicine as well as serve as a prototype
for similar military and civilian TBI centers worldwide. 

SmithGroup (www.smithgroup.com) ranks as the nation's 7th largest architecture
and engineering firm (Building Design &amp; Construction, July 2009) and employs
800. The Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund (www.fallenheroesfund.org) is a leader in
supporting the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. In 2007,
SmithGroup and IFHF created the award-winning Center for the Intrepid
rehabilitation center in San Antonio, Texas funded entirely by private donations
by over 600,000 Americans.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks have entered a new bull market, and the SP 500 index could rise as much as 10 percent from current levels by the end of this year, Goldman Sachs strategist Abby Joseph Cohen said on CNBC on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sees the benchmark Standard  Poor's 500 index in a range of 1,050-1,100 toward year-end, said Cohen, the firm's senior investment strategist and president of its Global Markets Institute.

"It may prove it began in March of this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks have recovered sharply since hitting 12-year lows in early March, with the SP 500 index now up 47 percent since trading as low as 666.79 points in March. In early afternoon trade on Thursday, the SP was off 0.53 percent at 997.44 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen also said she expects the labor market to improve, but in "an erratic way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears job losses are slowing, and there is some job creation going on," she said. But "we have many more months of difficult labor situation ahead, even if the recession, using GDP or industrial production, is almost over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. labor market has remained weak even as other parts of the economy have improved, with the unemployment rate at just under 10 percent. Friday's July employment report from the Labor Department is forecast to show the jobless rate at 9.6 percent, its highest since June 1983, and 320,000 monthly job losses, according to a Reuters survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen said sectors tied to economic improvement are likely to be the best stock picks for right now, including energy, technology and financial companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of us have lost track of the fact that most of these (financial) stocks do follow economic growth, so when the GDP is doing well, financial services tend to do well," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs on Wednesday raised its gross domestic product forecast for this year's second half to an annualized rate of 3 percent, from a prior outlook of 1 percent, citing an expected increase in production by companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many companies trying to be very cautious over last year really squeezed inventories down to levels that are unsustainable," Cohen said on CNBC.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer commits to improve access through a 60 percent price decrease to $1 per
dose on drug to treat TB in patients taking second-line HIV/AIDS medications.

Once-daily four-drug combination for "second-line" treatment of HIV/AIDS
available from Matrix, a Mylan company, at $475 annually today and at $425
annually in 2010, 28 percent lower than the current lowest-priced alternative.

Combined, the new agreements on HIV and TB -- the leading cause of death of
people living with HIV -- reinforce calls for more integrated prevention and
treatment of the two diseases.
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
President Bill Clinton announced two important and complementary agreements
today to enable better, more affordable treatments for patients on second-line
antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for HIV/AIDS in the developing world. For the first
time, a second-line regimen of four ARVs will be available for under $500
annually. Additionally, the cost of a key drug for treating tuberculosis (TB) in
patients using second-line ARVs has been reduced by 60 percent, to $1 per dose. 

"Thanks to the work of my Foundation`s HIV/AIDS Initiative, 2 million people
living with HIV/AIDS are now able to access lifesaving treatment," President
Clinton said. "But their continued survival depends on uninterrupted access to
medicines and quality and affordable health care throughout their entire life.
Today`s announcement will help ensure we can sustain treatment over a lifetime
and better treat patients with both HIV and TB, two key steps in turning the
tide of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic." 

Addressing the need for more affordable second-line ARVs, Mylan and Matrix, a
Mylan company, are making available all four drugs - atazanavir (ATV), ritonavir
(RTV), tenofovir (TDF), and lamivudine (3TC) - needed to enable once-daily
treatment of patients who have developed resistance to standard first-line ARVs.
The four drugs will be available in three pills, with tenofovir and lamivudine
combined into a single pill. The three pills are being made available today as
separate products, with a total price of less than $475 annually. Matrix also
will sell the pills together in one package - a "second-line-in-a-box" - at $425
annually starting in 2010. These new products and prices will be available to
governments that are members of the Clinton Foundation`s Procurement Consortium
across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. TDF+3TC is FDA approved,
and ATV and RTV are pending approval by the World Health Organization (WHO). 

Mylan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert J. Coury said, "Ensuring
sustainable access to effective treatments in the developing world is a critical
element in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. Mylan and Matrix are proud to
continue our commitment of creating and introducing innovative and affordable
pharmaceutical solutions. This includes our `second-line-in-a-box,` which will
reduce patient pill burden and facilitate patient compliance. Our affordable,
heat-stable version of ritonavir also represents another advance in the
development of products that can withstand environmental conditions in parts of
the world where treatment is desperately needed." 

Citing the importance of integrating HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis treatment,
President Clinton also announced an agreement with Pfizer to reduce the price
and expand the availability of rifabutin, a drug used to treat tuberculosis in
patients taking second-line ARVs. This marks CHAI`s first pricing agreement with
a research-based pharmaceutical company, as well as its first pricing agreement
on tuberculosis. Pfizer will sell the product at $1 per 150 mg dose, or $90 for
a full course of treatment over six months. This price will be available
throughout developing markets in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America,
the Middle East, and the Caribbean. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death
among HIV-positive patients. The WHO reports that over one-third of all
individuals living with HIV also are infected with tuberculosis, resulting in
over 450,000 deaths in 2007. 

Jeffrey B. Kindler, Chairman and CEO of Pfizer stated that, "Pfizer is pursuing
numerous global health projects like this one with the Clinton HIV/AIDS
Initiative to find new ways to connect people to the medicines they need. "We
are working on innovative solutions to bring health care to customers who have
often been neglected in the past and do this in a socially responsible,
sustainable, and commercially viable way." 

"Second-line-in-a-box"

The new Matrix product announced today will create a more convenient second-line
ARV treatment option. Patients will take three pills once a day instead of five
or more pills twice a day (i.e. at least three in the morning and at least two
in the evening) as required by alternative regimens. Additionally, the products
will include the first ever heat-stable version of ritonavir, which does not
require continuous refrigeration for its transport and distribution. 

Noting advantages in convenience and affordability, WHO has identified the
development of a second-line ARV therapy including atazanavir and ritonavir as a
top priority. However, until now, this regimen has been largely unavailable
since the existing ritonavir formulation required continuous refrigeration, a
major challenge for developing countries with limited infrastructure. Countries
have begun to adopt this regimen in national treatment guidelines in
anticipation of improved product features and pricing, and the Clinton
Foundation expects many more to follow suit to take advantage of the agreements
announced today. 

If fully adopted, the new products and prices would enable cumulative cost
savings of $400 million over the next 5 years, when compared with recent prices
paid for alternative regimens. Although only 3 percent of total patients on
treatment in low-income and sub-Saharan African countries are taking second-line
ARVs today, these patients account for nearly 20 percent of total ARV
expenditures because of the high cost of second-line drugs compared to
first-line drugs. These percentages will grow steadily in the coming years as
increasing numbers of HIV/AIDS patients experience first-line treatment failure.
There were between 200,000 and 250,000 second-line patients across the
developing world at the end of 2008. This number is expected to double over the
next three years. 

UNITAID helped to make the second-line ARV price reductions announced today
possible through its Second-Line Project, implemented by CHAI in partnership
with UNITAID. UNITAID funding for this project has created a reliable market for
key second-line medicines by increasing and aggregating demand across 25
beneficiary countries. Predictability of demand encourages suppliers to pursue
accelerated R on new products and enables them to offer lower prices by
achieving economies of scale and reducing production risks. 

Treating tuberculosis co-infection in second-line HIV/AIDS patients

The agreement with Pfizer enables a more effective and affordable treatment
option for second-line ARV patients who also require treatment for tuberculosis.
The treatment of HIV-tuberculosis co-infection is complicated by an undesirable
interaction between standard tuberculosis medicines and protease inhibitors -
the class of ARVs that represent the backbone of second-line treatment. To
counteract this effect, clinicians often adjust a patient`s ARV therapy to
increase the normal dose of certain drugs, producing higher levels of toxicity,
worse treatment outcomes, and significantly higher costs. Pfizer`s rifabutin
does not interfere with protease inhibitors, allowing patients to take ARVs at
normal doses. 

WHO highlighted the importance of rifabutin by adding it to the Essential
Medicines List (EML) in March 2009. The announcement with Pfizer today makes it
more affordable to treat TB and HIV simultaneously among patients on second-line
ARV therapy, cutting total drug costs by nearly $200 (or 33 percent) over a full
six-month course of TB treatment when compared to the most-preferred current
treatment option. 

Ongoing efforts to ensure the quality and affordability of treatment

The financial support of UNITAID, the United Kingdom Department for
International Development, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has enabled
the Clinton Foundation to pursue this work. The two agreements announced today
represent only the latest steps that the Clinton Foundation and its partners
have taken to ensure that the highest quality treatments are available at the
most affordable prices. 

These agreements reflect CHAI`s commitment to ensuring the availability of
high-quality drugs. Pfizer`s rifabutin is approved by the United States Food and
Drug Administration (U.S. FDA). Pfizer also is preparing to file with the WHO
Prequalification Programme. Matrix has received U.S. FDA approval for its
tenofovir/lamivudine combination pill. Matrix has filed dossiers for atazanavir
and heat-stable ritonavir with the WHO Prequalification Program and WHO Expert
Review Panel (ERP); dossier submissions include data establishing bioequivalence
to the reference drugs. Once approved by the WHO ERP, WHO Prequalification
Program, or U.S. FDA, products can be purchased by governments using funds from
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 6 (Reuters) - The new bull market in U.S.
stocks has begun and possibly started in March, Abby Joseph
Cohen, chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman
Sachs and Co, said on CNBC on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We do think the new bull market has begun," she said. "It
may prove it began in March of this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohen sees the Standard  Poor's 500 index .SPX at
between 1,050 and 1,100 toward the end of this year. She also
said it appears job losses are slowing but that she sees many
more months of "difficult labor situation ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch, Editing by Chizu

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades, removes from Rating Watch Negative, and revises Rating
Outlooks on 25 classes of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates from
J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2007-LDP10,
commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed list of rating actions
follows at the end of this press release. 

The downgrades are the result of loss expectations and reflect Fitch's
prospective views regarding commercial real estate market value and cash flow
declines. Fitch foresees potential losses could reach as high as 14.8% for this
transaction, should market conditions not recover. Today's rating actions are
based on losses of 8.4%, including 100% of the term losses and 25% of the losses
anticipated to occur at maturity; the 8.4% recognizes all of the losses
anticipated in the next five years. Given the uncertainty surrounding
macroeconomic conditions, commercial real estate fundamentals, interest rates,
liquidity and property performance, Fitch's actions today do not account for the
full magnitude of possible maturity losses. The bonds with Negative Outlooks
indicate classes that may be downgraded in the future should full potential
losses be realized. 

Fitch analyzed the transaction and calculated expected losses by assuming cash
flows on each of the properties decline 15% from year-end 2007 and property
values decline 35% from issuance. These loss estimates were reviewed in more
detail for 48.8% of the pool and, in certain cases, revised based on additional
information and/or property characteristics. 

The deal consists of two loan groups, Group R and Group S. Loans are grouped
according to whether they have a five to seven year maturities, or 10 year and
greater maturities. Principal proceeds, including unscheduled proceeds from
liquidations, are distributed according to their respective loan group: Group S
pays down the class S certificates and Group R pays down the certificates not
noted with an 'S.' Losses are allocated reverse sequentially, then pro rata to
each loan group's corresponding class. Fitch incorporated an analysis of the
structural features of this transaction, including the expected paydown of each
loan group with unscheduled principal proceeds based on projected losses, into
this review. 

Approximately 32.7% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as
follows: 5.8% in 2011, 15.8% in 2012, 7.2% in 2013, and 3.9% in 2014. All losses
associated with these loans are recognized in the rating actions. 

Fitch identified 67 Loans of Concern (35.9%) within the pool, 17 of which
(13.5%) are specially serviced (including one loan which will potentially be
transferred and is expected to become delinquent). Of the specially serviced
loans, six (7.7%) are current. Seven of the Fitch Loans of Concern (18.2%) are
within the transaction's top 15 loans (41.8%) by unpaid principal balance. 

Three of the Loans of Concern (6.5%) within the top 15 loans are expected to
default during the term, with loss severities ranging from 9% to 49%. The
largest contributors to loss are as follows: Solana (2.6% of the pool),
Outrigger Guam (1.9%), and the Orchard at Saddleback (1.9%). Solana consists of
1,793,290 square feet (sf) of office space, 43,685 sf of retail, a 38,000 sf
health club, and a full-service Marriott hotel. The property, located in
Westlake, TX, was built in 1988 and most recently renovated in 2006. The most
recent servicer reported debt service coverage ratio is 1.15 times (x) as of
June 2008. The loan, sponsored by Maguire Partners, transferred to the special
servicer in March 2009 for imminent default after a large tenant vacated a
portion of their space. The tenant continues to occupy 375,000 sq with their
lease expiration in 2011. Additionally, the borrower reported the Marriott hotel
within the complex is underperforming expectations. The special servicer is
discussing workout options with the borrower. Limited details are presently
available on the workout and current valuation of the asset due to the loan's
recent transfer to special servicing. 

The Outrigger Guam loan is secured by a full-service hotel consisting of
600-rooms and 37,215 sf of retail space in Tumon, Guam. The servicer reported
year-end debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 1.07x, as compared to the issuer
DSCR of 1.39x at origination. Occupancy was not reported. Based on current
performance and anticipated declines, losses are expected prior to the loan's
maturity. 

The Orchard at Saddleback is a two-phase community center located in Lake
Forest, Orange County, California. The property's third largest tenant, Shoe
Pavilion (23,000 sf, 8.3% NRA), filed for bankruptcy and liquidated in October
2008. One additional tenant filed for bankruptcy and two tenants have defaulted
on their leases. Additionally, nine tenants requested rent reduction ranges of
up to 50%. The loan will potentially be transferred to the special servicer and
is expected to become delinquent. Per the July remittance report, the servicer
advanced the loan's July debt service payment.

    NewMarket recently announced a ticker symbol change from NMKT to OTC:

Company's positive operating income for the previous three years and
revenue growth from approximately $78 million in 2006 to $95 million in

price to increase from the recent recapitalized price per share of $0.45
to $1.00 and as high as $2.50. The price per share potential is suggested
in conjunction with the presentation of the market capitalization values
of comparative public companies. The presentation includes an outlook on
the anticipated profitable revenue increase in 2009.

    The Webcast is now available for review on the Company's corporate

&lt;p&gt;Collegiate Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition to Create Thousands of Green
Automotive Engineering Graduates


WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge today announced that the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has joined the EcoCAR consortium of government, industry
and academic leaders who are helping to develop the next generation of
automotive engineers who will design and build the environmental vehicles of the
future. 

TheEcoCARcompetition, along with its headline sponsors - the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) and General Motors (GM), challenges 17 universities across the U.S.
and Canada to redesign and reengineer a 2009 Saturn VUE to further minimize fuel
consumption and reduce emissions. A joint effort among academic, government and
industry partners, EcoCARseeks to inspire the next generation of scientists and
engineers by giving them the tools and experience necessary to secure a more
energy-efficient future. 

EPA`s Office of Transportation and Air Quality will serve as a major sponsor of
the EcoCAR competition, providing technical advice and mentoring in the areas of
greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions. EPA will also conduct dynamometer
emissions testing on the competition vehicles at their National Vehicle and Fuel
Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 

"Developing clean, efficient vehicle technology is critical to our mission of
protecting public health and the environment" said Margo T. Oge, Director of the
Office of Transportation and Air Quality at EPA. "This competition brings
together government, industry and universities to reduce vehicle emissions,
while infusing young engineers with a passion for the environment." 

In addition to technical support, mentoring, and vehicle testing, EPA will
provide significant funding to support the non-profit program. The agency will
also play a major role in determining the winner of the competition, serving as
a judge in all three competition finals. The agency`s participation in the
EcoCAR competition strengthens the public and private partnership formed to
support the next generation of engineers striving to improve energy efficiency
and reduce greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions of vehicles. 

"This is an exciting day for EcoCAR and for the future of the next generation of
vehicle technologies," said Patrick B. Davis, Vehicle Technologies Program
Manager at the DOE. "As a platinum sponsor, the EPA will play a major role in
educating these student engineers about the importance of reducing greenhouse
gas and tailpipe emissions. Our partnership with EPA will help us todevelop and
nurture science and engineering talent with real-world training and experience,
allowing these engineering graduates to transition more rapidly into careers in
the green vehicle industry." 

"We are very pleased to further expand on the collaboration of industry,
government and academia that is core to this competition by welcoming the EPA as
a new sponsor," said Elizabeth A. Lowery, vice president, Environment, Energy
and Safety Policy at General Motors. "GM is committed to helping prepare the
next generation of automotive engineers to tackle some of the most pressing
issues the industry faces today, and with the EPA now on-board EcoCAR students
will gain an even better understanding of the real-world challenges of reducing
tailpipe emissions. This added support from the EPA will help pave the way for
these future engineers to drive their innovative designs out of the garage - and
onto the road."

&lt;p&gt;KANO, Nigeria Aug 6 (Reuters) - Nigeria's state of Kano on Thursday
withdrew its criminal case against U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) following
an out of court settlement over a 1996 meningitis drug trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ""I am happy I have come to the end of the matter by settling out of court.
What I did is to discontinue with the case," Aliyu Umar, the lead lawyer for the
state government, told reporters after a hearing in Kano.

  (Adds share reaction, analyst, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PARIS, Aug 6 (Reuters) - French biotech firm NicOx (NCOX.PA)
will buy back the rights to develop and market a drug that seeks
to treat eye disease glaucoma from U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N)
and said it was open to finding another partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Pfizer decided not to take PF-03187207 into final
Phase III clinical trials after a mid-stage study failed to meet
its main goal, denting NicOx shares. NicOx had been working on
developing eye drugs with Pfizer for over four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in NicOx, which did not disclose the financial
details of the deal, rose as much as 6.7 percent shortly after
the stock market opened on Thursday. They added 4.8 percent to
reach 9.94 euros by 0731 GMT, giving NicOx a value of 425
million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts said the agreement was to be expected, with
one Paris-based analyst calling NicOx shares "volatile".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "NicOx did not have much choice other than taking back the
product," one Paris-based analyst, who declined to be
identified, said. "It will not have cost them much and they
could find a partner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As well as PF-03187207, which has completed two mid-stage
tests in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular
hypertension, NicOx has won access to data on Pfizer's eye drug
Xalatan. Pfizer said the research and development programme was
no longer core to its strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, NicOx will regain rights to several new nitric
oxide-donating compounds seeking to treat diabetic retinopathy
and glaucoma, eye diseases which can cause blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will evaluate opportunities for advancing PF-03187207
into Phase III (clinical trials), including possible third-party
partnerships," Gavin Spencer, NicOx's vice president of business
development, said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases which can lead to the
loss of peripheral vision and eventually total blindness.
Diabetic retinopathy represents the most common cause of
blindness among adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NicOx is also looking for a partner to help it market its
experimental anti-inflammatory drug naproxcinod in the United
States but the biotech firm said in June completion of such
talks could face a delay [ID:nLI706981].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Caroline Jacobs; additional reporting by

Here are highlights from Thursday`sAnalyst Blog: 

"Cash for Clunkers" Continues

Not a complete answer to our dependency on imported oil, but not exactly a drop
in the bucket, either. If the second installment works just as well, we up to a
cumulative savings of 675 million gallons fewer of gasoline burned. 

This is in addition to the benefit of actually putting auto workers (and
suppliers) back to work, and car dealers being actually able to sell some cars
and keep their employees. As a result, some of the spending will come back to
the government in the form of the income taxes these workers pay. 

Keep in mind that it will also result in smaller losses at General Motors and
Chrysler, and we the taxpayers have rather substantial equity interests in those
firms. 

As a result of the program, Ford (NYSE: F) actually posted a year-over-year
increase in sales in July (2.2%) its first increase since 2007. Yes, three of
the top five models sold under the program were made by Toyota (NYSE: TM), but
two of those are built in America, as are the other two -- one from Honda (NYSE:
HMC) and the other from Ford. 

Traditionally, increased sales of durable goods like autos are one of the key
engines to power the economy out of a recession (housing is the other
traditional engine). The pick up in the sales rate to 11 million from down close
to 9 million is a very significant move. 

Granted, it is still well below the 16 million rate we were averaging a few
years ago, but it is highly unlikely we will get back to those levels for a
long, long time. The American consumer simply has far too much debt and needs to
rebuild his or her balance sheet. The option of tapping the equity in the house
to get a new SUV is simply no longer available. 

Still, relative to the rest of the money that has been thrown around trying to
stabilize the economy and the banking system, the $3 billion spent on the two
installments of the plan is chump change. It is, for example, only 25% of what
passed through American International Group (NYSE: AIG) to pay in full the
credit default swaps of Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS).

Here are highlights from Thursday`sAnalyst Blog: 

CRM Focuses on Healthcare

Healthcare provides a good business opportunity to information technology
companies, a fact reinforced by Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM). The company is
investing in Practice Fusion, which is involved in the business of electronic
health records, health policy, health information technology and consumer
medical data topics. Salesforce.com will invest around $10.0 million for a
marginal stake in the company, which will generate around $1.0 million of
revenue a year for the company. 

The cloud computing model introduced by Salesforce.com, uses online software
solutions created by it. We believe that the advantages of the model are
particularly applicable to the company`s clientele. In addition to the
user-friendly interface, cloud computing typically lowers IT staff requirements.
So medical practitioners and other professionals who prefer to manage the system
on their own will find it particularly useful. 

Under the new agreement, Practice Fusion`s EMR (electronic medical records
product line) will be combined with Salesforce.com`s cloud computing system to
enhance value for customers. We think the deal comes at an opportune moment
because the federal government passed a bill earlier this year, including around
$30.0 billion in incentives to medical practitioners and hospitals for buying
and using electronic record keeping software. We believe this is likely to
generate additional business for companies such as Salesforce.com, as most
doctors currently use hard copies of medical records. 

Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) is also trying to enter this segment, through collaboration
with Dell Inc. (Nasdaq: DELL). Other big companies such as Google Inc. (Nasdaq:
GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT) have launched personal health
records storage systems, which are helping patients to store their own health
data. We believe electronic health records provide significant business
opportunities, as healthcare professionals are increasingly adopting the concept
of a paperless office and recognizing the benefits. We believe that growth in
this segment is inevitable, as electronic records becoming accessible from
anywhere and at any time makes life easy for both doctors and patients.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with regulatory filings)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 7 (Reuters) - A power surge at Exxon Mobil
Corp's (XOM.N) refining complex in Baytown, Texas, on Thursday
caused the partial shutdown and restart of several units,
including a gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit,
according to notices the company filed Friday with Texas
pollution regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Exxon Baytown refinery is the nation's largest at
572,500 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Feed rates to units at the refinery were cut due to the
power surge on a line operated by a third-party provider. The
surge also triggered a fire in a piperack at the chemical
plant, according to a trade source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the three filings covering the refinery, chemical plant
and olefins plant at the Baytown complex, Exxon notes "no
impact to production and all customer needs are being met."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon was continuing to restore normal operations at the
refinery, according to an Exxon spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fire was quickly extinguished, according to the Baytown
fire department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One worker sustained a minor shoulder injury in the
incident.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Chemical Safety Board
said on Friday four investigators would go to Exxon Mobil
Corp's (XOM.N) Joliet, Illinois, refinery to probe a
hydrofluoric acid release that critically injured a worker on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokesman said the company had no comment about
the CSB's decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investigations into the cause of the accident are
ongoing," said Exxon spokesman Kevin Allexon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A propane leak at about 12:30 p.m. CDT (1730 GMT) Thursday
on an alkylation unit at the 238,600 barrel per day (bpd)
Joliet refinery led to the hydrofluoric acid release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four investigators currently probing a July 19 alkylation
unit fire at Citgo Petroleum Corp's Corpus Christi, Texas,
refinery, which also released hydrofluoric acid, will examine
the Joliet refinery event, said board spokesman Daniel
Horowitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a general concern that there have been a number of
these alkylation unit accidents," Horowitz said. "Any time
hydrofluoric acid is released, it's a cause for concern."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hydrofluoric acid can cause severe burns and extreme heart,
lung and bone damage in humans.

&lt;p&gt;Commissioners Only Think of Political Platforms When Speaking of Height Reform
FREEPORT, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Planned for August 11, during the next scheduled Walton County Board of County
Commissioner`s meeting, is the final ruling and vote on a county wide Ordinance
which amends the Walton County Land Development Code to establish a Height
Limitation for all of Walton County. This Height Ordinance not only impacts
values of current land owned by taxpayers of Walton County, but also stifles
future growth of the county in that it will impede proper densities and
intensities of useable lands throughout the county. Pressured by the Board`s own
political powers, most county residents do not want or do not understand what is
in front of them with this ordinance on August 11. 

Walton County is currently suffering from the highest unemployment rate and the
highest foreclosure rates it has ever seen. Instead of the Walton County
Commissioners promoting new ideas, better planning methods, and economic
development as other neighboring counties such as Bay, Holmes, Washington,
Okaloosa and Santa Rosa are doing, Walton County Commissioners continue to
stifle growth and prosperity and to encumber property rights of those taxpayers
who own land in Walton County - all for personal gain and recognition. Clearly,
planners throughout Northwest Florida have recommended in light of the
population growth projections stated in the Emerald Coast Sustainable economic
report, that going vertical to preserve natural resources and prevent urban
sprawl is the only option that counties within Northwest Florida should
consider. Walton County Commissioners are doing the opposite with approving this
new Height Ordinance. 

One such example of County Commissioner`s stifling growth is the voting down of
a proposed project that would have stimulated economic growth in north Walton
County. Jolly Bay proposed to use its authorized residential units, but to limit
development to just 12 acres of its 60-acre site in order to preserve wetlands
and provide for open space by going vertical with a 12-story condominium that
was designed to be located on the property in a location as much as &#188; mile away
from neighboring residences. The upper floors could have been sold for higher
prices, which would have added more to the tax base of Walton County which would
have benefited all taxpayers. Although the county planners testified that the
proposed 12 story condominium was compatible with and did not impact surrounding
properties due to its setback location on the property, the county planners felt
constrained by what they perceived to be a desire by the Board to limit height
regardless of whether the condominium impacted surrounding properties. 

By moving forward with the height ordinance that sets a maximum height of 75
feet for residential buildings that, like Jolly Bay, can provide for greater
setbacks, the County is arbitrarily restricting the ability of property owners
to develop authorized residential units in a site sensitive context for no
purpose. As Jolly Bay demonstrated and County staff testified, a 147-foot
condominium in North Walton County can be designed to be compatible and not
impact surrounding properties. 

The proposed Height Ordinance is unnecessary, over-regulation that will only
serve to worsen the situation that Walton County residents are faced with in
this difficult economy, and will expose Walton County and its taxpayers to
litigation for which the County has no insurance coverage. The Commissioners are
not properly focusing on economic development and solutions that will help with
the rising unemployment, as illustrated by the following dialog between
Commissioner Brannon and a Walton County Taxpayer Wayland Davis at a recent
County Commissioner hearing:

         COMMISSIONER BRANNON: It's my opinion that the people of this county, in my opinion, would rather him go somewhere else and build the 250-foot building.                                                                                                                                                                        
         MR. DAVIS: That's a nasty comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
         COMMISSIONER BRANNON: Is it a nasty comment? That's my opinion, Mr. Davis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
         MR. DAVIS: You know why I say that? We've got people walking the streets looking for jobs. If one project like the Jolly Bay had a come through, we would have had a 1.6 million dollar labor cost that would have went in somebody's family. And I don't say send them anywhere. That's a foolish thing to say, Commissioner.  
         COMMISSIONER BRANNON: Well, that's a matter of my opinion. My point is it's important for the citizens of this county, in my opinion, which I'm elected to convey that opinion, that a height restriction is important to them. Now, if I'm wrong, you tell me I'm wrong in election.                                           


The Walton County Commissioners are scheduled to have their final vote on this
height ordinance on August 11th at 5 p.m. at 31 Coastal Centre Boulevard, South
Walton Courthouse Annex, Santa Rosa Beach, FL. The Commissioners are attempting
to close the matter from public comment. The public should attend and taxpayers
should air their comments.

&lt;p&gt;Disney Hotel Workers Pledge to Continue Fight to Keep Health Care Affordable


ANAHEIM, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
A majority of Disney hotel workers voted to reject Disney`s most recent contract
proposal that would have made health insurance largely unaffordable for many of
the workers employed at the three Disney owned hotels. The final count in
yesterday`s vote was 1,076 votes to reject Disney`s latest contract proposal to
86 votes in favor of the contract proposal. 2,100 Disney hotel workers employed
as restaurant servers, dishwashers, housekeepers, front desk agents, and bellmen
at the three Disneyland Hotels, Paradise Pier Hotel, Disneyland Hotel, and Grand
California Hotel, have been working without a union contract since February
2008. In their latest contract offer Disney proposed to increasingly shift the
cost of health insurance to its employees and create a new "casual regular"
status for employees who average less than 30 hours a week. "Casual regular"
workers would be ineligible for health insurance benefits. 

The crux of the labor dispute is Disney`s proposals to increase costs and raise
eligibility requirements for their employees` health care. The company`s
proposal would make it so that by 2014 hotel workers could have to pay up to
$520 a month for family health coverage based on the Disney Signature Kaiser
Plan. Disney`s proposal would produce substantial hardship for Disney hotel
workers. Many of these workers and their families would no longer be able to
afford the cost of Disney`s health insurance and may be left uninsured. 

Juan Ruiz, a restaurant server who makes the state minimum wage plus tips at
Disney`s Grand California Hotel is one of the workers who might be left without
health insurance under Disney`s latest contract proposal. "I voted to reject
Disney`s contract proposal and pledge to continue fighting for affordable health
insurance. I have two daughters, ages 8 and 5 years, and I am the sole provider
for my family. If we have to pay for our health insurance, I will be forced to
choose between paying my mortgage or paying for my family`s health insurance,"
said Ruiz. 

In their continuing fight for a fair and just union contract, Disney hotel
workers, faith leaders, and community members have taken part in marches,
delegations to management, and a protest which shut down the main entrance into
Disneyland Park that resulted in dozens of arrests last year. A couple of weeks
ago, approximately 1,500 delegates to the Episcopal National Convention and
hotel workers marched to Disneyland to deliver over a thousand pledges from
delegates who promised to not return to the hotels if the workers called for a
boycott. As of yet a boycott has not been called, but workers are preparing for
the possibility in their ongoing fight for affordable health insurance.

&lt;p&gt; * Test well located near Cabinda coastline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Well flows at 11.6 mln cf of gas, 2,550 bpd oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron shares dip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds background on Angola, share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on
Friday it made an oil and natural gas discovery near the
Cabinda coast of Angola, expanding its portfolio in the West
African nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which pumps more than 500,000 barrels of oil per
day from Angola, said the discovery, in Block 0, was drilled in
March in 397 feet (120 meters) of water to a total vertical
depth of 13,000 feet (3965 meters). It encountered over 225
feet of net hydrocarbon pay in the Upper Pinda formation,
Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the 79-3XST1 discovery well had a flow rate of 11.6
million cubic feet of natural gas and 2,550 barrels of liquid
hydrocarbons per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, through its local affiliate Cabinda Gulf Oil Co
Ltd (CABGOC), has a 39.2 percent interest and is the operator
of the Block 0 contractor group. Angolan state oil company
Sonangol has a 41 percent stake, and affiliates of France's
Total SA (TOTF.PA) and Italy's ENI SpA (ENI.MI) have 10 percent
and 9.8 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Chevron said CABGOC had begun production at the
Mafumerira Norte project ahead of schedule in the same
production block. That project will eventually consist of 14
wells and reach a total production of 30,000 barrels per day of
crude and 30 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is also drilling in the Banzala Field in the block,
as well as the Nemba and Kokongo fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Ramon, California-based company is also 31 percent
owner and the operator of a deepwater concession which produced
a total of 168,000 barrels of crude liquids last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is expecting first oil from its Tombua-Landana
development in Angola in the third quarter, and is also
drilling at fields in the Benguela Belize-Lobito Tomboco
project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Chevron dipped 5 cents to $69.20 per share in
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  SCHAUMBURG, IL, Aug 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Acresso Software, the leading provider of licensing, entitlement,
installation, and application readiness software, today released the
results of an exclusive benchmark study, "AdminStudio: Accelerating App-V
Package Creation Up to 88 percent Faster than Traditional Methods,"
demonstrating that enterprise IT organizations who use the Acresso
AdminStudio application readiness solution can dramatically slash prep
time when readying applications for deployment with Microsoft App-V. The
exclusive study focused on the most challenging part of an application
virtualization implementation, the migration of applications from
traditional formats to an App-V ready format, and compared the preparation
time using traditional methods versus using AdminStudio. In all cases,
AdminStudio proved to be the faster option than the native method, the
App-V Sequencer. For full survey results: click here.

    Moving to App-V can prove particularly challenging to enterprises because,
until now, application administrators have had no alternatives to
time-intensive native methods of application preparation. The study
demonstrates that AdminStudio wins across all testing categories.


--  Slashed by over 88percent the time required to convert MSIs in batch
    using AdminStudio versus App-V Sequencer.
--  Reduced average time required to convert MSIs by 85 percent
--  Reduced average time required to convert all applications by 69
    percent.
--  Decreased time to convert a group of applications from 1 hour and 23
    minutes using traditional methods to less than 10 minutes using
    AdminStudio.
    

    
The benchmark study concludes that AdminStudio can improve application
virtualization adoption by lowering the cost and complexity of adopting
App-V virtualization technology whether administrators are experienced
with MSI packaging or they are first time users.

&lt;p&gt;Find Demonstrates Chevron`s Ongoing Exploration Success in Prolific Block 0
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) announced today that its affiliate, Cabinda Gulf
Oil Company Limited (CABGOC) and its partners, had made a successful discovery
in Block 0 located adjacent to the Cabinda coastline in Angola. 

The 79-3XST1 discovery well, drilled in March 2009 in 397 feet (120 meters) of
water to a total vertical depth of 13,000 feet (3965 meters), encountered over
225 feet of net hydrocarbon pay in the Upper Pinda formation. The well was
tested from a single 150 ft. perforated interval and flowed at a rate of 11.6
million cubic feet of natural gas and 2,550 barrels of liquid hydrocarbons per
day. 

"This discovery further demonstrates the success of Chevron`s focused
exploration program in growing our resource base. Our strong record of
exploration discoveries in West Africa provides Chevron opportunities to
successfully move energy resources forward from exploration to development to
production," said George Kirkland, executive vice president, Global Upstream and
Gas. 

"Chevron is pleased with the discovery, and we look forward to continuing the
work needed to further evaluate the find and potential development options,"
said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and Latin America Exploration and
Production Company. 

The discovery extends a trend of undeveloped natural gas condensate and crude
oil discoveries in the Greater Vanza Longui Area that are currently undergoing
appraisal. 

Chevron, through CABGOC, has a 39.2 percent interest and is the operator of the
Block 0 contractor group, which also includes SONANGOL E.P. (41 percent), Total
E (10 percent) and ENI Angola Production B.V. (9.8 percent). 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese company that offers a rival suite to Microsoft Office is following industry trends by turning its software into a Web-based service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evermore Software, based in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi, has for years offered a software suite that looks very similar to Microsoft Office but costs less. Now the company sees its rivals moving online, and it is designing a Web version of its suite to compete with the likes of Google Docs and Microsoft's upcoming Office Web apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone is searching for what form the online office should take, including Microsoft," Wang Yuanbing, vice president of Evermore, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evermore has long offered a desktop version of its Java-based suite, Evermore Integrated Office. Icons and functions resemble those in Microsoft Office, but the program opens its equivalents of Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint all in one window, rather than as separate applications. Users can tab between the sections, link parts of their content together and save documents in all of the sections as one joint file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company recently added a Web-based Chinese-English dictionary as a toolbar in its desktop program, said Rong Mingjun, an Evermore spokesman. More Web-based content, such as other user tools or ads, could feed into the program later, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evermore is little-known outside China. But over 20 million users have downloaded the personal version of Evermore Integrated Office, and state-owned enterprises and government offices around China use the business version, said Rong. The suite, which runs on Windows and Linux, has some users in the U.S. and other countries but is focused on China so far, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WebOffice, a Web-based version of Evermore's suite, will keep its Microsoft Office style but run in Internet Explorer or Firefox. Like Google Docs, the application stores a user's work on a remote server that can be accessed by logging in from any computer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the work on WebOffice is already done. The Web-based suite has already been announced and is currently undergoing final testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evermore will also offer an intranet version of WebOffice that runs on a company's internal servers and can be linked into other office software, such as Lotus Notes. An initial server version could be released this month, Rong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evermore has not announced pricing for WebOffice, but it sells the enterprise version of its latest offline suite for just below 1,200 yuan (US$176). The basic, personal version of the software is free. By comparison, Microsoft Office Standard 2007 costs about $400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evermore's combination of applications into one window should make its product appeal to businesses, but the company needs to do more marketing to attract private sector users, said Emily Bian [cq], a senior analyst at IDC China.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their product is actually pretty attractive," said Bian. "For now they need to strengthen their branding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evermore, Microsoft and others could benefit by offering Web-based versions of their software in China, she said. Rampant use of pirated programs in Chinese homes and offices cuts into revenue for software makers in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than charging license fees for their programs, software makers can offer them for free online and bring in revenue from ads or from user fees for value-added services, said Bian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even Evermore agreed it faces stiff competition from Microsoft Office, which dominates the global market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe we will maintain some competitive strengths relative to Microsoft," Rong said. "Of course, having an edge in technology is not the same as an edge in the market."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DETROIT (Reuters) - IBM is pushing ahead into providing technology services to manage water, a market $10 billion market that the company sees growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This to me is an area that's really going to explode in the next three to five years," said Sharon Nunes, who heads IBM's Big Green Innovations initiative. "People see it as a gap. The water market is transforming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Green Innovations, a play on IBM's nickname Big Blue, is part of IBM's so-called 'smarter planet' initiative that aims to apply information technology to efficiently manage electrical grids, transportation systems and other infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are actually looking at three different markets -- industrial sector, for example food and beverage companies ..., local and municipal governments, water utilities," said Sharon Nunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her group looks at business opportunities in sectors such as water, carbon management, solar technology and desalination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in discussions with a lot of food and beverage companies and some of the industrial processing companies," Nunes said, referring to new water management contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is also in talks with "a lot of utilities," she added but declined to give details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government stimulus in the water sector China and the United States, estimated at around $10 billion to $15 billion, will help establish the market for water management, Nunes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments, investors and human rights activists all see managing fresh water as key challenge in the coming decade. Billions of people already lack access to clean water and development and climate change are expected to disrupt the supply of fresh water even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM estimates leaks account for up to 60 percent of water supplied, costing water utilities worldwide $14 billion every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing water resources would include monitoring rivers, water reservoirs and pipes. IBM also provides systems for managing water infrastructure, such as levee oversight and flood control, Nunes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology company, whose products range from servers and software to consulting services, currently has a commercial deal underway with the Beacon Institute for Rivers and Estuaries in New York to build a monitoring and forecasting network for the Hudson River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, IBM is working with researchers to monitor wave conditions and pollution levels in Galway Bay, Ireland, and is putting together smart water meters in Malta in cooperation with the utilities there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's flood management and control system is getting a lot of attention from flood-prone countries in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing some initial inquiries from a lot of smaller Asian countries," Nunes said. "In areas where there is government stimulus packages, there's been a lot of outreach from some of the companies to IBM."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Poornima Gupta; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects to clarify details on AIG payouts to Goldman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By David Lawder and Jessica Wohl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/CHICAGO Aug 8 (Reuters) - Former U.S. Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson talked often to the head of Goldman
Sachs at the height of the credit crisis but did not actively
seek to help the bank he once ran, a spokeswoman for Paulson
said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Times on Saturday reported records of two
dozen conversations between Paulson and Goldman chief executive
Lloyd Blankfein the same week last September that rival bank
Lehman Brothers collapsed and insurer American International
Group (AIG.N) -- closely connected to Goldman -- was rescued
with public funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was a major beneficiary of the AIG bailout,
receiving nearly $13 billion in counterparty payments
ultimately funded by taxpayers, according to AIG disclosures in
March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company insists that it was fully collateralized and
hedged against those positions in the event of an AIG failure,
so it had no material economic exposure to the bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paulson's spokeswoman Michele Davis confirmed the telephone
conversations with Blankfein took place but denied Paulson had
any intention of helping Goldman specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Suggesting that AIG was saved for the sake of one firm is
as ridiculous as saying firemen put out a fire in a skyscraper
to protect just one of the thousands of people in the
building," Davis said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has come under fire from some lawmakers and public
interest groups for its government connections, seemingly
sailing through a deep recession shortly after accepting $10
billion of taxpayer bailout money and benefiting from a host of
other government programs, including access to the U.S. Federal
Reserve's borrowing window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PAULSON ON SIDELINES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paulson asked Treasury and White House lawyers for a waiver
from an ethics ban on contacting his former firm, as officials
feared that Wall Street was facing a total collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Times said the waiver was granted on Sept. 17, the day
after the AIG bailout was announced and the day after he
received a phone call from Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Following Lehman's failure and the acquisition of Merrill
Lynch (by Bank of America) that prevented its failure,
officials feared the same crisis of confidence might spread to
the remaining investment banks, Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs," Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Morgan Stanley were to fail, Secretary Paulson and the
other regulators believed that Goldman Sachs, as the last
remaining investment bank, might fail as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the government needed to intervene on Goldman, Paulson
"needed to be able to actively engage in finding a solution,"
she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sept. 16-21 telephone records, which the Times said it
obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request, showed
that Paulson spoke much more frequently with Blankfein than he
did other Wall Street executives during a week in which the
world stood on the brink of financial collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He spoke with John Mack, CEO of Morgan Stanley, which was
in a more tenuous situation, 12 times over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paulson and Blankfein spoke three times before the waivers
were granted and five times on Sept. 17, the New York Times
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paulson spent 32 years at Goldman Sachs and preceded
Blankfein as CEO before becoming Treasury secretary in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The records also show frequent phone calls with Timothy
Geithner, the current Treasury secretary who was head of the
New York Federal Reserve, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, and
congressional leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Davis said the volume of calls to Blankfein reflected in
part the need to keep abreast of market developments such as
frozen money market mutual funds and address a "crisis of
confidence" in the remaining investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman told the New York Times that Blankfein
spoke with the Paulson about Lehman Brothers' troubled London
operations and "disarray in the money markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a July 16 congressional hearing, lawmakers angrily asked
Paulson to explain changes in U.S. policy during the crisis and
said he had conflicts of interest in decisions involving Wall
Street firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I operated very consistently within the ethics guidelines
I had," Paulson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Glenn Somerville; Editing by Eric

&lt;p&gt;Publicis will issue 6.5 million treasury shares to the software giant, worth 162 million euros ($232.6 million) at Friday's closing price, and pay the rest in cash from its ample liquidity position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two firms, which concluded a cooperation deal in June, also signed a strategic alliance agreement to deepen their ties in digital advertising while Microsoft uses Bing as its battleship in the search engine war with Google Inc..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicis is already the number one in digital advertising and Razorfish was number two in the single advertising sector that still shows growth rates despite the economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group, based in Paris, beat Britain's WPP Plc and Japan's Dentsu Inc. in the final bidding from an original field of some eight parties interested in the Microsoft unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The price paid was the result of an auction process," Publicis chief executive Maurice Levy told reporters on a telephone conference from the south of France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the transaction valued Razorfish at some 1.4 to 1.5 times the revenues, which he called in line with sector deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added Publicis did not plan any more acquisition of this size in the sector, but would look at any opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any of these deals would be smaller-sized acquisitions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At end June, Publicis had 3.5 billion euros in liquidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction means that Publicis will generate 25 percent of its sales from the digital sector, up from 21 percent at the half-year stage, a figure Levy originally targeted for end-2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicis is the world's third-largest advertising group with ad agencies such as Leo Burnett, Saatchi  Saatchi, media buyers Starcom MediaVest Group and ZenithOptimedia while in digital advertising it owns Digitas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Razorfish was founded in 1995 and became part of Microsoft in 2007 as part of the $6 billion aQuantive acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its clients include Best Buy, Ford, McDonald's, Microsoft and Starwood Hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICROSOFT REMAINS BIGGEST CLIENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the biggest client and under the agreement Razorfish will remain the preferred provider while Microsoft will spend a minimum amount for services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is part of a wider five-year agreement in which Publicis buys display and search advertising from Microsoft at attractive terms in return for minimum guaranteed purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicis has a pact with Google since January 2008 and Levy said the two alliances would work side by side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Publicis shares the French group will transfer to Microsoft will be valued at the average share price of 20 trading days before the closing of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will give the Redmond-based software group a stake of some three percent in Publicis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its biggest holder is the founding Bluestein-Blanchet family of chairwoman Elisabeth Badinter with 15.5 percent, followed by Dentsu with a stake of 14.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicis has a market value of 4.88 billion euros while the market leader by revenues, WPP, has a market value of 5.86 billion pounds ($9.82 billion).

&lt;p&gt; * Publicis to buy Razorfish in $530 million deal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * To pay Microsoft 6.5 mln shares and rest in cash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Will boost Publicis position in digital communications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * WPP and Dentsu were also in final bidding round
By Marcel Michelson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PARIS, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Publicis (PUBP.PA) struck a $530
million deal with Microsoft (MSFT.O) to buy the Razorfish ad
agency and boost its position in digital communications, the
world's third-largest communications group said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicis will issue 6.5 million treasury shares to the
software giant, worth 162 million euros ($232.6 million) at
Friday's closing price, and pay the rest in cash from its ample
liquidity position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two firms, which concluded a cooperation deal in June,
also signed a strategic alliance agreement to deepen their ties
in digital advertising while Microsoft uses Bing as its
battleship in the search engine war with Google Inc. (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Publicis is already the number one in digital advertising
and Razorfish was number two in the single advertising sector
that still shows growth rates despite the economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group, based in Paris, beat Britain's WPP Plc (WPP.L)
and Japan's Dentsu Inc. (4324.T) in the final bidding from an
original field of some eight parties interested in the Microsoft
unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The price paid was the result of an auction process,"
Publicis chief executive Maurice Levy told reporters on a
telephone conference from the south of France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the transaction valued Razorfish at some 1.4 to 1.5
times the revenues, which he called in line with sector deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added Publicis did not plan any more acquisition of this
size in the sector, but would look at any opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any of these deals would be smaller-sized acquisitions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At end June, Publicis had 3.5 billion euros in liquidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The transaction means that Publicis will generate 25 percent
of its sales from the digital sector, up from 21 percent at the
half-year stage, a figure Levy originally targeted for end-2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Publicis is the world's third-largest advertising group with
ad agencies such as Leo Burnett, Saatchi  Saatchi, media buyers
Starcom MediaVest Group and ZenithOptimedia while in digital
advertising it owns Digitas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Razorfish was founded in 1995 and became part of Microsoft
in 2007 as part of the $6 billion aQuantive acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its clients include Best Buy (BBY.N), Ford (F.N), McDonald's
(MCD.N), Microsoft and Starwood Hotels (HOT.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICROSOFT REMAINS BIGGEST CLIENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is the biggest client and under the agreement
Razorfish will remain the preferred provider while Microsoft
will spend a minimum amount for services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is part of a wider five-year agreement in which
Publicis buys display and search advertising from Microsoft at
attractive terms in return for minimum guaranteed purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Publicis has a pact with Google since January 2008 and Levy
said the two alliances would work side by side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Publicis shares the French group will transfer to
Microsoft will be valued at the average share price of 20
trading days before the closing of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will give the Redmond-based software group a stake of
some three percent in Publicis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its biggest holder is the founding Bluestein-Blanchet family
of chairwoman Elisabeth Badinter with 15.5 percent, followed by
Dentsu with a stake of 14.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Publicis has a market value of 4.88 billion euros while the
market leader by revenues, WPP, has a market value of 5.86
billion pounds ($9.82 billion). World number two Omnicom Group

&lt;p&gt;Transaction Positions Publicis Groupe as the Global Leader in Digital
Communications
PARIS &amp; REDMOND, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News: 

Publicis Groupe SA (Paris:PUB) (Euronext Paris: FR0000130577) and Microsoft
Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) jointly announced today that they have signed an
agreement under which Publicis Groupe will acquire Razorfish, a leading digital
marketing agency, in a transaction valued at approximately $530 million,
expected to be provided in a combination of cash and Publicis Groupe treasury
shares. In addition, the parties announced they have signed a Strategic Alliance
Agreement that will become effective at the closing of the transaction. 

"The acquisition of Razorfish is another step forward in realizing our strategic
vision of building a world leader in digital communications, a critically
important space for our clients," said Maurice L&#233;vy, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Publicis Groupe."More than anything, this acquisition
should demonstrate that Publicis Groupe now presents a wider pool of resources,
talent, and expertise that will help our clients market their products or
services in a way that takes maximum advantage of the new digital world.Our
capabilities will be further enhanced by the great talent throughout Razorfish,
and we are happy to welcome this new addition to our family." 

"Razorfish is known for extraordinary digital customer experiences and brings
with it a robust suite of tools that will enhance the current portfolio of
capabilities we are building to keep our clients connected to people in an
increasingly digital world," added Mr. L&#233;vy."The combination of Razorfish`s
assets with the complementary expertise we already possess will be highly
valuable to our clients and shareholders." 

Mr. L&#233;vy concluded, "When we complete this transaction, approximately a quarter
of our annual revenues will come from digital communications, and we believe we
have more capacity to grow with new clients. Equally important, we are very
pleased that as a consequence of this transaction, we are building upon the
strategic relationship with Microsoft that we announced in June to explore ways
to work together to help deliver innovative on-line solutions to a broad
spectrum of brand marketers." 

Steve Ballmer, Microsoft`s Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are grateful for
the contributions Razorfish has made to our online advertising business since
joining the company as a part of the aQuantive acquisition in 2007, and are
pleased that they have found a new long-term home with Publicis Groupe. We look
forward to continuing to work with Razorfish as one of our agencies, and we`re
confident that as a part of Publicis Groupe, Razorfish will build on its success
to date in the digital advertising industry." 

Razorfish will continue to operate under its brand name and be organizationally
part of VivaKi, the new Publicis Groupe entity created in June 2008 to leverage
the combined scale of the autonomous operations of Digitas, Starcom MediaVest
Group, Denuo, and ZenithOptimedia. Major clients of Razorfish include Best Buy,
Ford, McDonald`s, Microsoft, and Starwood Hotels. 

David Kenny, Managing Director of VivaKi, said, "We pursued this acquisition
based on its potential to deliver client benefit.The addition of Razorfish to
the VivaKi portfolio gives us a wider and more diverse platform of capabilities
which will convert to optimal service offerings and other opportunities for our
clients. Moreover, in collaboration with Microsoft, we will be able to develop
and provide our clients exclusive, first mover access to new opportunities,
programs, content, inventory and experiences." 

The Strategic Alliance Agreement builds upon and expands the broad strategic
cooperation agreement announced in June between Microsoft and Publicis Groupe.
The agreement helps Publicis Groupe media clients by allowing their agencies to
purchase display and search advertising from Microsoft over the five-year term
of the agreement on favorable terms, in exchange for certain minimum guaranteed
aggregate purchase levels. The agreement also provides that Razorfish will
continue to be a preferred provider to Microsoft for digital strategy, creative
and experiential marketing services, and contains a commitment by Microsoft to
spend a minimum amount for those services each year during the term of the
agreement. 

Razorfish`s management team, led by Chief Executive Officer Bob Lord, will
remain unchanged. Mr. Lord said, "Publicis Groupe offers an ideal technological
and cultural match for Razorfish and the opportunity to share a wealth of new
resources with our clients. Our capabilities in technology are highly compatible
with Publicis Groupe`s online advertising operations and will accelerate
Razorfish`s mission to expand its global reach and broaden its services. Working
closely with the other great companies in the Publicis Groupe/VivaKi portfolio,
we will be able to grow our talent and provide additional opportunities for
professional development and extend our capabilities for clients." 

The total consideration is expected to be paid in a combination of cash and
delivery of 6.5 million Publicis Groupe treasury shares. The cash component of
the purchase price will be determined based on the value attributed to the
shares calculated by the average closing price of Publicis Groupe stock during
the 20-trading-day period ending on the eighth business day prior to the closing
date of the transaction. 

The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2009, and is
subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the United
States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

&lt;p&gt;Two Microsoft employees have created an online suggestion box where users can submit feature or fix requests for Office, the company's popular productivity suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MakeOfficeBetter.com, an unsanctioned suggestion solicitation site, was created by Steve Zaske, a planner on the Office development team, and Luke Foust, a Microsoft developer in the test group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you've got a new feature idea or an idea on how to improve Microsoft Office, please share it here," said Zaske and Foust in a debut message on the site. "[And] vote on other ideas you agree with. Through the magic of crowd-sourcing, the best ideas should rise to the top."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zaske and Foust acknowledged the MakeOfficeBetter was not an official company effort, but said they would "do our best to get the ideas posted here in front of the right people within the Office development team."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 3:30 p.m. ET Monday, the top-ranked suggestion was "Improve the HTML support in Outlook," while the No. 2 and No. 3 spots were occupied by "Synchronize Outlook Notes and Tasks" and "Detach Outlook UI from the network thread(s)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HTML improvement suggestion points to fixOutlook.org, a site that protests Microsoft's use of the Word rendering engine -- rather than Internet Explorer's -- to display HTML in Outlook e-mails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site, which calls on users to fire off tweets expressing their dislike of Word's engine, sparked a reaction from William Kennedy, a Microsoft executive who runs the Office communications and forms team, and prompted debate about whether Microsoft's decision was a result of legitimate security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it's committed to using the Word engine to render HTML in Outlook in Office 2010, the suite's next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zaske and Foust didn't spell out whether the suggestions would be taken to heart for Office 2010, or only for versions that follow. Microsoft launched an invite-only technical preview program for Office 2010 a month ago, and so may have locked down most, if not all, features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before Microsoft handed out early copies of Office 2010, builds leaked to file-sharing sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few of the suggestions now listed on MakeOfficeBetter are for Office Web, the for-free scaled-down versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote that will debut at the same time Office 2010 launches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not yet pegged a ship date for Office 2010, and has said only that it's planning on delivering the suite sometime in the first half of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc will have to give up its personnel information on a former employee accused of stealing trade secrets, after a U.S. judge on Monday denied the firm's motion to quash a request by the computer programmer's lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firm must provide the lawyer with documents from the personnel file of its former programer Sergey Aleynikov, who faces criminal charges of stealing Goldman code used in trading, Judge Paul Crotty ordered in Manhattan federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawyer subpoenaed Goldman for the file last week and the firm submitted a motion to quash the request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crotty ordered Goldman to provide documents including Aleynikov's job application, interview, job offer letter, performance reviews, progress reports and any training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov is free on $750,000 bail. He was detained for several days following his arrest by the FBI at Newark Liberty International Airport on the night of July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was charged in a criminal complaint of stealing code used for trading from Goldman. The government said he downloaded the code onto a home computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has not been indicted and court documents show his lawyer and U.S. prosecutors are in talks "on a possible resolution of the case" -- a legal term that often, but not always, indicates a defendant may plead guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a court hearing on Thursday, Goldman lawyer Matthew Friedrich argued that the request may not be allowed under pretrial rules. Aleynikov's lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, said she wanted to show U.S. prosecutors her client was not fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They just may be under a false impression," Shroff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawyer has said Aleynikov was not guilty and there was no harm to Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, 39, worked at Goldman in New York for two years before joining Teza Technologies, a Chicago firm, in June. Teza suspended him after his arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a July 4 court hearing, a U.S. prosecutor said the purported theft of code from Goldman threatens to cost the firm millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov told investigators Goldman Sachs knew he had worked on the program from home previously and he had no intention of stealing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v Aleynikov 09-mj-01553 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool; Editing Bernard Orr, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* World`s first offshore Gravity Based Structure LNG regasification terminal
will have capacity to deliver 775 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. 
* Adriatic LNG Terminal can supply approximately 10 percent of Italy`s natural
gas requirements.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced that the first liquefied
natural gas (LNG) cargo arrived at the Adriatic LNG regasification Terminal
located offshore of Porto Levante, Italy aboard the LNG carrier, Dukhan. 

Terminale GNL Adriatico ("Adriatic LNG") is owned by Qatar Terminal Limited (45
percent), a Qatar Petroleum subsidiary, ExxonMobil Italiana Gas (45 percent) and
Edison (10 percent). The Terminal is the first offshore Gravity Based Structure
in the world for unloading, storage and regasification of LNG. It utilizes
ExxonMobil proprietary technology and is designed around a large concrete
structure, which houses two LNG storage tanks, a regasification plant, and
facilities for mooring and unloading LNG vessels. When it reaches full
operational capacity later in 2009, the Adriatic LNG Terminal will be able to
deliver 775 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (8 billion cubic meters
per year), or approximately 10 percent of Italy`s current natural gas
requirements. 

"ExxonMobil is a global leader in developing and delivering advanced LNG
technology," said Neil Duffin, president of ExxonMobil Development Company.
"ExxonMobil is proud to partner with Qatar Petroleum and Edison in developing
the Adriatic LNG Terminal that will increase Italy`s LNG import capacity and
provide cleaner-burning natural gas to help meet consumer demand. Through
advanced technologies, project execution expertise, and economies of scale,
ExxonMobil is extending its ability to bring global LNG supplies to Italy and
elsewhere around the world." 

"The Adriatic LNG Terminal will further expand Qatar`s global reach and provide
a diverse and secure energy supply for Italy," commented Saad Al-Kaabi, Director
Oil &amp; Gas Ventures for Qatar Petroleum and Chairman of Adriatic LNG. "The
arrival of the first LNG cargo marks a significant milestone in Qatar's
world-leading LNG business and reflects our successful collaboration with
ExxonMobil." 

Facilitating the development of a global market for cleaner-burning natural gas,
ExxonMobil is an industry leader in all aspects of the LNG value chain,
including resource development, liquefaction, transportation, regasification
terminals and gas marketing. In partnership with Qatar Petroleum, the company is
employing new technology to build four of the largest LNG production facilities
in the world, LNG regasification terminal projects in the UK, Italy and the US,
as well as the industry's largest vessels to carry LNG to market. ExxonMobil is
also participating in the development of LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and
Australia. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Statements of future events or conditions in this release
are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project plans
and schedules, gas volumes, and the impact of new technology could differ
materially due to changes in market conditions affecting the oil and gas
industry or long-term oil and gas price levels; political or regulatory
developments; timely completion of projects; technical or operating factors; and
other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in
the Investors section of our website (www.exxonmobil.com) and in Item 1A of our
most recent Form 10-K. References to quantities of gas include amounts that are
not yet classified as proved reserves but that we believe will be produced in
the future.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Exchange Administrators Can Browse Offline EDB Files and Selectively
Export Folders and Emails Even in the Case of Heavy Database Corruption 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
OfficeRecovery.com has released a new version of Visual Recovery for Exchange
Server, its granular data recovery software for Microsoft Exchange Server. 

The utility presents offline email database in the form of a folder tree and
lists of messages. Folders and individual messages can then be marked for
subsequent export into PST files. 

The latest release of the data recovery tool now supports all Exchange Server
versions up to 2007, including most recent service packs. The product
performance on heavily corrupted Exchange email databases has been improved both
speed- and quality-wise. 

The typical time for Visual Recovery for Exchange Server to prepare a 16Gb EDB
file for browsing has been reduced to less than 10 minutes, although it may vary
depending on database complexity and the extent of damage. After the initial
database scan is completed, the data is readily available for granular export. 

"I encourage Exchange administrators to use Visual Recovery as the default tool
for exporting items from offline EDB files in the course of daily data
management routines. A very important feature of the software is its capability
to handle corrupted databases which cannot be mounted anymore, and this is what

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Chase announced today that it has added 223 former Washington Mutual bank

million deposit accounts to the company`s state-of-the-art platform. 

Chase consumers and business customers have unparalleled access to more than
1,000 branches and 3,150 ATMs - all now branded with the bright blue Chase
octagon -- in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It is easily the largest
bank network in the Tri-State area. 

"We have added even more convenience for Chase customers and we have quadrupled
the number of locations here that former WaMu customers can use," said Dan
Deegan, head of retail banking for Chase in the Tri-State area. "Our employees
have worked hard to make this a smooth transition for our customers who can now
take advantage of our expanded set of products and services to achieve their
financial goals."

rebranding the 223 former WaMu branches and 588 ATMs in the Tri-State area.
Chase is using high efficiency HVAC and lighting systems, low irrigation plant
landscaping, solar reflectance, recycled materials in walls, floors and
ceilings, and Energy Star appliances. 

So far this year, Chase has converted and rebranded 1,037 former WaMu branches
in 11 states. By the end of 2009, about 1,800 former WaMu branches across the
country will be operating under the Chase brand and on the Chase computer

&lt;p&gt;Agreement Latest in Company`s Multimillion Dollar Initiatives in Angola
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the Cooperative League of the United States of America
(CLUSA) today announced the basis for a new partnership aimed at supporting
Angola`s continued focus on developing a diversified and sustainable economy. 

The Memorandum of Understanding, witnessed by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton in Luanda, Angola, focuses on supporting financial, educational,
technical and training services to help improve the commercial viability of
small to medium scale farmers and agricultural enterprises in Angola. 

"This event underscores the innovative ways that the US government, American
corporate partners, and NGOs are working together to diversify Angola`s economy
so that the Angolan people can better benefit from the country`s natural
wealth," said the US Ambassador to Angola, Dan Mozena. 

"We are delighted to support productive partnerships that benefit the people of
Angola," said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and Latin America
Exploration and Production. "Today`s agreement continues to build on our
collective strengths and capabilities and emphasizes Chevron`s commitment to
helping deliver better social, environmental and economic outcomes in the places
where we operate." 

This Memorandum of Understanding will give continuity to the $56 million Angola
Partnership Initiative established in 2002 between Chevron and other development
partners including USAID to support education, food security, capacity building
of government institutions, and small business development in Angola. The
agreement also follows a 5-year, $5.6 million Agriculture Development and
Finance Program (Pro-Agro) initiated in 2006, which has increased the yield,
quality and market share of local products such as bananas and coffee. 

Chevron`s support for other existing development programs within Angola
includes:

* NovoBanco, a micro-finance institution established by Chevron and USAID that
provides credit to small entrepreneurs and low-income households. Launched in
2004, the bank has extended over $40 million in loans, and reached over 30,000
entrepreneurs. 
* A $5 million anti-malaria partnership with the Ministry of Health in Angola as
part of Chevron`s $30 million commitment with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria.

Chevron is among the largest producers of energy in Angola with Angolans
accounting for more than 85 percent of the company`s local workforce. Among the
company`s major capital projects in Angola is the $3.8 million Tombua-Landana
Project, which is projected to come online in the third quarter of 2009 and
achieve peak production of about 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day by 2011,
and the Sonangol-Chevron led Angola Liquefied Natural Gas facility, which is
expected to achieve first gas in 2012. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;Experienced Biotechnology Executive to Join Team Managing BioTime`s Human
Embryonic Stem Cell Research and Product Development 
ALAMEDA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
BioTime, Inc. (OTCBB:BTIM) announced today that Walter Funk, Ph.D. has joined
its management team as Vice President for Stem Cell Research. Dr. Funk will
participate in the management of BioTime`s team of scientists developing
numerous products from human embryonic stem cells for use in research and in
novel therapies for human diseases. 

Dr. Funk is an experienced biotechnology professional, having held both senior
technical and executive research positions over the past 15 years. He trained in
Biochemistry (Ph.D., University of British Columbia) and has published over 45
peer-reviewed journal articles. He was one of the first scientists to join Geron
Corporation, and participated in the isolation of the telomerase gene which
allows certain cells, such as embryonic stem cells, to proliferate without
aging. Later at Geron, he worked with the world's first human embryonic stem
cell lines and provided the first detailed description of their gene expression
patterns through a collaboration with Celera Corporation. Dr. Funk subsequently
held the position of V.P. Research at Nuvelo, Inc., where he led a team
developing novel human biotherapeutics. His group identified R-spondin proteins,
an important new class of human growth factors that have completed Phase 1a
clinical trials, and also developed new antibodies intended for use in the
treatment of human malignancies. Most recently, Dr. Funk co-founded Parallax
Venture Partners, a seed-stage venture capital group, and sits on the boards of
Gene Oracle, a leading provider of synthetic gene technologies and services and
Phyllom, LLC, an agricultural biotech product development company. 

"I am excited to join the BioTime team at such an important time in the
company`s development," said Dr. Funk. "The development of the ACTCellerateTM
embryonic progenitor cell technology represents a fundamental advancement of
cell therapeutic strategies, providing for the first time an elegantly simple
means of scaling up commercial quantities of highly purified human cell types. I
look forward to helping BioTime execute a strategic plan to push this technology
towards commercialization. Our recent award of a prestigious CIRM grant will
help BioTime and its collaborators make rapid progress toward this goal." 

"We couldn`t be more enthusiastic about Dr. Funk`s decision to join the BioTime
management team. He has a track record of consistently providing critical
scientific expertise and executive acumen," said Michael D. West, Ph.D., CEO of
BioTime. "His expertise in genomics will help us reach our goal of leading the
emerging industry of regenerative medicine by providing the first detailed gene
expression map of BioTime`s hundreds of proprietary cell lines."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds forecasts for non-Japan Asia, reasons for upgrade)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Aug 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) on Monday
raised its forecast for Asian economic growth this year and next
based on a stronger outlook for the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank revised its projections for gross domestic product
growth in Asia ex-Japan, which were already above consensus, to
5.6 percent from 4.9 percent this year and to 8.6 percent from
7.8 percent in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said Asia would benefit from strength in China, which
it now expects to grow 9.4 percent this year and 11.9 percent in
2010. Previously the bank had forecast 8.3 percent and 10.9
percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Explaining its upgrade, Goldman said Chinese growth momentum
remained strong and policy tightening was behind the curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Buchanan, the bank's chief economist for non-Japan
Asia, said the National Development and Reform Commission and the
State Council, China's cabinet, remained very cautious about any
significant tightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe policymakers will only choose to tighten more
dramatically via significant hikes in policy rates once the
consequences of above-trend growth become obvious (i.e., actual
inflation or supply bottlenecks or significant asset price
bubbles)," he said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This may mean that increases in interest rates will not come
until next year, perhaps after discussions at December's annual
economic policy-setting meeting, Buchanan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Premier Wen Jiabao said at the weekend that Beijing would
stick to an appropriately loose monetary stance and proactive
fiscal policy to achieve its goal of 8 percent GDP growth this
year. [ID:nPEK220133]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That target looked out of reach until data for the second
quarter started to show the impact of the government's 4 trillion
yuan ($585 billion) stimulus spending and a record burst of
lending by China's mainly state-owned banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said Asia would also draw strength from a rosier
outlook in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank raised its 2009 GDP forecasts for Hong Kong,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, but
kept its projections for Indonesia, Thailand and India unchanged.

Microsoft Sells Razorfish

Yesterday, Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) announced the sale of Razorfish, the digital
advertising firm it received as part of the aQuantive acquisition in 2007. The
consideration to be paid by Publicis Group, the acquirer, is around $530
million, partly in the form of cash and partly in 6.5 million Publicis Groupe
treasury shares. 

The agreement creates a win-win situation. Publicis Groupe gets to acquire a
digital advertising company, which effectively transforms a quarter of its
business to the digital model. With Internet usage increasing the world over,
digital advertising is assuming increasing importance in today`s world. The
price is also reasonable, given that the company generated around $400 million
in revenues in 2008, and is expected to generate $360-370 million in 2009. 

The revenue decline is recession-related and does not indicate loss of position
at customers. In fact, Razorfish`s customer base is another positive, as the
company serves several big names such as Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F), AT (NYSE:
T), Kraft Foods (NYSE: KFT), Best Buy Co. (NYSE: BBY), Levi Strauss &amp; Co. and
Mercedes-Benz USA.

&lt;p&gt;
SANTA ANA, Calif., Aug. 11, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- STEC, Inc. (Nasdaq:STEC),
today announced that STEC's MACH8IOPS Solid State Drives (SSD) are now
integrated and shipping into several versions of IBM's (NYSE:IBM) System x
server series. These diskless versions of the System x represent an Enterprise-
Server platform relying solely on SSD technology with higher performance and
lower-power consumption than that of traditional drives.

Designed for transaction-intensive industries, the MACH8IOPS SSD-enabled System
x is capable of delivering much higher IOPS performance with fewer drives
compared to an HDD-enabled version. A MACH8IOPS-enabled System x not only offers
high performance and better system efficiency, but also delivers lower cost of
ownership by significantly reducing the system's footprint, power consumption,
and associated hardware costs.

"Today's announcement adds significant momentum to our MACH8IOPS product line,
particularly since the Enterprise-Server market has been viewed as being one of
the more competitive sectors for SSDs," said Manouch Moshayedi, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of STEC. "We believe enterprise servers and blades
represent a very large and growing market where 25-30 million HDDs are being
used each year. Our MACH family of products are a great fit for this market."

STEC's MACH8IOPS SSD is revolutionizing the storage world by delivering to the
users the ultimate level of reliability and performance in a fully integrated
device. At the heart of the MACH8IOPS SSD is STEC's leading-edge controller,
able to address multiple flash chips simultaneously for enterprise-level
performance. In addition the MACH8IOPS incorporates the enterprise necessary,
full data path protection, STEC's proprietary set of algorithms capable of
protecting data anywhere in the path from HOST to Flash for the ultimate in data
loss prevention. The MACH8IOPS SSD product family offers a comprehensive array
of options for enterprise system architects and thus STEC's MACH8IOPS SSD is
among the few Solid State Drives trusted for Enterprise-Storage environments.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), the world's largest credit card networks, are counting on foreign markets for the growth that recession-bound U.S. consumers have been unable to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseas markets have contributed to the bottom line at both Visa and MasterCard with double digit revenue growth rates in recent years, helped by a shift among consumers worldwide to using plastic where they once used cash and checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But foreign markets became truly crucial last year -- sustaining the revenue and earnings of both firms, despite a steep decline in credit card use in the United States -- still by far the largest market for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, emerging countries from Mexico to South Korea -- and even economies such as Japan and Germany that are developed, but are underpenetrated by credit and debit cards -- could become the engines of growth ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In Russia, in Brazil, in the United Arab Emirates, in Taiwan, even in China and Japan, while we see some good activity or strong activity, it's potentially much stronger when those economies start to do better," Visa's Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very entrenched in every one of those places and we are looking to get a lot more of attraction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's operating revenue from abroad increased to 44 percent in the second quarter from 40 percent a year ago and could rise to 50 percent in the next three to five years, Saunders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard's chief executive Robert Selander said in an interview with Reuters earlier this year that the company was considering increasing investments in emerging markets despite the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign markets represented 55 percent of MasterCard' purchase volume in the second quarter, up from 50 percent in 2007. Analysts estimated those countries could represent 60 percent of the company's annual purchase volume of $2 billion in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard are partially insulated from the credit crisis because they process transactions rather than lend funds. However, both companies have seen a slowdown in activity as U.S. consumers use credit cards less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first three months of 2009, Visa's payment volume grew 2 percent, boosted by a 10 percent increase in the Asia Pacific region and a 15 percent jump in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, MasterCard's purchase volume declined, hurt by a steep contraction in the use of credit cards in the United States. But the Asia Pacific region grew 16 percent and Latin America 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign markets have helped both companies stick to earnings targets. Visa has said its adjusted EPS will grow over 20 percent, while MasterCard expects net income growth of at least 20 percent in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For both companies to grow much faster than 5, 6 percent they need that international growth," said Greg Smith, an analyst at Duncan-Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$4 TRILLION OPPORTUNITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at JPMorgan Chase estimated in a recent report that under-penetrated developed countries and emerging markets could represent a $4 trillion purchase volume opportunity, almost as much as Visa and MasterCard's annual purchase volume combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among developed countries, Japan, Germany, Italy and Spain hold low payment penetration rates, offering bigger growth opportunities than the United States or the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil, Russia, China, India, Mexico and South Korea seem to be the most appealing emerging markets for growth, given their size, growing middle class and underdeveloped electronic payment network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In China and India there is half a card per person, while in the United States there is something close to 5 cards per person, so you can see the difference in penetration; plus the number of people make China and India big opportunities of growth," said David Koning, an analyst at Robert Baird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Monday, MasterCard said it could keep expanding through organic growth, partnerships and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's second largest credit card network has launched its first platinum debit card targeting affluent consumers in Mexico and its first debit card in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the appointment of Ajay Banga, former head of Citigroup in Asia, as president of MasterCard is a sign of how closely the company is looking abroad for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early this year, the company acquired Dublin-based software provider Orbiscom and, most recently, it created a joint venture with French hotels and services group Accor SA (ACCP.PA) to expand in the prepaid card business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, bigger rival Visa has invested in British mobile banking and payment service provider Monitise Plc (MONI.L) and has started a program to pay by mobile phone in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa also launched a venture in Singapore with a software provider to offer prepaid and debit processing services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"International markets are going to grow faster, more sustainably and for a longer period than the U.S. for both Visa and MasterCard," said Robert Dodd, an analyst at Morgan, Keenan  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Credits Palo Alto Networks with Finding a Terminal Services Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability, Identifying Yet Another Potential Threat
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Palo Alto Networks, the leader in next-generation firewalls, today announced
that its Threat Research Team discovered one of the vulnerabilities rated as
"critical" that was published in Microsoft`s Patch Tuesday security bulletin
today. 

Microsoft credits Palo Alto Networks` Threat Research Team for finding a remote
code execution vulnerability (CVE-2009-1929) in the Microsoft Terminal Services
Client ActiveX Control that could allow an attacker to take complete control of
a vulnerable system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability, called the
Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX Control Heap Overflow Vulnerability,
by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could potentially allow remote
code execution if a user visited that page. 

Palo Alto Networks` next-generation firewalls are unique in the industry in
their ability to see and control applications, users and content - not just
ports, IP addresses and packets. Traditional port-blocking firewalls do not have
the content intelligence to identify a possible application exploit such as
this, which could allow an attacker to install programs; view, change, or delete
data; or create new accounts with full privileges. 

The Palo Alto Networks Threat Research Team is active in the research community,
aggressively pursuing both new vulnerability research and mitigation of all
types of threats. Leveraging its expert understanding of today`s applications,
threats and how vulnerabilities get exploited, the team is a consistent
contributor in support of Microsoft`s Patch Tuesday releases, including
discovering four Microsoft vulnerabilities in the past six months. 

Palo Alto Networks` next-generation firewalls are the industry`s most powerful
firewall products, enabling enterprises to see and control applications, users
and content - not just ports, IP addresses and packets. This is a critical need
for enterprises` management of risk as industry studies continue to show
enterprises lack visibility into and control of application traffic due to the
outdated functionality of legacy security technology.1 Palo Alto Networks`
next-generation firewalls enable enterprises to create granular,
business-relevant security policies and safely control new enterprise and
consumer applications as business enablers instead of the block-or-nothing
approach offered by traditional port-blocking firewalls. 

About Palo Alto Networks

Palo Alto Networks is the leader in next-generation firewalls, enabling
unprecedented visibility and granular policy control of applications and content
- by user, not just IP address - at up to 10Gbps with no performance
degradation. Based on patent-pending App-ID technology, Palo Alto Networks
firewalls accurately identify and control applications - regardless of port,
protocol, evasive tactic or SSL encryption - and scan content to stop threats
and prevent data leakage. Enterprises can for the first time embrace Web 2.0 and
maintain complete visibility and control, while significantly reducing total
cost of ownership through device consolidation. For more information, please

Company's positive operating income for the previous three years and
revenue growth from approximately $78 million in 2006 to $95 million in

in conjunction with the presentation of the market capitalization values
of comparative public companies. The presentation includes an outlook on
the anticipated profitable revenue increase in 2009.

overall plan to align what management believes is an undervalued price
per share with the Company's otherwise strong fundamental financial
performance.

    NewMarket recently released an exclusive on-demand Webcast to review the
Company's positive operating income for the previous three years and
revenue growth from approximately $78 million in 2006 to $95 million in
2008. The focus of the Webcast is to present the potential for the share
price to increase from the recent recapitalized price per share of $0.45
to $1.00 and as high as $2.50. The price per share potential is suggested
in conjunction with the presentation of the market capitalization values
of comparative public companies. The presentation includes an outlook on
the anticipated profitable revenue increase in 2009.

    The Webcast is now available for review on the Company's corporate
website. A link to the Webcast titled 'NewMarket Corporate Update (August

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Aug 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
National Tween Girl Summit founders and the nation's leading tween girl
research firm, AK Tweens, and AllyKatzz.com, the country's largest COPPA
compliant tween girl social networking site, today announce that PBteen,
Disney Book Group, Sephora USA, Inc., Popstar! Magazine, Fundex Games,
Ltd., Daisy Rock Girl Guitars, D'Addario Strings, and Chit Chat Beauty
have joined Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) (NASDAQ: ERTS), the leading global
entertainment software company, as official sponsors of the first ever
National Tween Girl Summit, planned for October 10, 2009 at the historic
Capital Hilton Hotel in Washington, DC.

    The daylong Summit will examine the minds, motivation and lives of tween
girls, giving them a platform to share their thoughts and opinions on a
range of subjects. Over 300 tween girls from around the country will
convene with policy makers, experts, and celebrities to discuss a wide
range of topics including community service, personal safety online and
off, tween pressure and self-image, what's hot and what's not in the world
of tweens and much more. Parents, politicians and marketers will have the
opportunity to hear directly from the girls about what's important to them
-- from their struggles with peer and parental pressure, to government
policy affecting their lives, to what motivates them to buy what they buy.
Just four years away from legal voting age, and members of a demographic
which spends billions of dollars each year, the goal of the Tween Summit
is to help these girls understand their personal and collective power and
to give them a voice. The day culminates with a celebrity filled night of
entertainment for those in attendance. In addition, a virtual component
will allow hundreds of thousands of additional girls to join the summit
online via www.AllyKatzz.com.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Die Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) hat heute bekannt gegeben, dass die
erste Ladung an Fl&#252;ssigerdgas (LNG, von engl. liquefied natural gas) an Bord des
LNG-Tankers &#8222;Dukhan" den Regasifizierungsterminal von Adriatic LNG vor dem
italienischen Porto Levante erreicht hat. 

Die Betreiberin, Terminale GNL Adriatico oder Adriatic LNG, geh&#246;rt zu 45 Prozent
Qatar Terminal Limited, einer Tochtergesellschaft von Qatar Petroleum, zu 45
Prozent ExxonMobil Italiana Gas und zu 10 Prozent Edison. Der Terminal ist das
weltweit erste schwerkraftgest&#252;tzte Offshore-Bauwerk zur L&#246;schung, Aufbewahrung
und Regasifizierung von LNG. Im Terminal wird gesetzlich gesch&#252;tzte Technologie
von ExxonMobil angewendet, und das Bauwerk wurde rund um eine gro&#223;e
Betonstruktur entwickelt, in der zwei LNG-Speichertanks, eine
Regasifizierungsanlage und Einrichtungen zum Vert&#228;uen und L&#246;schen von
LNG-Tankern untergebracht sind. Nach dem Erreichen der vollen Betriebskapazit&#228;t

Kubikmeter Erdgas (8 Milliarden Kubikmeter pro Jahr) oder rund 10 Prozent des
gegenw&#228;rtigen italienischen Erdgasbedarfs liefern. 

&#8222;ExxonMobil ist weltweit f&#252;hrend in der Entwicklung und im Einsatz von
fortschrittlicher LNG-Technologie", sagte Neil Duffin, President der ExxonMobil

Projekterfahrung und Skaleneffekte erweitert ExxonMobil seine F&#228;higkeiten zur
Lieferung globaler LNG-Vorr&#228;te nach Italien und an andere Orte rund um die
Welt." 

&#8222;Der Terminal von Adriatic LNG wird die globale Pr&#228;senz Katars weiter ausdehnen
und Italien mit einem mannigfaltigen und sicheren Energievorrat beliefern",
bemerkte Saad Al-Kaabi, Leiter &#214;l- und Gasprojekte von Qatar Petroleum und

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Aug 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has placed
10 million shares of GAGFAH (GFJG.DE), equivalent to about 4.4
percent of the company's stock, on behalf of an unidentified
institutional investor, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It was not immediately clear at what price and on whose
behalf the shares were placed. GAGFAH is 60 percent-owned by
Fortress (FIG.N), while J.P. Morgan [JPM.N] subsidiary
Highbridge Capital holds 5.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for GAGFAH said the company had not received any
statement on changes in voting rights.

(CCL.AX), Australia's top soft drink bottler, expects
second-half profit growth in the high single digits as new
products come onstream and spending on drinks holds up, the
company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Amatil said low petrol prices and lower mortgage

downturn, but the early signs of economic recovery didn't mean
the difficulties were completely over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think we will bounce along the bottom for a while,"
Managing Director Terry Davis told a briefing. "I won't be
comfortable or confident about the real recovery until we can
say we have peaked in unemployment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  He also said the group, which is 30 percent owned by
Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), was considering the option of making its
own PET soft drink bottles and it would make a decision in the
next three or four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Coca-Cola Amatil, which reported an in line with
expectations first-half net profit of A$189.8 million ($158
million), rose 1.1 percent to A$9.35 in early afternoon trade,
in line with the increase in the broader market .AXJO.

 (Recasts, adds detail)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Deepti Govind&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, Aug 12 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal court has
ordered Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to stop selling some versions
of its widely used Word software in the United States in two
months, ruling in favor of a small Canadian firm that accused
the software giant of violating its patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A U.S. district court in Texas ruled in favor of i4i Ltd in
its long-running patent dispute against Microsoft, slapping
more than $290 million in damages on Microsoft and issuing an
injunction preventing the world's top software company from
selling versions of Word that contain the disputed patent
technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The patent in question relates to the use of XML, or
extensible markup language, in the 2003 and 2007 versions of
Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The injunction, set to take effect in 60 days, is not
expected to hurt Microsoft. The software giant could easily
adjust its programs to comply with the court's ruling,
according to industry experts, or settle with i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And a new version of Word -- which does not include the
disputed patent technology -- goes on sale next year with the
release of Office 2010, potentially side-stepping the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft ended Wednesday up 2 percent and inched
up another 0.3 percent in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which is involved in a number of legal battles
over patents, said it plans to appeal the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the evidence clearly demonstrated that we do
not infringe, and that the i4i patent is invalid," Microsoft
spokesman Kevin Kutz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CASH COW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Word is Microsoft's core word-processing application in its
flagship Office suite of business software, used worldwide and
long the U.S. software developer's reliable cash cow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The patent in question is for the use of XML, technology
used to make documents such as corporate earnings reports and
news articles machine-readable and easily publishable on
multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toronto-based i4i had claimed in a 2007 suit that Microsoft
knowingly infringed one of its patents in its Word application
and its Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The final judgment from the U.S. District Court ruled that
Microsoft did infringe on i4i's patents, following a jury
verdict issued in favor of i4i on May 20. [ID:nN20530462].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for
Information Inc vs Microsoft Corp, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Texas, Tyler Division, No. 6:07CV113.

&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE Aug 13 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd
(CCL.AX), Australia's top soft drink bottler, said on Thursday
first-half profit rose 10.4 percent after good weather led to
strong drink sales in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Amatil, 30 percent owned by Coca-Cola Co (KO.N),

for the first half.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft must pay nearly $300 million in damages and interest to Canadian company i4i because it infringed the latter's patent for a document system that relies on XML custom formatting, according to court documents filed yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Davis has also slapped an injunction on Microsoft forbidding it to sell Word 2003, Word 2007, and Word for Mac 2008 in the U.S. The injunction takes effect Oct. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a jury awarded Toronto-based i4i $200 million in damages last May, Davis' final order wasn't released until Tuesday. In it, he spelled out the total Microsoft owes i4i.&lt;/p&gt;

$200 million in damages for infringing the i4i patent;
$40 million in "enhanced damages" for Microsoft's "willful infringement";
$11.8 million in post-verdict damages, calculated from the May jury verdict through yesterday;
$38.8 million in pre-judgment interest.&lt;p&gt;The grand total comes to $290.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision. "We are disappointed by the court's ruling," said company spokesman Kevin Kutz in an e-mail. "We believe the evidence clearly demonstrated that we do not infringe and that the i4i patent is invalid. We will appeal the verdict."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Davis' injunction, Microsoft is barred from selling "Word 2003, Word 2007 and Microsoft Word products not more than colorably different from Word 2003 or Word 2007," as well as "any Infringing and Future Word products that have the capability of opening a .XML, .DOCX or .DOCM file containing custom XML."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.DOCX, introduced in Office 2003, is the default file format for Word 2003 and Word 2007; .DOCM is the same file format, but with macros enabled. Although the Word 2003 and Word 2007 file formats are different, both are based on XML (Extensible Markup Language).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word 2008 for Mac, which is already in customers' hands, and Word 2010, the word processor slated for release in Office 2010 in the first half of next year, are also able to open the file formats Davis listed, and thus are affected by the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that Office file formats have been taken to task. Just last week, for example, Microsoft said it would add a file format "ballot" to Office 2010 as part of a campaign of concessions to ward off European Union (EU) antitrust regulators. Microsoft's proposal let European customers select the default file format from an unspecified number of choices, including the company's own XML-based format, Open Office XML (OOXML) and Open Document Format (ODF), an increasingly popular open-source document standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights AutoNation (NYSE: AN) as the Bull of the Day
and Canon (NYSE: CAJ) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research
provides analysis on J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and U.S.
Bancorp (NYSE: USB). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

AutoNation (NYSE: AN) remains focused on improving its product mix and cost
cutting initiatives. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by posting
higher profits in the second quarter despite difficult industry conditions. 

The company addressed its cost reduction initiatives, lower interest expense,
disciplined operating model and inventory management for maintaining the
profits. 

As such, we have upgraded the stock to an Outperform recommendation with a
target price of $22.00. 

Bear of the Day: 

We believe the sharp appreciation of the yen is eroding Canon's (NYSE: CAJ)
revenue and profits. 2Q results were weak with revenue and earnings much below
expectations. 

We expect revenue in 2009 to be hurt by weak consumer spending and a worsening
global economy, and believe the company will struggle to meet expectations in
fiscal 2009. We maintain our estimates for the full year. 

We also maintain our Sell recommendation on CAJ shares with a six-month target
price of $25.00.

Toxic Assets Still There

"The recently conducted stress tests weighed the ability of the nation`s 19
largest bank holding companies to weather further losses from the troubled
assets and assessed how much additional capital would be needed. However, the
adequacy of the stress tests and the resulting adequacy of the capital buffer
required for future financial stability depend heavily on the economic
assumptions used in the tests. As more banks exit the TARP program, reliance on
stress-testing for the economic stability of the banking system increases."

In other words, much of the improvement we have seen in the banking system,
particularly among the big 19 stress-tested banks -- such as J.P. Morgan (NYSE:
JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) -- has come from
changes in the accounting rules, rather than a change in the fundamental
economic value of the securities. There has been some real improvement in the
condition of the banks, but that is mostly due to the large round of capital
raising in the wake of the stress tests. 

The decision to inject capital rather than buy up the assets was a much more
effective use of the TARP funds to stabilize the banking system, but it has left
the fundamental problem in place: billions and billions of loans that were made
that are unlikely to be paid back. The changes in the accounting rules allow the
banks to extend and pretend that the loans still have a much higher value than
they really do. This buys the banks some time.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Nokia are working together to put a version of Microsoft's Office productivity applications on Nokia handsets, the companies said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Business Division President Stephen Elop and Nokia Executive Vice President for Devices Kai Oistamo unveiled the alliance -- which should give Microsoft leverage against Google and others that are attacking its Office business with free or low-priced, Web-based productivity applications -- in a teleconference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, the two companies will begin working together immediately to design, develop and market productivity applications for mobile professionals, bringing an application called Microsoft Office Mobile to Nokia's Symbian devices, they said in a press statement. They will also do the same for other Microsoft communications, collaboration and device-management software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The applications will be available first on Nokia's Eseries phones, which are optimized for the business market, but eventually will extend to other Nokia handsets. Microsoft and Nokia also will jointly market the applications to business customers and carriers, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-Nokia deal brings two competitors together. Microsoft's Windows Mobile platform for handsets competes with Symbian, the OS for most Nokia phones. However, Windows Mobile has never really found solid footing in the mobile market, while Nokia's Symbian is still the market share leader for midrange handsets, said Directions on Microsoft analyst Matt Rosoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting Office applications on Nokia handsets is a savvy business move for Microsoft, he said, and will also help both companies compete against their mutual rivals Apple and Research in Motion, which have made life difficult for both companies in the mobile market. Apple's iPhone remains primarily a consumer phenomenon, while Research in Motion's Blackberry OS is extremely popular with business users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop and Oistamo said that the partnership is based on Microsoft's and Nokia's common goal to make mobile workers more effective as mobile devices become more evolved and powerful. "This partnership was founded with the customer in mind and understanding that mobile workers of the future will need to get more out of their mobile phones," Oistamo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This whole relationship is about expanding ... from a business-productivity perspective," Elop said. "We need to take the broad productivity experiences and put them in the hands of as many people as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal does not mean that Microsoft is conceding to Nokia's Symbian as the dominant OS for smartphones, Elop said. Oistamo said that Nokia has no plans to offer Windows Mobile on its own handsets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both said the two companies will remain fierce mobile competitors even as they collaborate to bring Office to more mobile workers. Microsoft already offers Office Mobile on Windows Mobile handsets and plans to put a new version of the application on mobile phones next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We both believe strongly in our respective strategies but we also believe in our new alliance," Elop said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first application to appear on Nokia phones will be Microsoft Office Communicator, the company's instant messaging and Web presence client for business users, Oistamo said. This will happen sometime next year, he said, with other applications to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to its Windows OS business, Microsoft's Office business is the primary source of the company's revenue. However, its Office consumer business has been declining, showing that pressure from Google and other less expensive productivity applications is beginning to take its toll at the low end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counter this slide, Microsoft also has been working on its own Web-based version of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote called Office Web Apps. That offering will be available on PCs through a browser at the same time it releases the next version of Office 2010 in the first half of next year. Office Web Apps is scheduled to be in a technical preview this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/HELSINKI (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Nokia announced an alliance on Wednesday to bring business software to smartphones and counter the dominance of Research in Motion Ltd's BlackBerry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Texas district court on Tuesday ruled in favor of Canadian software firm i4i Ltd and filed an injunction preventing Microsoft from selling the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent relates to the use of XML, or extensible markup language, which is used to make documents such as corporate earnings reports and news articles machine-readable and easily publishable on multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from Microsoft's Word, XML is used by other word processing applications such as OpenOffice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court also ruled that Microsoft would have to pay more than $290 million in damages to i4i, which makes software for manipulating documents, for infringing the patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which is involved in a number of legal battles over patents, said it plans to appeal the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they (Microsoft) decide to appeal, we will certainly follow it carefully and we will continue down the path to ensure that the judgment is upheld," said i4i Chairman Loudon Owen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toronto-based i4i had claimed in a 2007 suit that Microsoft knowingly infringed one of its patents in its Word application and its Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The verdict stops Microsoft from selling Word 2003 or Word 2007 with our technology in it within 60 days.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Nokia are working together to put a version of Microsoft's Office productivity applications on Nokia handsets, the companies said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Business Division President Stephen Elop and Nokia Executive Vice President for Devices Kai Oistamo unveiled the alliance -- which should give Microsoft leverage against Google and others that are attacking its Office business with free or low-priced, Web-based productivity applications -- in a teleconference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, the two companies will begin working together immediately to design, develop and market productivity applications for mobile professionals, bringing an application called Microsoft Office Mobile to Nokia's Symbian devices, they said in a press statement. They will also do the same for other Microsoft communications, collaboration and device-management software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The applications will be available first on Nokia's Eseries phones, which are optimized for the business market, but eventually will extend to other Nokia handsets. Microsoft and Nokia also will jointly market the applications to business customers and carriers, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-Nokia deal brings two competitors together. Microsoft's Windows Mobile platform for handsets competes with Symbian, the OS for most Nokia phones. However, Windows Mobile has never really found solid footing in the mobile market, while Nokia's Symbian is still the market share leader for midrange handsets, said Directions on Microsoft analyst Matt Rosoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting Office applications on Nokia handsets is a savvy business move for Microsoft, he said, and will also help both companies compete against their mutual rivals Apple and Research in Motion, which have made life difficult for both companies in the mobile market. Apple's iPhone remains primarily a consumer phenomenon, while Research in Motion's Blackberry OS is extremely popular with business users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to its Windows OS business, Microsoft's Office business is the primary source of the company's revenue. However, its Office consumer business has been declining, showing that pressure from Google and other less expensive productivity applications is beginning to take its toll at the low end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counter this slide, Microsoft also has been working on its own Web-based version of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote called Office Web Apps. That offering will be available on PCs through a browser at the same time it releases the next version of Office 2010 in the first half of next year. Office Web Apps is scheduled to be in a technical preview this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Services Industry Elite to Gather at Leading Technology Services Conference,
with Focus on Next Generation of Value-Added Services
SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
AFSMI, SSPA, and TPSA-the three leading professional associations of the
services and support industry-announced the keynote lineup for the upcoming
Technology Services World 2009 (TSW09) Las Vegas conference being held October
19 - 21. The conference will feature thought leaders from CA, Ericsson, HP,
Microsoft, Neochange, Oracle, salesforce.com, and Symantec, as well as AFSMI,
SSPA, and TPSA. 

Following his opening welcome address and keynote, "Complexity Avalanche:
Overcoming the Threat to Technology Adoption," AFSMI|SSPA|TPSA CEO J.B. Wood
will host a discussion on the topic with a distinguished roster of industry
executives including Kathleen Hogan, corporate vice president of Microsoft
Services, Microsoft; Chris Dowse, founder and CEO, Neochange; Stephan Scholl, NA
consulting senior vice president, Oracle; David Hare, vice president of
enterprise support services, Symantec; and Alex Dayon, senior vice president,

&lt;p&gt;   * Top software, cellphone makers join forces&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft to offer Office applications on Nokia devices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Alliance is challenge to RIM's BlackBerry devices/service
 (Adds bylines; executive, analyst comments, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby and Tarmo Virki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE/HELSINKI, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) and Nokia (NOK1V.HE) announced an alliance on
Wednesday to bring business software to smartphones and counter
the dominance of Research in Motion Ltd's RIM.TO BlackBerry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The alliance between the world's largest software company
and cellphone maker means the latest versions of Microsoft's
Office applications, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and
messaging, will be available on a range of Nokia cellphones,
which make up 45 percent of the global smartphone market.
[ID:nLC410005]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies, at one time fierce rivals in the mobile
telecommunications business, expect to offer Nokia phones
running Office sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is giving some of our competitors -- let's spell it
out, RIM -- a run for their money," said Nokia Executive Vice
President Robert Andersson, in a telephone interview. "I don't
think BlackBerry has seen the kind of competition we can
provide them now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Research in Motion's RIMM.O BlackBerry created the market
for mobile e-mail, and its dominant position in the corporate
sector, especially in North America, has protected it from
Nokia's attempts to crack the market in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "RIM should be reasonably safe in the near-term because
Nokia's presence in the U.S. is relatively small," said Neil
Mawston from research firm Strategy Analytics. "Partnering more
closely with Microsoft will help to raise Nokia's profile in
the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The alliance also aims to counter Google Inc's (GOOG.O)
recent move into free online software, targeted at Microsoft's
business customers, and the growing popularity of Apple Inc's
(AAPL.O) iPhone device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's clear that Nokia and Microsoft are both facing
competitive challenges, most notably from Google," said John
Jackson, an analyst at wireless research firm CCS Insight. "It
makes sense for these two companies to work together to see if
they can pool their competitive strengths to try and counter
some of this pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The alliance means Microsoft's new Office suite of
applications could be available to a much wider audience than
the users of Windows Mobile phones, which make up 9 percent of
the smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see this as a great opportunity to deliver Office
Mobile to 200 million Nokia smartphone customers," said Takeshi
Numoto, an executive at Microsoft's Office business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said Microsoft is clearly looking at the largest
possible audience with the Nokia deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The deal is a good win for Microsoft and it will surely
now be hoping to upsell the Microsoft suite of operating
systems into Nokia's possible portfolios of smartphones, mobile
Internet devices and netbooks over the next couple of years,"
said Strategy Analytics' Mawston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies stressed that the new venture will not

&lt;p&gt;Key Issues Include Over-Scheduling and School Bullying

Disney Family.com`s Back-to-School Resource Provides Moms with Tips For a
Seamless Transition


NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Families across the country are gearing up for back-to-school, and as the season
approaches parents are worried about managing their children`s hectic schedules
and dealing with school bullies. According to a recent survey from Disney
Family.com, 84 percent of parents report that their children are involved with
some sort of extracurricular activity and 71 percent report that their children
are involved in two or more activities. Moms are increasingly tasked with
managing hectic schedules as 43 percent reported they handle all transportation
related to extracurricular activities, even as many of these moms work
full-time. 

Another key concern for parents headed into the new school year is bullying.
Eighty-two percent of parents reported that their children either witnessed
bullying or were the victims of bullying in school. Survey data also showed that
bullying has increased in recent generations with 33 percent of parents
reporting that they were bullied in school, while those same parents reported
that 42 percent of their children have been bullied. 

Amidst the concerns, parents also reported that family-time is a priority with
nearly nine out of ten families still managing to sit down for dinner together
at least two nights during the school week while one in four families has
instituted a weekly family game night. 

To help make the back-to-school transition as hassle-free as possible and ensure
families are able to spend quality time together, Disney Family.com launched a
back-to-school resource with tips and advice for parents faced with keeping
everything in order during this stressful time. 

"From school lunch ideas to back-to-school budgeting tips and a survival guide
to help moms manage schedules, Disney Family.com is a one-stop resource for busy
moms," said Emily Smith, Vice President of the Disney Online Mom and Family
Portfolio. "Back to school can be a difficult transition period for everyone in
the family and our goal is to provide moms with tools they can use to make it as
easy and stress-free as possible." 

In addition to survey findings, the back-to-school resource features tips and
ideas including:

* Recipes for quick and easy weekday meals
* Tips for juggling academics, after-school and family life
* Expert advice from principals and the opportunity to get answers to the
questions you have been dying to ask 
* College Savings Sweeps - A chance to win $2,500 toward a child`s college
education

Survey Methodology

The results of the survey, underwritten by Disney Family.com and conducted by
Usability Sciences, are based on responses of more than 2,600 Disney Family
visitors in the United States. The survey was conducted over a period commencing
July 23, 2009 and continuing through July 30, 2009. The margin of error is + or
- 1%.

&lt;p&gt;Make a purchase, then redeem accumulated rewards points to pay for any item on
your credit card, including the item you just purchased

Amplify your savings with up to quadruple rewards points

25,000,000 bonus points being offered to first customers who get the card
NORWALK, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Discount mavens and deal hounds - here`s a new offering from The Priceline
Negotiator that you won`t be able to pass up. Today, priceline.com (Nasdaq:
PCLN) introduced the priceline rewards Visa card - an instant-rewards card that
lets cardholders make a purchase, collect rewards points and then, as soon as
the points post to their account (typically within two days), redeem accumulated
points to pay for items on the credit card, including the item they just
purchased. 

Also today, priceline.com released the results of an independent survey on
American attitudes toward the ancient art of haggling. A surprising 64% of
survey respondents said they have tried to negotiate on a purchase. See survey
results at http://pcln.com/guxh. 

The new card lets travelers amplify their savings by earning multiple rewards
points on all priceline.com and other purchases. With the new priceline rewards
Visa card, which is offered through Barclays, cardholders can earn up to 4
points for every $1 spent on priceline.com Name Your Own Price reservations and
up to 3 points on their published-price travel reservations. Card members can
choose from one of three everyday spend categories (utilities, groceries or home
improvement) to earn 2 points for every $1 spent. And every other purchase made
on the card earns 1 point per $1 spent. 

Accumulated points can be redeemed and used just like cash to pay off credit
card charges. Cardmembers do not have to wait for traditional monthly billing
cycles to redeem their points. As soon as a merchant posts a charge to the card,
the charge - and the applicable points - appear in real-time on a continually
updated statement. In some instances, charges and points can be posted as early
as the next day. The new card includes an additional benefit for priceline.com
travel customers. Priceline.com has increased the purchasing power of points
redeemed to pay for priceline.com Name Your Own Price travel reservations.
Compared to other purchases, Name Your Own Price reservations will require fewer
points to pay them off. 

The priceline rewards Visa card is ideally tailored to help consumers meet the
challenges of today`s tough economy. "The priceline rewards Visa card delivers a
nunchuck blow right to the solar plexus of high prices," said The Priceline
Negotiator, aka William Shatner. "Cardmembers save twice - once on their money
saving priceline.com reservations and again when they use those powerful points
to cut their credit card bill to ankle height." 

In fact, The Negotiator likes the priceline rewards Visa card so much that he`s
putting his image on it. "Any shopkeeper will tremble in fear of you, a true
Negotiator, when you flash that card," said The Negotiator. 

"The Priceline brand is all about saving people money and we wanted our card to
be an extension of our brand," said Paul Hennessy, priceline.com`s Chief
Distribution Officer. "The card lets travelers accumulate reward points rapidly
with one of the richest point systems in the online travel industry. The card is
also extremely flexible. Any purchase on the card gains points, although
consumers will see the obvious advantage in making all of their travel
reservations with the card. And those points can be redeemed and used like cash
to pay for literally any purchase made on the card. With all these different
ways to save, it seemed a very Priceline-like solution." 

"Priceline.com`s approach to its loyalty card is unique in that it is not so
much a travel card as it is an all-purpose credit card that rewards all kinds of
purchase activities with points that can be applied to pay off anything on a
monthly credit card statement," said Lloyd M. Wirshba, Chief Executive Officer,
Barclaycard US. "We believe that this is an extremely powerful concept that will
resonate strongly with consumers in the current economic climate."

Additional 25,000,000 bonus points giveaway

To introduce the priceline rewards Visa Card, priceline.com and Barclays are
sponsoring a 25,000,000 bonus points giveaway. Customers who are among the first
to sign up and are approved for the card will receive an additional 5,000 or
2,500 bonus points plus $50 or $25 hotel bonus cash good toward their next
priceline.com reservation, depending on whether they choose the fee or no-fee
card. Hotel bonus cash is awarded after the card is used for the first time. The
special promotion will continue until the 25,000,000 bonus points are exhausted.


Easy and automatic points accumulation and tracking

Depending on whether you choose the Fee or No-Fee card, Barclays will
automatically calculate the correct points value for each purchase and display
it in your online statement as soon as it`s posted to your account.
ID/Password-protected statements can be accessed through Barclays Website or
through a special link available on priceline.com. Continually updated
statements can be viewed 24/7. 

Simple points redemption

Here`s where the priceline rewards Visa card really shines. When you access your
statement, you`ll see a summary of your accumulated rewards points. Each charge
on the card of $25 or more will have a checkbox next to it that allows you to
redeem accumulated points to pay for that purchase. You must have accumulated
and redeemed enough points to completely cover the purchase, with no partial
point payments. For example, you would need a minimum of 3,000 redeemed points
to eliminate a $30 charge from your statement. If you had 3,500 total redeemed
points, you would continue to have a balance of 500 points after eliminating the
$30 item.

Beginning today, consumers will be able to fill out a Priceline Rewards Visa
card application by visiting http://www.pricelinevisa.com.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Aug 12 (Reuters) - China's stock market will
resume its rally after a short-term consolidation, providing
buying opportunities in the ports, shipping and home appliance
sectors, J.P. Morgan said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Jing Ulrich, chairman of China Equities at the bank, said
she was less enthusiastic about shares of property firms and
banks that led the market's boom in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shanghai's main stock index .SSEC fell 4.7 percent to its
lowest close in four weeks on Wednesday on worries this year's
market surge has outrun the recovery in the economy and that a
sharp fall in new loans will mean less money available to flows
into the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index is still up 71 percent so far this year, making
Shanghai the world's best performing major stock market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the near term, I think the consolidation will last a
little while longer, but all the factors for continued strong
performance of the market are in the place," Ulrich told
reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although companies in the exports, ports and shipping
sectors, including China COSCO Holdings (1919.HK) (601919.SS),
were still suffering losses due to weak external demand, they
had potential to turn around over the rest of 2009, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Home appliance makers should also benefit from
strengthening property sales as well as rising household
incomes, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ulrich ruled out a near-term policy tightening from
Beijing, pending an export recovery and a pick-up in private
investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the uneven recovery, given the lack of corporate
profitability, given the lacklustre investment by the private
businesses, I think the government will hold off any major
tightening," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ulrich expects China to let red chips such as China Mobile
(0941.HK) and Lenovo (0992.HK) to list in the mainland within
six months and foreign firms within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About a dozen major "red-chip" firms, those headquartered
in China but listed in Hong Kong, are keen to list in Shanghai,
according to bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China agreed in May to let qualified foreign firms list on
domestic stock exchanges by issuing shares or depository
receipts as part of efforts to open up its capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L), Europe's biggest bank, has
hired two Chinese underwriters for its planned China listing,
its Asia Pacific chairman told Reuters last week.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co is looking to sell 23 office properties in what may be the country's largest office real estate sale this year, the Wall Street Journal said in a report on its Website on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The property on offer could raise more than $1 billion according to the report. A representative for JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to sell some of the buildings, the bank will likely have to provide incentives, such as a sale-leaseback transaction, according to the report, which cited real estate experts and another bank's deal as an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter and materials obtained by the newspaper, the Journal said New York developers bid more than $290 million for HSBC's New York City headquarters because the bank agreed to lease back most of the building for the next 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for HSBC was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan has not explicitly offered financing for the properties it is selling, so buyers would have to look elsewhere for credit, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sinead Carew; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today promised it will replace the often-hated Entourage e-mail client in its Office for the Mac with a version of Outlook by late 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Outlook for Mac will deliver the functionality that businesses have come to expect from Outlook on Windows," said Eric Wilfred, the general manager of Microsoft's Mac Business Unit (MacBU) in a conference call this morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Outlook for Mac and Outlook for Windows will be different, for sure, and they will also be compatible, for sure," Wilfred added when asked what kind of parity users should expect between the two applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will ship the next version of Office for Mac -- which doesn't yet have an official title -- in "time for the holiday season in 2010," Wilfred said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mac users have long complained that Entourage, the e-mailer bundled with Mac versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint in Office for Mac 2008, is a poor cousin of Outlook, the application used by Windows customers. Their complaints have centered on Entourage's inability to connect as seamlessly to corporate Exchange mail servers as does Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Microsoft launched Office for Mac 2008, in fact, MacBU developers explicitly said Entourage's reliability and stability were more important than making the program a clone of Windows' Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilfred reversed MacBU's course today. "Outlook for Mac will refresh not just the front end, but the guts of the application," he said during the call. "Outlook for Mac will bring features our customers have long requested -- such as information rights management -- that make working across platforms even easier. I think people will see that this move to Outlook for Mac is more than just a name change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new program will be built using Cocoa, Apple's development environment, which consists of a collection of frameworks, APIs (application programming interfaces) and runtimes that let engineers create Mac OS X native software. Outlook for Mac will also sport a new, more robust database to store e-mails, events, notes and to-dos, said Wilfred, and the database will support backups done with Apple's Time Machine software and indexing via Mac OS X's integrated Spotlight search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook for Mac will build on Entourage 2008, Web Services Edition, software that Microsoft unveiled last January, and which has been in beta testing since then. Entourage Web Services Edition uses Exchange's native connectivity protocol through an API to put the client on a more equal footing with the Windows-based Outlook when it comes to synchronizing with Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Entourage for Web Services Edition is a stepping stone to something bigger ... Outlook for Mac," Wilfred said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted Entourage for Web Services Edition on the MacBU download site today, where users of Office for Mac 2008 can grab the 65MB update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilfred also announced that starting Sept. 15, Microsoft will pare the number of Office for Mac editions from three to two, dropping Special Media Edition and renaming the standard version as "Business Edition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business will include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Entourage for Web Services Edition; Document Connection for Mac, a tool it also introduced in January that helps improve access and browsing to documents on SharePoint and Technologies and on Office Live Workspace; new business-oriented clip art and templates; and a seven-hour series of online training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft added Document Connection for Mac to Office for Mac 2008 with the update to Service Pack 2 (SP2) last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Edition will be priced at $399.95 for the full version, $239.95 for the upgrade; pre-orders for Business Edition will start Aug. 18. Home and Student Edition's price remains at $149.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilfred dodged questions during the call about Microsoft bringing Office for Mac to Apple's iPhone, a move many had speculated would be the focus of today's announcement. "That's a popular question," Wilfred acknowledged today. "But no, there's no news today about any iPhone work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had previously committed to bringing back Visual Basic support in the next version of Office for Mac -- another sop to business users -- and Wilfred repeated that promise today. "Visual Basic will be back," he said. Visual Basic was used in Office for Mac 2004 to provide macro-making capabilities, but Microsoft scrubbed it from the 2008 version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On any integration with Snow Leopard, Apple's Mac OS X upgrade some now expect to see later this month, he said Microsoft had nothing to say. "Apple has not shared any features of Snow Leopard's Exchange support with us," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snow Leopard is to include built-in support for Exchange 2007, and so will make it possible for corporate customers to connect and sync to their Exchange mail servers using the operating system's bundled Mail, iCalc and Address Book applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Thursday said that starting next year it will include Outlook in its version of the Office for the Mac platform, replacing Entourage, the e-mail and groupware application for Mac users the suite has now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move will give business users of the Mac version of the suite more of the same features Microsoft already offers for people using Office on Windows, said Eric Wilfrid, general manager for Microsoft's Mac Business Unit, in a teleconference Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also will reduce the number of editions of Office 2008 for Mac from three to two when it releases a new Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Business Edition on Sept. 15, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new edition will replace the current Office 2008 for Mac and Office 2008 for Mac Special Edition that Microsoft sells and will cost US$399.95, the same as the current Office 2008 for Mac. Microsoft will continue to offer Office 2008 for Mac Home and Student Edition for $149.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes to Office 2008 for Mac lineup will not necessarily remain in effect until Microsoft releases the new Office for Mac around the holidays in November and December of 2010, however. Microsoft will reveal any further changes at a later date, Wilfrid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new business edition of Office for Mac is designed to give business customers using the software better connections to Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft's messaging server for delivering business e-mail, Wilfrid said. Once Outlook becomes part of the suite, this integration will improve, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also engineered Outlook for the Mac to be compatible with Outlook on the Windows platform, Wilfrid said. Outlook has been the e-mail and groupware client software for Office for Windows for many years and is widely used with Exchange Server for corporate e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Gartenberg, vice president of strategy and analysis at Interpret LLC, said that with Apple's Mac computers becoming a more viable option for the enterprise, it is an important move for Microsoft to make its Mac version of Office more on par with its Windows version for those users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Apple's next version of Mac OS X, Snow Leopard, will include native support for Exchange Server when it's released next month, which means business users can get Exchange-based business e-mail through Apple's iWork suite -- a competitor to Office -- as well as other native Mac applications. With this move imminent, Microsoft's inclusion of Outlook in Office for Mac at the end of next year might be too little, too late, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Apple is going after business users with these types of features," Gartenberg said of native Exchange support. "There are still some things Outlook could offer that Apple's integration with Exchange might not offer -- we'll have to see. But it will be more than a year [after Snow Leopard]. That's going to give Apple a pile of time to evangelize to folks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has definitely been feeling the pressure on its Office business not only from Apple's gains in PC market share, but also from free or low-cost competitive applications from Google and others. In fact, Thursday's announcement was the second the company made this week to expand its Office business, which next to Windows remains the main profit driver at Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Microsoft and Nokia unveiled a deal to put Office applications on Nokia's Symbian-based mobile devices, a move that will help Microsoft reach more mobile business users with its Office Mobile suite. The software currently only runs on Windows Mobile devices, which have less market share than Nokia's Symbian handsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a judge halted the sale of Microsoft Word on Tuesday for infringing a patent, many of us wondered about the repercussions of this decision. The patent itself, for the creation of custom XML documents, seemed like an afterthought, and for good reason: The average user never has and never will use Word for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, you may be curious. What is XML anyway, and why is it such a big deal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of XML as a way to define what kind of information goes into a document. So, as I'm writing this story in Word, I could hypothetically use XML to denote the story's title as "headline," my name as "byline," and the article itself as the "body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, PC World might be interested in having my article marked up like this for a variety of reasons. The most basic purpose would be to store information on my work in a database, so they could easily determine how many articles I've written. But where XML really gets useful is in its ability to edit the documents themselves and create new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, let's say PC World wanted to publish a book containing all the blogs posted on the Web site this year. Provided that every Word document was marked up with the appropriate XML tags, PC World could use a script to format all the documents in the same way, with headlines in a certain size, bylines in bold, and text in a specific font. If I tagged the subject of the article with XML, it'd even be possible to create a new document containing all the writing I've done on that particular subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent by i4i offers a "Method and System for Manipulating the Architecture and the Content of a Document Separately from Each Other." That's fairly vague, but it generally pertains to the editing of content in a document that's been marked up with XML. Microsoft has a patent that's more specific, in that it offers a way for computing devices to grab data from a marked up XML document without the need for word processing software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still not planning on using XML any time soon? At least you won't miss it if Microsoft has to pull the feature to keep Word on store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/170148&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discoverer Clear Leader Designed to Drill Wells to a Total Depth of 40,000 Feet
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:
CVX), today announced that the Discoverer Clear Leader, an ultra-deepwater
drillship newly built to Chevron`s specifications, has begun work for Chevron in
the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico under a five-year contract with Transocean.
The state-of-the-art vessel is capable of drilling wells in 12,000 feet (3,650
meters) of water to a total depth of 40,000 feet (12,200 meters), surpassing the
limits of previous technology. 

"The Discoverer Clear Leader offers the most-advanced drilling capabilities in
the offshore drilling industry and will enable Chevron to expand the search for
new domestic sources of energy," said George Kirkland, executive vice president,
Upstream and Gas, Chevron. 

Chevron is one of the top lease holders and producers in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico. The drillship will begin work for Chevron at several of its deepwater
projects, including Tahiti and Jack/St. Malo. 

The Discoverer Clear Leader is the first of two new drillships to be
commissioned for Chevron. The second vessel, the Discoverer Inspiration, is
expected to be delivered in early 2010. 

The drillship features Transocean`s patented dual-activity drilling technology
designed to enable parallel drilling operations from a single derrick, saving
time and money in deepwater well construction compared with conventional rigs. 

Chevron has already established itself as a leader in drilling capabilities. The
company holds the current world water-depth drilling record of 10,011 feet
(3,051 meters) of water in the Gulf of Mexico. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded, removed from Rating Watch Negative, and assigned
Rating Outlooks to 14 classes of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates
from JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. series 2006-CIBC15. A
detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. 

The downgrades are the result of loss expectations on specially serviced loans
as well as Fitch's prospective views regarding commercial real estate market
value and cash flow declines. Fitch foresees potential losses could reach as
high as 10.1% for this transaction should market conditions not recover. Today's
rating actions are based on losses of 7.5%, including 100% of the term losses
and 25% of the losses anticipated to occur at maturity; the 7.5% recognizes all
of the losses anticipated in the next five years. Given the significant term to
maturity, Fitch's actions only account for 25% of the losses associated with
maturities beyond five years. The bonds with Negative Outlooks indicate classes
that may be downgraded in the future should full potential losses be realized. 

Fitch analyzed the transaction and calculated expected losses by assuming cash
flows on each of the properties decline 15% from year-end (YE) 2007 and property
values decline 35% from issuance. These loss estimates were reviewed in more
detail for certain loans representing 71.7% of the pool and, in some cases,
revised based on additional information and/or property characteristics. 

Approximately 4.2% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as
follows: 0.0% in 2010, 0.5% in 2011, 0.0% in 2012, 3.7% in 2013, and 0.0% in
2014. All losses associated with these loans are fully recognized in the rating
actions. 

Fitch identified 23 Loans of Concern (25.6%) within the pool, nine of which
(16.9%) are specially serviced. Of the specially serviced loans, four (10.6% of
the pool) are current. Six of the Fitch Loans of Concern (18.5%) are within the
transaction's top 15 loans by unpaid principal balance, four of which are in
specially servicing (13.2%). 

Six of the loans within the top 15 (18.5%) are expected to default during their
term with loss severities ranging from 10.7% to 46.6%. The largest contributors
to recognized loss are as follows: Lightstone Portfolio (3.5%), FPG Portfolio 1
(3.8%), and The Midwest Retail Portfolio (3.9%). 

The Lightstone Portfolio consists of four regional malls totaling 1,905,421
square feet (sf). The properties have experienced a significant decline in
performance and transferred to the special servicer in October 2008. The
properties are being marketed for sale by the receiver. Based on initial offers,
losses are expected upon disposition. 

FPG Portfolio 1 is a portfolio of 12 industrial and office properties comprising
approximately 1.8 million sf. The loan transferred to special servicing due to
imminent default in June 2009 as several tenants have become delinquent in
rental payments and additional vacancies are expected. Servicer is preparing the
assets for sale and losses are expected upon disposition. 

The Midwest Retail Portfolio consists of 12 anchored and one shadow-anchored
shopping centers comprising 1,457,129 sf located primarily throughout Nebraska.
The loan transferred to special servicing in July 2009 due to a modification
request. Most recent servicer reported occupancy and debt service coverage ratio
(DSCR) is 84.9% and 1.26 times (x), respectively. Based on anticipated declines
in performance a default is anticipated prior to the loan's maturity in 2016. 

Fitch has downgraded, removed from Rating Watch Negative and assigned Rating
Outlooks to the following classes: 

--$164.2 million class A-J to 'BBB-' from 'AAA'; Outlook Negative; 

--$37.1 million class B to 'BB' from 'AA'; Outlook Negative; 

--$15.9 million class C to 'BB' from 'AA-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$31.8 million class D to 'B-' from 'A' Outlook Negative; 

--$26.5 million class E to 'B-'; from 'A-'; Outlook Negative. 

--$29.1 million class F to 'CCC/RR6' from 'BBB+'; 

--$26.5 million class G to 'CCC/RR6' from 'BBB'; 

--$21.2 million class H to 'CC/RR6' from 'BBB-'; 

--$7.9 million class J to 'CC/RR6' from 'BB+'; 

--$10.6 million class K to 'CC/RR6' from 'BB'; 

--$7.9 million class L to 'CC/RR6' from 'BB-'; 

--$2.6 million class M to 'CC/RR6' from 'B+'; 

--$5.3 million class N to 'CC/RR6' from 'B'; 

--$5.3 million class P to 'CC/RR6' from 'B-'. 

Fitch has affirmed the following classes: 

--$50 million class A-1 at 'AAA',; Outlook Stable; 

--$73.7 million class A-3 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$1.00 billion class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$101 million class A-SB at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$227.9 million class A-1A at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$211.8 million class A-M at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--interest-only class X1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--interest-only class X2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch does not rate the following class: 

--$31.8 million class NR.

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Worlds, Disney Channel Programming Events and Family Sites Drive Guest
Traffic and Growth
NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
According to just released data from comScore Media Metrix, Disney Online, which
produces the No. 1 ranked community-family and parenting destination on the Web
(www.Disney.com), broke all-time traffic records in July 2009, reaching nearly
34 million unique visitors and beating the previous all-time record of 32.3
million uniques set in August 2008. Disney Online traffic was up
month-over-month across all key measurements in July, including unique visitors
(+8%), page views (+17%), time spent (+29%) and average daily visits (21%). 

Traffic growth highlights include:

* Strong interest in online games, including increased traffic to Disney Fairies
Pixie Hollow virtual world and interest in a new Phineas and Ferb online game
featured on DisneyXD.com. 
* The Disney Channel programming event Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana drove
an 11 percent traffic increase to DisneyChannel.com compared to prior month,
coinciding with the event`s record-breaking TV ratings (9.3 million viewers, No.
1 telecast across all of cable). 
* For the second month in a row Disney Family sites saw double-digit growth,
with an increase of 11 percent over June.

"It`s exciting to see a well-established site like Disney.com continue to break

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp put its new Zune HD digital music and video player on sale on Thursday, pricing it below comparable Apple Inc iPod devices, in an attempt to claw some market share away from the dominant leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devices, which are available for pre-order but won't hit shelves until September 15, are priced at $219.99 for the 16 gigabyte version and $289.99 for the 32 gigabyte version. Comparable iPod Touch players are priced at $299 and $399 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 16-gigabyte player typically holds about 4,000 songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new Zune HD is slimmer than previous version and has a touch screen for the first time. The range comes in five colors and has a built-in radio receiver, Wi-Fi, and can display high-definition video to a big screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * IBM sees analytics growing 15-20 pct from 2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * IBM sees analytics sales topping $2 bln from 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Wins defense contract
 (Adds comments by executive, details on defense contract)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) - IBM said on Thursday it
expects revenue at its analytics business to grow by around 15
to 20 percent from next year on, as the fledgling unit wins
more contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) said the
analytics business, which helps clients plot trends, predict
risk and cut costs, is likely to account for more than $2
billion in revenue in 2010 -- a fraction of IBM's 2008 revenue
of $103.6 billion. This year, revenue from analytics could grow
by about 10 percent, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm feeling a positive lift in momentum in terms of our
signing and our sales," said Fred Balboni, who heads the unit.
"I think we're moving in the right direction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's business analytics and optimization service unit was
created earlier this year as part of its global services
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe this is going to be a growing business and that
it will grow faster than application-oriented hardware and
software services," Balboni said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM combines analytics, which incorporates advanced
mathematics, with its software and consulting skills to help
clients predict risks and plot trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example, it can help governments plan against pandemics
and aid banks in fighting financial fraud. Police also use
analytics to mine data to predict patterns of criminal
behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has shifted its focus from hardware to more profitable
software and services over the past decade and has recently
positioned the analytics business as a key growth driver, as it
yields higher margins than the average IBM product or service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company announced late last month that it plans to buy
business analytics company SPSS Inc SPSS.O for $1.2 billion
in cash to better compete against rivals like Oracle Corp
ORCL.O and SAP AG (SAPG.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM also said it hopes to win more business from federal
and local governments. In a sign it was making headway, IBM won
a $20 million contract with the U.S. military's Special
Operations Command for its global defense missions, a source
familiar with the deal said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source, who was not authorized to comment on the deal
since it was not yet officially announced, said the five-year
contract would help U.S. forces plan and synchronize various
operations against terrorist networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares were down 57 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $118.72
in afternoon trading.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has agreed to pay $600,000 and has already spent more than $2.5 million as part of a guilty plea to killing migratory birds in five states, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * New digital music player available for pre-order &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Priced below rival Apple iPods &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEATTLE, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) put its new Zune HD digital music and video player on sale on Thursday, pricing it below comparable Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPod devices, in an attempt to claw some market share away from the dominant leader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The devices, which are available for pre-order but won't hit shelves until Sept. 15, are priced at $219.99 for the 16 gigabyte version and $289.99 for the 32 gigabyte version.  Comparable iPod Touch players are priced at $299 and $399 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A 16-gigabyte player typically holds about 4,000 songs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft's new Zune HD is slimmer than previous version and has a touch screen for the first time. The range comes in five colors and has a built-in radio receiver, wifi, and can display high-definition video to a big screen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Derek Caney) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((bill.rigby@thomsonreuters.com; +1 206 418 9236; Reuters Messaging: bill.rigby.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MICROSOFT/ZUNE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug 13 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities raised its December 2010 price target on the shares of Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), saying the company's diverse business model should position it as a relatively early beneficiary of any macro-driven replacement cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage raised its price target on HP's stock to $49.50 from $40, and said in a note to clients the company's second-quarter revenue will be helped by foreign currency effects and better-than-expected trends in personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JP Morgan has an "overweight" rating on the company's stock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage said it expects general expense management, coupled with long-awaited benefits from the PC maker's imaging and printing cost actions to prop up operating margins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JP Morgan also raised its December 2010 price target on computer maker Dell Inc's DELL.O shares to $13 from $10, citing general improvement in valuation multiples within the broader equity markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage, which has an "underweight" rating on the stock, however, said it is cautious on the company's incremental operating leverage potential and does not expect any positive developments out of its August 27 earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Both Dell's high PC exposure and lack of a transformative acquisition to diversify the revenue streams prevent us from becoming more constructive on the stock," the brokerage said in a separate note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage lowered its revenue estimate for Dell's October quarter to $12.89 billion from its earlier estimate of $12.95 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of HP were up 14 cents at $44.32 Thursday morning on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of Dell were up 23 cents at $14.07 on Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in Bangalore; Editing by Unnikrishnan Nair) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((saqib.ahmed@thomsonreuters.com; within US +1 646 223 8780;  outside U.S +91 80 4135 5800; Reuters Messaging  saqib.ahmed.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: HEWLETTPACKARD/RESEARCH JPMORGAN  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Use of 3 Major Public Relations Firms Raises Ethical Questions Over Chevron
Conduct in Ecuador Litigation

Army of Paid Consultants Seeks Favorable Media Coverage


WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron is using its deep pockets to hire three public relations firms to
strengthen a misinformation campaign to evade a $27.3 billion judgment against
the company in Ecuador for creating the worst oil-related contamination on earth
in the Amazon rainforest, said spokesmen for dozens of Amazonian communities in
the South American nation. 

Plaintiffs have charged that Chevron`s public relations team undermines the rule
of law in Ecuador and interferes with U.S. foreign policy goals in the region,
which encourage U.S. investors to respect local laws. Chevron has taken out
several large advertisements in Ecuadorian newspapers attacking the judge and
various court-appointed experts - advertisements which would violate the law in
the U.S. -- and has announced it will not pay any adverse judgment, despite the
fact it stipulated to a U.S. court that it would abide by any ruling in the
country. 

"Chevron is violating the rule of law in Ecuador and its American public
relations firms are leading the charge," said Andrew Woods, an American lawyer
who advises the local communities. 

The three public relations firms used by Chevron are Edelman, Hill &amp; Knowlton,
and Sard Verbinnen. Separately, Chevron also has hired numerous lobbyists to
pressure the Obama Administration to cancel trade preferences for Ecuador`s
government to retaliate for the fact its citizens are suing an American company,
a strategy that to this point has failed. 

"Chevron is gouging American consumers at the pump and then using the profits to
pay public relations specialists to undermine a trial because the evidence is
stacked against it," said Chris Lehane, a member of the legal team suing the
company. 

"Chevron has gone from using the Ecuadorian army to suppress indigenous protest
to using an army of lobbyists and public relations executives to suppress
justice," he added. 

The public relations agencies bring controversy of their own. Hill &amp; Knowlton
has been caught lying on behalf of its corporate clients, including the tobacco
industry when the agency created fake research denying a link between nicotine
and lung cancer, and in 1991 when it coached a witness to lie before the U.S.
Congress to justify the first Gulf War. Edelman is known for selling "green
washing" services to corporate polluters - among them Chevron and the British
coal company EOn -- to soften their negative image on environmental matters. 

The lead on Edelman`s Chevron account is Charles Bakaly, the former spokesman
for special prosecutor Ken Starr during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. At the
time, he was formally accused of leaking grand jury information to the media to
damage President Clinton and is a darling of the far right of the Republican
Party. 

"Chevron`s use of Hill &amp; Knowlton, Edelman, and a notorious Ken Starr political
operative reflect the company`s own warped sense of ethics," said Karen Hinton,
a spokeswoman for the communities suing the oil giant in Ecuador. "Chevron`s
lawyers know the evidence has proven the company`s guilt, so they now operate in
the court of public opinion. The only card they have left is to play a game of
smoke and mirrors." 

Chevron faces a judgment in Ecuador of up to $27.3 billion based on a 4,000-page
environmental damages assessment prepared by a team of 15 court-appointed
experts. Most of the scientific evidence in the report comes from an estimated
50,000 chemical samplings results produced by Chevron that document extensive
cancer-causing toxins at its own well sites, which were mostly built in the
early 1970s. 

Chevron is accused in the lawsuit of systematically dumping more than 18 billion
gallons of toxic waste into Amazonian waterways from 1964 to 1990, when Texaco
(now Chevron) was the exclusive operator of a large oil consortium covering
roughly 2,000 square miles in Ecuador`s Amazon rainforest. Several independent
news organizations, including 60 Minutes and The Washington Post, have recently
documented how Texaco left hundreds of oil-filled waste pits that still use
pipes to run toxic waste into nearby streams. 

Given the quantity of evidence against the company, Chevron has begun to place
favorable "news" that can be cited as evidence in court, said Hinton. Most of
this "news" is published on the editorial pages of various pro-business
newspapers where Chevron advertises, such as the Latin American Business
Chronicle and Investor`s Business Daily. These outlets write about the Ecuador
case using Chevron`s talking points without contacting the plaintiffs. 

Chevron suffered a major shareholder revolt over the Ecuador liability at its
annual meeting in May, while New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo recently
announced he is investigating the company to determine if it is misleading
shareholders about Ecuador. Hinton said pressure from shareholders explains why
Chevron hired Sard Verbinnen, which boasts on its website that it maintains
"close relationships" with financial journalists and institutional investors. 

Examples of Chevron`s ethically questionable public relations campaign include:

* In April, Chevron produced a 13-minute video designed to look like an
"objective" CNN news report and narrated by former CNN correspondent Gene
Randall, but never disclosed it was funded by the company. The tactic was
harshly criticized by the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR). 
* The CJR said the Randall video raises "ethical questions" and quotes Norman
Solomon, a media critic, as saying "the whole [Randall] effort by Chevron is
just another attempt at media spin by a huge corporation with plenty to hide -
with the added twist of a hiring a former journalist to implicitly pretend that
he`s being a journalist while flaking for Chevron to defend the indefensible." 
* Chevron has taken several internet journalists and bloggers on all-expense
paid trips to Ecuador in return for favorable coverage on their sites, without
disclosing the fact they are paid. The company`s lawyers then cite information
on the blogs as "evidence" in their court papers. The practice of paying
seemingly independent journalists is considered highly unethical.

The trial is taking place in Ecuador at Chevron`s request. To avoid trial in the
U.S., where the case originally was filed in 1993, Chevron submitted fourteen
sworn affidavits to a U.S. federal judge praising the fairness of Ecuador's
courts and stipulated it would be bound by any ruling in Ecuador as a condition
of the case being transferred there. 

A final decision on the case is expected in several months.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - A U.S. federal court has ordered Microsoft Corp to stop selling some versions of its widely used Word software in the United States in two months, ruling in favor of a small Canadian firm that accused the software giant of violating its patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. district court in Texas ruled in favor of i4i Ltd in its long-running patent dispute against Microsoft, slapping more than $290 million in damages on Microsoft and issuing an injunction preventing the world's top software company from selling versions of Word that contain the disputed patent technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent in question relates to the use of XML, or extensible markup language, in the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injunction, set to take effect in 60 days, is not expected to hurt Microsoft. The software giant could easily adjust its programs to comply with the court's ruling, according to industry experts, or settle with i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a new version of Word -- which does not include the disputed patent technology -- goes on sale next year with the release of Office 2010, potentially side-stepping the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft ended Wednesday up 2 percent and inched up another 0.3 percent in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which is involved in a number of legal battles over patents, said it plans to appeal the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the evidence clearly demonstrated that we do not infringe, and that the i4i patent is invalid," Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CASH COW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word is Microsoft's core word-processing application in its flagship Office suite of business software, used worldwide and long the U.S. software developer's reliable cash cow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent in question is for the use of XML, technology used to make documents such as corporate earnings reports and news articles machine-readable and easily publishable on multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toronto-based i4i had claimed in a 2007 suit that Microsoft knowingly infringed one of its patents in its Word application and its Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final judgment from the U.S. District Court ruled that Microsoft did infringe on i4i's patents, following a jury verdict issued in favor of i4i on May 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc vs Microsoft Corp, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, No. 6:07CV113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty in Bangalore and Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Edwin Chan and Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

The blog covers a range of information security issues, including software
security, computer and network security, the professionalism of security,
security management, and trends and hot issues in the security space, with a
particular focus on the problem of insecure software. The blog will consider
security both from a business and technical perspective, keeping the contents
current, thoughtful and sometimes provocative. 

"In my 25 years as an information security professional, I have witnessed a wide
variety of information security challenges and look forward to sharing the
lessons I`ve learned," said Molini. "One of the topics to which I am giving
special attention in my blog is software security, which is considered by many
to be the biggest new issue facing security professionals today. The
professionals who work every day in the field of software development often walk
a fine line between profit and process. They must balance the mandate for high
productivity against their professional commitment to high quality systems. I
will speak to the issues that they face with a pragmatism that is sorely needed
in this industry. 

"I welcome comments from security and software professionals alike as we attempt
to create a true dialogue on these important issues," Molini said. 

During his career, Molini has worked in government and the private sector,
advising major financial and pharmaceutical organizations on a variety of
information security issues, including system and software security, intrusion
detection and risk management. He has implemented security controls for large
organizations as vice president of Data Security at First USA Bank and computer
security coordinator for NASA`s Space Shuttle Flight Software development team.
Currently, Molini is a senior program manager at Microsoft, working in the
Identity and Security Division. He has been a CISSP for more than 15 years and
is also a key architect of the new CSSLP certification from (ISC)2.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Aug 14 (Reuters) - A mortgage finance company
owned by Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) could garner
$775 million in government rescue funds if the company
aggressively eases the terms of failing home loans, the U.S.
Treasury said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Litton Loan Servicing collects monthly mortgage payments on
behalf of investors and must decide what to do with homeowners
who default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under President Barack Obama's housing rescue plan,
mortgage service companies can receive cash payments if they
successfully steer a borrower away from foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on the size of their mortgage holdings, Litton could
be eligible for as much as $775 million in payments for giving
aid to all its troubled borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Treasury Department has promised to provide monthly
progress reports on how successful the largest mortgage
servicers are in doling out aid. Litton will now be scrutinized
under that program since it qualified to take part in the
rescue effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Patrick Rucker; Editing by Kenneth Barry)

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day

Here are highlights from Thursday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Wal-Mart Beats But Narrows

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported strong second quarter results with
earnings of 88 cents per share, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of
85 cents. Earnings were up 2.3% year-over-year and were at the high-end of
management`s guidance of 83 cents to 88 cents per share. 

Wal-Mart`s revenue for the quarter declined 1.4% year-over-year to $101.5
billion, as marginal revenue increases in the Wal-Mart's U.S. segment of 0.3%
was fully offset by declines in International and Sam`s Club segments of 5.1%
and 3.2%, respectively. International sales were primarily affected by the
recent currency volatility. 

U.S. comparable store sales for Wal-Mart and Sam`s Club declined 1.2% year
over-year, below management`s guidance of flat to positive 3%. 

New Claims Rise, Old Ones Fall

After a string of relatively upbeat economic news, this was a bit of a
disappointment. Coming out of a recession, the data does not tend to move in a
straight line; rather, the data dances, with a few steps forward and then a few
steps back. Not all parts of the country, or the economy will recover at the
same time. 

Companies have been able to report better than expected earnings, but have had a
very hard time on the top line. The difference has been cost cutting, and cost
cutting usually means laying people off. When everybody is laying people off it
means that revenues will be further depressed because the unemployed do not
spend as much as people with jobs. 

For the individual company, the cost cut of laying someone off is greater than
revenue loss from that worker spending less on the company`s products.
Collectively, though, it contributes to lower economic activity and thus
revenues for almost all companies. 

However, that will not be spread evenly, since people will continue to spend on
staples like toothpaste and soap from Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL) or Procter &amp;
Gamble (NYSE: PG) but not spend on discretionary items like travel, which hurts
Airlines like Southwest Air (NYSE: LUV) and hotel companies like Marriott (NYSE:
MAR).

&lt;p&gt;TALLAHASSEE, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Ron Sachs Communications earned seven statewide Golden Image awards from the
Florida Public Relations Association this week, including the Dick Pope All
Florida Golden Image Award - Florida`s top public relations award for the year. 

The seven awards won by Ron Sachs Communications were the most won by any firm
this year at the FPRA Golden Image Awards presented August 11 at the Boca Raton
Resort. 

Ron Sachs Communications won Florida's top public relations award awards for the
year - the Dick Pope All Florida Golden Image Award - for its Yes on Amendment 4
for Conservation campaign, which also won a Golden Image Award and a Judges`
Award in the public affairs category. The campaign used low-budget social
networking and Web-based viral strategies as well as public relations and
targeted advertising to help win passage for a Florida constitutional amendment
that provided tax incentives for conserving privately owned wildlife habitat.
The campaign helped boost public support for the measure from 37 percent in a
pre-campaign poll to win backing from 68 percent of voters in the 2008 election.


"I`m pleased that our team was recognized by such an important professional
organization for this innovative and successful campaign," said Ron Sachs,
president of Ron Sachs Communications. "2008`s Amendment 4 is a great measure to
conserve Florida`s natural heritage, and I`m proud that FPRA recognized our
efforts to ensure the campaign was successful at the ballot box." 

Gov. Charlie Crist`s Explore Adoption initiative, created by Ron Sachs
Communications in partnership with CoreMessage, also won a statewide Golden
Image Award in the public service category. Within two years of launching the
campaign to encourage public adoptions, Florida boosted the number of adoptions
by 19 percent. 

In addition, the "Explore Adoption" 30-minute television special produced by Ron
Sachs Communications with CoreMessage and Evolution Media won an Award of
Distinction in the Video Public Service category for videos of More Than One
Minute. 

"I am so proud of our work to help Florida children be adopted from foster care
into forever homes where they will be loved and protected," said Michelle Ubben,
partner and chief operating officer of Ron Sachs Communications. "Our team did
stellar work on this terrific project, and I`m proud that the judges found it
worthy of recognition." 

Ron Sachs Communications also won both a Judges` Award and an Award of
Distinction for its work publicizing the case of Rachel Hoffman, a Florida State
University student who was murdered by drug dealers in a botched sting operation
after being enlisted as a confidential informant by the Tallahassee Police
Department. Public outcry from the tragedy helped prompt passage of a new
Florida law changing the way police use confidential informants.

&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GEORGIA, Aug 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Enhanced Telecommunications' (d/b/a) ETI Software Solutions, Inc., (ETI)
(www.etisoftware.com) today announced Farmers Telephone Cooperative
(FTC), will use ETI's Triad Service Delivery Platform (SDP) to integrate
Microsoft's Mediaroom IP video technology to its customer care and
billing infrastructure. Triad, already in full production at Farmers will
also provide inventory control for FTC's IP set-top boxes, mediate
Pay-per-view (PPV) billing, as well as automate the provisioning of IPTV
services to FTC's expanding subscriber base serviced by Mediaroom. With
Triad SDP, Farmers is also capable of supporting Caller-ID, Remote DVR
scheduling and Pre-Paid IPTV services over the Mediaroom infrastructure.

    With Triad SDP's fully-functional interface to Mediaroom, all IP set-top
boxes and gateways will be instantly activated once they are installed at
the subscriber's premise or an adjustment to IPTV services is made to an
existing subscriber's account. Additionally, Triad SDP extracts all PPV
and video-on-demand (VOD) purchases from Mediaroom and exports these
charges for inclusion in subscribers' consolidated telecommunications
services bills. Caller ID, subscriber web-based remote DVR scheduling and
web-based technician installation tools are also part of the SDP suite -
bringing Mediaroom's back-office support to a new level.

    "When we originally implemented Triad, we had the foresight to select a
product that would future-proof our initial IPTV deployment," said Brad
Erwin, CEO, Farmers Telephone Cooperative. "We are realizing our strategy
of investing in a product to help us cost-effectively and rapidly
interface with Microsoft's Mediaroom platform on-time and on-budget."

    "Farmers Telephone Cooperative - a long time customer - selected Triad as
its platform of choice based on our more than 20 years experience and our
proven deployments at both large and small carriers nationwide," said
Peter M Pifer, Chief Executive Officer, ETI Software. "In deploying IPTV
services, FTC continues to be one of the nation's most advanced telephone
cooperatives and we look forward to FTC's continued growth."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft can likely sidestep a recent injunction by a Texas federal judge that bars the company from selling Word with an "easy technical workaround," a patent attorney said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The injunction doesn't apply to existing product that has already been sold," said Barry Negrin, a partner with the New York firm Pryor Cashman LLP who has practiced patent and trademark law for 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Headlines that say Microsoft can't sell Word are not really true," said Negrin, pointing out that the injunction granted by U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Davis on Tuesday only prohibits Microsoft from selling Word as it exists now after Oct. 10. "All Microsoft has to do is disable the custom XML feature, which should be pretty easy to do, then give that a different SKU number from what's been sold so it's easy to distinguish the two versions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does not need to provide an update to users running already-purchased copies of Word 2003 and Word 2007, the two versions that Davis barred the company from marketing after it lost a patent infringement case brought by Toronto-based i4i in 2007. Those copies' infringements have already been "paid for" by the $200 million in damages, and another $12 million in damages from the jury verdict in May until this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, a jury awarded i4i $200 million in damages for infringing an i4i patent; Davis tacked on additional damages and interest to bring the total to nearly $300 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I were Microsoft, I would be a lot more upset with the jury award than the injunction. [The latter] is annoying, but there should be some easy technical workarounds," said Negrin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it will appeal the verdict, but it has not put a timetable on that move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An appeal could take one to two years, said Negrin. "I'd put the over-under at 18 months," he said, noting that much more complex patent cases with more patents and more claims work their way through the appeals process in longer time frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he declined to put a number on Microsoft's chances of getting the verdict and thus the injunction, overturned on appeal. "That really depends on the issues they plan to raise," Negrin said. "I'd expect them to raise invalidity of the patent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a 2006 Supreme Court ruling that set aside a lower court's injunction against eBay in a patent dispute over its "Buy It Now" auction feature may favor Microsoft. In that decision, the Supreme Court said lower courts must use a four-factor test when considering patent injunctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the four is that the public interest is not disserved with the injunction," said Negrin. But with the numbers of Word users and the possible disruption to business if the company did stop selling the product in two months, Microsoft may be able to make the case that the injunction is not in the public interest. "That may depend on how Microsoft wants to paint how easy it is, or not, to change Word," Negrin continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger factor, he said, is whether i4i can be adequately compensated without the injunction -- in other words, by money. "It might be difficult for i4i to argue that $290 million is not adequate compensation," Negrin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options -- including arguing for a stay of the injunction or even some kind of settlement with i4i -- are probably off the table. "The district court judge already denied a request for a stay," Negrin observed. Although Microsoft can avoid paying the $290.6 million to i4i when it appeals by posting a bond, "It has no right to ask for a stay of the injunction," he added. "But it can still ask the court of appeals for the federal circuit for a stay of the injunction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a settlement -- something many bloggers have bandied about as a possible Microsoft exit strategy -- is very unlikely. "Any settlement [Microsoft] could have gotten before would have been a hell of a lot smaller than it is now," said Negrin. "It's almost too late to settle this with i4i. Microsoft's lost all around at the district court level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negrin called the $291 million judgment high. "But it's not insanely high. It's not beyond the pale," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis' injunction forbids Microsoft from selling Word 2003, Word 2007, Word for Mac 2008 and presumably Word 2010 when it ships next year, if the applications let people create custom XML documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has to appeal," Negrin noted. "They really don't have a choice. And given that the landscape of patent law may be changing, the federal circuit or the Supreme Court might be more inclined for relief."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working against Microsoft, however, is that it was hit with "willful infringement" of the i4i patent, the factor that contributed another $40 million in damages to what the jury awarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"i4i claims it presented internal e-mails within Microsoft where [employees] said that they would go ahead with the custom XML feature, even as they acknowledged the i4i patent," said Negrin. "And i4i maintains it even tried to pitch their technology to Microsoft, but Microsoft said, 'thanks, but no thanks.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court documents in the case refer to a 2001 meeting between i4i and Microsoft representatives, held at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash. headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has a reputation for squashing the little guys," Negrin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Aug 14 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) Japan group
refiner TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK (5012.T) said on Friday its middle

to 34 million kilolitres (584,000 barrels per day), equal to
about 12 percent of the nation's refining capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TonenGeneral's refinery run rate rose to the mid-70 percent
level in January-June, up from 72 percent the same period a year
ago.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/HELSINKI (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Nokia announced an alliance on Wednesday to bring business software to smartphones and counter the dominance of Research in Motion Ltd's BlackBerry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alliance between the world's largest software company and cell phone maker means the latest versions of Microsoft's Office applications, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and messaging, will be available on a range of Nokia cell phones, which make up 45 percent of the global smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies, at one time fierce rivals in the mobile telecommunications business, expect to offer Nokia phones running Office sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is giving some of our competitors -- let's spell it out, RIM -- a run for their money," said Nokia Executive Vice President Robert Andersson, in a telephone interview. "I don't think BlackBerry has seen the kind of competition we can provide them now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research in Motion's BlackBerry created the market for mobile e-mail, and its dominant position in the corporate sector, especially in North America, has protected it from Nokia's attempts to crack the market in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"RIM should be reasonably safe in the near-term because Nokia's presence in the U.S. is relatively small," said Neil Mawston from research firm Strategy Analytics. "Partnering more closely with Microsoft will help to raise Nokia's profile in the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alliance also aims to counter Google Inc's recent move into free online software, targeted at Microsoft's business customers, and the growing popularity of Apple Inc's iPhone device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that Nokia and Microsoft are both facing competitive challenges, most notably from Google," said John Jackson, an analyst at wireless research firm CCS Insight. "It makes sense for these two companies to work together to see if they can pool their competitive strengths to try and counter some of this pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alliance means Microsoft's new Office suite of applications could be available to a much wider audience than the users of Windows Mobile phones, which make up 9 percent of the smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see this as a great opportunity to deliver Office Mobile to 200 million Nokia smartphone customers," said Takeshi Numoto, an executive at Microsoft's Office business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said Microsoft is clearly looking at the largest possible audience with the Nokia deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal is a good win for Microsoft and it will surely now be hoping to upsell the Microsoft suite of operating systems into Nokia's possible portfolios of smartphones, mobile Internet devices and netbooks over the next couple of years," said Strategy Analytics' Mawston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies stressed that the new venture will not affect the future of Microsoft's Windows Mobile and Nokia's Symbian operating systems for smartphones. Executives said Nokia has no plans to make a Windows Mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are extremely committed to Symbian," said Andersson. "This is very clear. This is a multi-year collaboration building on Symbian. We are as committed as before, if not more," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 2.1 percent to $23.62 on Nasdaq while Nokia rose less than 1 percent to 9.30 euros in Helsinki. Shares in RIM were 0.5 percent lower in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle and Tarmo Virki in Helsinki, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; * Congo detains three employees of Freeport project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Held on suspicion of embezzlement &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joe Bavier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KINSHASA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Congolese authorities have
detained three employees of a giant Freeport-MacMoRan mining
project on suspicion of embezzling millions of dollars in a visa
and work permit scam, Congo's top prosecutor has told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two Congolese staff and Dirk Vanhooymissen, administrator at
Tenke Fungurume Mining (TFM) in which U.S.-based Freeport
(FCX.N) is majority stakeholder, are being held at the capital
Kinshasa's central prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are being prosecuted for misappropriation of public
funds and forgery," Democratic Republic of Congo's
prosecutor-general Octave Tela told Reuters late on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said they were under suspicion of involvement in a scheme
under which usual procedures were bypassed for paying visa and
work permit fees for TFM employees, adding that the sums in
question amounted to several million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Francois Saidi Hamici, director of immigration in Katanga
province, had also been detained in connection with in the
affair, Tela said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The TFM mine project in Congo's Katanga province is widely
considered to be the largest and highest-grade undeveloped
copper and cobalt project in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TFM said in a statement that the company was aware that the
three employees were being held for questioning in relation to
their alleged involvement in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government has not presented TFM with any evidence of
wrongdoing by TFM's employees. The company is cooperating with
government inquiries and conducting its own internal
investigation," TMF spokeswoman Margaret Kabamba said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She added that according to company policy, any lawyers
employed on behalf of the accused would not be authorised to
talk to the media. The employees themselves could not be reached
for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freeport has a 57.75 percent stake in the Tenke mine.
Toronto-listed Lundin Mining owns 24.75 percent with Congolese
state copper miner Gecamines holding 17.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The affair comes a week after Congo's government completed a
long-delayed review of 61 mining contracts, most of which were
agreed during the chaos of a 1998-2003 war and the three-year
transitional government that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials said Tenke has yet to agree to the rewriting of
the contract in accordance with new legislation, extra royalties
on additional production, and the integration of the state
company into management structures. The government gave the TFM
an additional 60 days in which to complete the process.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - In the press notes for Nick at Nite's new series "Glenn Martin, DDS," there's a quote from executive producer Michael Eisner, who says the series "re-envisions the classic family sitcom" and "delivers humor in a mature, sophisticated manner." But the former head of Disney must have been talking about another show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Martin" ain't no modern "Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," and the only universe in which "sophisticated" could be said to apply to it would be the one in which Judd Apatow is U.S. poet laureate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Martin" looks different from other sitcoms: It's stop-motion animation, and that allows for vibrant colors and textures. Still, in this era of claymation and Nick Park, the series' lack of fluidity calls to mind "Davey and Goliath" rather than "Wallace and Gromit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, it's utterly conventional. Martin, his wife and their two children (as well as his daughter's personal assistant) have hit the road in an RV and are having wacky adventures. Oh, and they've brought their -- um -- well-endowed (in the anus department) dog, K-9. Seriously. Just imagine the animator whose life's work has boiled down to re-creating a dog's oversized exit portal, and you get the sense of desperation that wafts off the entire series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin and company are on the road after their house burns down and, in the premiere, endure challenges including frustration with the children's addiction to technology, loss of car keys and the enigmatic Amish. There also is an uncalled-for characterization of Sarah Jessica Parker as a horse. What did she do to deserve this? Who did the Amish piss off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ignore the stilted jokes, the limp characterization, the complete lack of "re-imagining" of anything. Just understand this: "Martin" is an animated show with a laugh track. Imagination comes in handy, though, in trying to figure out how someone approved this concept, labored on this and then let it free into the world. Mr. Eisner, really. This is how you wanted to bring Tornante Animation into the world? You should know better. What would Mickey say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp is looking to the building blocks of our bodies -- DNA -- to be the structure of next-generation microchips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As chipmakers compete to develop ever-smaller chips at cheaper prices, designers are struggling to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial DNA nanostructures, or "DNA origami" may provide a cheap framework on which to build tiny microchips, according to a paper published on Sunday in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microchips are used in computers, cell phones and other electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first demonstration of using biological molecules to help with processing in the semiconductor industry," IBM research manager Spike Narayan said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically, this is telling us that biological structures like DNA actually offer some very reproducible, repetitive kinds of patterns that we can actually leverage in semiconductor processes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was a joint undertaking by scientists at IBM's Almaden Research Center and the California Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, the tinier the chip, the more expensive the equipment. Narayan said that if the DNA origami process scales to production-level, manufacturers could trade hundreds of millions of dollars in complex tools for less than a million dollars of polymers, DNA solutions, and heating implements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The savings across many fronts could add up significantly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the new processes are at least 10 years out. Narayan said that while the DNA origami could allow chipmakers to build frameworks that are far smaller than possible with conventional tools, the technique still needs years of experimentation and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp has been hoarding cash to better manage its balance sheet but investors worry that it could be building a war chest for a splashy acquisition similar to its failed 2004 bid for Walt Disney Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors value shares of Comcast at close to historical lows, as the top U.S. cable service provider's conservative balance sheet strategy has rekindled speculation that it wants to be a major player in the media content market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I talk to other investors, it's usually the first thing they ask about," said Chris Marangi, an analyst at Gabelli Co, which is long-term shareholder of Comcast. "They always bring up the 2004 bid Comcast made for Disney."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts made an audacious $54 billion bid for Disney five years ago, and the once traditional, family-run cable company has never quite shaken off the image of a media wannabe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors worry that Comcast might use growing cash reserves to go after names such as Viacom Inc, owner of MTV Networks and Paramount film studio, or Time Warner Inc, which owns CNN, HBO and Warner Bros despite little evidence of such a move, said analysts. Disney is no longer seen as a target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say such concerns are behind the 11 percent drop in Comcast's stock this year because not many big media deals have a history of boosting shareholder value. In comparison, the SP 500 Index has risen 12 percent in the year to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a wariness with investors about what Comcast is going to do," said Tuna Amobi, an analyst at Standard  Poor's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, a large bid for content seems unlikely given the slimmed-down trend in media. Time Warner this year spun off its cable service unit, purportedly killing the myth that content and distribution need to be combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even the executive who fended off the Disney bid still thinks Comcast could buy a big content play. In an interview with Broadcasting  Cable magazine last week, former Disney CEO Michael Eisner said of Comcast: "They may want to recapture their dreams of going after Disney, but not with Disney specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am sure Brian Roberts and Steve Burke (COO) have Time Warner high on their computer screens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner added that he had "zero information" on such a deal but it was enough evidence for some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Collins Stewart analyst Thomas Eagan said: "With Comcast, the concern for acquisition risk doesn't have to be logical."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comcast declined to comment on its MA strategy. The company is still more widely expected to be interested in smaller cable networks acquisitions than a mega-merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FREE CASH FLOW GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said uncertainty surrounding Comcast's MA strategy coupled with an earlier decision to slow the rate at which it returns cash to investors have hurt its valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comcast's enterprise value is just 4.9 times the average Wall Street forecast for 2010 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Traditionally, Comcast has traded at a ratio of about six to eight times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, most pay-TV valuations are currently under pressure. The No. 2 cable operator Time Warner Cable is trading at 5.1 times 2010 earnings while satellite TV operator DirecTV Group is even lower at 4.6 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Comcast is the only one of its peers whose investors consistently raise concerns about its MA strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its cheerleaders, Comcast is still about rising revenue, growing profits and widening margins. It is a defensive play during a recession when Americans are still paying for cable television. Its capital spending is falling, leading to fast-growing free-cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts think Comcast should use that free cash to accelerate significantly a share buyback, or increase meaningfully its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Comcast has left investors confused about what they're going to do with all this free cash flow," said cable industry veteran analyst Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research. "They should be clear and simply return it to shareholders and focus on being a cable company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Comcast's free-cash flow grew 56 percent to $3.7 billion, but it raised its already modest dividend by just $60 million leaving it with yield of 1.8 percent versus the average SP 500 yield of around 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comcast has taken actions that might reassure investors. It resumed its share buyback in the second quarter after suspending it last year when credit markets looked rocky. Bernstein estimates the repurchases implied an effective yield of around 4 percent. The company still had $3.9 billion left on its pre-approved program as of June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a blocking and tackling slow moving business. There's no Eureka here," said Kaufman Bros analyst Todd Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Yinka Adegoke; Editing by Tiffany Wu and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Aug 16 (Reuters) - International Business
Machines Corp (IBM.N) is looking to the building blocks of our
bodies -- DNA -- to be the structure of next-generation
microchips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As chipmakers compete to develop ever-smaller chips at
cheaper prices, designers are struggling to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Artificial DNA nanostructures, or "DNA origami" may provide
a cheap framework on which to build tiny microchips, according
to a paper published on Sunday in the journal Nature
Nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microchips are used in computers, cell phones and other
electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is the first demonstration of using biological
molecules to help with processing in the semiconductor
industry," IBM research manager Spike Narayan said in an
interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Basically, this is telling us that biological structures
like DNA actually offer some very reproducible, repetitive
kinds of patterns that we can actually leverage in
semiconductor processes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The research was a joint undertaking by scientists at IBM's
Almaden Research Center and the California Institute of
Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Right now, the tinier the chip, the more expensive the
equipment. Narayan said that if the DNA origami process scales
to production-level, manufacturers could trade hundreds of
millions of dollars in complex tools for less than a million
dollars of polymers, DNA solutions, and heating implements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The savings across many fronts could add up
significantly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the new processes are at least 10 years out. Narayan
said that while the DNA origami could allow chipmakers to build
frameworks that are far smaller than possible with conventional
tools, the technique still needs years of experimentation and
testing.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 16 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co's (KO.N) shares
are set to rise as much as 20 percent, Barron's said in its
Aug. 17 edition, pointing to the soft-drink maker's cost
cutting, position in fast-growing emerging markets and new
arrangements with its bottlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola has used its ample cash during the economic
downturn to take market share from rivals. It has cut costs, as
well as make changes to agreements with its bottlers that
analysts say will prompt them to help develop its brand, the
weekly paper wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite those strengths, Coke's shares are trading for 15
times analysts' 2009 earning estimates and 2010 forecasts,
close to the stock's lowest valuation in 20 years, Barron's
wrote, arguing the multiple should be of at least 17, implying
a stock price of $56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Including a 3.4 percent dividend yield, that would mean a
potential return of 20 percent over current Coke stock prices,
Barron's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Co shares closed trading on Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange at $48.47, up 0.73 percent, or 35 cents.

&lt;p&gt; * 30-day extension granted

 * Programmer accused of stealing code

 * Defense lawyer had sought deferred prosecution agreement

 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - A federal judge has granted
more time for the government to seek an indictment against or
work out a settlement with a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) programmer accused of stealing trade secrets, after the
programmer's lawyer said she wants the case dismissed.

 U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis delayed further
proceedings by 30 days until Sept. 16 to let the government and
Sergey Aleynikov, the former programmer, continue talks.

 Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti said talks to

 It is common for prosecutors to ask to extend a deadline
for seeking an indictment while plea negotiations are taking
place. The request does not mean a settlement is forthcoming.

 Prosecutors have accused Aleynikov of downloading stolen
Goldman proprietary code onto a home computer, a theft that
could cost the Wall Street bank millions of dollars.

 Aleynikov has told investigators that Goldman knew he had
worked on the relevant code from home previously without
complaint, and that he had no intent to steal.

 The FBI arrested Aleynikov on July 3 at Newark Liberty
International Airport. He was later freed on $750,000 bail

 At a hearing on Aug. 10, Aleynikov's lawyer said she would

 Such agreements let accused persons escape criminal charges
so long as they do not break the law for some period of time.

that my client never engaged in any improper behavior, was a

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft knew of the patent held by i4i as early as 2001, but instead set out to make the Canadian developer's software "obsolete" by adding a feature to Word, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent infringement case brought by Toronto-based i4i resulted in a $290 million judgment against Microsoft, and an injunction that bars Microsoft from selling Word 2003, Word 2007 and Word for Mac 2008 in their current forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 65-page summary opinion dated Aug. 11, U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Davis said that evidence presented during the May 2009 jury trial showed Microsoft had met with i4i executives as far back as 2001, knew of the firm's patent for XML editing, and yet did nothing to guarantee that its implementation of "custom" XML would not infringe the i4i patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis highlighted an internal Microsoft e-mail that was presented by i4i during the trial as "particularly damaging." The e-mail was sent by Martin Sawicki, a member of the XML for Word development team, as a reply to another Microsoft employee who forwarded a message from i4i that described both its software and patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We saw [i4i's products] some time ago, and met its creators," said Sawicki in the Jan. 23, 2003, e-mail. "Word 11 will make it obsolete. It looks great for XP though." Word 11 was the in-development code name for what was eventually dubbed Word 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The trial evidence revealed that Microsoft's intention to move competitors' XML products to obsolescence was quite bold," Davis said in his opinion. During the trial, i4i's expert testified that 80% of the market for the company's products was made moot when Microsoft added custom XML capabilities to Word 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My main concern with i4i is that if we do the work properly, there won't be a need for their product," stated another internal Microsoft e-mail submitted into evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last May, a Texas jury awarded i4i $200 million in damages for Microsoft's patent infringement. Davis added another $40 million in "enhanced damages" for Microsoft's "willful infringement," and additional damages and interest that brought the total to $290.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis slapped an injunction on Microsoft that blocks it from selling Word 2003, Word 2007, Word 2008 for Mac, and when it's released, Word 2010, unless the company changes or removes the word processing programs' custom XML feature. Microsoft has until Oct. 20 to comply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patent attorney said last week that Microsoft should be able to work around the injunction with an "easy technical" fix. "All Microsoft has to do is disable the custom XML feature, which should be pretty easy to do, then give that a different SKU number from what's been sold so it's easy to distinguish the two versions," said Barry Negrin, a partner with the New York firm Pryor Cashman LLP who has practiced patent and trademark law for 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, however, has said a work-around would be arduous. "Microsoft argues that redesigning current and upcoming Word products is an enormous task," said Davis in his summary. "Microsoft suggests that compliance with i4i's proposed injunction would take approximately five months to re-release the currently infringing products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the terms of the injunction, Microsoft does not have to retroactively update already-sold copies of Word, but only insure that versions sold after Oct. 20 do not infringe the i4i patent. "Thus, i4i's proposed injunction would have little effect, if any, on the daily operations of Microsoft's current customers," said Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had asked Davis to issue a stay of the injunction "pending reexamination of the [i4i] patent," but Davis denied the request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Microsoft also pitched the idea that its upcoming Word 2010 -- part of the Office 2010 that is now in preliminary public testing and slated to ship in the first half of next year -- be allowed to hide the custom XML functionality from users. The feature would be turned on at customer request. Microsoft said it would track the use of the feature and pay an ongoing royalty for each such use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This option would amount to a compulsory license," said Davis, "while ignoring i4i's ongoing injury by way of loss of brand recognition and market share. It is clearly improper, and Microsoft's request is denied."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis was clearly puzzled by the contradictions in Microsoft's allegations that it would take months to remove the feature from Word, but yet it could modify Word 2010 relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Davis took a shot at Microsoft's continued determination to do business as usual. "Even after several years of litigation and a jury verdict of infringement, Microsoft requests the ability to continue selling the accused products and release an upcoming product with the same infringing functionality," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said last week that it will appeal the verdict and the injunction. The company has not yet filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that Office file formats have been taken to task. Two weeks ago, Microsoft said it would add a file format "ballot" to Office 2010 as part of a campaign of concessions to ward off European Union (EU) antitrust regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

Here are highlights from Friday`sAnalyst Blog: 

CHL Updates 3G Subscriber Target

China Mobile (NYSE: CHL), the largest wireless operator in the world by
customer, has announced its updated 3G subscriber target. The company expects to
amass roughly 80 million 3G customers within 2 years of the first phase of
commercial service rollouts. This will enable the wireless giant to capture
approximately one-third of the Chinese 3G market. However, the new subscriber
target represents a decline from the original guidance of 100 million, largely
due to intense competition. 

China Mobile remains the leading player in the Chinese wireless market with 70%
market share, leapfrogging the second placed China Unicom (NYSE: CHU). However,
the overhaul of the Chinese telecom industry in late 2008 has intensified the
competitive scenario in the domestic wireless market with the addition of a new
market entrant China Telecom (NYSE: CHA). 

Upbeat on Chevron

Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) inked a five-year contract with Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:
RIG) for the use of a newly built ultra-deepwater drillship, Discoverer Clear
Leader, in the Gulf of Mexico. 

The state-of-the-art vessel is the first of two new drillships to be
commissioned for Chevron. The second vessel, Discoverer Inspiration, is expected
to be ready in early 2010.

&lt;p&gt;MONTERREY, Mexico--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Grupo Televisa, S.A.B.'s (Televisa) ratings as
follows: 

--Long Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'; 

--Local currency IDR at 'BBB+'; 

--National scale long-term rating at 'AAA(mex)'. 

The outlook Outlook for all ratings is SStable. 

In addition, Fitch affirmed the following ratings: 

--Outstanding balance of US$72 million of 8.0% senior notes due 2011 (originally
US$300 million) at 'BBB+'; 

--US$500 million 6% senior notes due 2018 at 'BBB+'; 

--US$600 million 6.625% senior notes due 2025 at 'BBB+'; 

--US$300 million 8.5% senior notes due 2032 at 'BBB+'; 

--MXP4,500 million 8.49% senior notes due 2037 at 'BBB+' and 'AAA(mex)'. 

Televisa's ratings reflect its strong business profile across operating
segments, solid cash flow generation, extended maturity profile and ample
liquidity. Televisa's business and credit profile remains strong as the major TV
broadcaster in Mexico and the largest Spanish speaking content producer
worldwide. Additionally, Televisa holds majority stakes in the largest pay TV
providers in Mexico through DTH operator Innova (Sky) and cable operators
Cablevision (Mexico City) and Cablemas (more than 45 cities in the country), in
addition to its 50% ownership in TVI, which operates in Monterrey. 

Televisa's cash flow generation remains strong despite the global economic
conditions, supported by its leading market positions in all of its business
divisions. In the Television Broadcasting segment Televisa has maintained
audience shares over 70% and EBITDA margin for the latest 12 months (LTM) ended
in June 30, 2009 of 49%, similar to those registered in 2008 and 2007. The
company's management continues to maintain a strict cost and expense control in
order to support profitability. Consolidated EBITDA margin for the LTM at June
2009 was 39.9%, similar to 40.5% at year-end 2008, but down from 42.6% in 2007. 

Televisa media business diversification strengthens its credit profile. For the
LTM ended at June 2009, Television Broadcasting represented 42% of total sales,
compared to 45% in 2008 and 51% in 2007; the Sky and cable/telecomm segments
represented 36% of total revenue compared to 33% and 27% in 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Televisa's growth strategy will continue to be focused on the
Mexican telecommunications industry, and on maintaining and expanding its
programming and content exports abroad, especially with Univision in the U.S. 

Televisa's credit measures remain strong. For the LTM ended June 30, 2009,
EBITDA to net interest was 9.4 times (x) compared to 12.8x in 2008, and net debt
to EBITDA for the same period was 0.1x, from -0.1x in 2008. As of June 2009,
Televisa had cash balances of approximately the equivalent of US$2.7 billion and
total debt of approximately the equivalent of US$2.8 billion. Total debt is made
up of a US$225 million bank loan at Cablevision, US$50 million in bank loans and
US$175 million in senior notes at Cablemas, US$266 million in bank loans and
US$90 million of satellite leases at Innova (Sky), approximately US$1.8 billion
in outstanding senior notes issued by Televisa and other bank debt for US$155
million. Debt maturities are manageable for Televisa with approximately US$230
million coming due in 2009-2011. In Fitch's view, the company's strong cash flow
generation in addition to its large cash balances will allow it to finance capex
and fund shareholders' distributions, keeping a conservative liquidity position.

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Microsoft's high-profile deal with handset maker Nokia could help keep aggressive software rivals at bay, but at the same time spell the end for its ailing Windows Mobile operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week Microsoft and Nokia unveiled an alliance taking Microsoft's Office applications -- including Word, Excel and PowerPoint -- to a range of Nokia cell phones from next year. The pact could counter moves by phone makers to use Google's free Android operating system, and keep Microsoft relevant in the mobile market despite a poor showing from Windows Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's possible that Microsoft has accepted it is not going to succeed in the mobile OS race, particularly now that HTC and Samsung seem to be sneaking into the Android party," said Tero Kuittinen, analyst at MKM Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may be better to help Nokia throw meatballs into Google's punch bowl -- Nokia still has a chance of spoiling the Android feast," Kuittinen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android has got a lot of traction in the cell phone industry, with many vendors planning to introduce phones using it, but so far only a few Android phones have reached consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft appears to be gambling that the benefit of gaining Nokia's scale with Office will offset the possible cost of losing sales among its existing Windows Mobile licensees," said Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radical steps were needed, not just to battle Android but also Nokia's own Symbian system, which it has opened to other handset makers for free use -- leaving Microsoft the only operating system maker charging license fees from handset makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But though Microsoft says its is committed to Windows Mobile, the Nokia deal is being read by many as a signal the company wants to limit its involvement. The arrangement also jeopardizes sales of smaller handset makers like HTC who have focused on Windows phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRUGGLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has tried to conquer the mobile operating system market for years, but despite heavy investments its success has been limited - and that was before the onset of the recession, which will trigger an overall market contraction this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company has not been able to challenge Symbian, the top mobile operating system, and Windows Mobile's market share has at best topped 10 percent compared with Symbian's market share of around 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last two years the success of RIM's Blackberry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and Apple's iPhone has pushed it to No 4 in the market, and Android has started to make headway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Nokia deal could marginalize Windows as a mobile operating system even further," said Kuittinen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All manufacturers in total sold just 3.8 million Windows phones in April-June quarter, according to research firm Gartner, giving Windows a 9 percent market share among smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This compares to Nokia selling 3.7 million of 5800 model, its first touch-screen phone, and Symbian sales totaling 21 million phones in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see this as a tacit admission from Microsoft that WinMo hasn't made the grade. I am becoming more concerned about its future and I worry that Windows Mobile 7 could even be the last throw of the dice," Gartner analyst Nick Jones wrote in a blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Imagine you're (Microsoft CEO) Steve Ballmer, and in two years time WinMo was still 4th in smartphone market share. How much longer would you keep throwing money at it?" Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia sold 17 million smartphones in the last quarter alone, including 4.7 million enterprise-focused E-series phones -- more than Windows Mobile total sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategy Analytics estimates Microsoft charges between $7 and $15 per phone from handset vendors -- meaning Windows Mobile created at best revenues of $57 million in the last quarter from $13.1 billion for the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All top handset makers, except Nokia, have Windows phones in their offering, but HTC is the only larger phone maker focusing on Windows Mobile. HTC is also expanding its offering, adding Google's Android phones to its portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss-making Sony Ericsson replaced on Monday its chief executive, with analysts saying the sidestep into making Windows phones was one of the key mistakes of previous management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kelvin Soh in Taipei, Editing by Sitaraman Shankar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has taken various actions on 17 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase
Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2008-C2. In addition, Fitch has assigned
Rating Outlooks as applicable. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the
end of this press release. 

The downgrades are the result of loss expectations on loans in special
servicing, as well as Fitch's prospective views regarding commercial real estate
market value and cash flow declines. Fitch forecasts potential losses of 14.6%
for this transaction should market conditions not recover. Today's rating
actions are based on losses of 14.1%, including 100% of the losses associated
with term defaults and any losses associated with maturities within the next
five years. Given the significant term to maturity, Fitch's actions only account
for 25% of the losses associated with maturities beyond five years. The bonds
with Negative Outlooks indicate classes that may be downgraded in the future
should full potential losses be realized. Fitch considers the Outlooks on the
super-senior classes to be Stable due to projected losses having limited impact
on credit enhancement when associated pay down is factored into the analysis. 

Fitch analyzed the transaction and calculated expected losses by assuming cash
flows on each of the properties decline 15% from year-end (YE) 2007 and property
values decline 35% from issuance. These loss estimates were reviewed in more
detail for loans representing 71% of the pool and, in certain cases, revised
based on additional information and/or property characteristics. Approximately
97% of the assumed losses were on loans reviewed in detail by Fitch. 

Approximately 16.4% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as
follows: 4.8% in 2012, 2.2% in 2013, and 9.5% in 2014. In 2017 and 2018, 83% of
the pool is scheduled to mature. 

Fitch identified 20 Loans of Concern (37.1%) within the pool, four of which
(22.3%) are delinquent and in special servicing. Six of the Fitch Loans of
Concern (29.7%) are within the transaction's top 15 loans (63.7%) by unpaid
principal balance. 

Losses are expected on eight of the loans within the top 15 (43.7%): four
(24.1%) of these loans are expected to default the term, while losses on the
remaining four loans (19.6%) are expected at maturity. Loss severities
associated with these loans range from 5% to 60%. 

The largest contributors to loss by loan balance are as follows: The Promenade
Shops at Dos Lagos (10.8%), The Westin Portfolio (9%), and The Regency Portfolio
(2.2%), all of which are specially serviced. Appraisal reductions and associated
monthly appraisal subordination entitlement reductions (ASER) are present for
The Promenade Shops at Dos Lagos and The Westin Portfolio. The cumulative ASERs
for these two properties are $1.4 million and $604,354, respectively. 

The Promenade Shops at Dos Lagos is comprised of a 345,847 square foot (sf)
lifestyle/entertainment retail center built in 2006/2007. The loan transferred
to special servicing in October 2008 for monetary default after the borrower
indicated the property was significantly impacted by the downturn in the economy
and slower than anticipated growth of the neighborhood residential real estate
market. Many tenants at the center have been struggling since origination and
have asked for rent reductions. It is also noted that these tenants have kickout
provisions in their leases that could be triggered in the next year. As of July
2009, the average sales per square foot at the center were 36% below the
pre-construction projection. Although the sponsor, Poag &amp; McEwen, is focusing on
lease re-negotiations, tenant retention, and improving sales volume, the special
servicer continues to move forward with foreclosure. 

The Westin Portfolio consists of the 487-room Westin La Polama in Tucson, AZ,
with a 27-hole Jack Nicklaus golf course and spa, and the 412-room oceanfront
Westin Hilton Head, in Hilton Head, SC. The loan transferred to special
servicing in October 2008 for monetary default. The properties have been
significantly affected by the weakening hotel sector and continue to experience
performance declines while both business and leisure travel remain low. The
servicer continues to negotiate with the borrower, and updated appraisals have
been received. The current appraisals indicate value is not sufficient to
support the outstanding debt amount. 

The Regency Portfolio transferred to special servicing in March 2009 for
imminent default after the borrower indicated it would be unable to make any
future debt service payments due to a substantial increase in vacancies and
declining rental values. The loan is secured by 20 properties - 11 retail, four
industrial, three flex, one medical office and one multi-family - primarily
located in Iowa. Management of the property has been transferred to a
third-party entity and a receiver has been appointed. The special servicer
continues to negotiate with the borrower. 

Fitch has downgraded, removed from Rating Watch Negative, and assigned Outlooks
and Loss Severity (LS) ratings to the following classes: 

--$116.5 million class AM to 'BBB-/LS4' from 'AAA'; Outlook Negative; 

--$61.2 million class AJ to 'B/LS5' from 'AAA'; Outlook Negative;

--$2.9 million class Q to 'CC/RR6' from 'B'; 

--$4.4 million class T to 'CC/RR6' from 'B-'. 

Fitch has also affirmed the following classes and Outlooks: 

--$19.8 million class A-1 at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--$68.1 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--$105.5 million class A-3 at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--$54.5 million class A-SB at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--$354.6 billion class A-4 at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--$145 million class A-FL at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--$64.7 million class A-1A at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp is looking to the building blocks of our bodies -- DNA -- to be the structure of next-generation microchips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As chipmakers compete to develop ever-smaller chips at cheaper prices, designers are struggling to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial DNA nanostructures, or "DNA origami" may provide a cheap framework on which to build tiny microchips, according to a paper published on Sunday in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microchips are used in computers, cell phones and other electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first demonstration of using biological molecules to help with processing in the semiconductor industry," IBM research manager Spike Narayan said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically, this is telling us that biological structures like DNA actually offer some very reproducible, repetitive kinds of patterns that we can actually leverage in semiconductor processes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was a joint undertaking by scientists at IBM's Almaden Research Center and the California Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, the tinier the chip, the more expensive the equipment. Narayan said that if the DNA origami process scales to production-level, manufacturers could trade hundreds of millions of dollars in complex tools for less than a million dollars of polymers, DNA solutions, and heating implements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The savings across many fronts could add up significantly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the new processes are at least 10 years out. Narayan said that while the DNA origami could allow chipmakers to build frameworks that are far smaller than possible with conventional tools, the technique still needs years of experimentation and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Correcting spelling of Freeport McMoRan)-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KINSHASA Aug 17 (Reuters) - U.S. miner Freeport McMoRan
Copper  Gold Inc. has agreed with Congolese authorities to pay
$16 million in fees and penalties in a settlement related to
procedures for getting visas and work permits for staff, the
company said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Congo's top prosecutor told Reuters last week three
employees of Tenke Fungurume Mining (TFM), in which Freeport
(FCX.N) holds a majority, had been detained on suspicion of
embezzling millions of dollars in a visa and work permit scam in
the central African country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "TFM has agreed to pay approximately $16 million in fees and
penalties associated with the settlement," Freeport spokesman
Bill Collier said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "TFM is committed to maintaining compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Congolese deputy prime minister Emile Bongeli
told Reuters the affair would not affect a government review of
Tenke's contract relating to its project in Congo's Katanga
province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mine is widely considered to be the largest and highest
grade undeveloped copper and cobalt project in the world.

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Microsoft's high-profile deal with handset maker Nokia could help keep aggressive software rivals at bay, but at the same time spell the end for its ailing Windows Mobile operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week Microsoft and Nokia unveiled an alliance taking Microsoft's Office applications -- including Word, Excel and PowerPoint -- to a range of Nokia cell phones from next year. The pact could counter moves by phone makers to use Google's free Android operating system, and keep Microsoft relevant in the mobile market despite a poor showing from Windows Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's possible that Microsoft has accepted it is not going to succeed in the mobile OS race, particularly now that HTC and Samsung seem to be sneaking into the Android party," said Tero Kuittinen, analyst at MKM Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may be better to help Nokia throw meatballs into Google's punch bowl -- Nokia still has a chance of spoiling the Android feast," Kuittinen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android has got a lot of traction in the cell phone industry, with many vendors planning to introduce phones using it, but so far only a few Android phones have reached consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft appears to be gambling that the benefit of gaining Nokia's scale with Office will offset the possible cost of losing sales among its existing Windows Mobile licensees," said Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radical steps were needed, not just to battle Android but also Nokia's own Symbian system, which it has opened to other handset makers for free use -- leaving Microsoft the only operating system maker charging license fees from handset makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But though Microsoft says its is committed to Windows Mobile, the Nokia deal is being read by many as a signal the company wants to limit its involvement. The arrangement also jeopardizes sales of smaller handset makers like HTC who have focused on Windows phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRUGGLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has tried to conquer the mobile operating system market for years, but despite heavy investments its success has been limited - and that was before the onset of the recession, which will trigger an overall market contraction this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company has not been able to challenge Symbian, the top mobile operating system, and Windows Mobile's market share has at best topped 10 percent compared with Symbian's market share of around 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last two years the success of RIM's Blackberry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and Apple's iPhone has pushed it to No 4 in the market, and Android has started to make headway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Nokia deal could marginalize Windows as a mobile operating system even further," said Kuittinen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All manufacturers in total sold just 3.8 million Windows phones in April-June quarter, according to research firm Gartner, giving Windows a 9 percent market share among smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This compares to Nokia selling 3.7 million of 5800 model, its first touch-screen phone, and Symbian sales totaling 21 million phones in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see this as a tacit admission from Microsoft that WinMo hasn't made the grade.

HTC is also expanding its offering, adding Google's Android phones to its portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss-making Sony Ericsson replaced on Monday its chief executive, with analysts saying the sidestep into making Windows phones was one of the key mistakes of previous management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kelvin Soh in Taipei, Editing by Sitaraman Shankar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Aug 17 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has
hired Ronan McCullough, the former head of debt syndicate in
Asia for Goldman Sachs (GS.N), for a similar role, three
sources familiar with the move said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; McCullough left Goldman Sachs at the end of last month,
said one of the sources, declining to be identified because he
was not authorised to discuss personnel moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Morgan Stanley, McCullough will report to Vinay Jayaram,
the Hong Kong-based co-head of fixed income capital markets for
Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined comment while
McCullough could not be immediately reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move comes as improved risk appetite and declining
credit spreads have spurred a surge in corporate and sovereign
debt issuance in the region this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This month, Malaysian state oil company Petronas [PET.UL]
sold $4.5 billion in dollar-denominated bonds and Islamic debt,
marking Asia's biggest corporate bond sale since a $5 billion
global issuance from Hutchison Whampoa (0013.HK).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Microsoft legal chief says ad deal "not risk free" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * "Impossible" to know how long antitrust review will take &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Says deal will make Google-led market more competitive &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Bill Rigby &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEATTLE, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has confidently described its planned search advertising deal with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) as a "win-win", but the software company's legal chief is prepared to concede that the outcome is not certain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal, struck in late July after months of talks, faces a tough regulatory review, and the possibility that it won't be enough to effectively challenge Google Inc (GOOG.O). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "For both companies, it would be right to say this is not risk-free," said Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith, in an interview last week. "I don't know of any investment that is." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal, struck on July 30, proposes that Microsoft's Bing becomes the search engine for both, while Yahoo focuses on attracting big advertisers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft shareholders generally welcomed the deal, but Yahoo's shares plunged as investors bemoaned the lack of an upfront payment from Microsoft or revenue guarantees in hard dollars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts pointed out that Microsoft still had an incentive to take market share from Yahoo, and that Yahoo's salesforce could end up selling ads they would not be paid for if clicked on in a Microsoft site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Smith acknowledged that such a situation was possible, but pushed attention to the potential upside.  "I do think there is a compelling business return that each company has a strong opportunity to generate for its shareholders," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LEGAL RISK &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The first hurdle is the antitrust review, which Microsoft and Yahoo do not expect to be completed until early 2010. Microsoft has made its initial Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust filing with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), according to Smith. The DoJ is expected to lead the review, but has not yet commented on the matter publicly.   "It's impossible to know for certain how long that review will take, obviously it's up to the governments involved," said Smith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft is confident it can persuade regulators that a stronger rival for Google is in the best interests of the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's widely understood by governments around the world that the search marketplace needs to become more competitive," said Smith, whose job it is to steer Microsoft through the antitrust approval process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The only way to do that is to bring the No. 2 and 3 providers together and thereby create a stronger counterbalance to a very dominant No. 1." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Antitrust experts generally expect the deal will get close scrutiny from regulators, but ultimately will be approved. [nN29273592] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    According to Microsoft's own research, Google has 78 percent of the U.S. market for paid search -- results pages featuring ad links, rather than just pure algorithmic results &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- compared with Yahoo's 16 percent and Microsoft's 6  -- compared with Yahoo's 16 percent and Microsoft's 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Yahoo, which must also make antitrust filings, will make a similar case to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We feel good about what advertisers and publishers and users are going to see here, which is really a long-term sustainable opportunity for some competition to Google, which has been quite dominant," said Michael Callahan, Yahoo's general counsel, in an interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Callahan says the Justice Department's opposition to a planned search-ad partnership between Yahoo and Google last year -- which ultimately led to the companies abandoning the plan -- will have no bearing on the Microsoft deal. "These are not similar types of transactions," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SCALE BUSINESS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, which vehemently opposed the Yahoo-Google tie-up last year, says the Justice Department was right to object to the deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The most important thing is not what any single private company argued last year, it's what the DoJ concluded," said Smith. "And what the DoJ concluded last year was that Google already had a dominant position in this marketplace." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Alone, Microsoft cannot effectively challenge Google, said Smith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We pointed out a year ago that despite our size and our financial resources, we did not have a profitable search business. Today we do not have a profitable search business." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Microsoft-Yahoo tie-up is an "important step" in building a viable search business, he added, as it helps them gain the scale necessary to play a significant role in the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's like having an auction house," said Smith. "If no one comes to your auction you don't have the kind of business that causes people to want to sell products at your auction house.

&lt;p&gt;Discoveries Build On Chevron`s Leading Position in the Highly Prospective
Carnarvon Basin
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Australia Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX),
today announced two natural gas discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin offshore
Western Australia. The discoveries are located in Australia`s premier
hydrocarbon basin, where Chevron is the leading lease holder. 

The Clio-2 well, located 90 miles (150 kilometers) off the coast of Western
Australia, is situated in 3,200 feet (990 meters) of water and drilled to a
total depth of 14,400 feet (4,405 meters). The well discovered 375 feet (115
meters) of net gas pay. 

The company also made a discovery with the Kentish Knock-1 well. Drilled in
approximately 4,000 feet (1,200 meters) of water to a total depth of
approximately 8,300 feet (2,500 meters), the well encountered approximately 110
feet (34 meters) of net gas pay. The discovery at the Kentish Knock prospect is
located approximately 185 miles (300 kilometers) from the Western Australian
coastline. 

"These two gas finds add to Chevron`s significant gas interests in Australia,"
said George Kirkland, executive vice president, Global Upstream and Gas, Chevron
Corporation. "Our exploration success, combined with our development plans for
our Gorgon and Wheatstone projects, underpin our future growth prospects in
Australia." 

The Clio-2 well is in the WA-205-P permit area. It is located near the
significant Clio-1 discovery made by Chevron in 2006. Chevron Australia is the
operator with 66.66 percent interest while Shell Development (Australia) holds
the remaining interest. 

The Kentish Knock-1 well is located in the WA-365-P permit area in the Exmouth
Plateau, the deepwater frontier of the Carnarvon Basin. Chevron Australia also
operates permit WA-365-P with a 50 percent interest while Shell Development
(Australia) holds the remaining interest. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Today, Global Healthcare Alliance becomes the first U.S. revenue cycle
management company to align its practice management system, globalcentaraSM,
with the expertise of Microsoft`s&#174; advanced, Web-based development platform,
SilverLight&#8482;. 

The most comprehensive and flexible Web-based development toolbox available,
SilverLight&#8482; provides the next generation of media integration - creating rich,
interactive experiences for users. Global`s adaptation of SilverLight&#8482; positions
globalcentaraSM to become the most powerful practice management solution
available for health care providers. 

"SilverLight&#8482; enables Global to incorporate our proven, Web-based globalcentara
product with the robust power and data speed of a server-based program," said
John Adams, president and chief executive officer of Global. "The end result is
a user environment unlike any product on the market." 

Visually dynamic and designed to function intuitively with the user, Global`s
modernized service provides real-time information in an organic, on-screen
environment supported by familiar Microsoft Common User Interface tools such as
drag and click functions and easy access windows, menus and tool bars. The
result is quicker access to important information and improved on-screen
organization and customization. 

The first thing globalcentaraSM users will notice is how easy it is to move
between the different office workflow product features. They can simultaneously
manage and move between several applications, including multiple doctors`
schedules, patient processing, insurance information and finance functions, such
as posting payments and submitting claims. 

"Global is ahead of the technology curve by utilizing Silverlight to deliver one
of the richest web-based health care practice management systems available
today," said Christopher McConn, director of business development for Idea
Integration, a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner and interactive design agency.
"By using SilverLight to achieve a high level of usability, intuitive
interfaces, and standardization so desperately needed in this industry, Global
is going to change the way patient data and health care revenue cycle management
are administered." 

Global`s developers used the company`s extensive knowledge of health care work
flow operations to create modifications based on best practices and using
technology that works how users think. They then went through extensive product
testing with existing clients to ensure the updated globalcentaraSM platform
delivered on its promise to empower users and enhance productivity. 

Global plans to debut the enhanced globalcentaraSM platform at the Medical Group
Management Association (MGMA) 2009 Annual Conference in October. Advanced demos
of the product are available by calling (866) 458-6076.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights IBM (NYSE: IBM) as the Bull of the Day and Cost
Plus, Inc. (Nasdaq: CPWM) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on Colonial BancGroup Inc. (NYSE: CNB), BB
Corporation (NYSE: BBT) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

IBM's (NYSE: IBM) second quarter results were above the Zacks Consensus
Estimates, driven by higher gross margins and operating cost controls. The
company also raised its 2009 EPS by 50 cents to $9.70. 

As a result of its large non-US revenue base, IBM has been better insulated from
the recent weakness in the U.S. economy than many of its peers. We believe that
with the strong liquidity position, operational efficiency and improving
profitability, IBM is a defensive play in the current environment and is well
positioned to benefit from the market recovery. 

We maintain our Outperform rating on the stock based on strong fundamentals,
substantial free cash flow, solid Services businesses and earnings momentum.
However we remain cautious on currency fluctuations, which are taking a toll on
revenue and may be critical to earnings growth over the next two years. 

Bear of the Day: 

First-quarter sales and earnings per share were slightly above our estimates for
Cost Plus, Inc. (Nasdaq: CPWM). Even so, the company's sales declined 9%
year-on-year and it reported a net loss of $20 million. 

The company is closing stores, cutting costs and trying to preserve cash, but
those moves will do little to reverse its weak sales trends and merchandise
margins. In addition, management's guidance for the second quarter cautioned
investors to prepare for more of the same. 

Cost Plus expects same-store sales to decrease 9.5%-14.5% and a pre-tax loss
from continuing operations of $14-$21 million. We have an Underperform rating on
CPWM shares. Our six-month target price is $0.50.

Biggest Bank Failure of 2009

Five more banks including Colonial BancGroup Inc. (NYSE: CNB) were shuttered by
U.S. regulators on Friday. This takes the total number of failed federally
insured banks in this year to 77, compared to 25 in 2008 and 3 in 2007. 

Alabama-based lender Colonial was the biggest financial institution to fail this
year, with about $25 billion assets and 346 branches in Florida, Alabama,
Georgia and Texas. This is the largest financial institution failure since the
shut-down of Seattle-based thrift Washington Mutual in September 2008, which had
about $307 billion in assets. 

The four other banks were Community Bank of Nevada, Las Vegas; Community Bank of
Arizona, Phoenix; Union Bank, Gilbert, Ariz; and Dwelling House Savings and
Loan, Pittsburgh. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has been
appointed receiver of these banks. 

Out of Colonial`s $25 billion assets, the FDIC has approved the sale of about
$22 billion to BB Corporation (NYSE: BBT) along with $20 billion in deposits.
FDIC will hold the rest of about $3 billion assets, which will be sold later. 

As of June 30, 2009, Community Bank of Nevada had assets of $1.52 billion and
deposits of $1.38 billion, while Community Bank of Arizona had assets of $158.5
million and deposits of $143.8 million as of June 30 and Union Bank had assets
of $124 million and deposits of $112 million as of June 12. Dwelling House had
$13.4 million in assets and $13.8 million in deposits as of March 31. 

Colonial had been feeling significant pressure. It has been under criminal
investigation by the Justice Department in connection with alleged accounting
irregularities, and a civil search by the Securities and Exchange Commission
relating to accounting issues and the bid for federal bailout funds. 

On August 13, Colonial's troubles escalated as a federal court in Miami froze $1
billion of its assets in response to a lawsuit filed by Bank of America
Corporation (NYSE: BAC).

&lt;p&gt;PERTH/BEIJING (Reuters) - Australia and China struck their biggest trade deal on Tuesday, as the world's two most valuable listed oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and PetroChina (601857.SS), reached a $41 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon will supply LNG from the massive A$50 billion Gorgon LNG project on Australia's northwest coast, expected to have an output of 15 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is the operator of the project with a 50 percent stake, while Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) each own a 25 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement with PetroChina follows Exxon's A$10 billion ($8.26 billion) deal with India's Petronet (PLNG.BO) and means that buyers have now been found for Exxon's entire share in the Gorgon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes at a time of trade and political tension between China and Australia and as China looks to soak up raw materials and energy supplies to fuel growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a statement about the nature of our two economies and the fact that Australia is important to China, just like China is important to Australia," Australian Resources Minister Martin Ferguson told Reuters in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the pact, PetroChina will become the largest buyer of gas from Gorgon, receiving 2.25 mtpa of gas from the project for 20 years. That is on top of PetroChina's previous 20-year agreement signed with Shell for 1 mtpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the regulatory approval process nearing completion in Australia, all of the Gorgon partners could officially approve the massive project as early as next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The A$50 billion contract to supply PetroChina is a foundation contract that will assist in getting the Gorgon LNG project to final investment, and that again would represent the biggest stand-alone project in Australia's history," said Ferguson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUSINESS GOOD FOR RELATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diplomatic crisis between Australia and China was largely caused by China's arrest of an Australian citizen in an investigation into iron ore pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China and Australia's No. 3 miner announced an iron ore deal on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal between Exxon and PetroChina, both of which have market capitalizations in excess of $300 billion, may go even farther toward mending the rift between China and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferguson said China had approved the deal, and does not expect political opposition in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the project is expected to start producing gas in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just think about it. One project will see about 6,000 Australian workers at the peak of construction and buy about $30 billion worth of Australian goods and services over the next few years," Ferguson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has two operating LNG terminals, Dapeng and Fujian, with the capacity to import over 6 mtpa of LNG. The aim is to increase that amount to 50 mtpa by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source with Chevron said the company was in talks to supply a similar volume of Gorgon LNG to PetroChina's smaller rival, CNOOC (0883.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Exxon, the contract could yield dividends when it seeks other deals with China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's shares slid two cents to $66.53 on the New York Stock Exchange in late afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are playing for longer-term relationships, not a one-night stand," said Oppenheimer  Co analyst Fadel Gheit.

&lt;p&gt; * PetroChina and Exxon Mobil seal new 2.25 mln tonne deal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Deal brings PetroChina's Gorgon supply to 3.25 mtpa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Biggest trade deal ever between Australia and China
 (Adds analyst's comment, Exxon share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Fayen Wong and Tom Miles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PERTH/BEIJING, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Australia and China
struck their biggest trade deal on Tuesday, as the world's two
most valuable listed oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
and PetroChina (601857.SS), reached a $41 billion liquefied
natural gas (LNG) agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon will supply LNG from the massive A$50 billion Gorgon
LNG project on Australia's northwest coast, expected to have an
output of 15 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is the operator of the project with a
50 percent stake, while Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
(RDSa.L) each own a 25 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement with PetroChina follows Exxon's A$10 billion
($8.26 billion) deal with India's Petronet (PLNG.BO) and means
that buyers have now been found for Exxon's entire share in the
Gorgon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It comes at a time of trade and political tension between
China and Australia and as China looks to soak up raw materials
and energy supplies to fuel growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a statement about the nature of our two economies and
the fact that Australia is important to China, just like China
is important to Australia," Australian Resources Minister
Martin Ferguson told Reuters in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the pact, PetroChina will become the largest
buyer of gas from Gorgon, receiving 2.25 mtpa of gas from the
project for 20 years. That is on top of PetroChina's previous
20-year agreement signed with Shell for 1 mtpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the regulatory approval process nearing completion in
Australia, all of the Gorgon partners could officially approve
the massive project as early as next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The A$50 billion contract to supply PetroChina is a
foundation contract that will assist in getting the Gorgon LNG
project to final investment, and that again would represent the
biggest stand-alone project in Australia's history," said
Ferguson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a Factbox on Gorgon, please click on [ID:nSYD428849]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUSINESS GOOD FOR RELATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The diplomatic crisis between Australia and China was
largely caused by China's arrest of an Australian citizen in an
investigation into iron ore pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China and Australia's No. 3 miner announced an iron ore
deal on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal between Exxon and PetroChina, both of which have
market capitalizations in excess of $300 billion, may go even
farther toward mending the rift between China and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ferguson said China had approved the deal, and does not
expect political opposition in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the project is expected to start producing gas in
2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Just think about it. One project will see about 6,000
Australian workers at the peak of construction and buy about
$30 billion worth of Australian goods and services over the
next few years," Ferguson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China has two operating LNG terminals, Dapeng and Fujian,
with the capacity to import over 6 mtpa of LNG. The aim is to
increase that amount to 50 mtpa by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source with Chevron said the company was in talks to
supply a similar volume of Gorgon LNG to PetroChina's smaller
rival, CNOOC (0883.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Exxon, the contract could yield dividends when it seeks
other deals with China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's shares slid two cents to $66.53 on the New York
Stock Exchange in late afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are playing for longer-term relationships, not a
one-night stand," said Oppenheimer  Co analyst Fadel Gheit.
"Obviously it's a very large market, the fastest growing one in
the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CNOOC's Dapeng terminal imports gas from the North West
Shelf project in Australia, and preliminary deals have been
signed for supply from various proposed Australian projects to
terminals under construction in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's gas consumption is set to nearly triple over the
next 10 years, potentially rising to around 18 billion cubic
feet per day by 2020 and making the country the world's No. 3
gas market after Russia and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of that demand will come from domestic production, but
given an expected government-driven rise in domestic gas prices
soon, LNG could become an attractive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Prices are relatively low so the Chinese are in a good
position in terms of bargaining large supply deals," said
Kenneth Medlock, an energy fellow at the Baker Institute for
Public Policy at Rice University in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the volume it is buying, PetroChina has not secured
a minority stake in the project, pointing to buoyant demand for
long-term LNG supplies despite the current economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a long list of around a dozen proposed LNG projects in
the Asia-Pacific region, buyers are also eager to lock in
supplies as quickly as possible from projects that are most
likely to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a Factbox of planned terminals, please click on

&lt;p&gt;Photo Release -- Dr. Walter Lowe to Lead Orthopaedics At UT Medical School and
Memorial Hermann-TMC

HOUSTON, Aug. 18, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Walter R. Lowe, M.D., the new head of
the orthopaedic programs at The University of Texas Health Science Center at
Houston and Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center, has been treating Houston's
top professional and college athletes for more than a decade. He is a team
physician for the Houston Texans and Houston Rockets, as well as the University
of Houston, Strake Jesuit College Preparatory and North Shore Senior High
School.

A photo accompanying this release is available at
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/prs/?pkgid=6518

Lowe has been named the new chairman of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at
The University of Texas Medical School at Houston and the chief of Orthopedics
at Memorial Hermann-TMC. Lowe, an orthopaedic surgeon who graduated from the UT
Medical School in 1983, will assume his new positions Aug. 15.

"Dr. Lowe has distinguished himself in the field of orthopaedic surgery and
sports medicine," said Giuseppe Colasurdo, M.D., dean of the UT Medical School.
"I am certain he will build an extraordinary department with emphasis on the
highest standards of patient care and service. And I am confident that he is
particularly committed to the advancement of our educational programs."

"My No. 1 priority is to make sure the orthopaedic surgery residents get the
best training possible," Lowe said. "I want to grow the department and recruit
top faculty members. Memorial Hermann and the UT Medical School have the
commitment to do just that."

Lowe, who has been a medical director of the Memorial Hermann Sports Medicine
Institute since it opened in 2007, is looking forward to the challenges
associated with his new role at its flagship hospital.

"Dr. Lowe's skill as a surgeon, his broad sports medicine experience and his
commitment to exceptional patient care have been and will continue to be a great
asset to Memorial Hermann-TMC and to our patients," said Juanita Romans, CEO of
the Memorial Hermann-TMC Campus.

Lowe specializes in the care of injured knees, shoulders and elbows.

Lowe studied under legendary baseball doctor Frank Jobe, M.D., who in 1974
pioneered a procedure to repair injured pitching arms called the "Tommy John
surgery." John was the first major league baseball player to receive the
operation technically known as an ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction.

The son of a football coach, Lowe played high school football in Las Vegas,
N.M., and tennis at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colo.

Helping athletes return to the football field or basketball court is gratifying,
said Lowe, a native of Denton, Texas. "You are giving people back a lifestyle
and a way of life," he said.

Lowe completed a fellowship at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in Los
Angeles, an internship at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth and a
residency at Tarrant County Affiliated Hospitals in Fort Worth. He is a member
of the National Football League Physicians Society, the Association of
Professional Team Physicians, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,
American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine and the American College of
Sports Medicine. He is the only active member in Houston of the ACL Study Group,
an international organization consisting of a select group of highly-specialized
physicians. Lowe also served as a team physician for the Houston Oilers before
they moved to Tennessee in 1997 and for the Houston Comets, which suspended
operations last year.

Lowe's medical education experience includes 14 years on the faculty of Baylor
College of Medicine, where he has been serving as director of the Baylor Sports
Medicine Fellowship and chief of the Sports Medicine Section.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects paragraph 3 to change source of quote to Bruce
Wasserstein, not Tom Tuft)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 18 (Reuters) - Eyeing a fresh wave of public offerings,
Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N) has hired former Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) equity-markets banker Tom Tuft, the Wall Street Journal
said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tuft, who will join Lazard in November, was involved with
several high-profile initial public offerings in 1990s,
including that of Estee Lauder (EL.N), according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our view is that generally over the next five to six
years, there will be a re-equitization of the American capital
structure," Lazard CEO Bruce Wasserstein told the paper. "So if
you are in our role of giving advice, giving the best advice is
very important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lazard, which does not handle actual underwriting, will
name Tuft as the chairman of its global capital markets
advisory group, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The paper said Tuft's Goldman exit was announced internally
last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lazard and Goldman could not be immediately reached for
comment outside regular U.S. business hours.

&lt;p&gt;Court Fines Chevron Lawyer for Causing Delay; Criminal Prosecution Gains Steam
LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
An Ecuadorian trial judge dealt Chevron another setback when he fined the
company`s local counsel for trying to delay the end of a $27 billion
environmental trial and referred a court-ordered report to Ecuador`s national
prosecutor for possible use in a criminal prosecution of the company, according
to court papers made available this week. 

The fine, imposed on Chevron lawyer Patricio Campuzano, was the result of a
regular practice by the oil company of re-filing legal motions that already had
been denied, according to an order issued by trial judge Juan Nunez. A final
decision in the case was expected in November but because of Chevron`s delays
will now happen in 2010, said lawyers for the Amazon communities that are suing
the company. 

The judge also granted a request from the Fiscalia, Ecuador`s national
prosecutor office, for a certified copy of a court-ordered damages assessment
that contains evidence that oil sites certified by Chevron as remediated in the
mid-1990s are extensively contaminated. The prosecutor is investigating two
Chevron lawyers and seven former Ecuadorian government officials on charges they
conspired to lie about the results of the limited clean-up in exchange for a
release from liability from government claims. 

The damages report, which contains 4,000 pages of data and was prepared by a
team of 15 experts, found that Chevron could be liable for up to $27.3 billion
for dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways and
abandoning more than 900 unlined waste pits when it operated a large oil
concession in the Amazon rainforest from 1964 to 1990. Five indigenous groups
have been decimated by the contamination, while experts believe a clean-up would
dwarf the largest decontamination effort ever undertaken. 

In the order, Judge Nunez found that Chevron was filing repetitive motions to
"deceive" the court so it would commit errors that the company could then use as
part of an appeals process. Chevron already has announced that it expects an
adverse decision by the trial court. 

Lawyers for the rainforest communities had a mixed reaction to the court`s
decision. 

"This latest order nails Chevron for abusing the judicial process in Ecuador but
it comes too late," said Julio Prieto, an Ecuadorian lawyer representing the
rainforest residents in the lawsuit. "For far too long the trial court in
Ecuador has permitted Chevron`s lawyers to undermine the due process rights of
the local communities to delay a final resolution of the claims. In fact,
Chevron`s main strategy is to delay because it has no credible defense to the
underlying charges." 

The judge`s decision comes at a time when Chevron is reeling from several legal
setbacks in various U.S. courts. 

In July, Chevron`s U.S. lawyers abandoned a lawsuit in U.S. federal court in New
York that attempted to shift liability in the case to Petroecuador, Ecuador`s
state-owned oil company. Chevron had determined it could not win the case and
preferred to fold its cards early rather than suffer additional embarrassment,
said Prieto. 

Chevron has been dealt five straight defeats in U.S. federal courts over the
Ecuador issue, including one in June when the Supreme Court turned down a
Chevron petition. 

The fine imposed on Campuzano -- five dollars - was more symbolic than
substantive and was not a sufficient deterrent for Chevron, said Prieto. 

Prieto said Chevron`s delaying tactics include the following:

* Chevron is currently "finishing" two expert reports on the impact of oil
contamination on fish and agriculture, even though the company had the right to
submit them since 2003. 
* The trial judge this year allowed Chevron to conduct eight redundant field
inspections even though the inspections phase of the trial began in 2004 and
ended in 2006. Reports from the eight inspections are still pending. 
* Chevron induced a local Ecuadorian army official to fabricate a security
threat against Chevron lawyers to delay a key inspection where members of an
indigenous group planned to testify. Chevron was never sanctioned. 
* The court has permitted Chevron to continually submit irrelevant but
time-consuming evidence, such as soil samples taken far from contaminated
sites.

The lawsuit, originally filed in U.S. federal court in 1993, was transferred to
Ecuador at Chevron`s request. Chevron agreed to jurisdiction and to abide by any
ruling in Ecuador as a condition of the transfer, which took place in 2002. 

Once the evidence in the Ecuador trial pointed to Chevron`s culpability, the
company launched a public relations and lobbying campaign to delay the case and
to discredit the Ecuador courts that it had previously praised.

the brokerage cut to "neutral" from "buy".&lt;/p&gt;

attractive view on regulated utilities, citing strong valuation
on longer-term metrics and expected improvement in demand

and small-cap companies versus the larger ones among the
regulated entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The more commodity oriented diversified utilities,

larger cap regulated names," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the alerts, please double click [ID:nWNBB6751]

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Eyeing a fresh wave of public offerings, Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N) has hired former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) equity-markets banker Tom Tuft, the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuft, who will join Lazard in November, was involved with several high-profile initial public offerings in 1990s, including that of Estee Lauder (EL.N), according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our view is that generally over the next five to six years, there will be a re-equalization of the American capital structure," Tuft told the paper. "So if you are in our role of giving advice, giving the best advice is very important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lazard, which does not handle actual underwriting, will name Tuft as the chairman of its global capital markets advisory group, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper said Tuft's Goldman exit was announced internally last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lazard and Goldman could not be immediately reached for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ajay Kamalakaran in Bangalore; Editing by Valerie Lee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PowerBuilder 12 Offers the First Migration Path From Win32 to .NET Framework;
Comprehensive New IDE Introduces Extensive .NET Framework Application
Development Functionality Including Windows Presentation Foundation
DUBLIN, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Sybase, Inc. (NYSE:SY), an industry leader in delivering enterprise and mobile
software, today announced the beta availability for PowerBuilder 12, a new
generation of Sybase`s proven development tool. This latest release of the
award-winning PowerBuilder empowers developers with the easiest, fastest and
most cost-effective path to the Microsoft .NET Framework, the Microsoft Windows
component that supports building and running the next generation of
applications. 

"PowerBuilder 12 is one of the most significant releases in the product`s
history," said David Tong, vice president of Engineering, Sybase. "We have
recognized the need in the PowerBuilder community for a versatile and open .NET
development tool and have responded with a solution that empowers developers to
quickly and easily deliver .NET Framework-based applications without limitations
via end-to-end managed code." 

Sybase will ship PowerBuilder with two self-contained modules, one designed for
Windows 32-based development and a new comprehensive module for developing
Windows Presentation Foundation-based applications on top of the Microsoft
Visual Studio shell. 

"By leveraging the Visual Studio Shell, Sybase is providing its community of
developers with even more flexibility in building and deploying data driven
applications that target the Windows platform," said Matt Carter, Group Product
Manager, Visual Studio, Microsoft. "Microsoft is pleased to be working with
Sybase to enable custom tools such as PowerBuilder." 

PowerBuilder 12 works with the Visual Studio infrastructure to expand
productivity for the .NET Framework, enhancing development of Windows
Presentation Foundation applications. With the release of PowerBuilder 12,
Sybase becomes the only vendor to allow customers to maximize their existing
investment in code and skills with a solution that converts Win32 code to the
.NET Framework seamlessly and removes the pain of expensive migration. 

PowerBuilder 12 continues the tradition of simplifying application development
by taking advantage of the features in the Visual Studio shell, and going to the
next level by enhancing ease of use and adding new functionality not available
in any other IDE for the .NET Framework. Sybase's patented DataWindow has been
completely rewritten to natively support Windows Presentation Foundation and
allow for deployment of fully managed code in .NET Framework-based applications.


PowerBuilder 12 provides key new features and benefits, including:

* One tool, two modules that provide comprehensive support for both Win32 and
.NET Framework development - build and maintain Win32 applications and migrate
existing code to Windows Forms, WebForms, ASP.NET and Windows Presentation
Foundation, as well as build new Windows Presentation Foundation-based
applications and deploy 100 percent managed code, all with existing PowerBuilder
skills 
* The ability to leverage the extensive library of plug-ins the Visual Studio
ecosystem provides and third-party components from commercial, open source and
freeware vendors 
* Open and heterogeneous database support for access to virtually any database
management system (DBMS) 
* A newly rewritten DataWindow that natively supports Windows Presentation
Foundation as well as many new presentation styles for an enhanced user
experience 
* Visual Inheritance for Windows Presentation Foundation windows and User
Objects 
* Drag-and-drop capability from the Solution Explorer, providing immediate
access to properties and methods of controls graphically added to Windows
Presentation Foundation windows

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has joined forces with Citrix, HP and Intel as a sponsor of Power IT Down Day, a challenge to government employees to turn off their PCs, monitors and printers when they leave work on Aug. 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chill out: Five ways to cut back on data-center power consumption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first year Microsoft has participated in Power IT Down Day, which company officials say is part of a broader effort by the software giant to address energy usage on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whole idea behind Power IT Down Day is to raise awareness for the user and make it easier for the user to reduce energy consumption," says Kim Nelson, executive director of e-government for Microsoft and a former CIO for the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone can participate in Power IT Down Day although the event is targeted at federal workers.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's participation in Power IT Down Day comes at a time when the company is promoting the new power management features in Windows 7. These capabilities build upon enterprise-wide power management settings available in Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 7 has a number of enhancement that will make it easier for the user to enjoy greater energy savings not just on Power IT Down Day but everyday," Nelson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Windows 7 will feature an Adaptive Display Brightness Feature that allows users to automatically dim displays after a specified period of time, similar to how a laptop display automatically goes into sleep mode when it is on battery power. Windows 7 also supports displays with ambient light sensors so that the brightness automatically adjusts depending on external light conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 also has several features aimed at reducing the amount of power used by CPUs. These include reducing the number of services that run in the background such as Bluetooth for wireless devices. These services will now be triggered as needed instead of running all the time. This will allow the CPU to remain idle for longer periods of time, thereby requiring less power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Windows 7 will offer troubleshooting advice for network managers that will allow them to diagnose power usage and identify ways to reduce it. The latest version of Windows also makes it easier for administrators to wake up PCs that are in sleep mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're trying to make it a lot easier for the typical user to get the most power savings possible," Nelson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson says Microsoft is encouraging its government customers to participate in Power IT Down Day as a way of focusing attention on the power savings that can come from desktops as well as servers.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson says government agencies are more focused on reducing IT-related power usage than many industry segments because of a presidential order signed in 2007 that requires agencies to reduce their energy consumption by 3% per year or 30% total by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The focus clearly has been on the data center&#8230;but as people look for ways to meet the executive order, they're going to have to look at the desktop," Nelson says. "We think our products can help our customers make significant reductions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson points to a Natural Resources Defense Council report that says the power management settings in Vista would save customers around $50 per year in energy usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lots of our users didn't adopt Vista. We think that going into next year, a large number of our users will go from Windows XP directly to Windows 7. We think there's a significant opportunity for us as a company to help our customers drive down their energy usage," Nelson adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's plan to "sandbox" documents in the next version of Office looks like a "very good step forward," according to one security analyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft revealed more details about a new security feature in Office 2010, dubbed "Protected View," that is designed to shut down the popular hacker tactic of feeding users rigged Word, Excel and PowerPoint files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a good move," said John Pescatore, Gartner's primary security analyst. "It gets away from the 'training' people have that makes them ignore pop-up warnings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protected View isolates Word, Excel and PowerPoint files in a read-only environment that prevents malware -- which has piggybacked on Office documents for years -- from harming the PC or hijacking the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The file is being opened within a sandboxed instance of the application -- Word, Excel, PowerPoint -- and if there was malicious code present in the file, the goal is that code would not be able to find a way to tamper with your documents, change your profile or other user settings," said Vikas Malhotra, a Microsoft security program manager, in a entry to a company blog last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If nothing else, we'll stay just as secure as before, but [Protected View] should cut down on the messages to the users," said Pescatore, talking about the kind of alerts current versions of Office display when users are about to open an untrusted document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within Outlook, for example, users who open an attachment now face a dialog box that asks, "Would you like to open the file or save it to your computer?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is extremely hard to answer this question without seeing the contents of the file first," acknowledged Malhotra. "In Office 2010, we have removed this dialog and instead we now just open the file directly in Protected View ....This allows you to look over the contents and make an informed decision if you really trust the file or not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is all driven by hackers using fuzzing tools," said Pescatore, talking about the dark art of hammering on file formats to probe for vulnerabilities. Microsoft has repeatedly had to patch file format flaws in Office applications, most recently in July when it fixed a bug in Publisher 2007 and in June, when it patched seven vulnerabilities in Excel and two more in Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that it's impossible for anyone, including Microsoft, to root out every instance of an input error -- the company uses home-grown fuzzing tools on its own products during development -- Pescatore said that the only solution is to give people a way to protect themselves after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his blog entry, Malhotra spelled out more details about Protected View, including when it's triggered and how enterprise IT staffs can manage those options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 opens a Word, Excel or PowerPoint document in Protected Mode when the file's downloaded from the Internet or an Outlook message's file attachment is opened. In some situations, Protected View will also swing into action when a file is grabbed from the company's internal network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This strikes me as a pretty good balance between security and usability," said Pescatore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Protected View will be used to open documents that have been tagged with the "File Block" security feature introduced in Office 2007. File Block lets corporate IT managers -- or a technically astute end user -- declare specific Office file types that can or cannot be opened by Word, Excel and PowerPoint. The feature was backported to Office 2003 in May 2007 as part of a regularly-scheduled monthly security update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Microsoft pitched File Block as a last-ditch defense against hacker attempts to use old file formats -- which historically have many more security holes than newer formats -- to compromise PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malhotra admitted that users hadn't taken to File Block. "From your feedback we heard that this was overly limiting from a usability aspect since your users still wanted to 'read' those files," he said. "In Office 2010 ... an administrator can set policy to indicate if the user should be allowed to leave Protected View, by editing the file, or force them to stay in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key [to Protected View] is what sort of tools will Microsoft give administrators to manage this," said Pescatore. "What if you want to be more granular than this? There are millions of documents out there that will be pulled into Protected View that aren't currently tagged with File Block. What will be the default?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users will also be able to open any document in Protected View from Office 2010's file menu, said Malhotra, and the Office 2010 window will carry a red bar at the top to show that the file is being viewed in a sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up today, a Microsoft spokeswoman said that Protected View will benefit from some features in Vista and Windows 7 -- notably UIPI (User Interface Privilege Isolation) -- to further restrict the sandbox process. But Office 2010 will offer Protected View to users running the suite on the older Windows XP operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pescatore thinks it unlikely, however, that Microsoft will backport the new feature to earlier editions of Office, a tactic it's used on occasion, such as adding File Block to Office 2003. "I sort of doubt they will do that," he said. "A lot of what they're doing here is tied to the XML format."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft has fired up the beta process for Office 2010 -- it kicked off the Technical Preview last month as an invite-only round of testing -- it has not yet announced a ship date for the product, saying only that it will release in the first half of 2010. A beta for the general public is slated for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Two environmental groups have filed a lawsuit against Chevron Phillips Chemical Co LP over alleged violations of the U.S. Clean Air Act at its Cedar Bayou plant, located east of Houston, representatives of the groups said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with company statement, adds byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Erwin Seba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 19 (Reuters) - Two environmental groups have
filed a lawsuit against Chevron Phillips Chemical Co LP over
alleged violations of the U.S. Clean Air Act at its Cedar Bayou
plant, located east of Houston, representatives of the groups
said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sierra Club and Environment Texas allege the 50-50
petrochemical joint-venture between energy giants Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) repeatedly violated limits
for pollution set in operating permits issued by regulators for
the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The groups brought the lawsuit because state regulators
have failed to enforce limits, said Luke Metzger, executive
director of Environment Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Because the state of Texas has failed to stop such
violations at Cedar Bayou and elsewhere, citizen groups have
had to step up and enforce the law themselves," Metzger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The federal Clean Air Act allows citizens to bring lawsuits
to enforce the act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron Phillips spokesman said the company has reduced
pollution at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since 2001, the Cedar Bayou Plant has reduced its total
reportable emission events by more than 73 percent and its
total annual emissions by 63 percent," said company spokesman
Brian Cain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit alleges that thousands of violations occurred
during malfunctions at the plant in the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  About 50 percent of the releases from the plant since June
2004 have come from shutdowns due to Hurricanes Rita and Ike
and an electrical power outage caused by an outside supplier,
Cain said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The groups are discussing a possible settlement with the
company, Metzger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District
Court of the Southern District of Texas in Houston. It seeks an
end to excessive pollution from the plant and civil penalties
of up to $32,500 per day for each violation of the Clean Air
Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shell Oil Co, the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc
(RDSa.L), agreed in April to settle a similar lawsuit by
improving operations at its joint-venture Deer Park, Texas,
refinery, paying $6 million to reduce pollution from school

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with company statement, adds byline) By Erwin Seba HOUSTON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Two environmental groups have filed a lawsuit against Chevron Phillips Chemical Co LP over alleged violations of the U.S. Clean Air Act at its Cedar Bayou plant, located east of Houston, representatives of the groups said on Wednesday. The Sierra Club and Environment Texas allege the 50-50 petrochemical joint-venture between energy giants Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) repeatedly violated limits for pollution set in operating permits issued by regulators for the plant. The groups brought the lawsuit because state regulators have failed to enforce limits, said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. Because the state of Texas has failed to stop such violations at Cedar Bayou and elsewhere, citizen groups have had to step up and enforce the law themselves, Metzger said. The federal Clean Air Act allows citizens to bring lawsuits to enforce the act. A Chevron Phillips spokesman said the company has reduced pollution at the plant. Since 2001, the Cedar Bayou Plant has reduced its total reportable emission events by more than 73 percent and its total annual emissions by 63 percent, said company spokesman Brian Cain. The lawsuit alleges that thousands of violations occurred during malfunctions at the plant in the past five years.  About 50 percent of the releases from the plant since June 2004 have come from shutdowns due to Hurricanes Rita and Ike and an electrical power outage caused by an outside supplier, Cain said. The groups are discussing a possible settlement with the company, Metzger said. The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Texas in Houston. It seeks an end to excessive pollution from the plant and civil penalties of up to $32,500 per day for each violation of the Clean Air Act. Shell Oil Co, the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), agreed in April to settle a similar lawsuit by improving operations at its joint-venture Deer Park, Texas, refinery, paying $6 million to reduce pollution from school buses and placing solar panels on public buildings.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 19 (Reuters) - Two environmental groups filed
a lawsuit against Chevron Phillips Chemical Co LP over alleged
violations of the U.S. Clean Air Act at its Cedar Bayou plant,
located east of Houston, said representatives of the groups on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Sierra Club and Environment Texas allege the 50-50
petrochemical joint-venture between energy giants Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) repeatedly violated limits
for pollution set in operating permits issued by regulators for
the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron Phillips representative was not immediately
available to discuss the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The effects of pollutants released from the Cedar Bayou
plant can be felt as far away as downtown Houston and beyond,"
said Neil Carman, Clean Air Program Director for the Lone Star
Chapter of Sierra Club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A single release on Oct. 7, 1999, from the Chevron Phillips
plant contributed to "the single worst ozone day in Houston in
the last 20 years," Carman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ground-level ozone is a primary component of smog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit alleges the thousands of violations occurred
during malfunctions at the plant in the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The groups are discussing a possible settlement to the
lawsuit with the company, said Luke Metzger, executive director
of Environment Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are very encouraged we can find some resolution to the
case," Metzger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit filed against Chevron Phillips on Wednesday in

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it filed a motion to stay an injunction imposed by a federal court last week which threatened to halt sales of some versions of its popular Word application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Microsoft also asked for an expedited review of its appeal against the ruling, which determined that Microsoft was in breach of a patent held by a small Canadian software firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 12, a U.S. district court in Texas ruled in favor of i4i Ltd in its long-running patent dispute against Microsoft, slapping more than $290 million in damages on Microsoft and issuing an injunction preventing the world's top software company from selling versions of Word that contain the disputed patent technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent in question relates to the use of XML, or extensible markup language, in the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word. The injunction is set to take effect in 60 days from the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These filings are not unusual in patent cases," said Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz on Tuesday, referring to the motion to stay and request for an expedited appeal process. "We believe the evidence clearly demonstrates that we do not infringe and that the i4i patent is invalid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With regard to the upcoming Christmas season, we are planning to grow in an anti-cyclical way and expect that it (business) will be above the 2008 level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does not break out sales figures for Germany in its financial reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German video game industry is expected to grow 5 percent in 2009 to more than $2.9 billion, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, bucking the economic downturn that has curbed consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, video game equipment and software sales fell 29 percent in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's peer Sony Corp on Tuesday said it would cut the retail price of its flagship PlayStation 3 console -- which competes with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii -- to spur console sales that have lagged those of rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The price cut for the PS3 does not surprise me at all. To us, this does not matter. We sell via concepts. But should we become convinced that we have to act regarding pricing, we will do so. At the moment, however, I do not see such a need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cheapest version of Microsoft's Xbox costs $200. Sony on Tuesday said the price for the PS3 would be lowered to 299 euros in Europe and $299 in the United States, as of August 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Christoph Steitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's Bing search engine continued to make small gains on rivals Google Inc and Yahoo Inc in the U.S. Internet search market in July, according to the latest data from research firm ComScore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which launched Bing in early June, racked up 8.9 percent of U.S. Internet searches in July, up 0.5 percentage points from June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, the leader in the market, and Yahoo, the distant No. 2, both lost 0.3 percentage points of market share in July, to 64.7 percent and 19.3 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last month Microsoft and Yahoo finally signed an agreement to cooperate on Internet search advertising, with Bing powering searches on both companies' sites and Yahoo handling the ad sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal has yet to be approved by regulators and likely won't take full effect in the market until early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has confidently described its planned search advertising deal with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) as a "win-win", but the software company's legal chief is prepared to concede that the outcome is not certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal, struck in late July after months of talks, faces a tough regulatory review, and the possibility that it won't be enough to effectively challenge Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For both companies, it would be right to say this is not risk-free," said Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith, in an interview last week. "I don't know of any investment that is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, struck on July 30, proposes that Microsoft's Bing becomes the search engine for both, while Yahoo focuses on attracting big advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shareholders generally welcomed the deal, but Yahoo's shares plunged as investors bemoaned the lack of an upfront payment from Microsoft or revenue guarantees in hard dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts pointed out that Microsoft still had an incentive to take market share from Yahoo, and that Yahoo's salesforce could end up selling ads they would not be paid for if clicked on in a Microsoft site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith acknowledged that such a situation was possible, but pushed attention to the potential upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think there is a compelling business return that each company has a strong opportunity to generate for its shareholders," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEGAL RISK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first hurdle is the antitrust review, which Microsoft and Yahoo do not expect to be completed until early 2010. Microsoft has made its initial Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust filing with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), according to Smith. The DoJ is expected to lead the review, but has not yet commented on the matter publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's impossible to know for certain how long that review will take, obviously it's up to the governments involved," said Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is confident it can persuade regulators that a stronger rival for Google is in the best interests of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's widely understood by governments around the world that the search marketplace needs to become more competitive," said Smith, whose job it is to steer Microsoft through the antitrust approval process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only way to do that is to bring the No. 2 and 3 providers together and thereby create a stronger counterbalance to a very dominant No. 1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antitrust experts generally expect the deal will get close scrutiny from regulators, but ultimately will be approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft's own research, Google has 78 percent of the U.S. market for paid search -- results pages featuring ad links, rather than just pure algorithmic results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- compared with Yahoo's 16 percent and Microsoft's 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, which must also make antitrust filings, will make a similar case to regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel good about what advertisers and publishers and users are going to see here, which is really a long-term sustainable opportunity for some competition to Google, which has been quite dominant," said Michael Callahan, Yahoo's general counsel, in an interview last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callahan says the Justice Department's opposition to a planned search-ad partnership between Yahoo and Google last year -- which ultimately led to the companies abandoning the plan -- will have no bearing on the Microsoft deal. "These are not similar types of transactions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCALE BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which vehemently opposed the Yahoo-Google tie-up last year, says the Justice Department was right to object to the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most important thing is not what any single private company argued last year, it's what the DoJ concluded," said Smith. "And what the DoJ concluded last year was that Google already had a dominant position in this marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alone, Microsoft cannot effectively challenge Google, said Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We pointed out a year ago that despite our size and our financial resources, we did not have a profitable search business. Today we do not have a profitable search business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-Yahoo tie-up is an "important step" in building a viable search business, he added, as it helps them gain the scale necessary to play a significant role in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like having an auction house," said Smith. "If no one comes to your auction you don't have the kind of business that causes people to want to sell products at your auction house. You need a certain scale to be competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft late Tuesday warned of "massive disruptions" to sales of Office, as well as to partners such as Best Buy, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, if the injunction that prevents it from selling Word 2003 and Word 2007 in the U.S. after Oct. 10 is not set aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an emergency motion filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals, Microsoft asked that the injunction imposed last week by U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Davis be stayed, or temporarily put on hold, while its appeal is heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move was expected, as it had previously said it would appeal the verdict and the injunction that resulted from a patent infringement case it lost last May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft and its distributors (which include retailers such as Best Buy and OEMs such as HP and Dell) face the imminent possibility of a massive disruption in their sales," Microsoft argued in the motion. "If left undisturbed, the district court's injunction will inflict irreparable harm on Microsoft by potentially keeping the centerpiece of its product line out of the market for months," the firm's lawyers added. "The injunction would block not only the distribution of Word, but also of the entire Office suite, which contains Word and other popular programs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent infringement case brought by Toronto-based i4i in 2007 resulted in a $290 million judgment against Microsoft and an injunction that bars it from selling Word 2003 and Word 2007 after Oct. 10 unless they're altered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also complained to the Court of Appeals that while it has taken steps toward the latter solution, that, too, puts an unfair burden on the company. "Already, Microsoft is expending enormous human and financial capital to make its best effort to comply with the district court's 60-day deadline," stated Microsoft in the motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if Microsoft ultimately succeeds on appeal, it will never be able to recoup the funds expended in redesigning and redistributing Word, the sales lost during the period when Word and Office are barred from the market, and the diminished goodwill from Microsoft's many retail and industrial customers," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Microsoft painted a bleak picture for users. "Even if the injunction will not affect Microsoft's existing Office customers, consumers and businesses who require new copies of Office and Word would be stranded without an alternative set of software." Microsoft's attorneys also claimed that the situation would be a "major public disruption," and would "have an effect on the public due to the public's undisputed and enormous reliance on those products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, Microsoft said it would take five months for it to craft new versions of Word that omitted the offending feature. i4i countered, saying that it could be done much faster than that with a software patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Barry Negrin, a partner with the New York firm Pryor Cashman LLP who has practiced patent and trademark law for 17 years, agreed with i4i, saying that Microsoft should be able to work around the injunction with an "easy technical" fix. "All Microsoft has to do is disable the custom XML feature, which should be pretty easy to do, then give that a different SKU number from what's been sold so it's easy to distinguish the two versions," said Negrin said in an interview on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, a Texas jury awarded i4i $200 million in damages for Microsoft's patent infringement. Davis added another $40 million in "enhanced damages" for Microsoft's "willful infringement," and additional damages and interest that brought the total to $290.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Negrin, although Microsoft has the right to request an appeal, and a postponement of the damages while that appeal works it way through the system -- the latter is almost always granted -- it has no automatic right to a stay of the injunction. "The district court judge already denied a request for a stay," Negrin noted last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Microsoft also filed a separate appeal of the judgment, and with i4i's agreement, will not have to post bond, as is often required, to guarantee that it has the money to pay damages if it loses the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working against Microsoft's request for a stay of the injunction is the fact that it was hit with "willful infringement" of the i4i patent, Negrin said. In a 65-page summary opinion, Judge Davis said that Microsoft knew of the patent held by i4i as early as 2001, but nevertheless set out to make the Canadian developer's software "obsolete" by adding a feature to Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also asked the Court of Appeals to put its motion on a fast-track schedule. It requested that the court order i4i to respond to the motion by next Monday, Aug. 24, and promised it would file a reply to any i4i response by Aug. 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will offer Windows 7's ribbon-style application interface to Windows Vista users in an update this October, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As first reported by Long Zheng, the blogger who writes the popular istartedsomething.com, Microsoft will provide Vista users an optional update that installs the code necessary to display Windows 7's Ribbon framework on its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framework, called "Scenic Ribbon," is a derivation of the ribbon-esque "Fluent" user interface that debuted in Office 2007 two years ago. Both feature a wide ribbon-like display at the top of a window that replaces the traditional drop-down menus, small icons and toolbars that have standardized Windows applications' look-and-feel for decades. Office 2007 faced serious resistance from some users over the ribbon when it launched, although that has subsided over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, complaints mounted over plans by OpenOffice.org to overhaul the interface of that open-source productivity suite. Some have blasted the organization for parroting Office 2007's ribbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Office ribbon sucks. Please don't copy it," wrote one user in a comment to a Sun Microsystems blog. Sun contributes engineering and developer time to OpenOffice.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Microsoft said the ribbon interface would be used by both Microsoft and third-party developers to distinguish new applications for Windows 7 from older versions that ran, say, on Windows XP or Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the things we think will differentiate apps written for Windows 7, as opposed to those for earlier versions of Windows," said Mike Nash, the head of Microsoft's Windows product management, in an interview with Computerworld last January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That plan seems to be in tatters now. Starting in October, application developers will be assured that new software they've crafted to include the Scenic Ribbon interface will also run on Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A Windows 7 interoperability pack, known as the Windows 7 Client Platform Update, is to be released alongside Windows 7 in October of this year," said Karl Bridge, a Microsoft programming writer, in a message posted last week to a forum on the MSDN (Microsoft Developers Network) site. "This update provides down-level support for the Windows Ribbon framework and will be made available from the Microsoft Download Center and as a 'Recommended update' on Windows Update."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridge added that the update will support all versions of Vista, including the entry-level Home Basic and Starter, which for Vista has been sold only in a limited number of markets overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application developers who build software with Windows 7's ribbon interface will have to point users to Windows Update or Microsoft's download site to grab the Client Platform Update, or silently call Windows Update as part of setup, Bridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's most visible "ribbonized" Windows 7 applications are the revamped Paint and retooled Wordpad, the basic image editor and word processor, respectively, bundled with the OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows XP users will be out of ribbon luck, however, as the October update will not apply to the eight-year-old operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Microsoft and the University of California at San Diego have come up with divergent schemes to address shortcomings of data center architectures, particularly management and configuration burdens, and to promote the efficient use of virtual machines.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two groups presented their findings at the SIGCOMM 2009 conference this week in Barcelona, and each had its own flavor. The Microsoft team sought high performance for all traffic regardless of demand, while the UCSD team focused on allowing the free migration of VMs, minimal configuration when adding new hosts to the network and quickly addressing failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolution of the router&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's researchers also addressed VM migration and Layer 2-like addressing but using a method that calls for installing an agent on every endpoint, which contrasts with the UCSD group's plan to tweak switch software and leave the endpoints alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UCSD effort led by Amin Vahdat, a professor of computer science at the school, proposes a blend of Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity for data centers that enables massive scaling that is otherwise limited by Layer 2 factors and reduces the management and configuration demands of Layer 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say their PortLand protocol could support a data center network of 100,000 servers without modifying any of the host machines. The group presented its findings in the research paper "PortLand: A scalable Fault-Tolerant Layer 2 Data Center Network Fabric".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the addition of devices to the network plug-and-play -- with no configuration or modification of end devices -- was a key goal of PortLand, Vahdat says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would support VM migration, something Layer 3 can't do because VMs can move from server to server, each with a different IP addresses. It also introduces a flat mechanism for sharing PortLand-assigned media access control (MAC) &#160;addresses that overcomes the memory limitations of most switches by reducing the size of the address tables each switch has to store, Vahdat says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PortLand requires additional software that enables switches to discover their place in the data center topology. The software also enables switches to assign a pseudo MAC address to each device that is directly connected to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under PortLand, switches maintain tables of PMAC prefixes and forward traffic to the appropriate switch until the traffic reaches the switch the destination device is attached to. That switch translates the PMAC to the actual MAC so the traffic can be delivered to the correct device, Vahdat says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To facilitate forwarding traffic, PortLand includes a Fabric Manager server, which performs a function analogous to a DNS server in resolving URLs with IP addresses. Rather than broadcast for address resolution between PMACs and the IP addresses, switches redirect broadcast ARP requests from their connected hosts to the Fabric Manager, which replies with the appropriate IP address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabric Manager maintains a soft state of the network so if it crashes, it can reconstruct the address information from access switches in the network using the PortLand protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Fabric Manager crashes, the time to continue communication on the network is negligible because the protocol reverts to broadcasting for address resolution, Vahdat says. If Fabric Manager is operating, the lookup runs at wire speed.PortLand also respects the line drawn between devices network administrators control and the hosts controlled by system administrators. Rather than modifying the host MAC address directly using an agent and a server, the PortLand architecture has the switches translate MAC addresses to PMAC addresses. "We let the end host be what it is and make just small changes to the switch software and no changes to the switch hardware," Vahdat says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's scheme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's team, led by Albert Greenberg, David Maltz and Parveen Patel, also deals with the addressing problem by introducing a two-tiered system, a location-specific IP address and an application specific IP address that follows applications around as they migrate to new VMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Microsoft VL2 architecture, each server is associated with the location-specific IP address of the switch it is attached to. As with PortLand, a VL2 directory system maps the location IPs to the application IPs. A VL2 agent on each server retrieves the location-specific IP address of the switch nearest the destination server and encapsulates application packets inside it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploying an agent and configuring servers is something PortLand avoids. But VL2 has other features that PortLand doesn't address. For example, VL2's directory server can refuse to provide the location-specific IP address if access policies deny the initiating server connectivity to the destination server. This gives VL2 the ability to enforce access control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's researchers go beyond the ambitions of PortLand by looking at data center traffic patterns and designing a network topology that chooses paths for each traffic flow in a manner that avoids persistent congestion hot spots and provides uniform high capacity between any two servers in the data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VL2 calls for a layer of highly integrated aggregation switches with so many connections to a higher layer of intermediate switches that in the event of a failure, performance degrades gracefully, the Microsoft researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Xbox 360 and Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation 3 are locked in a battle to control entertainment in the living room beyond video games, a competition that is only growing more intense with the increasing popularity of digital distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two rivals have tens of millions of users, making them well-placed to capitalize if a critical mass of consumers begins to move toward a single "digital hub" that offers a buffet of media, including movies, TV shows, music and games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The all-in-one hub has been touted for years as the future of home entertainment, but consumers have been slow to change, still opting to play their content on a variety of devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although analysts caution that it is still early in the game, they say Microsoft --- which had a four-year head start -- is leading Sony, with steady revenue from paying subscribers and a strong slate of content deals, including partners such as Netflix (NFLX.O) and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the companies do not provide sales data for their entertainment networks -- Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network (PSN) -- Jesse Divnich, an analyst with EEDAR, said sales have more than doubled year-to-date.

&lt;p&gt;MSCS packages hosted Exchange email, other services aimed at small and
medium-sized business owners
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Intermedia, the global leader in Exchange hosting, today announced the
availability of online resources that its private label partners can use to
promote Microsoft Communication Services (MSCS) - a marketing package of hosted
Exchange email, SharePoint and Office Communications Server. The news comes on
the heels of a July announcement from Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) that Intermedia
is among a select group of companies it is working with to promote MSCS. 

Intermedia and Microsoft`s marketing alliance is called Microsoft Communication
Services from Intermedia. MSCS was designed to appeal directly to small and
medium-sized business owners. The MSCS marketing resources that Intermedia and
Microsoft developed will enable Intermedia`s partners to be more effective in
marketing the productivity value of Microsoft Exchange email, SharePoint and
Office Communications Server. 

Intermedia partners are able to promote MSCS and other hosted Microsoft
offerings under their own brand, managing the underlying services with a private
label version of Intermedia`s proprietary control panel. According to Bob
Leibholz, Intermedia`s vice president of sales and business development, "Small
and medium-sized business owners view email, scheduling, and document sharing as
communication tools. MSCS is a way to engage business owners using language that
aligns with this view. It`s a marketing package in the best sense of the term,
and we`re proud to make it available to our partners. We expect to accelerate
our growth as a result of this marketing effort and help our partners do so as
well." 

Developed by Microsoft, the MSCS marketing resources help Intermedia partners
identify appropriate prospects and then engage them with compelling messages.
The resources are available for download on Intermedia`s Partner Portal, which
also includes resources for marketing Intermedia`s Exchange hosting and other
hosted solutions. Resources specific to MSCS include email, letter, phone
script, and web site templates to which Intermedia partners can apply their own
branding. 

Intermedia hosts over 200,000 premium Microsoft Exchange mailboxes - more than
any other hosted Exchange provider - and over 400,000 mailboxes total.
Intermedia`s partner program includes internationally recognized Fortune 500
brands as well as more than 3,500 small and medium-sized businesses - primarily
managed service providers (MSPs) and other technology solution providers. The
profitable 14-year old company offers migration services to transition its
partners` existing Exchange accounts with no disruption.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has taken various rating actions on 13 classes of J.P. Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates, series 2007-CIBC20. In addition, Fitch has assigned Rating
Outlooks, as applicable. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of
this press release. 

The downgrades are the result of Fitch's prospective views regarding commercial
real estate market value and cash flow declines as well as loss expectations on
specially serviced loans. Fitch forecasts potential losses of 7.3% for this
transaction, should market conditions not recover. Today's rating actions are
based on losses of 5.7% including 100% of the losses associated with term
defaults and any losses associated with maturities within the next five years.
Given the significant term to maturity, Fitch's actions only account for 25% of
the losses associated with maturities beyond five years. The bonds with Negative
Outlooks indicate classes that may be downgraded in the future should full
potential losses be realized. 

Fitch analyzed the transaction and calculated expected losses by assuming cash
flows on each of the properties decline 15% from year-end (YE) 2007 and property
values decline 35% from issuance. These loss estimates were reviewed in more
detail for loans representing 69.9% of the pool and, in certain cases, revised
based on additional information and/or property characteristics. 

Approximately 15.1% of the mortgages are scheduled to mature within the next
five years, with 7% maturing in 2012 and 7.1% maturing in 2014. In 2017, 80.6%
of the pool is scheduled to mature. 

Fitch identified 33 Loans of Concern (23.2%) within the pool, 11 of which (3.8%)
are specially serviced. None of the specially serviced loans are within the
transaction's top 15 loans, which comprises 55.3% of the total pool's unpaid
principal balance. 

Twelve of the top 15 loans (47.9% of the pool) are expected to default during
the term or at maturity, with loss severities ranging from approximately 1% to
18%. Of the top 15 loans, the largest contributors (by loan balance) to term
losses are as follows: North Hills Mall (5.6% of the pool balance), Baldwin Park
Retail (1.6%) and the Everbank Building (1.5%). 

North Hills Mall is a 585,798 square foot (sf) retail property located in
Raleigh, NC. Overall occupancy as of April 2009 was 97.8%, compared to 97.6% at
issuance, with a servicer reported YE 2008 debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of
1.09 times (x). Approximately 14.7% of the leases have expired or are scheduled
to expire prior to YE 2010. Major tenants include: Target (not part of the
collateral); JCPenney; Regal Cinemas; and REI. 

Baldwin Park Retail is a 182,463 sf retail plaza located in Orlando, FL.
Occupancy as of November 2008 was 84.3%, compared to 87.8% at issuance, with a
servicer reported YE 2008 DSCR of 0.94x. Approximately 23.7% of the leases have
expired or are scheduled to expire prior to YE 2011. Major tenants include
Publix and CVS. 

The Everbank Building loan is secured by a 206,798 sf office building located in
the central business district of Jacksonville, FL. Occupancy as of November 2008
was 88.8% compared to 86.1% at issuance. The servicer reported YE 2008 DSCR was
1.04x. 

The largest specially serviced asset (0.9%) with losses expected is a retail
center located in Bluffton, SC, anchored by a cinema. The asset transferred to
special servicing in October 2008 for payment default. A receiver is in place at
the property as of May 2009. 

Fitch has downgraded, removed from Rating Watch Negative, and assigned Loss
Severity Ratings and Rating Outlooks to the following classes: 

--$152.6 million class A-J to 'AA/LS-4' from 'AAA'; Outlook Negative;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded, removed from Rating Watch Negative, and assigned
Rating Outlooks to 13 classes of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates
from J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2006-CIBC17.
A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. 

The downgrades are the result of loss expectations and reflect Fitch's
prospective views regarding commercial real estate market value and cash flow
declines. Fitch forecasts potential losses of 6.8% for this transaction, should
market conditions not recover. Today's rating actions are based on losses of
5.2%, including 100% of the losses associated with term defaults and any losses
associated with maturities within the next five years. Given the significant
term to maturity, Fitch's actions only account for 25% of the losses associated
with maturities beyond five years. The bonds with Negative Outlooks indicate
classes that may be downgraded in the future should full potential losses be
realized. 

Fitch analyzed the transaction and calculated expected losses by assuming cash
flows on each of the properties decline 15% from year-end (YE) 2007 and property
values decline 35% from issuance. These loss estimates were reviewed in more
detail for certain loans representing 69.1% of the pool and, in some cases,
revised based on additional information and/or property characteristics. Of the
recognized losses, approximately 70% are derived from loans which Fitch examined
in detail. 

Approximately 5.6% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as
follows: 3.6% in 2011 and 2% in 2013. In 2016, 92.9% of the pool is scheduled to
mature. 

Fitch identified 26 Loans of Concern (17.5%) within the pool, three of which
(1.6%) are specially serviced. Of the specially serviced loans, none are
current. None of the specially serviced loans are within the transaction's top
15 loans (53.5%) by unpaid principal balance. 

Two of the Loans of Concern (12.4%) within the top 15 loans is expected to
default during the term, with loss severities of approximately 18%. The largest
contributors to loss are as follows: Bank of America Plaza (10.5%), The Towers
(1.9%) and The Bonnie Lane and Northlake Portfolio (0.6%). 

The Bank of America Plaza loan is collateralized by a 1.25 million square foot
(sf) office property located in downtown Atlanta, GA. Major tenants include Bank
of America (30% of net rentable area [NRA]) and Troutman Sanders (23% NRA). The
third largest tenant Ernest and Young (16.7% NRA) vacated the property in April
2007. Some of the space has been re-leased but the majority of it remains
vacant. Tenants occupying 15% of the NRA have leases which expire in 2009 and
42% of the NRA, including the largest tenant, expires in 2012. The sponsors are
GFW Trust, GFW Trust II and Bentley Forbes Holdings, LLC. Fitch expects the loan
to default prior to maturity in 2016. 

The Towers loan is collateralized by a 160,000 sf office tower located in Great
Neck, NY. Major tenants include Garfunkel Wild &amp; Travis (16% NRA), Sterling
Equities (14% NRA) and Servisair (11% NRA). Twenty six percent of the NRA have
leases which expire in 2010, 15% in 2012 and 11% in 2013. Revenues and occupancy
have generally been in-line with the issuer's underwriting; however, 2008
expenses were approximately 17% in excess of underwritten. 

The Bonnie Lane and Northlake Portfolio is collateralized by 13 single-story
office buildings comprising 89,000 sf in Cordova, TN and a 78,000 sf office and
retail center in Tucker, GA. The loan transferred to special servicing in
October 2008 due to imminent default. The loan is now 90-days delinquent and the
special servicer is pursuing foreclosure. The servicer reported June 30, 2008
occupancy, the most recent available, was 82%. Fitch loss estimates are based on
recent appraised values. 

Fitch has downgraded, removed from Rating Watch Negative, and assigned Rating
Outlooks to the following classes: 

-- $202.9 million class A-J to 'A' from 'AAA'; assigns LS-3; Outlook Negative;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Weitz &amp; Luxenberg P.C.: 

WHO: Weitz &amp; Luxenberg P.C. 

WHAT: Paw Paw, Mich. residents are invited to attend a special community meeting
with lawyers from Weitz &amp; Luxenberg. 

WHEN: Tuesday, August 25 at 7 p.m. 

WHERE: Paw Paw High School, 30609 E. Red Arrow Hwy., Paw Paw, MI 49079-8699 

Attorneys from Weitz &amp; Luxenberg (www.weitzlux.com) - a law firm long recognized
in the legal community for pursuing legal claims on behalf of communities and
individuals harmed by toxic pollution - will be on hand with local Michigan
counsel to discuss the soil contamination problem in Paw Paw, Mich., and to
advise residents about their legal options. 

BACKGROUND: For two decades, the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Paw Paw, Mich.,
discharged its waste water into town soil. Today, nearby groundwater used for
drinking and other household uses is showing signs of heavy metal contamination,
with detectable levels of toxins linked to cancer, including arsenic, lead, iron
and manganese. 

Soil contamination has already affected the groundwater, as well as property
values of dozens of homes in Paw Paw, especially those situated near the source
of the contamination: Coca-Cola`s Minute Maid plant on Red Arrow Highway. 

The situation is not improving. Town authorities have told residents to stop
drinking local water and to switch to bottled water. And the Paw Paw Township
Assessor recently sent letters to affected residents stating that their homes`
"state equalized values" have been reduced by 10 percent because of the soil
pollution. 

"The Coca-Cola Co. has made overtures to some of the residents of Paw Paw, and
we are hopeful that we can resolve this matter for the residents provided the
company recognizes the damages it has inflicted upon the community and fairly
compensates residents for their injuries," said Erin Brockovich, who has been
affiliated with Weitz &amp; Luxenberg for several years. "I have worked with the
environmental attorneys at Weitz &amp; Luxenberg and I trust them to recognize
residents` concerns and to represent their very best interests in this
unfortunate matter." 

Brockovich is no stranger to righting environmental wrongs. Best known for her
investigative work in a successful lawsuit against Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
in California that resulted in a $333 million settlement, Brockovich`s
experience in that case inspired a popular movie bearing her name and starring
movie actress Julia Roberts. Brockovich will be in Australia on the date of the
meeting but has taped a special, personalized video for Paw Paw residents that
they will be able to view.

us for a free environmental lawsuit review via our website, www.weitzlux.com

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, Aug 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
KCOM (LSE: KCOM), a leading UK supplier of business communication
solutions, has completed a live trial of Nortel's(1) (OTCBB: NRTLQ)
Contact Center 7.0 (CC7) demonstrating successful integration with
Microsoft's Office Communications Server. The trial, the world's first to
test the compatibility of the two solutions, showed the two products can
significantly improve service and efficiency for contact centres.

    KCOM conducted the trial using its IT service desk, with staff operating
out of Hull and Reading in the UK. Nortel's Contact Center 7.0,
integrated with Microsoft Office Communications Server, was deployed to
assist agents in handling high call volumes and to improve customer
service by allowing callers to use their preferred method of
communication to register queries.

    KCOM's service desk handles approximately 6000 calls a month from both
internal and external clients. Following deployment of the Contact Center
7.0 and OCS solution, service desk agents saw a 30% decrease in the
number of phone calls that were logged as users opted to submit queries
by instant message (IM) or email instead.

    "One of the most satisfactory results of the trial was that our users
really noticed a change in service," said Paul Marsden, workplace
services manager, KCOM. "They particularly liked the ability to submit
queries via instant message as it allowed them to continue working rather
than waiting in a queue for the call to be answered. Also, given the
choice, the agents themselves didn't want to go back to the old
technology; they felt the Contact Center 7.0 and Office Communications
Server solution was more intuitive and user friendly."

    Offering users the option to submit their enquiry via their preferred
method of communication also showed benefits for the service desk agents.
Nortel Contact Center 7.0 allows agents to prioritise enquiries, and in
this instance, voice calls were prioritised over IM, and IM was
prioritised over email. This allowed urgent calls to be handled
immediately, while less urgent calls were handled as agents became
available. The agents also found they were able to process enquiries at a
faster rate when they were submitted by instant message as they could get
more background information from users.

    The Contact Center 7.0 solution used by KCOM also included Nortel's
'Expert Anywhere' capability, allowing agents to see the availability of
other experts in the contact centre. Through access to 'presence'
information, the agents were better able to ensure the calls they routed
would be answered and resolved on first contact.

    "Our agents instantly recognised the benefit of seeing the availability
of subject matter experts within their new integrated desktop," said
Marsden. "The solution allowed the agents to identify the people within
the business that could help them resolve enquiries which they couldn't
answer themselves, without the need to call back. On the whole, the
transition to the new technology was incredibly smooth, with no need for
additional staff or significant overtime. The agents embraced the
solution and found they were more productive when using it. During the
trial the solution was confined to staff working in two locations, but I
now have every confidence in the solution and am looking to deploy it to
staff in our other locations."

    "In the current economic climate, organisations are looking to increase
productivity while driving down costs," said Mario DiMascio, vice
president, Enterprise Sales, Northern Europe, Nortel. "Delays in dealing
with enquiries and call-backs are costly to any business and are normally
associated with contact centre agents not having access to the right
information or the right people at the right time. This trial shows that
the problem can be solved by combining the power of Nortel's Contact
Center suite with the Presence and Instant Messaging capabilities of the
Microsoft Office Communications Server platform."

    Nortel and Microsoft Corp. have a long-standing relationship through the
Innovative Communications Alliance, from which businesses are now
realising the benefits. Contact Centre 7.0 is the latest in Nortel's
contact center portfolio and draws on industry expertise to provide the
very latest in customer contact technology. Nortel's Contact Center 7.0
achieved 'Generally Available' status on 23rd of June 2009.

    Nortel's Contact Centre 7.0 was recently honoured with industry accolades
with the IP Contact Center Technology Pioneer Award by Technology
Marketing Corporation and Customer Interaction Solutions Magazine.
Awarded to the "best of the best," Nortel's Contact Centre 7.0 was
recognised for its ground-breaking, stand-out capabilities in the
advancement of call centre technologies.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Aug 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner on Friday denied that emergency government
action taken last year to shore up the U.S banking system was
tailored to the interests of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) or any other
firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We have been forced to do just extraordinary things and,
frankly, offensive things to help save the economy," Geithner
said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal and Digg, an
online site where users share and rate articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am completely confident that none of those decisions ...
had anything to do with the specific interest of any individual
firm, much less Goldman Sachs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Congress, acting on the urgent advice of then
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, a former Goldman Sachs chief
executive, last year put up $700 billion to prevent the banking
system from collapsing amid a global credit crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Treasury, under Paulson, and the Federal Reserve also
crafted a massive bailout of insurer American International
Group (AIG.N), that enabled it to pay counterparties, including
Goldman, billions of dollars that might otherwise have been
lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geithner, who was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York during the crisis and therefore close to all of
decisions that were taken, said government had a duty to act in
the face of such a grave threat in order to prevent an even
worse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The basic imperative...in a crisis like this (is) to
protect people who are innocent of the mistakes that brought us
to this place," he said in the interview.

&lt;p&gt;COALINGA, California (Reuters) - Chevron Corp is building a solar plant here to create the steam that boosts production at an aging California oilfield, in a pioneering project the company aims to replicate elsewhere if it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron outlined the previously undisclosed plan at a city council meeting in Coalinga, a city halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco that started as a coal outpost, boomed with oil gushers, and is now a potential solar energy hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company said the solar thermal plant, which will collect reflected sunlight from thousands of mirrors at a 323-foot (98-meter) tower where the water boils, will replace some steam production now powered by natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steam is injected into wells to heat up heavier oil and thus lower its viscosity to make it easier to extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solar thermal company BrightSource Energy is partnering with Chevron on the project, which will employ BrightSource's technology. A spokesman for Oakland, California-based BrightSource would not comment on the terms of that deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sergio Hoyos, a business developer at Chevron Technology Ventures, said construction of the Coalinga plant would begin this year, with production slated to start by the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only problem we have is when it's cloudy," he said to a few laughs at the city council meeting on Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he said solar thermal could never replace natural gas in steam production, it is an opportunity for Chevron to save energy while championing a technology pegged by some as a winner in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just this week, German solar thermal company Solar Millennium AG and plant builder MAN Ferrostaal AG announced that they have joined forces to capture a chunk of the growing U.S. solar thermal power market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coalinga plant will cover 100 acres of Chevron-owned land with more than 7,000 mirrors. Hoyos said Chevron would consider deploying the solar thermal system, which will be the first of its kind to produce steam for oil production, at larger fields if it is successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Technology Ventures, which sells solar power and energy efficiency services, studied the Coalinga site for a year and a half before deciding it would cause a limited environmental impact and take advantage of the area's high solar radiation, Hoyos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also cited the topography of the area, a parched stretch of flatland nestled against hills on the western edge of California's agriculture-intensive Central Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Chevron project will not produce electricity, it is another vote of support for solar in an area that is near the grids of two big utilities, PGE Corp's Pacific Gas  Electric and Southern California Edison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both utilities have recently struck deals with Chevron partner BrightSource for large amounts of solar thermal power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, last year, PGE contracted with a unit of Portuguese conglomerate Martifer for 106.8 megawatts of power from both a solar thermal plant and natural gas produced by agricultural waste at plants near Coalinga -- also known for its cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of 18,000 people wears its oil history on its sleeve. Just a block from where Hoyos spoke is a Richfield gasoline filling station built in 1934 that has been restored and fenced off for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city's name is derived from the railroad's Coaling Station A, and after the initial coal boom, a series of gushers more than a century ago heralded its emergence as one of California's biggest oil-producing areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But based on the latest figures, the Coalinga field has had more than 90 percent of its oil extracted since its discovery in 1890, leaving plenty of work for steam injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall; Editing by Phil Berlowitz, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Thursday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Citi May Levy Annual Charges

In order to offset potential losses from new legislation signed by President
Obama, rising credit card defaults and increasing unemployment, Citigroup (NYSE:
C) is considering charging its credit card customers an annual fee. 

In May, the president signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and
Disclosure -- Credit CARD Act -- of 2009 into law. The legislation will improve
consumer disclosures and end some egregious practices in the credit card
industry but stops short of capping interest rates and fees. Most of the
provisions go into effect from Feb. 22, 2010, unless otherwise stated. 

Despite being touted as a victory for consumers, the bill could have unintended
consequences as credit card companies look for ways to make up for potential
lost revenue. 

Credit card companies have been gearing up for the new landscape for months,
mailing consumers a spate of warnings about fee and interest rate changes.
Citigroup is in the process of informing some cardholders that it will institute
an annual fee, about $30, on certain accounts. 

American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) recently sent out notice that it will eliminate
over-the-limit fees on its consumer credit cards in October. 

Competitors Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:
DFS) and JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) have yet not decided to levy annual
charges on its card holders.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Yahoo! Inc are joining a group of opponents to a class action settlement that gives Google Inc the right to digitize millions of books, the companies said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies are becoming part of the Open Book Alliance, made up of nonprofits and libraries that have raised a red flag against Google's plan to digitize books and put them on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, we've agreed to participate in the coalition," a spokesman for Microsoft said. A Yahoo spokeswoman said they had also signed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc has also reportedly joined, but a spokeswoman said: "We don't comment on rumor or speculation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say the deal gives Google the unimpeded ability to set prices for libraries, once they scan books and put them on the Internet. If the service becomes a necessity for libraries they would face monopoly pricing, Google's opponents say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also say it would also allow Google -- and only Google -- to digitize so-called orphan works, which could pose an antitrust concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orphan works are books or other materials that are still covered by U.S. copyright law, but it is not clear who owns the rights to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google took issue with the criticism. "The agreement is not exclusive. If improved by the court it will expand access to millions of books in the U.S.," said Gabriel Stricker, a spokesman for Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The agreement stands to inject more competition into the digital book space, so it's understandable why our competitors would fight hard to prevent more competition," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York University law professor James Grimmelmann, who runs thepublicindex.org site, which carries documents on the case, said he is waiting to see the arguments of the Open Books Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google is right that there are access benefits to making books available," said Grimmelmann. "The question of whether this is good or bad for competition is hotly contested. There are clear ways that the settlement could create a concentration of power, especially over orphan books."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is under review or investigation by the U.S. Justice Department, the European Commission and a group of U.S. state attorneys general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement was reached in October, 2008, to settle a lawsuit filed in 2005 by the Author's Guild, when Google began scanning books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guild and a group of publishers has alleged copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has agreed to pay $125 million to create a Book Rights Registry, where authors and publishers can register works and receive compensation from institutional subscriptions or book sales.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with Chevron statement, market prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 21 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said it
was making repairs to a shut unit at its 245,271 barrel-per-day
(bpd) San Francisco Bay-area refinery in Richmond, California,
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit's shutdown triggered spikes on Friday in gasoline
and diesel prices in the San Francisco Bay wholesale refined
products market. Gasoline was up as much as 9 cents, according
to trade sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokesman declined to identify the malfunctioning
unit, but trade sources said it was a hydrocracking unit, which
makes gasoline and diesel fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had a piece of equipment with a problem and we needed
to shut it down," said Chevron spokesman Sean Comey. "We
continue to supply product to our customers. We don't
anticipate it will impact our ability to supply product to our
customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the San Francisco wholesale market, gasoline blended to
meet California's strict environmental standards was offered as
high as 9 cents per gallon over the price in Los Angeles, where
gasoline traded at 17 cents and 18.5 cents over the NYMEX
October RBOB gasoline contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With those premiums, the wholesale outright price for a
gallon of gasoline would be $2.1698.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diesel fuel specially blended for California markets was
offered in San Francisco at 20 cents over NYMEX October heating
oil for an outright price of $2.1366 a gallon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Los Angeles, gasoline was up 1.5 cents for the September
California wholesale gasoline contract, compared with
Thursday's price.

&lt;p&gt;Windows Live Hotmail users have been venting their frustration at Microsoft Corp. for the past month since the software maker suddenly removed a popular feature because it created a security hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Attach Photo" feature allowed users to directly add photos, images or graphics into e-mails. Users are allowed to quickly edit and add captions to the photos, which are automatically compressed by Hotmail, enabling users to attach more images per e-mail. It is distinct from Attach File, which still works and lets users attach photos to e-mails without compressing them or giving users the ability to edit them first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users, such as Carl Creed, a retired system administrator in Leiston, England, say they first noticed Attach Photo was missing about three weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and other users have complained on the Windows Live Help support forum about Microsoft's failure to warn them beforehand and the "wasted hours" they spent trying to debug the feature on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Microsoft had just told us end users that they were planning to remove this feature before they did remove it, we would not be so upset in the first place," Creed said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a posting updated Thursday at the Windows Live Help forum and also posted at the Windows Live blog, Microsoft said it removed the feature after finding an "incompatibility with Internet Explorer that caused a security flaw with photo uploads ... The Hotmail team takes security very seriously and we expect to bring back the photo upload feature by the end of September."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Attach Photo feature relies on an ActiveX control, a Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed in a follow-up e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ActiveX is a plug-in technology for building Web components designed by Microsoft. While theoretically a boon for Web programmers, ActiveX has been heavily criticized by security pros, including the U.S. government's Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT), for the many threats it enables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the security flaw because it "might compromise the security of our services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Greenbaum, a senior research manager for Symantec Corp., declined to criticize the ActiveX technology itself, as the security vendor has done in the past. And he applauded Microsoft's decision to take down the feature until the security hole is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Attackers are focusing on vulnerabilities in popular websites in order to reach as wide an audience as possible with their attacks, and leveraging such a popular site as an attack vector would be a huge victory for any online criminal," Greenbaum wrote in an e-mail. "Disabling the vulnerable functionality until a proper solution can be put in place is absolutely the right thing to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While popular, the Attach Photo feature has been hit by several problems in the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2007, users at the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) forums complained about being blocked from using Attach Photo due to Internet Explorer 7's security settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2008, a poster at Mozilla Firefox's support forum complained about the feature being disabled. This was echoed by a poster at Windows Live Help in March this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reply, a Microsoft representative posted that the Attach Photo feature was incompatible with the 64-bit version of Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings believes The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO; Coca-Cola) is not likely
to follow PepsiCo, Inc.'s (NYSE: PEP; PepsiCo) footsteps in acquiring its large
U.S. bottlers as the transaction is more financially compelling for PepsiCo. In
a special report, Fitch estimates the PepsiCo transaction would produce roughly
three-times the synergies plus savings from elimination of shared corporate
functions verses the possible synergies Coca-Cola would achieve in a
hypothetical purchase of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE). 

'PepsiCo's announced acquisition of its bottlers represents a significant shift
in the company's structure but we're not expecting Coca-Cola to follow suit,'
said Christopher Collins, Associate Director at Fitch. 'We estimate that PepsiCo
would gain significant additional synergies from its acquisition versus a
Coca-Cola purchase of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. due to the separate Gatorade
distribution system and lagging efficiency efforts in the Pepsi system.' 

'Furthermore, PepsiCo's overall bottling system is more fragmented than
Coca-Cola's and in light of declining North America carbonated soft drinks
consumption; PepsiCo's major bottlers have less incentive to merge on their own.
In addition to allowing PepsiCo to capture significant cost savings, a
consolidated bottling system also provides the company with control to more
effectively implement operating and marketing strategies,' said Wesley E.
Moultrie II, Senior Director at Fitch. 

According to the report, one major reason PepsiCo's acquisition is likely to be
more lucrative than a Coca-Cola/CCE combination is Gatorade's separate
distribution. Gatorade is sold in the same channels as products distributed by
Pepsi bottlers but is distributed by PepsiCo, so PepsiCo has in effect,
duplicate distribution systems for its beverages. Coca-Cola has for the most
part maintained distribution of its entire beverage line-up through its
bottlers. 

Pepsi system efficiency efforts have lagged behind the Coca-Cola system. PepsiCo
and its bottlers have established a purchasing cooperative to gain purchasing
power in buying raw materials. While the Coca-Cola system also has a purchasing
cooperative, the Coca-Cola system has undertaken more initiatives, from
experimenting with concentrate pricing frameworks to engaging in greater supply
chain cooperation. Through a purchase, PepsiCo can effect similar changes but
keep a substantial portion of the cost savings. 

While the U.S. market is the largest for retail beverages, PepsiCo relies on it
for over half of its revenues, compared to Coca-Cola, for which North America
accounts for just over 25% of its net revenues. When the greater synergies are
considered in combination with the importance of the U.S. market to PepsiCo,
bottler consolidation represents a greater opportunity for PepsiCo than
Coca-Cola.

&lt;p&gt; * South Africa eyes Angola oil sector&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * PetroSA and Sonangol to work together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Henrique Almeida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LUANDA, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Angolan and South African
businesses urged an end to visa restrictions they say are
damaging economic ties between South Africa, the continent's
largest economy, and one of Africa's biggest oil producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The often laborious process of obtaining visas is considered
a significant barrier to travelling between the two countries
and a stumbling block for business and trade. A work visa for
Angola can sometimes take more than a year to process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The free movement of business people between the countries
is a necessary pre-condition for the growth of the economic
partnership," the Angolan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and
the Business Unity of South Africa said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During South African President Jacob Zuma's two-day trip to
Angola, which ends on Friday, both nations signed six accords to
cooperate in areas ranging from aviation to trade, but failed to
scrap visa requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Angolan and South African business urges both governments
to address the visa concerns expressed during the business
forum," the two business groups added in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than 150 South Africans delegates representing nearly
120 companies met their Angolan counterparts in Luanda on
Thursday in what Zuma billed as the "biggest business delegation
to take part in a state visit since the end of apartheid".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zuma, closer to Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
than former South African President Thabo Mbeki, said in a
speech on Thursday he would help open the doors to the Angolan
market where opportunities in the oil sector abound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OIL SECTOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As Africa's largest economy South Africa is in a position
to be of benefit to Africa's largest oil producer," Zuma told
Angolan and South African business leaders late on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angolan state-owned oil firm Sonangol and the Petroleum Oil
and Gas Corporation of South Africa (PetroSA) are expected to
meet soon to discuss ways to work together, according to dos
Santos, who did not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Huge opportunities still remain in the petroleum and gas
sectors in Angola with 28 of the 51 concessions offshore still
to be licensed and explorations under way offshore," the two
business groups said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Africa's biggest economy has been sidelined from Angola for
decades as lucrative oil contracts were awarded to U.S. and
European oil companies such as Chevron (CVX.N) and BP (BP.L).
Roads, bridges and dams destroyed by the 1975-2002 civil war
have been rebuilt by Chinese, Brazilian and Portuguese firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two nations are also looking for investment
opportunities in the mining, agriculture, transport, tourism and
banking sectors. Standard Bank's (SBKJ.J) chief executive for
Africa told Reuters he would soon open a branch in Luanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angola emerged from an almost three-decade civil war in 2002
to rival Nigeria as Africa's biggest oil producer while South
Africa has little oil and relies on coal for most of its energy
needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2007, South Africa exports to Angola amounted to 6
billion rand ($753.5 million) whilst Angolan exports to South
Africa amounted to 12 billion rand, according to Zuma. Almost 90
percent of Angola's exports were petroleum products.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Citi May Levy Annual Charges

In order to offset potential losses from new legislation signed by President
Obama, rising credit card defaults and increasing unemployment, Citigroup (C) is
considering charging its credit card customers an annual fee. 

In May, the president signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and
Disclosure -- Credit CARD Act -- of 2009 into law. The legislation will improve
consumer disclosures and end some egregious practices in the credit card
industry but stops short of capping interest rates and fees. Most of the
provisions go into effect from Feb. 22, 2010, unless otherwise stated. 

Despite being touted as a victory for consumers, the bill could have unintended
consequences as credit card companies look for ways to make up for potential
lost revenue. 

Credit card companies have been gearing up for the new landscape for months,
mailing consumers a spate of warnings about fee and interest rate changes.
Citigroup is in the process of informing some cardholders that it will institute
an annual fee, about $30, on certain accounts. 

American Express Co. (AXP) recently sent out notice that it will eliminate
over-the-limit fees on its consumer credit cards in October. 

Competitors Bank of America Corp (BAC), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and JP
Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) have yet not decided to levy annual charges on its card
holders.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
holds a weekly meeting of its research analysts where they
offer trading ideas that are given to top clients, the Wall
Street Journal reported on its website on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But the paper cited Steven Strongin, Goldman's stock
research chief, as saying these meetings did not give anyone an
unfair advantage and the tips did not contradict research notes
that carry predictions over a longer term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's analysts talk about short-term developments
around specific stocks during the meeting, called a "trading
huddle", which is also attended by some of the firm's own
traders, the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The practice started some two years ago, and since then the
Wall Street firm has given ideas on hundreds of stocks, the
Journal reported, citing internal Goldman documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman could not be reached immediately for comment on
Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company told the Journal that its own traders were not
allowed to use the information until it had been given to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Journal also cited Goldman spokesman Edward Canaday as
saying that a comment that could lead to changes such as those
in earnings estimate, ratings or price target must be sent out
to all clients. But Canaday told the Journal that it was rare
for comments to reach such levels.

&lt;p&gt;Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators are examining
weekly meetings at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), where
research analysts offer tips to traders and then to big
clients, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman will be asked to provide more information about the
meetings by examiners from Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a related story, click [ID:nN2380953]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The WSJ, citing internal Goldman documents, said the
short-term tips given at the meetings differed from long-term
research. In the distribution of trading tips, there have been
no accusations of securities law violations against Goldman,
the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It quotd a Goldman spokesman as saying: "We believe the
disclosure we have now is entirely appropriate. Analysts are
not allowed to express differing views without publishing that
view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and FINRA could not be immediately reached for
comment by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment on Goldman,
but said, "as a general matter, broker-dealers have obligations
to use research information properly, disclose conflicts of
interests by research analysts, and ensure their publicly
available research is consistent with privately expressed
views."

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of plans to put a new face on Yahoo Messenger and Mail and add functions to its search engine came after news that Google and Yahoo each lost a fraction of a point of U.S. search share to Microsoft last month [nN18441019].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not a version of Bing," Prabhakar Raghavan, a senior vice president of Yahoo, said to reporters at the company's headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are Yahoo and that will continue...We collaborate on the back-end but we are competitors on the front-end," he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a press event held at their headquarters, the company gave more details of its complex relationship with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of July, Microsoft and Yahoo signed a 10-year deal under which search on Yahoo's websites will be generated by Microsoft's new Bing search engine. The companies hope the deal will take effect early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will license Yahoo's search technology, allowing it to integrate certain aspects of it into Bing. Microsoft's advertising search product, AdCenter, will also replace Yahoo's equivalent product, Panama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan said that when Microsoft sends ads along with its answers to queries, Yahoo may or may not use all of them, depending on a complex formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new series of boxes to the left of search results and ads will give users more ways to make use of what they have found, said Larry Cornett, Yahoo vice president of search products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A box powered by Internet security company McAfee Inc, will filter dangerous links.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 24 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Securities gave
securities backed by the riskiest mortgage assets a thumbs up
on Monday and moved to an 'overweight' on subprime securities
amid signs the ailing economy and housing market are turning
the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Overwhelmingly, positive supply-demand conditions and the
growing body of evidence that economic recovery and improvement
in housing is underway," led to the bullish move, said Chris
Flanagan, JPMorgan analyst in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; July existing home sales, posting their strongest reading
in two years, climbed to an annualized pace of 5.24 million in
a sign of a turnaround for the ailing housing market. Home
sales have been helped by better affordability, a stabilizing
economy, and perhaps an $8,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit,
the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In yet another sign that the worst of the housing decline,
which began in 2006, has passed, the NAHB housing market index
increased to 18 in August from 17 in July. While still at a low
level, the index rise suggest an improving trend, the analyst
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The increase suggests that there will be continued gains
in new home sales and that high levels of affordability are
beginning to take hold," said Flanagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment firm turned 'overweight' on the securities
that once wreaked havoc on investors and led to billions of
dollars in writedowns at banks for the second time in nine
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's first bullish call on the risky securities came
in late 2008 after the Federal Reserve set policy aimed at
lowering consumer mortgage rates, boosting incentives for
refinancing and buying homes. The weighting was reversed to
'underweight' in February after the firm said President Barack
Obama's housing plan failed to address the core problem of
negative equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The lack of change in government policy compels us to move
to an 'underweight' on subprime RMBS since we see minimal
support provided to help stop home price and asset price
declines," said Flanagan, in a February report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In late March, the firm moved to a "neutral" weighting on
subprime RMBS on the anticipated rollout of the Private-Public
Investment Program and expanded Term Asset-Backed Securities
Loan Facility (TALF) program for legacy securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news led to a rally in both cash subprime mortgage
securities and those tied to the ABX derivatives index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While volatility will no doubt be part of the landscape
going forward, the analyst said the trend to lower yields and
generalized yield convergence is expected to continue. Recent
selloffs have provided attractive entry points for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Risky asset yields continue to decline from crisis levels
as economic recovery takes hold. ABX and subprime will be last
responders, but they will eventually follow suit. We continue
to look for yield declines of 300 to 600 basis points for
assets currently yielding 10 percent and above," said
Flanagan.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
The following statement is being issued by The Rossbacher Firm, Hagens Berman
Sobol Shapiro LLP, Wilentz Goldman &amp; Spitzer, P.A., Reed Smith LLP, and Thompson
Hine LLP pursuant to an Order of the Superior Court of the State of California,
for the County of LosAngeles, Central Civil West:

If You Made a Payment or Co-Payment For the Purchase of the Hormone Replacement
Therapy Drugs Estratest or Estratest H.S. in California, You Could Benefit From

California Only Case

I.WHAT IS THIS NOTICE ABOUT?

Since August 2003, two class action lawsuits have been pending in California
state court. The lawsuits, filed by individuals, have been brought on behalf of
any person or Third Party Payor ("TPP") who paid any part of the cost of
Estratest or Estratest H.S. (collectively referred to as "Estratest"), purchased
in California at any time since August 7, 1999. The lawsuits exclude persons
with pending claims against Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Solvay") for personal
injury or wrongful death, and also exclude persons or TPP`s who purchased
Estratest for purposes of resale (the "Class"). Plaintiffs assert claims against
Solvay for violations of California state unfair competition and false and
deceptive advertising laws in connection with Solvay`s marketing of Estratest.
Solvay denies the claims asserted by plaintiffs and has denied that it engaged
in unfair, false or deceptive marketing related to Estratest. Solvay further
maintains that purchasers have not been injured and are not entitled to any
monetary damages or other forms of relief. A California state court certified a
California Class on May 1, 2008. The parties have agreed to a settlement of the
litigation. 

II.WHAT IS ESTRATEST AND HOW WAS IT USED?

Estratest is a prescription hormone replacement therapy drug within a class of
drugs prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms
associated with menopause in patients whose symptoms are not relieved by
estrogen alone. 

III.WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF SETTLEMENT?

Solvay has agreed to pay $30 million dollars into a Settlement Fund to pay
refunds to purchasers of Estratest. The Settlement Fund will also be used to pay
for the reasonable costs of notice to the California Class, the costs of claims
administration, and reasonable attorneys` fees, expenses, and Plaintiff`s
incentive awards to be approved by the Court. Purchasers will be allowed to
obtain refunds not to exceed 30% of the purchase price paid for Estratest. Funds
remaining after disbursements, if any, will be distributed by cy pres per Court
Order consistent with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &#167;384 and the Settlement Agreement. In
order to obtain a refund, Class Members must timely submit a claim form stating
their total out of pocket expenditures for Estratest during the Class period.
The Settlement provides a release by Class Members of any current or future
California non-personal injury claims against Solvay relating to Solvay`s
marketing, advertising and sale of Estratest, including representations about
the regulatory status of Estratest. If the Court approves the settlement and it
becomes final, the class action lawsuits will be dismissed, with prejudice, and
Class Members will not be able to sue Solvay in the future based upon the same
claims. 

IV.WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS?

If you believe you are a member of the Class and wish to participate in the
settlement you must submit a claim form to the Claims Administrator at the
address listed below, postmarked on or before February 12, 2010. You may file a
motion with the Court for permission to appear, intervene, and/or object, filed,

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta Aug 24 (Reuters) - The 98,200 barrel per
day Hibernia offshore oil project southeast of St. John's,
Newfoundland and Labrador, was unaffected by hurricane Bill, a
spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil Corp. said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hibernia wasn't in the path of Bill, the first named
hurricane of the year. However the company has not yet had a
chance to assess any damage to its Sable Offshore Energy
Project off the coast of Nova Scotia, which was closer to the
center of the storm that passed through the region on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spokeswoman Margot Bruce-O'Connell said a team had
been sent to one of Sable's platforms on Monday morning and
other assessment teams would soon be dispatched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Employees were evacuated from the Sable project last week
before the storm arrived. Gas production had already been shut
down for scheduled maintenance.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) holds a weekly meeting of its research analysts where they offer trading ideas that are given to top clients, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company Will Provide Scholarships to Spelman College in Honor of Retired
Executive Vicki R. Palmer


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE), the world`s largest marketer, distributor,
and producer of Coca-Cola products, today announced the establishment of The
Vicki R. Palmer Scholarship Program, created in honor of Spelman College trustee
and retired Coca-Cola Enterprises executive Vicki R. Palmer. CCE will fund
$25,000 in annual scholarships to the College in support of the program. 

Given to students with academic promise, a demonstrated financial need, and a
proven commitment to community service, The Vicki R. Palmer Scholarship will
also provide Spelman students an opportunity to complete a summer internship at
CCE. 

"The Vicki R. Palmer Scholarship honors Vicki`s invaluable contributions to our
company, while representing CCE`s ongoing commitment to attract and retain a
diverse, inclusive, and highly talented workforce," said John F. Brock, chairman
and chief executive officer, Coca-Cola Enterprises. "This program recognizes her
dedication to community service, diversity, inclusion, and the empowerment of
women, which are all trademarks of her leadership style." 

Throughout her 25-year tenure in the Coca-Cola system, Mrs. Palmer was committed
to helping fulfill the Company`s diversity and inclusion goals of recruiting,
retaining and promoting minorities and women, and providing opportunities for
women and minority-owned businesses. 

"I am honored by CCE`s generosity in establishing this scholarship program,
which will serve as a lasting legacy," said Mrs. Palmer. "This tribute
underscores the missions of CCE and Spelman, both of which are committed to
preparing young leaders for a competitive, global business environment while
making a positive social impact." 

An avid supporter of Spelman College, Mrs. Palmer was elected to the school`s
board of trustees in 1995. Currently, she serves as chair of the Investment
Committee and is a member of the Audit, Finance and Budget Committee; Audit
Sub-Committee; and Executive Committee. 

"As a board member for more than 14 years, Vicki has demonstrated her passion
for student development and mentorship by actively engaging business and
community leaders in support of Spelman`s vision," said Dr. Beverly Daniel
Tatum, president, Spelman College. "The Palmer Scholarship celebrates this
passion by providing financial support and career training to help Spelman women
become leaders in a 21st century global economy." 

Mrs. Palmer made lasting leadership contributions to both CCE and the Atlanta
community over her distinguished career. She was initially hired by The
Coca-Cola Company in 1983 before joining CCE`s initial leadership team as
Assistant Treasurer when the company formed in 1986. She was then elected
Corporate Vice President and Treasurer in 1992; Senior Vice President and
Special Assistant to the CEO in 2000; and served as Executive Vice President,
Financial Services and Administration from 2004 until her retirement earlier
this year. 

Founded in 1881, Spelman College is a prestigious, highly selective, liberal
arts college that prepares women to change the world. Located in Atlanta, Ga.,
this historically black college boasts a 79 percent graduation rate, and
outstanding alumnae such as Children's Defense Fund Founder Marian Wright
Edelman; former U.S. Foreign Service Director General Ruth Davis, authors Tina
McElroy Ansa and Pearl Cleage; and actress LaTanya Richardson. More than 83
percent of the full-time faculty members have Ph.D.s or other terminal degrees,
and the average faculty to student ratio is 12:1. More than 2,100 students
attend Spelman. For more information, visit www.spelman.edu. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises is the world`s largest marketer, producer, and distributor
of bottle and can liquid nonalcoholic refreshment. CCE sells approximately 80
percent of The Coca-Cola Company`s bottle and can volume in North America and is
the sole licensed bottle for products of The Coca-Cola Company in Belgium,
continental France, Great Britain, Luxembourg, Monaco, and the Netherlands. For

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Social Democrat (SPD) Frank-Walter Steinmeier is running against conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany's federal election, scheduled for September 27.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some facts about Steinmeier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- A political unknown at the national level when he was appointed foreign minister in 2005, the 53-year old Steinmeier quickly emerged as one of Germany's most popular politicians. He took over the symbolic post of vice-chancellor in November 2007 and was named the Social Democrat (SPD) candidate for chancellor in September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Chief of staff to former SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder from 1999 to 2005, Steinmeier has shown himself to be an effective behind-the-scenes mediator and fixer, but his experience as a politician is limited. He has never been elected to office, lacks campaigning experience and has not shown the rhetorical skills and charisma of his mentor Schroeder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Steinmeier is seen as a moderate within the SPD. He has defended Schroeder's controversial "Agenda 2010" economic reforms against left-wing members of his party but supports traditional SPD positions on phasing out nuclear power, extending the minimum wage and raising taxes on the most wealthy Germans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- As foreign minister, Steinmeier has taken issue with Merkel's open criticism of human rights violations in countries like China and Russia. Unlike Merkel, he also favors Turkish entry into the European Union. But he has worked harmoniously with her on a range of other foreign policy issues, from keeping German troops in Afghanistan, to confronting Iran over its nuclear program and negotiating binding goals to combat climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Born in Detmold, western Germany in 1956, the white-haired, bespectacled Steinmeier studied law and political science at Giessen University. He is married and has one daughter. He likes jazz and is an avid football fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Noah Barkin; Editing by Charles Dick)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * UAE banks' cost of risk to remain high&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Funding shortage to affect UAE banks' growth potential&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * UAE banks' profitability to remain attractive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DUBAI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - UAE banks, whose second-quarter
profits were hit by credit provisions, may see growth curbed by
difficult funding conditions but their overall profitability is
attractive, Goldman Sachs said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank earlier revised its ratings and stock price targets
on five UAE banks. [ID:nWNAB2815]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs cut First Gulf Bank FGB.AD to neutral, while
raising Dubai Islamic Bank DISB.DU and Abu Dhabi Commercial
Bank ADCB.AD to neutral. It also downgraded National Bank of
Abu Dhabi NBAD.AD to sell from neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We ... expect funding trends to become more challenging
going forward, which will negatively affect UAE banks' growth
potential," Goldman Sachs said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But while we expect the cost of risk to remain high and top
line pressure to emerge due to narrowing margins and lower
volumes, we estimate that profitability levels in general will
remain attractive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many of the banks in the UAE saw second-quarter profits
decline because of provisions booked against a rise in loan
defaults. That level of non-performing loans is "rising and may
remain elevated for the rest of the year," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main risks for the UAE banks are the continuous pressure
on real estate prices and falling corporate profits, which could
result in higher-than-anticipated credit losses and lower
investment values, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UAE banks' shares have underperformed global peers, as
investors remain concerned "despite significant support from
local governments, which have helped boost funding and
capitalization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While it is not surprising that non-performing loan ratios
are increasing and thus the cost of risk is rising, so far,
asset quality deterioration has been gradual and well within our
expectations," according to the research report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concerns have mounted recently over the fallout of the debt
troubles at two Saudi conglomerates -- Saad Group [SAADG.UL] and
Ahmad Algosaibi  Bros -- to which several UAE banks are
exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Goldman said the banks' total exposure is relatively
small and that systemic risk due to credit quality is low. UAE
banks have been prudent in their provisions, the real estate is
mostly secured and that they remain among the best capitalized
in the world, according to the analysts.

&lt;p&gt;A week earlier, U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Davis had issued the injunction and ordered that Microsoft pay $290 million in damages and interest to Toronto-based i4i Inc. for infringing on that company's patent for a document system that uses XML custom formatting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The i4i technology allows users of Word 2003, Word 2007 and Word for Mac 2008 to create custom XML documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its emergency motion filed Aug. 18 with the U.S. Court of Appeals, Microsoft warned of the business disruption and asked that the injunction be stayed during the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if Microsoft ultimately succeeds on appeal, it will never be able to recoup the funds expended in redesigning and redistributing Word, the sales lost during the period when Word and Office are barred from the market, and the diminished goodwill from Microsoft's many retail and industrial customers," Microsoft argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said that an injunction would "inflict irreparable harm on Microsoft by potentially keeping the centerpiece of its product line (Office) out of the market for months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry Negrin, a partner at New York law firm Pryor Cashman LLP who has practiced patent and trademark law for 17 years, said that Davis' conclusion that Microsoft willfully infringed on the i4i patent will probably hurt the company's chances for an injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 65-page summary opinion, Davis said that Microsoft knew of the patent held by i4i as early as 2001 but nevertheless set out to make the Canadian developer's software "obsolete" by adding a custom XML feature to Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negrin also contended that Microsoft could use an " easy technical work-around" to sidestep the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All Microsoft has to do is disable the custom XML feature, which should be pretty easy to do, then give that a different SKU number from what's been sold, so it's easy to distinguish the two versions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft requested that the court order i4i to respond to its motion by Aug. 24, and it promised to reply to any i4i response by Aug. 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This version of the story originally appeared in Computerworld 's print edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO--(Business Wire)--
Biovail Corporation (NYSE:BVF) (TSX:BVF) today announced that its subsidiary,
Biovail Laboratories International SRL (BLS), has entered into an agreement with
Santhera Pharmaceuticals (Switzerland) Ltd., a subsidiary of Santhera
Pharmaceuticals Holding AG (SIX: SANN) to acquire the U.S. and Canadian rights
to develop and commercialize Santhera`s JP-1730/fipamezole for the treatment of
Dyskinesia in Parkinson`s Disease (DPD). JP-1730/ fipamezole is a first-in-class
compound that, in a recent Phase IIb study, displayed the potential to reduce
levodopa-induced dyskinesia. 

Bill Wells, Biovail`s Chief Executive Officer said, "This agreement with
Santhera is directly on strategy and another important step in our efforts to
build a sustainable product-development pipeline in specialty central nervous
system disorders." 

"Biovail is an emerging key player in the area of neurodegenerative disorders.
With its commitment to this therapeutic area and the strong track record it has
developed in a short period of time, I am confident that JP-1730/fipamezole will
become a key product for the improved management of Parkinson`s disease," said
Klaus Schollmeier, Chief Executive Officer of Santhera." 

Under the terms of the agreement, which covers only the U.S. and Canada, and
subject to customary closing conditions, Biovail will make an upfront payment of
$8 million, a further payment of $4 million upon the successful closing of
Santhera`s acquisition of Oy Juvantia Pharma Ltd., and will pay up to $35
million in potential development and regulatory milestones associated with the
initiation of a Phase III study, regulatory submissions and approvals of
JP-1730/fipamezole in DPD. The agreement also stipulates that Biovail make
additional milestone payments of up to $145 million as certain sales thresholds
are met. Biovail will also make royalty payments of 8% to 15% on net commercial
sales of JP-1730/fipamezole. 

Should Biovail pursue a second indication, up to $20 million in additional
success milestones would be payable to Santhera upon approval. 

Biovail will be responsible for the remaining clinical development programs and
costs in the U.S. and Canada. The companies have agreed to collaborate on the
development program. Santhera will have the right to use and sublicense data
generated for development and commercialization purposes outside of North
America. Initiation of the first Phase III study in the U.S. is scheduled for
2011. Santhera will retain co-promotion rights in the U.S. 

About Dyskinesia in Parkinson`s Disease

Parkinson`s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Doctors
prescribe levodopa and other dopaminergic compounds as standard therapy. Over
time, as the disease progresses, the beneficial effects of this medication often
diminish and additional movement disorders can appear (sometimes quite severe).
These movement disorders include dyskinesia which can be described as sudden
uncontrollable, often chaotic movements of limbs, face, tongue and body. These
complications derive principally from long-term levodopa use, but there is
currently no alternative to using levodopa or dopamine agonists. It is estimated
that approximately 400,000 patients in Europe and North America are affected by
troublesome dyskinesia associated with their levodopa therapy. 

About Fipamezole

Fipamezole is an antagonist of the adrenergic alpha-2 receptor with a novel mode
of action in the treatment of Dyskinesia in Parkinson`s Disease. The rationale
behind the development of fipamezole is to increase noradrenergic release in
certain areas of the brain, resulting in rebalancing of the distorted brain
network and potentially alleviating symptoms of advanced Parkinson`s disease
such as dyskinesia, motor fluctuations, orthostatic hypotension and cognitive
impairment without exacerbating the underlying Parkinsonian features of the
disease. In a recent Phase IIb study, Santhera demonstrated that
JP-1730/fipamezole has the potential to reduce Dyskinesia in Parkinson`s Disease
with the study results also suggesting that the drug has the potential to reduce
"off time" and improve cognitive function. Furthermore, the reduction in
dyskinesia was found to be strongly correlated with the investigator`s clinical
global impression of improvement in overall condition.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday it would temporarily restrict the issuing of U.S. visas in Honduras, raising pressure on the government that took power after a June 28 coup to step down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The State Department, which has repeatedly condemned the military coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya, said that from Wednesday it would only provide visa services to potential immigrants and emergency cases at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration has urged Honduran authorities to accept proposals put forward by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, whose efforts to end the crisis have stalled over the de facto government's refusal to allow Zelaya to return to power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Jose accord proposed last month by the Nobel Peace Prize winner would have allowed Zelaya to return to office until elections are held by the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the visa decision was intended to reinforce an Organization of American States' delegation that landed in Honduras on Monday to try to persuade the de facto government to accept the Arias' plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In support of this mission and as a consequence of the de facto regime's reluctance to sign the San Jose accord, the U.S. Department of State is conducting a full review of our visa policy in Honduras," Kelly said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As part of that review, we are suspending non-emergency, non-immigrant visa services in the consular section of our embassy in Honduras, effective August 26," Kelly added. "We firmly believe a negotiated solution is the appropriate way forward and the San Jose Accord is the best solution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity told reporters the visa decision was "a signal of how seriously we are watching the situation" and said Washington was considering other steps though it was premature to disclose these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OAS later conceded that the delegation visiting Honduras had not been successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Mission regrets that it was not possible on this occasion to obtain the backing of the San Jose Accord," the OAS said in a statement reiterating its call for Honduran authorities to accept the proposal before the country's presidential campaign opens next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESISTING PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The de facto government, which has resisted pressure from Western hemisphere governments and international bodies to reinstate Zelaya, vowed on Tuesday to stick to a plan to hold a presidential election in November, even if other countries don't recognize the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be elections whether they are recognized or not," the country's caretaker leader Roberto Micheletti told foreign ministers from the region on a visit with Organization of American States chief Jose Miguel Insulza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They included ministers from Argentina, Canada, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama and the Dominican Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micheletti said his country could survive any economic sanctions imposed over his refusal to allow Zelaya's return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not afraid of anyone's embargo," Micheletti told the ministers. "This country can get by without your support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Honduran crisis has divided Washington. Earlier this month, 16 Democratic Congressmen wrote to Obama urging him to freeze the assets of coup leaders. But a group of Republican senators has sought to hold up confirmation of State Department appointments due to the administration's support for Zelaya, an ally of Venezuela's leftist president Hugo Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocacy group Human Rights Watch on Tuesday urged the international community, and the United States in particular, to ratchet up pressure on the de facto government in light of a report documenting abuses against Zelaya's supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said on Friday that four people had been shot dead in protests since the June 28 coup. It also criticized more than 3,500 arbitrary arrests aimed at silencing protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States, a long-time ally of Honduras and the country's top trading partner, has suspended some military aid, but the Obama administration has resisted imposing more far-reaching sanctions, citing the detrimental impact they could have on the country's struggling economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. government, in particular, could play a key role through the use of carefully targeted sanctions," said HRW director for the Americas, Jose Miguel Vivanco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivanco said the Obama administration should directly target members of the de facto government by denying them access to the U.S. banking system and targeting private companies associated with these officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gustavo Palencia in Tegucigalpa; Editing by David Storey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Citrix have decided not to sponsor next week&#8217;s VMworld virtualization conference and are maintaining only a limited presence at the show due to conflicts with rival VMware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won't see Microsoft's newest virtualization tool at VMworld&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMworld, though hosted by VMware rather than a neutral party, has become perhaps the most important virtualization conference in the IT industry. Nearly 200 companies, both partners and competitors to VMware, will be sponsoring the show or exhibiting products at the upcoming conference in San Francisco.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft and Citrix, who once embraced VMworld, are claiming that VMware is unfairly limiting competition at the show, a charge VMware denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Citrix have both served as &#8220;gold sponsors&#8221; at past VMworld conferences, including the September 2008 show in Las Vegas and the February 2009 show in France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for next week&#8217;s conference, Microsoft and Citrix are no longer sponsors and are listed merely as exhibitors. Additionally, Microsoft claims new restrictions on vendors will prevent it from demonstrating its System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 R2 at VMworld, and Citrix claims VMware is forcing it to reschedule a Citrix Technology Professionals summit meeting so it doesn&#8217;t overlap with VMworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware denies that its sponsor and exhibitor policies are anything out of the ordinary for an industry conference, and has said it does not aim to limit the rights of competing vendors to exhibit technology at VMworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, a spokesperson for Citrix claimed in an e-mail to Network World that &#8220;VMworld guidelines prohibited Citrix from being a sponsor.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;VMworld is a proprietary event run by one vendor,&#8221; Citrix vice president of marketing Kim Woodward said in a statement. &#8220;At the end of the day, they have every right to change the rules in any way they wish. Citrix respects that and will fully comply with the terms of our show contract with them. When it comes down to it, if customers want a more open event, they will have to give that feedback directly to VMware or vote with their feet by attending other shows that don&#8217;t restrict competitors.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s no surprise that Microsoft and Citrix are taking the same stance, given that the companies have a tight virtualization partnership as they attempt to unseat VMware in the x86 virtualization market. Competition has been heating up in the past year, and the strategy of Microsoft and Citrix has been to tie their management products together so that customers can use one management platform for both hypervisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue over VMworld restrictions first arose in May, when it was reported that VMware modified its sponsor and exhibitor agreement to say that products exhibited at VMworld must be &#8220;complementary to VMware products and technologies.&#8221; At the time, VMware told Network World that despite the new language &#8220;competing vendors [will be] allowed to exhibit, including exhibiting competing products.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware reiterated its position in a statement Tuesday, which says &#8220;The exhibitor sponsorship contract we are using is standard across the industry; there is nothing out of the ordinary or meant to limit the value of VMworld. We are expecting a great turnout. Nearly 200 companies, including those with competitive solutions, will be participating in the conference this year.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft and Citrix have issued several criticisms of VMware&#8217;s new policies. Even though Microsoft will have a booth at VMworld, the company says it will not showcase its latest virtualization technology. "Next week at VMworld 2009 we can't show SCVMM [System Center Virtual Machine Manager] 2008 R2, or any other products, in our booth,&#8221; Microsoft's Patrick O'Rourke wrote in a blog post Tuesday. &#8220;In short, it's their show, it's not an industry show, and they set the rules.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even last year, when Microsoft was still a VMworld sponsor, the company conducted some guerrilla marketing, passing out fake casino chips directing attendees to a Web site titled "VMware Costs Way Too Much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, Citrix technologist Rich Crusco wrote in his blog that Citrix had to cancel a virtualization event of its own because of a policy that VMworld exhibitors cannot promote any competing event within 50 miles of VMworld in the days leading up to and after the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citrix CTO Simon Crosby also writes that Citrix was unable to organize a meeting at a hotel near the Moscone Center, where VMworld is being held, because VMware allegedly banned the hotel from renting facilities to VMware competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ridiculous thing about this is that I thought that VMware was trying to convince us that VMworld is an industry show for virtualization,&#8221; Crosby writes. &#8220;It clearly isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;A panel of federal judges has granted Microsoft Corp.'s request for a fast-track appeal of the injunction that prohibits the company from selling its popular Word software after Oct. 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft must make its case to the three judges by the end of business today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit last week approved Microsoft's demand for an expedited hearing for its appeal. At the same time, the court denied Microsoft's motion for an "administrative stay" that would have nullified the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injunction, which bars Microsoft from selling Word 2003 and Word 2007 in their current forms after Oct 10, was mandated by U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Davis on Aug. 11 after the company was found guilty by a Texas jury of infringing a patent held by Canadian software developer i4i Inc. Davis also awarded i4i more than $290 million in damages and interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 18, Microsoft filed a motion to stay the injunction while it takes the case to appeal. In that motion, Microsoft warned of "massive disruptions" to its sales, as well as those of important OEM (original equipment manufacturers) partners such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., if the injunction was not put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a patent attorney with 17 years experience said Microsoft would be able to quickly create a workaround to disable the offending Word's "custom" XML feature, the company claimed it would be unable to modify Word 2003 and Word 2007 by the Oct. 10 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Court of Appeals calendar for the case, Microsoft must file a brief today outlining its arguments for the stay. i4i's response brief is due two weeks later, on Sept. 8, while Microsoft's reply to that must reach the court by noon on Sept. 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An oral hearing is slated for Sept. 23, less than three weeks before the injunction is to take effect. The Court of Appeals would render its verdict on Microsoft's motion at some point after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, the judge said in a summary opinion of the case that evidence presented during the May trial showed Microsoft intended to make i4i's software "obsolete" by adding the custom XML feature to Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis also took shots at Microsoft for trying to do business as usual in the face of the verdict and his injunction. "Even after several years of litigation and a jury verdict of infringement, Microsoft requests the ability to continue selling the accused products and release an upcoming product with the same infringing functionality," Davis said two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i4i did not respond to a request for comment on the expedited schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

It also criticized more than 3,500 arbitrary arrests aimed at silencing protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States, a long-time ally of Honduras and the country's top trading partner, has suspended some military aid, but the Obama administration has resisted imposing more far-reaching sanctions, citing the detrimental impact they could have on the country's struggling economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. government, in particular, could play a key role through the use of carefully targeted sanctions," said HRW director for the Americas, Jose Miguel Vivanco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivanco said the Obama administration should directly target members of the de facto government by denying them access to the U.S. banking system and targeting private companies associated with these officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gustavo Palencia in Tegucigalpa; Writing by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Monday put the last bit of polish on the newest edition of its System Center Virtual Machine Manager, but said Tuesday users won't see it next week in the software giant's booth at VMworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Next week at VMworld 2009 we can't show SCVMM [System Center Virtual Machine Manager] 2008 R2, or any other products, in our booth. &#8230; In short, it's their show, it's not an industry show, and they set the rules. So we'll make the best of it; always lots of Microsoft customers and partners on the floor. Stop by the booth to meet some of the best/brightest minds at Microsoft," Microsoft's Patrick O'Rourke wrote Tuesday on the company's Virtualization Team Blog. "Ordinarily it'd be great news that we RTM'd System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 R2 ahead of schedule, so close to the RTM of WS08 [Windows Server 2008] R2 Hyper-V and one week before VMworld conference. You can't beat the timing of it all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 things we love/hate about VMware's vSphere &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing centers on Microsoft finally adding Live Migration support to its virtualization management tools and the fact it lines up with the Live Migration capabilities in the just released Windows Server 2008 R2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marquee feature in SCVMM 2008 R2 is support for the new Microsoft server platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft's inability to show its SCVMM might be as much the company's own doing as a VMware requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware did alter its contract for exhibitors earlier this year to include language that prohibits exhibitors from demonstrating services that "overlap/substitute with VMware's products/capabilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new contract touched off such a fierce firestorm of commentary that VMware felt compelled to clarify its position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware says the language is only a standard part of tradeshow contracts and that it has no plans to enforce the restriction.A VMware spokeswoman reiterated that position in an e-mail to Network World in May, saying, "Yes, competing vendors are allowed to exhibit, including exhibiting competing products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft either did not get the message, or it has clearly decided to follow the terms of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of the competition between the two vendors, it could be that Microsoft is using the contract dustup in order to exhibit a little competition by painting VMware as a company that fears competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to focus heavily in 2010 on its management and virtualization platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last month, Bob Muglia, president of the server and tools division, told financial analysts that virtualization and management are keys to the division's long-term strategy in regards to cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do anticipate that management and virtualization will continue to be our strongest performing, as a percentage-wise part of our business, during fiscal year 2010," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is our expectation that our [virtualization] growth will accelerate substantially this fiscal year, largely, and almost completely at the expense of VMware," Muglia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muglia said its System Center management tools portfolio has been growing 30% per year and producing more than $1 billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow John on Twitter: twitter.com/johnfontana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. today announced it was expanding an antipiracy program for Office to the U.S., the U.K. and 11 other countries that will identify pirated copies of the suite and nag users with on-screen messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansion follows a pilot program Microsoft launched in four countries in April 2008, then extended to an additional 24. This is the first time, however, that Microsoft has asked U.S. users to install a notifications component that pesters users if it determines the copy of Office is illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the download of the notification component was "voluntary," and that it has started to push the software to users today. Because the program is launching over several months, not everyone will see it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Windows XP users, the update is marked "High Priority" in the list generated when they retrieve downloads from Microsoft Update; Vista users see it tagged as "Important." Even if users have Automatic Updates set to download and install all updates, the notifications software requires users to accept an End User License Agreement (EULA) before it will install.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, once it's downloaded and installed, the new notifications application cannot be uninstalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notifications component that Microsoft is pitching is separate from the companion validations element: The former posts periodic messages on the screens of PCs running illegal copies of Office, while the latter determines if the software is legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one time, Office users had to validate their copies in order to access add-ons, such as free Office 2007 templates, and to use Office Update, an Office-only service that was just terminated in favor of the combination Windows-Office service dubbed "Microsoft Update."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last spring, Microsoft dropped those requirements, and allowed users running counterfeit copies to download add-ons. With the disappearance of Office Update earlier this month, all users can grab security and bug-fix updates via Microsoft Update, regardless of the status of their software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft's support site, Office Genuine Advantage Notifications software puts up a message when a pirated copy is launched. "This copy of Microsoft Office is not genuine," the message reads. "Please excuse this interruption. This copy of Microsoft Office did not pass validation. Click Learn More for details and for help identifying the best way to get genuine Microsoft Office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also adds a message-bearing toolbar to Office XP and Office 2003, and adds a similar message to the "ribbon" interface of Office 2007. "This copy of Office is not genuine. Click here to learn more," the toolbar and ribbon messages read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010, the still-in-the-works version slated to ship in the first half of next year, will also include antipiracy validation and notification elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has periodically faced resistance to its anticounterfeit programs, including Windows Genuine, as well as the lesser-known Office cousin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At times, the complaints have been extremely vocal. Last year, Microsoft inadvertently pushed the pilot notifications program -- meant to reach users only in Chile, Italy, Spain and Turkey -- to customers worldwide via Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), triggering a flood of false warnings and getting system administrators hot under the collar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, the notifications update to WSUS machines had been ranked "Critical," which meant most corporate update servers automatically approved it and pushed it to client PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This update was deployed as a CRITICAL Update? While this may be critical to Microsoft's bottom line, any clear-thinking IT person would assume (silly me) that a critical update would be critical to IT in the sense of stability or security," said a user identified as Chris Edwards-Dawn in a support forum at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acknowledged its mistake, but waited several days to provide an official explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it has in the past, Microsoft today said the expansion of its Office program was meant to protect customers. "The ultimate goal of our programs that stem the flood of piracy is not only to lessen the impact of these illegal activities, but also to ensure that our customers enjoy all the capabilities -- as well as the peace of mind -- that come with using genuine software," said Cori Hartje, senior director of Microsoft's anticounterfeit group, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokeswoman added to Hartje's comment saying, "Non-genuine software has been shown to be more vulnerable to viruses and spyware, which can be used to damage a user's PC or steal their personal information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users whose copies of Office 2007 are flagged as bogus -- and only Office 2007; earlier editions aren't eligible -- may qualify for a free replacement through Microsoft's Office Complimentary Offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

P Finds Buyer for Drug Business

Warner Chilcott, a specialty drug maker, recently announced plans to acquire
Procter &amp; Gamble Co.`s (NYSE: PG) prescription drug business for about $3
billion. 

Last December, P had announced its intention to restrict making new
investments in the pharmaceutical division and divest its interest in the
healthcare brands. It decided to focus more on over-the-counter products such as
Pepto Bismol, Prilosec, Vicks cough medicines and other personal care brands.
Management stated that the pressure from generics was also one of the reasons
for it to consider divestiture of this business. 

Warner Chilcott, which makes birth control, female hormone therapies and
dermatological products, believes this acquisition will be a strategic fit to
its existing business. The deal is expected to expand its market share in the
women`s health market. Warner Chilcott will run the newly acquired business as
its 100% subsidiary. 

Private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management and drug maker Forest
Laboratories (FRX) had also shown their interest in purchasing P`s
prescription drug business. 

Several banks, including Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.
(NYSE: JPM), Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS), among others,are expected to provide
about $4 billion in financing for the deal. Out of this, Warner Chilcott will
use $3 billion for the acquisition and the remaining $1 billion for refinancing
its existing debt.

China Mobile Goes for "Ophones"

China Mobile (NYSE: CHL) has reportedly entered into a strategic agreement with
Taiwan-based High Tech Computer Corp (commonly known as HTC) today to jointly
develop 3G smartphones in China. The joint-venture will design and develop
handset models (called "Ophones") based on China Mobile`s home-grown TD-SCDMA 3G
technology. The agreement also covers the development of TD-LTE, a 4G mobile
broadband technology based network. 

HTC, the world`s largest maker of handsets based on Microsoft's (Nasdaq: MSFT)
Windows Mobile platform, will develop and supply at least seven 3G handset
models by 2010 (including one in 2009). On the other hand, China Mobile will
invest RMB47 million ($6.9 million) in the joint-venture and will provide
customer service and support. This strategic collaboration will significantly
help China Mobile to promote its TD-SCDMA technology in the nascent domestic 3G
wireless market. 

China Mobile is also exploring opportunities for technology collaboration with
other Taiwanese companies such as Chunghwa Telecom (NYSE: CHT) and MediaTek Inc.
Moreover, the company aims to acquire a 12% stake in Far EasTone
Telecommunications, Taiwan's third-largest mobile-phone operator by revenue, for
approximately $529 million. This strategic investment will open up an
opportunity for network and technology synergies as Far EasTone also plans to
develop 3G TD-SCDMA based network. 

In addition to the expansion of its 3G TD-SCDMA network, China Mobile is
increasingly focusing on developing 3G smartphones to counter competition from
Apple Inc.`s (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPhones. The company`s closest competitor, China
Unicom (NYSE: CHU), is currently negotiating with Apple to bring iPhones to
China, potentially in 2009. China Mobile hopes its relatively low-priced
smartphones will drive demand for 3G services in China and boost associated
subscriber growth.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are shrugging their shoulders at reports that Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) gives special trading advice and early access to analyst research to a select few clients, saying the practice is commonplace in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Goldman hosts a weekly meeting of its research analysts, joined by top clients, to discuss trading ideas. The story raised the issue of favoritism for top Goldman clients, prompting the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Securities and Exchange Commission to commence investigations, the paper said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA, the securities industry's regulatory arm, said it was looking into the situation. The SEC declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors like Marshall Front, chairman of Front Barnett Associates LLC, said Goldman Sachs is not alone among brokerage firms in "favoring their largest and most productive clients" with trading tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a big deal so long as market-moving information is not being shared, according to this view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as there is no deception involved and people aren't being misled, which I don't think is the case, it is just a common practice and Goldman is not alone in following it," said Front, whose Chicago-based firm manages $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others say Goldman risks alienating some of its smaller trading clients who do not enjoy access to these so-called trading "huddles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would be upset if I were a Goldman customer and I felt that others were getting information before I did," said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. "I think they have a customer relations problem on their hands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman did not return messages seeking comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the potential to anger clients, some, like investor Walter Todd, said sharing tips only with a firm's best customers may not be a "best practice." But they don't see how it breaks the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't necessarily agree with it, but I don't think it is illegal as long as it is disclosed to clients up front," said Todd, a portfolio manager with Greenwood Capital Associates, which manages more than $700 million. "I think we need to wait and see the facts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd said it is not new that analysts share their thoughts on investments with the firm's most profitable accounts before broadly disseminating the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Analysts frequently talk to investment clients and just give them the latest and greatest news, even if they haven't put that out there in a report," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN UNDER SCRUTINY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Wall Street's largest and most profitable bank, has come under scrutiny in recent years. It has been facing a public backlash over its outsized bonus pool and its billions in profit so soon after it repaid $10 billion received last fall from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Holland, a money manager with New York-based Holland  Associates, called the scrutiny over Goldman's trading tips a "sign of the times and the season."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is fashionable to dump on Wall Street, particularly those making money in this difficult time," Holland said. "Plus, it is the end of August and there is very little else going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a time when the securities industry is still reeling from the financial crisis that paralyzed markets last year, some investors believe regulators could better spend their resources elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative to the other abuses and issues securities regulators face, Front said, "This is not an issue that I would think would rise to the top of the heap of issues that has to be dealt with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; Additional reporting by Rachelle Younglai in Washington; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sees no damage to Sable project so far&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Inspections to satellite platforms to continue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Hurricane Bill leaves oil and gas production unscathed
(Adds detail.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CALGARY, Alberta, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) said on Tuesday that inspections of the Sable Offshore
Energy Project off the coast of Nova Scotia have not turned up
any damage from Hurricane Bill, which passed over the region on
Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margot Bruce-O'Connell, a spokeswoman for the company said
further inspections on Sable's platforms will be done this week
as staff that were evacuated from the project in advance of the
hurricane return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At this point we haven't identified any damage to the
facilities," Bruce-O'Connell said. "But offshore inspections
will continue throughout the week as we man up our facilities
and visit satellite platforms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bill entered Canadian waters as a Category 1 hurricane on
Saturday and weakened to a tropical storm as it hit
Newfoundland. The storm did not damage any of Atlantic Canada's
oil and gas production facilities or the region's refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sable was down for scheduled maintenance before the storm
hit and was not producing natural gas. Spectra Energy (SE.N)
said on Tuesday that Sable, which produces up to 500 million
cubic feet of natural gas and 20,000 barrels of natural gas
liquids per day, was unlikely to return to service on schedule.
[nN25202499]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bruce-O'Connell said the delay was related to the
evacuation prior to the storm but did not say when production
would resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sable Project is owned by Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell
(RDSa.L), Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO), Pengrowth Energy Trust

&lt;p&gt;TruckMate Software from TMW Systems Breezes through 679,680 Orders per Day
CLEVELAND, Ohio--(Business Wire)--
Working with experts at the IBM Innovation Center in San Mateo, Calif., TMW
Systems developers put the latest product release, TruckMate 2009, through a
grueling series of simulated, high-volume freight bill transactions and dispatch
activities performed by up to 2,000 concurrent users as part of benchmark
testing for the enterprise transportation software application. Average response
times under even the highest loads were sub-second, demonstrating that TruckMate
2009 running on the latest IBM DB2 Enterprise 9.5 database can easily support
the transactional volumes of busy regional LTL, intermodal and truckload
carriers. 

Simulating a range of hardware environments found at trucking companies today,
the benchmark was designed to simulate a varied mix of users performing
activities most commonly performed in transportation operations, including:
creation of a new order; posting of that order with rating, accessorial charges,
general ledger details and driver pay calculations, as well as dispatch work
involving creation of a trip from a freight bill; assignment of driver, power
and trailer to a load; and pickup and delivery status changes. Multiple test
scenarios were defined for several distinct hardware environments, simulating
200, 520, 1,000 and 2,000 concurrent software users. 

"We are extremely proud of how TruckMate performed under this testing. Our
developers have been eager to subject their software to the rigorous testing and
world-class technology environment offered by the IBM Innovation Center," said
Randall Burrell, senior vice president and general manager for TruckMate. "The
results of that program reinforce, for current and future TruckMate customers
alike, their choice of technology platform is robust, scalable and capable of
growing along with their most ambitious business plans." 

TMW Systems is the leading developer and supplier of software designed
specifically for the transportation services sector, with applications for
logistics, trucking, brokerage and private fleet operations. The company offers
and supports a full portfolio of operations, dispatch, fleet maintenance and
optimization solutions in use throughout the US, Canada, Mexico and Europe.

&lt;p&gt;SUNNYVALE, California (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc said on Monday it has revamped its search to compete against Microsoft Corp's Bing, even as it relies on the Redmond giant to power its queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of plans to put a new face on Yahoo Messenger and Mail and add functions to its search engine came after news that Google and Yahoo each lost a fraction of a point of U.S. search share to Microsoft last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not a version of Bing," Prabhakar Raghavan, a senior vice president of Yahoo, said to reporters at the company's headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are Yahoo and that will continue...We collaborate on the back-end but we are competitors on the front-end," he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a press event held at their headquarters, the company gave more details of its complex relationship with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of July, Microsoft and Yahoo signed a 10-year deal under which search on Yahoo's websites will be generated by Microsoft's new Bing search engine. The companies hope the deal will take effect early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will license Yahoo's search technology, allowing it to integrate certain aspects of it into Bing. Microsoft's advertising search product, AdCenter, will also replace Yahoo's equivalent product, Panama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan said that when Microsoft sends ads along with its answers to queries, Yahoo may or may not use all of them, depending on a complex formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new series of boxes to the left of search results and ads will give users more ways to make use of what they have found, said Larry Cornett, Yahoo vice president of search products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A box powered by Internet security company McAfee Inc, will filter dangerous links. Videos will play without leaving the search page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A box to sites like Yelp, which provides user feedback on stores and restaurants, can be clicked to check out the quality of a sushi restaurant without leaving the search page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cornett, who demonstrated the new approach, said it was undergoing testing and will be available some time this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comscore reported Microsoft gained 0.5 percent in July, but still only holds 8.9 percent of the search market, compared to 64.7 percent for Google and 19.3 percent for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares closed up 20 cents, or 1.35 percent, to end the day at $14.99 on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Lawsky, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Eric Auchard LONDON (Reuters) - The fate of Yahoo Inc has become intertwined in the public's imagination with the success or failure of its dealings with Microsoft Corp in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's despite the fact that as much as 70 percent of the value investors put on Yahoo's depressed shares are tied up in its international assets or cash holdings -- factors that have nothing to do with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's operations trade for just $5 to $6 per share out of its current $15 share price, once you exclude its Asian investments and the value of its cash. Its hidden assets in Japan and Chinese affiliates -- Yahoo Japan Corp and China's Alibaba Group -- alone are worth around $6 to $7 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that Yahoo needs to find a way to cash out of its increasingly rocky relationship with Alibaba Group, in which it holds a 39 percent stake after it pulled back from operating its own business in China in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's best chance here may come next year if Alibaba succeeds with a second IPO of its Taobao.com consumer ecommerce site, building on the success of the 2007 IPO of Alibaba.com, now valued at more than US$13 billion on the Hong Kong exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, Yahoo's huge success in building the biggest U.S. Internet media destination never translated very well overseas, despite the early foray into Asia that left it with lucrative assets in Japan and China. These passive investments came to substitute for a global operating strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's changing now, as Yahoo once again has begun investing in international operations it can fully control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest such push, Yahoo said on Tuesday that it would buy Maktoob.com, the largest Internet media site for the Arab world, with an estimated 16.5 million users. Terms were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's international stronghold is Asia, where it had 172 million unique users in the month of June, according to industry estimates. It is the top player in Japan through its stake in Softbank-controlled Yahoo Japan, and is dominant in Taiwan and Hong Kong as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, Yahoo has the most visited home page and is the most popular provider of e-mail, instant messaging and online news to consumers. In a country mad on the sport, Yahoo operates the most popular site for cricket fans. Yahoo had 23 million unique monthly users in India in June, according to market researcher comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Yahoo stock gets little to no stock market credit for these international operations. Converting market share into meaningful financial results will take years. First, Yahoo must develop its patchwork of leading properties in places like the Philippines and Vietnam and Latin America into a global franchise. And it's hard to see how Yahoo can regain lost ground in Europe's more developed Internet markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, the trap for Yahoo has been that much of its international value remains latent, locked up in investments in Japan and China rather than in operating businesses it controls. That is changing, slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leaves Yahoo at the mercy of an eventual rebound in U.S. advertising markets. For the foreseeable future, any significant rebound in Yahoo's share price depends on conjecture over the still unknown potential of getting into bed with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- At the time of publication Eric Auchard did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article, with the exception of a token Yahoo share. He may be an owner indirectly as an investor in a fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Eric Auchard is a Reuters columnist.

&lt;p&gt;Qiwi Mobile Connects Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Smartphones to Give Business
Professionals Anytime-Anywhere Productivity
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Qiwi Mobility LLC is now offering Qiwi Mobile, an application designed for
Microsoft Dynamics NAV, to provide business professionals the ability to access
and update business data in the back-end of Microsoft Dynamics NAV through
BlackBerry, iPhone, and Windows Mobile. 

Many vendors provide mobile access to CRM, however Qiwi Mobility found that few
application developers work with business management software. Qiwi Mobile
satisfies those needs by allowing users to simply carry business data in their
personal smartphones. By connecting to back-end business management systems,
business professionals can benefit from timely responses, improved customer
satisfaction, and anytime-anywhere productivity. 

This innovative mobile application also features the ability to customize,
allowing users to build applications based on their own needs without assistance
from developers. In addition, considering data security, Qiwi Mobile applied
128-bit SSL to secure data and gave users authority to manage access to their
applications. 

"While business competition gets tougher, mobile business apps are becoming more
critical. Qiwi Mobile provides what organizations want- business mobility, which
enables instant feedback from the field to the back-end office system," said
Carsten Howitz, president of Qiwi Mobility LLC. "It benefits executives, sales
professionals, and service personnel greatly in terms of efficiency and decision
making. With accurate and up-to-date data, they can have better control over
tasks and respond quickly to inquiries related to pricing, available stock,
orders, etc. They are no longer dependent on telephone calls to the office or
bulky connections via the Internet." 

"Qiwi Mobile offers our customers more accessibility to the corporate data on
the move- whether it is around the production area, away doing deliveries, or
salespeople checking status of jobs while at customer locations. By
incorporating Qiwi Mobile in the business solution we deliver, customers are
able to maximize their return of investment," said Chew Kim Poh at DP
Technology, one of the resellers partnering with Qiwi Mobility. 

A pre-built Qiwi Mobile application for Microsoft Dynamics NAV is available to
download from Apple`s App Store and product website at www.qiwiland.com.

her plan goes awry and her brothers Justin and Max join in on the fun. Alex`s
best friend Harper, along with Theresa and Jerry Russo are also featured in the
game, taking part in adventures on Waverly Place. 

Players can experience the lives of the Russo kids as they explore locations
from the show, including the Waverly Sub Station, the Wizards Lair, Tribeca

throughout the game, fans apply their wizard skills in exciting mini-games by
using their stylus to levitate, move and freeze objects. New and familiar story

Alex Russo and her brothers Justin and Max are a lot like the teens in their
Manhattan neighborhood but they have one significant difference&#8230;they come from a
long line of wizards and they must learn to hone their budding magical powers or
soon risk losing them. Their dad Jerry was born with the same powers but was
forced to relinquish them when he married their mom, a mortal named Theresa.

siblings get into and out of comedic situations as they grapple with both their
budding wizardly powers and typical teen challenges spanning school, friends and
family.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, Aug 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ProStockMonitor.com is a focused research firm with special interest in
little known micro-cap stocks that look poised for gigantic moves.

small to micro-cap and small-cap companies poised for movement in the

potential for advancement.

    Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet, speaking at the annual central bankers'
symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said the world economy is pulling out
of a recession. Crude oil rose to a 10-month high as stronger equities
bolstered confidence that the global economy will recover from the
recession. We may see oil exceed $80 per barrel if the economy continues
to pick up. This should be a great positive for the equity markets.

    ProStockMonitor continues to follow an array of stocks including
Citigroup Inc, Fannie Mae, Exxon Mobil Corp and Ford Motor Company in
addition to the many small-cap stocks on our watch list. Fannie Mae had a
significant price increase in Monday's trading with a price jump of $0.50
or 41.7%. Citigroup Inc had a modest increase again today with a 2.5%
price increase. Shares in both Ford Motor Company and Mastercard fell
today. Exxon Mobil Corp's shares rose $1.31 today most likely as a result
of the increase in oil prices. ProStockMonitor also continues to track
small-cap stocks like Mass Hysteria Entertainment Corp and Turbine Truck
Engines, Inc. Small-cap company Mass Hysteria Entertainment Corp. today
saw a big jump in both its share price and volume. We believe this trend
will continue as the company issued a strong press release after the
close appears and appears undervalued. Turbine Truck Engines, Inc also
delivered news Monday after market after having a very strong trading day.

    We feel that the micro-cap market is poised for a great September rally
so we are keeping our eyes on what we think will be some very exciting
opportunities. ProStockMonitor Investment Report conducts comprehensive

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators are examining weekly meetings at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), where research analysts offer tips to traders and then to big clients, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman will be asked to provide more information about the meetings by examiners from Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WSJ, citing internal Goldman documents, said the short-term tips given at the meetings differed from long-term research. In the distribution of trading tips, there have been no accusations of securities law violations against Goldman, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It quoted a Goldman spokesman as saying: "We believe the disclosure we have now is entirely appropriate. Analysts are not allowed to express differing views without publishing that view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and FINRA could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment on Goldman, but said, "as a general matter, broker-dealers have obligations to use research information properly, disclose conflicts of interests by research analysts, and ensure their publicly available research is consistent with privately expressed views."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ajay Kamalakaran in Bangalore, Megan Davies in New York and Rachelle Younglai in Washington; Editing by Anshuman Daga)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan says Q2 results support "overweight" upgrade&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Telecom index up 1.23 after news

 (Adds detail, comments, share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 25 (Reuters) - JPMorgan on Tuesday upgraded the
European telecoms sector to "overweight", anticipating an
improved economic climate in the second half, and said Vodafone
(VOD.L), France Telecom FTE.PA and KPN (KPN.AS) were top
picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The upgrade buoyed telecom shares with Vodafone gaining 2.2
percent by 1054 GMT. France Telecom shares rose 2.5 percent and
KPN stock was up 1.37 percent. Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE)
gained 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DJ Stoxx Telecom index .SXKP was 1.1 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said the telecoms sector was favoured by cheap
valuations, increasingly stable and predictable results, and
seasonal trading patterns that had led the sector to
consistently outperform in the final months of most years since
1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In H109, this seasonality `predisposed' the sector to
underperform, but in addition, expectations regarding the
sector's `immunity' from the recession were too optimistic,"
JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first quarter, only two incumbents beat estimates on
core profit and while domestic fixed line businesses remained
almost stable "mobile revenues tracked a deeper than expected
GDP drop", it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second quarter gave reason for a more optimistic outlook
as incumbent operators missed less on the top line and eight out
of 13 incumbents beat core profit expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In H2, we believe the improving economic context will act
to strengthen the usual trading seasonality, for which we found
Q2 results overall supportive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said positive seasonality in the third and fourth 
quarters and valuations would be supportive, and pointed out
that European telecom companies were currently trading at 50
percent relative price-to-earnings discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BofA Merrill Lynch downgraded the sector earlier this month
to "neutral".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said telecoms would likely lag behind sectors
that were more geared into the economy and it would be hard for
the sector to see catalysts for outperformance over the
near-to-medium term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, BofA Merrill Lynch said telecom-sector valuations
remained extremely attractive, with 2009 and 2010 dividend
yields estimated to be the highest of any sector, and it
remained the brokerage's favourite defensive sector.

&lt;p&gt; * UBS hires seven-member property team from JP Morgan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Team includes JP Morgan's head property banker
 (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Denny Thomas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SYDNEY, Aug 25 (Reuters) - UBS Australia (UBSN.VX) has
hired a team of seven property investment bankers from JP
Morgan Australia (JPM.N), amid signs that the battered property
sector could see a strong rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Church, the managing director of JP Morgan's real
estate banking division in Australia, will join UBS Australia
as the Swiss bank's head of property banking, a UBS spokeswoman
said on Tuesday, and his team would move with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JP Morgan spokesman confirmed Church's move to UBS, but
was not able to confirm the movement of the other staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The moves come only weeks after UBS lost its entire
Australian property banking team to Bank of America/Merrill
Lynch (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The listed property trust sector, with its high gearing,
has been the biggest victim of the global financial crisis in
Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The property sub-index .AXPJ, which tumbled about 57
percent in 2008, is still down about 8 percent this year. That
compares with a 18 percent rise in the benchmark SP/ASX 200
index .AXJO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, property market research firm IPD said in a report
this month that there are expectations that the Australian
market is getting closer to a bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Australian real estate investment trusts have raised nearly
A$15 billion ($12.4 billion) of equity since last September,
and investors' focus is shifting to the possibility of mergers
and acquisitions, especially with asset prices made cheap by
the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS's new property team would also consist of Ian Richards,
who would be an executive director, and Nick Thomson, who would
be a director, the UBS spokeswoman said. The rest of team is
made up of one associate director, two analysts and a team
assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan has enjoyed a stable property banking team over
the past few years under Andrew Pridham. He remains at JP
Morgan.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.'s lawyers late yesterday said the verdict that awarded a Canadian developer nearly $300 million in damages and resulted in an impending ban on sales of the company's popular Word software was a "miscarriage of justice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a brief filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Microsoft asked the three-judge panel to overthrow a Texas court's verdict and quash the injunction that prohibits the company from selling current versions of Word 2003 and Word 2007 in the U.S. after Oct. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brief is the first step in a fast-track process approved last week after Microsoft appealed the May jury verdict that found the company guilty of patent infringement. Two weeks ago, U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Davis awarded software developer i4i Inc. more than $290 million in damages and interest and blocked Microsoft from selling Word in its current form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An oral hearing for the appeal is slated for Sept. 23, after i4i files its response and Microsoft is given a chance to rebut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Microsoft castigated Davis' role in the trial. "This case stands as a stark example of what can happen in a patent case when a judge abdicates [his] gatekeeping functions," Microsoft said. "If the district court had been more faithful to its role as gatekeeper, it should have recognized a trial run amok and interceded to prevent a miscarriage of justice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 84-page brief, thick with legal citations of prior cases, continued to attack Davis' judgment during the case, saying that he failed to properly instruct the jury, awarded "enhanced" damages of $40 million, $15 million more than i4i had asked for and added the injunction against selling Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not justice," Microsoft said. "If district courts are free to admit theories of infringement that nullify a patent s claim terms, specification, prosecution history, and title; if they will allow an inventor to validate his patent by testifying without corroboration that he lied about the date of conception  then patent litigation will be reduced to a free-for-all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Microsoft also argued that Davis should not have issued the injunction that bars Word sales. Citing a Supreme Court ruling from 2006 that set aside a lower court's injunction against eBay in a patent dispute over its "Buy It Now" auction feature, the lawyers said i4i had failed to present evidence that justified Davis' injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its decision, the Supreme Court said that lower courts must use a four-factor test when considering patent injunctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said that i4i "utterly failed to meet [the burden of irreparable harm]" and did not "present a shred of evidence on its alleged loss of brand share." The company also argued that the damage to i4i had occurred in the past, and that i4i's software was complementary to Word, not a competitive product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its lawyers also complained that the injunction was unfair. "Given that i4i does not even have a stand-alone product that could compete with Word on the market, while Microsoft would lose its significant investments in creating the custom XML functionality of Word and would have to invest significant resources in redesigning it, the balance of the equities plainly favors Microsoft," the company's brief said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Microsoft claimed that Davis overlooked the public interest, one of the four factors cited by the Supreme Court in the eBay decision. "The public interest thus favors a final -- and better-tested -- determination of validity before Microsoft and its distributors are forced to incur additional costs in redesigning Word, and removing the current copies of Word from the market," stated the brief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, Microsoft said it would take five months to craft new versions of Word that omitted the offending "custom" XML feature. i4i, meanwhile, countered that it could be done much faster than that with a software patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The injunction should be vacated," Microsoft concluded in its brief. "The judgment should be reversed and the case remanded with instructions to enter judgment of noninfringement and invalidity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft fails to convince the Court of Appeals to overturn the verdict, or to issue a stay on the injunction, it will have to pull Word 2003 and Word 2007, and the corresponding editions of its Office suite that include Word, from the U.S. market in just over six weeks. Computer makers would also not be able to bundle Office 2003 and Office 2007, even trial versions, with new PCs sold after Oct. 10. In a motion it submitted last week, Microsoft warned of chaos if that happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft and its distributors (which include retailers such as Best Buy and OEMs such as HP and Dell) face the imminent possibility of a massive disruption in their sales," Microsoft said in the motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday, both Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. asked permission to file amicus curiae , or "friend of the court," briefs in support of Microsoft's motion to stay the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the court erred in its interpretation and application of the law in this case and look forward to the Sept. 23 hearing before the U.S. Court of Appeals, said Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i4i was not available for comment today, but Tuesday, the company issued a statement from its chairman Loudon Owen. "We firmly believe that the U.S. District Court made the right decision on the merits of the case [and] we are confident that we will prevail on the appeal," Owen said. "This is a vital case for inventors and entrepreneurial companies who, like i4i, are damaged by the willful infringement of their patents by competitors; particularly competitors as large and powerful as Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

Here are highlights from Tuesday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Microsoft Doing Everything Right

When I read the first article about the Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT)/Yahoo (Nasdaq:
YHOO) combo, I did not fully realize how it would change my search experience.
But when I checked my Yahoo mail this morning, I was pleasantly surprised to see
a Bing bar at the top. One of the things that crossed my mind was how could a
regular Googler like me be enticed into using Bing? 

It now appears that I have to do nothing, I just open a Yahoo finance/mail/or
any other Yahoo page and there it is. But would I still continue using Google
(Nasdaq: GOOG)? I think not, especially if Google is not my home page and the
content is more or less the same. This basically means that the focus has now
shifted from use to content. 

Microsoft has also introduced a freely downloadable version of MS Office,
facilitating the use of the company`s word processing, spread sheet and
PowerPoint products. Although Google already offers similar products, it was
more of a defensive measure to protect the company`s market share. 

The company recently signed an agreement with Nokia (NYSE: NOK) to offer Word,
Excel and PowerPoint features on select mobile phones from 2010. The revenue
potential could be substantial, considering Nokia`s market share. While the deal
should generate incremental earnings, many observers feel that it would mark the
end of the Windows-based mobile operating system. 

But Microsoft came up with yet another strategy to prove its adaptability to
changing market dynamics. The company`s newly announced OneApp feature will use
clouds to offer programs on GPRS phones in emerging markets. While smartphone
penetration in these markets has been limited, feature phones have huge
potential. 

Microsoft has already entered into an agreement with South Africa`s Blue Label
Telecoms, offering a dozen OneApp-powered applications. The initial package
includes popular programs like Facebook, Twitter, Windows messenger and games.
It would soon add other useful programs to enable bill payments and even health
diagnosis. 

The existing mobile operating systems from Research In Motion (Nasdaq: RIMM)
among others have made headway in the U.S. and other developed markets.
Microsoft`s intention to target emerging markets makes sense to us.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Aug 26 (Reuters) - Massachusetts' top securities
regulator said on Wednesday his office is demanding information
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) on how the investment bank
passes on analysts' short-term trading tips to top clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; William Galvin, Massachusetts' Secretary of State, said the
subpoenas were sent recently and that Goldman has until around
Sept. 7 to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We thought we solved this problem with the preferred
customers years ago when we settled with Goldman Sachs on Wall
Street research, but now we don't know," Galvin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Galvin said he was extremely concerned Goldman's analysts
pass on their best ideas to traders and preferred clients
during weekly meetings called "huddles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have to make sure that there is confidence in
research," Galvin said, noting it is critical to erase any
sense of a two-tier system where some clients are favored over

negotiated a $1.4 billion settlement between 10 big Wall Street
firms, including Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firms were accused of sending out overly optimistic
research to win investment banking business.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Legal IQ and IQPC present the eDiscovery Oil and Gas event, taking place October
14-16, 2009 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Houston, Texas. 

As one of the first eDiscovery events catering to the oil, gas and energy
industries, this program offers cost-containment best practices, proven
strategies to address challenges and judicial perspectives on eDiscovery,
specifically for these industries. 

"The oil, gas and energy industries have more litigation, from small scale
claims to company-wide litigation with billions in exposure; more government
inquiries, more international issues, and more locations of operations that must
be considered when managing eDiscovery," says Shahzad Bashir, Vice President,
Legal Consulting and Southwest Region, Huron Consulting Group and a speaker at
this year`s event. 

Since the volatile economic climate is challenging all industries to do more
with less, it is crucial that organizations within these sectors have the
opportunity to learn from and benchmark against other companies who are in
similar situations and face the same challenges. Topics will include proactive
strategies for record managements, global privacy issues, litigation management
and emerging technologies that will affect eDiscovery processes in these
sectors. 

"In this field, it is of increasing importance to understand emerging
technologies. Rapid growth in electronically-stored information leads to
increasing costs and burdens. At the same time, advances in technology
counteracts some of these issues," says Jeremy J. Gaston, Partner, Pillsbury
Winthrop Shaw Pittman, also on this year`s speaker faculty. "For example, more
sophisticated culling and search techniques can reduce the universe of documents
that must undergo human review. However, some advanced technologies can create
problems of their own: e.g., by enabling your adversary to learn more (and more
valuable) information with less time and effort. Thus, both in terms of costs
and outcomes, it is critical to keep abreast of these advances." 

Participating companies include EXXONMOBIL, BAKER HUGHES, CHEVRON, U.S. DISTRICT
COURT, NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, MARATHON OIL COMPANY, CVR
ENERGY, ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION, and SHELL.

&lt;p&gt;EquaSiis Workbench Streamlines the Sourcing Process and Creates a Valuable Link
Between Sourcing and Governance 
HOUSTON, NEW YORK &amp; LONDON--(Business Wire)--
EquaTerra announces the market availability of a unique sourcing platform,
EquaSiis Workbench, that has been piloted for the past year at selective
clients. EquaSiis Workbench, offered exclusively through EquaTerra, is a
sourcing tool developed by EquaSiis, a software company owned by EquaTerra, that
provides sourcing software and services. EquaSiis Workbench improves the
sourcing process and provides a foundation for effective sourcing governance
delivered through a companion product, EquaSiis Enterprise. This
first-of-its-kind application provides sourcing buyers a contiguous toolset to
source and manage outsourcing transactions. Specifically, EquaSiis Workbench
helps buyers collaboratively source new services while EquaSiis Enterprise
streamlines the transition and ongoing outsourcing governance. Together EquaSiis
Workbench and EquaSiis Enterprise improve the process across the lifecycle of
business process or information technology (IT) outsourcing relationships. 

EquaSiis Workbench can manage outsourcing deals of every size and geographical
scope and for any number of team resources and service providers. EquaSiis
Workbench creates a secure and multi-functional collaborative environment for
use by buyer procurement groups and sourcing teams as well as the service
providers` bidding on a deal. EquaSiis Workbench supports services sourcing
efforts via seven core functions:

* Role-Based Security: Controls access to documents and functional areas based
on assigned roles and authorization levels. 
* Collaboration and Workflow: Comes standard with "Web 2.0" features such as
discussion boards and chat, integration into existing email and calendaring
systems and integrated workflow. 
* Document Management: Provides full document management capabilities with a
common repository, version control and role-based access to documents. 
* Project Planning: Comes with standard project planning tools that allow tasks,
milestones and deadlines for easy tracking and forwarding to the appropriate
team member for action. 
* Methodology Support: It is populated with templates and best practice
guidelines and can accommodate any third-party methodology required. It also
provides discussion boards for sharing internal best practices with other
groups. 
* Service Provider Area: Enables controlled access for candidate service
providers to facilitate the exchange of RFP and proposal submissions, track key
project dates and support Q 
* Issue Resolution: Offers a full range of issue resolution features including
origination, assignment, version control, status and reporting, full text
search, escalation and a full repository of all issues encountered during the
sourcing effort.

"Sourcing processes for outsourcing deals are inherently time consuming, manual
and labor intensive efforts," said Bill Weathersby, President of EquaSiis. "They
generate huge volumes of paper from proposals, baseline efforts, SOWs, RFIs,
RFPs and contracts, all of which go through many iterations in buyer, advisor
and provider organizations. EquaSiis Workbench is the first platform in the
market to intelligently automate and accelerate the sourcing effort for major
outsourcing deals." 

Rick Bertheaud, EquaTerra Managing Director, has utilized EquaSiis Workbench at
a client team for the past few months. "Client team members have been impressed
with EquaSiis Workbench. They find real value in a collaboration and Q tool
that all sourcing participants - the client, third party advisors and law firms,
and service providers - can simultaneously and securely use together. It's been
a real timesaver for transferring large documents while efficiently managing
version control." 

EquaTerra clients involved in an outsourcing transaction are able to rapidly
provision EquaSiis Workbench, often in less than 48 hours. Importantly, all
information gathered in the sourcing process in EquaSiis Workbench flows
seamlessly into EquaSiis Enterprise, preparing the buyer to better manage the
transition effort and launch outsourcing governance operations. 

"Buyers have long used many fragmented desktop tools, like spreadsheets and
e-mail, to support outsourcing efforts, and not leveraging this effort to create
a governance platform," said Mike Beals, Vice President of EquaSiis Software.
"Buyers now have the opportunity to ensure continuity between sourcing,
transition and ongoing outsourcing governance efforts in one enterprise-wide
platform via EquaSiis Workbench and EquaSiis Enterprise." 

The intelligence behind EquaSiis Workbench is drawn from years of EquaTerra`s
outsourcing advisory experience. Clients benefit from the Microsoft toolset that
underlies both the EquaSiis Workbench and EquaSiis Enterprise platforms. Through
this toolset EquaSiis Workbench leverages industry-leading products like
SharePoint, Enterprise Search, SQL and Biztalk Servers and seamless integration
into all Microsoft Office applications. 

Microsoft US Alliance Director Kent Burkhardsmeier added, "EquaSiis Workbench is
an innovative combination of EquaTerra`s intellectual property and Microsoft
technology that enables sourcing teams to streamline complex business problems
through increased collaboration, workflow automation and business insights."

&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan`s U.S. Dollar Clearing - Asia Direct Solution Deepens Regional
Coverage and Delivers New Technology Enhancements
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan today announced that it has enhanced its U.S. Dollar Clearing - Asia
Direct solution to further assist clients seeking the fastest and most efficient
means of making U.S. dollar payments to banks in Asia. As part of the
enhancements, clients now have direct access to a larger number of banks as the
solution`s coverage has been expanded to members of Japan`s Tokyo Dollar
Clearing system. In addition, J.P. Morgan has invested in an intelligent routing
technology which streamlines processing and speeds settlement by enabling the
fastest channel for delivery. 

J.P. Morgan`s U.S. Dollar Clearing - Asia Direct is the first and only payment
solution to provide direct access to multiple regional and in-country U.S.
dollar clearing systems in China, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan from a single U.S.
dollar account. Clients are not required to establish separate accounts in each
country of clearing, resulting in better cash concentration, lower fees,
simplified funding arrangements and decreased time spent on reconciliation
activities. 

"Clients are able to capitalize on the significant growth in payment flows to
and across Asia with U.S. Dollar Clearing - Asia Direct," said Abdul Roaf
Latiff, Asia Head of Treasury Services Clearing and Foreign Exchange, J.P.
Morgan Treasury Services. "By expediting their payments, our clients also are
positioned to improve their relationships with customers, counterparties and
suppliers, and thus negotiate better terms." 

"As the largest U.S. dollar clearing bank in the world, J.P. Morgan continues to
bring expertise, innovation and value to clients conducting business in the Asia
Pacific," said Greg Murray, Product Executive, U.S. Dollar Clearing, J.P. Morgan
Treasury Services. "As J.P. Morgan pioneered and has served as the sole operator
of the Tokyo Dollar Clearing system for the past twenty years, the expansion of
our U.S. Dollar Clearing - Asia Direct solution to Japan is a natural extension
of our leadership position." 

Coverage Extended to Japan

J.P. Morgan has direct access to U.S. dollar settlement systems around the
world, having integrated its infrastructure with many independent in-country and
regional offshore clearing capabilities across major financial centers. J.P.
Morgan`s U.S. Dollar Clearing - Asia Direct solution initially provided clients
with direct access to banks in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan that are members of
Hong Kong`s Clearing House Automated Transfer System (CHATS). By adding direct
access to Japan`s Tokyo Dollar Clearing system, clients benefit from expedited
clearing capabilities in one of the world`s most vital business hubs. J.P.
Morgan also plans on expanding its U.S. Dollar Clearing - Asia Direct solution
to additional in-country clearing systems in Asia within the coming years. 

Technology Investment

Since launching U.S. Dollar Clearing - Asia Direct, J.P. Morgan has continued to
invest in the solution`s technology, resulting in enhanced service efficiency
and more streamlined transaction processing for clients making payments to or
within Asia. For example, the solution`s payment prequalification process has
been automated whereby customers no longer have to take advance steps to ensure
that a bank is a qualified member of the local clearing systems. The solution`s
new intelligent routing technology determines the quickest channel for
delivering payments, resulting is accelerated settlement and more efficient
liquidity management. Without Asia Direct, clearing U.S. dollar payments to Asia
can take a minimum of two days, costing businesses valuable opportunities to
maximize their liquidity. No additional software or features are required to
take advantage of these capabilities. 

The enhancements to U.S. Dollar Clearing - Asia Direct are part of J.P. Morgan
Treasury Services` ongoing investment in systems, innovation and services
designed to benefit its clients around the world.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Aug 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Information Builders, an independent leader in business intelligence (BI)
solutions, today announced support for IBM System z/OS computer Integrated
Information Processor (zIIP) in FOCUS 7.6.10 and WebFOCUS 7.7. Information
Builders' zIIP chip support represents the first and only BI platform
optimized for the popular mainframe environment. Using the IBM authorized
and licensed API for zIIPs, IBI will not charge for its software running
on zIIP, minimizing the costs of workloads.

    The zIIP chip was designed to handle the workloads of Business
Intelligence, and other data intensive applications. Specialized mainframe
processors like the zIIP allow users to offload work that might otherwise
run on the mainframe's general purpose chips.

    "By extending support for the IBM zIIP, Information Builders is providing
mainframe users a dramatic performance and cost advantage to expand their
operations in the zIIP mainframe environment," said Robert Hoey, GM, Major
Markets, Systems &amp; Technology Group, IBM. "It represents the latest of
many levels of support and interoperability Information Builders offers
to IBM customers."

    For mainframe operations looking for ways to drive greater value and
performance, Information Builders has optimized FOCUS and WebFOCUS for the
zIIP environment. The new versions perform the same mission critical tasks
and maximize processing power, reduce execution and response time, while
delivering consistent application performance and solid customer service.
By enabling efficient BI operations on the mainframe, Information Builders
gives customers real-time, dynamic reporting, with enough processing power
to deliver large 'customer facing' applications, without incurring extra
costs for setting up infrastructure or buying new machines or databases.

    Leveraging the zIIP, Information Builders helps enhance mainframe
operations of FOCUS and WebFOCUS by improving resource optimization to
reduce latent workload demand which the Central Processor can now absorb
and by stimulating visible performance improvement.

    About 80% of the new FOCUS and WebFOCUS processing is zIIP-enabled,
including computations, report formatting, aggregation, screening
criteria, styling, and transaction processing. Information Builders new BI
applications divert as much processing as possible to the zIIP and
monitors and adjusts to optimize zIIP utilization. zIIP is accessible to
mainframe FOCUS as of release 7.6 available Q3, 2009 and WebFOCUS 7.7,
available Q4, 2009.

    "Information Builders is dedicated to helping customers enhance value and
optimize their BI deployments," said Information Builders founder and CEO
Gerald Cohen. "By extending FOCUS and Web FOCUS to support the zIIP chip,
we have dramatically recalculated the economics of mainframe business
intelligence. Finally, business intelligence applications can leverage the
genius of the zIIP environment without compromising accessibility or
performance."

prices increased for the first time in three years. These are signals

&lt;p&gt;Aug 26 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities began coverage of
Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc (TWC.N) with
an "overweight" rating and said it sees more growth potential
for cable providers compared with telecom companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cable companies have been battling harder to win customers
amid competition from satellite TV services and fledgling video
services from phone companies ATT Inc (T.N) and Verizon
Communications (VZ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We favor the cable providers given higher relative growth
of key financial and operational metrics as well as less
exposure to the maturing and increasingly competitive wireless
industry," the brokerage said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said Comcast is well positioned for expansion of
average revenue per user as the digital transition continues
and higher speed data products gain popularity. It set a price
target of $19 on Comcast stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said both Comcast and Time Warner Cable had
significant upside for voice and data services, given their low
penetration rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also expects investors to benefit from Time
Warner Cable's plan for delevering the balance sheet following
the spin-off from Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). Time Warner Cable
was separated from Time Warner Inc on March 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan set a price target of $45 on shares of Time
Warner Cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Comcast closed at $15.21 Tuesday on Nasdaq, while
those of Time Warner Cable closed at $35.79 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon: carbon trading scheme may lead to unstable pricing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says favours a revenue-neutral carbon tax
 (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE Aug 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is
concerned that Australia's proposed carbon-trading regime will
lead to unstable pricing and favours a revenue-neutral carbon
tax, the head of the oil major's Australian unit said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's important to understand that allowing the cost of
carbon to be determined by traders on a carbon exchange carries
the potential to make carbon costs inherently unstable," Exxon
Mobil Australia Chairman John Dashwood told a business lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A revenue-neutral carbon tax on all energy sources is the
most efficient and transparent way of achiving this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon owns and operates a 130,000 barrels per day oil
refinery in the southeastern state of Victoria. It is also owns
oil and gas fields in Australia, including a 25 percent stake
in Australia's mammoth Gorgon liquified natural gas project,
which cleared its last major environmental hurdle on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Australia has outlined plans to tackle carbon emissions by
demanding that polluters buy emission permits on open markets,
but the scheme has yet to be finalised and it is still
vulnerable to strong lobbying and change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed carbon trading laws were voted down in the
parliament's upper house Senate earlier this month and the
Australian government will now submit the package of 11 bills
to the Senate a second time before year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more on Gorgon, see [ID:nSYD428849]

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp plans to slash the price of its high-end Xbox 360 video game console by $100, or 25 percent, stepping up the price war in the video game console market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective Friday, Microsoft will drop the price of the Xbox 360 Elite to $299.99 in the United States, just days after Sony Corp cut the rival PlayStation 3 to $299 from $399.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said the cuts will pressure Nintendo Co Ltd to lower the price of its best-selling Wii console, which retails for $249, but for now the company is standing firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have such a plan," Nintendo spokesman Yasuhiro Minagawa said when asked about a price cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among this generation of game consoles, the Xbox is No. 2 in the United States behind the Wii. But U.S. sales of the Xbox are up 17 percent this year, the only console to show growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price on the entry-level Xbox Arcade model will stay at $199.99, and Microsoft will phase out its mid-range Xbox Pro model, leaving it with two models. The Pro will sell for $249.99 until supplies run out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since PS3, Xbox and Wii are increasingly centerpieces of home entertainment, their sales can spur purchases of software, accessories and other media, and boost traffic at retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the unit that runs Xbox is a small part of Microsoft's overall sales -- at about 11 percent -- it is the company's biggest weapon in the battle to control entertainment in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman David Dennis said the price cut was in the works for some time and was not a response to Sony's cut.

Chris Lewis, head of Xbox Europe, said the cut would help Microsoft match or beat its 2008 performance, when it increased unit sales of Xboxes more than 80 percent in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond console sales, the cuts by Microsoft and Sony should provide a lift to a broader gaming industry has been stuck in a slump brought on by a lack of big-name releases and a recession that has pinched consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, game publishers like Activision Blizzard have clamored for price cuts, which often boost sales of software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Software makers should be quite happy about it," KBC Securities analyst Hiroshi Kamide said.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
The Disney-ABC Television Group, Hearst Corporation, and NBC Universal (NCBU)
today announced an agreement for A Television Networks (AETN) to acquire
Lifetime Entertainment Services. 

The entities stated that under the agreement, there are mechanisms by which NBCU
may elect or be required to exit AETN over a period of up to 15 years, in which
event Disney and Hearst could become 50-50 owners of AETN. The timing and amount
of a buy-out of NBCU's stake is uncertain as is how/where the buy-out would be
financed. Based on Fitch's estimates, an immediate buy-out of NBCU's entire
stake (most conservative case) financed either at Disney or at AETN would have
no effect on Disney's ratings. 

Additionally, Fitch does not expect any material impact to Disney's $400
million-$500 million in annual cash dividends from the equity stakes as a result
of these transactions. Fitch has traditionally assessed Disney's dividend income
from these cable networks in its Free Cash Flow metrics and not its Operating
EBITDA calculations, since A and Lifetime are generally outside of its core
brands. This treatment reflected Fitch's historical divestiture concerns given
other non-core ventures over the last few years (E! Entertainment Television and
US Weekly) were sold with proceeds predominantly dedicated toward share
repurchases. The potential increase in Disney's equity stake over time in AETN
could influence Fitch's evaluation of them as core operations, meaning financial
performance of this entity may be incorporated into Fitch's base operating
credit statistics at some point. The exit of NBCU from the venture does not
create any additional competitive concerns for the A channel as NBCU's 25%
minority stake would have unlikely kept them from developing competitive
programming on their wholly-owned cable channels. 

Fitch currently has the following ratings on Disney and its subsidiaries, all
with a Stable Outlook: 

The Walt Disney Company 

--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'; 

--Short-term IDR 'F1'; 

--Commercial paper 'F1'. 

ABC Inc. 

--IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'. 

Disney Enterprises, Inc. 

--IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'.

31, 2009, available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, details, background) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 27 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on
Thursday operations were back to normal at its 245,271 barrel-per-day
San Francisco Bay-area refinery in Richmond, California, following
repairs to a unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron's Richmond Refinery is back up and operating," Brent
Tippen, a spokesman for the oil major, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said last Friday it was making repairs to a shut unit at
the refinery without identifying it, but trade sources said it was a
hydrocracking unit, which makes gasoline and diesel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit shutdown had triggered spikes late last week in gasoline
and diesel prices in the San Francisco Bay wholesale refined products
market.

byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jim Christie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - California will pay no
fees and 3.0 percent interest on a $1.5 billion loan from JP
Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) that will provide the state with
money to pay its recently issued IOUs, State Treasurer Bill
Lockyer said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The loan also will help bolster the state government's cash
as it prepares for a multi-billion dollar sale of short-term
debt next month to raise money for its cash-flow needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a wrap," Lockyer told Reuters by telephone. "It
allows us obviously to accelerate the repayment of the IOUs and
to have some cash cushion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government of the most populous U.S. state issued the
IOUs, which carry a 3.75 percent interest rate, to conserve
dwindling cash during its recent budget crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; California is scheduled to begin redeeming the IOUs, issued
to taxpayers owed refunds and vendors, on Sept. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state through Tuesday had issued 414,000 of the IOUs,
technically registered warrants promising payment, worth $2.26
billion, according to the state controller's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; California will repay the loan from JP Morgan Chase after
its planned sale of revenue anticipation notes next month,
Lockyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lockyer is planning to sell $10.5 billion of the short-term
debt to raise proceeds for the state government's cash-flow
purposes. But he is prepared for a smaller sale of $7.8 billion
of the notes if Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and lawmakers
approve measures to defer some payments, the treasurer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A date for the note sale has not been set but Lockyer has
said he is planning to hold the sale in mid-September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE SALE CRITICAL FOR STATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lockyer said he expects strong orders from individual and
institutional investors for the notes: "The general view in the
financial community is that there will be significant demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lockyer added that JP Morgan Chase will likely play a
prominent role in the note sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JP Morgan Chase should get credit for being consistently
supportive of state needs," he said. "I expect that JP Morgan
Chase will have a lead role with others with that financing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They were the most accommodating of the Wall Street
firms," Lockyer added. "Most of the commercial banks, because
their reserves are so stretched, don't have the capacity to do
that sort of thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terms of the $1.5 billion loan come as concerns about
California's finances ease a bit on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch Ratings on Wednesday removed California's general
obligation debt from alert for a possible downgrade, citing
recent actions by the state's government to tackle its cash
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch affirmed California's GO rating of BBB, or two
notches above speculative, or "junk" status, and said the
ratings outlook is stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch applauded budget revisions in July that closed an
expected $24 billion deficit and provided the state with enough
cash flow flexibility to cover near-term needs, including money
to repay IOUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; California's government, however, still faces serious
challenges as recession grips the state's economy and slashes
revenues, said Fitch analyst Douglas Offerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes California's RAN sale next month critical for
the state government's near-term finances. "It's essential that
they be able to successfully close a RAN sale to even out their
cash flow," Offerman said.

(MSFT.O) plans to slash the price of its high-end Xbox 360
video game console by $100, or 25 percent, stepping up the
price war in the video game console market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Effective Friday, Microsoft will drop the price of the Xbox
360 Elite to $299.99 in the United States, just days after Sony
Corp (6758.T) cut the rival PlayStation 3 to $299 from $399.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have said the cuts will pressure Nintendo Co Ltd

company's biggest weapon in the battle to control entertainment

the works for some time and was not a response to Sony's cut.
Rather, he said, the price reduction will attract new buyers

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - An Abbott Laboratories Inc unit that makes genetic tests will work with Pfizer Inc to develop a test to screen non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors to determine which patients are good candidates for a novel cancer therapy being developed by Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Abbott unit, Abbott Molecular, said it would develop a test that determines a patient's genetic status. Results would be used to select patients for future clinical trials of a new oral cancer therapy, known as PF-02341066, being developed by Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Abbott test, another step toward personalized medicine in cancer treatment, will determine the presence of so-called gene rearrangement in the tissue of NSCLC tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene rearrangement is a process in cells that can contribute to the transformation of a normal cell into a cancerous one. It is found in NSCLC tumors and a wide variety of other cancers, but not in normal cells. Gene rearrangement, also called translocation, means the gene is in a different place than it usually is. If gene rearrangement is present, the Pfizer therapy is more likely to be effective, an Abbott spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 6 percent to 7 percent of NSCLC patients have the rearrangement and thus would be candidates for clinical trials of PF-02341066, an investigational therapy that selectively targets cancer-causing genes implicated in the progress of many cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This test will allow us to focus on the patient population most likely to benefit," Garry Nicholson, general manager of the Pfizer Oncology Business Unit, said in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with Abbott, he added, "we are confident that we will deliver yet another application of personalized medicine to address a currently unmet medical need in NSCLC."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbott Molecular President Stafford O'Kelly said Pfizer's compound "appears to be ideally suited to individualized therapy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial terms of the Abbott-Pfizer deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Abbott unit unveiled an agreement with British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline to develop a companion test to screen for lung cancer. That test will focus on an antigen called MAGE-A3 and will screen for NSCLC tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug companies and regulators alike increasingly are turning to these companion diagnostics -- tests that look for specific genes or proteins -- as a way to improve the odds that a high-cost biotechnology drug will work in specific patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca stopped most U.S. sales of Iressa in 2004 after it was found to help only 10 percent to 15 percent of lung cancer patients. But several studies have suggested that some people -- notably nonsmokers, Asians and women -- did better on Iressa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Debra Sherman; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

 (adds Nintendo comment, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gabriel Madway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
plans to slash the price of its high-end Xbox 360 video game
console by $100, or 25 percent, stepping up the price war in
the video game console market following a similar move by rival
Sony Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Effective Friday, Microsoft will drop the price of the Xbox
360 Elite to $299.99, just days after Sony (6758.T) cut the
rival PlayStation 3 to $299.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have said that the cuts would put pressure on
Nintendo Co Ltd 7974.OS to lower the price of its
best-selling Wii console, but for now the company is not
changing the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't have such a plan," Nintendo spokesman Yasuhiro
Minagawa said when asked if the company plans to cut prices on
the Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Xbox is the No. 2 console in the U.S., behind the Wii,
which sells for $249. But Xbox sales are up 17 percent in the
U.S., the only console to show growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price on the entry-level Xbox Arcade model will stay at
$199.99, and Microsoft will phase out its mid-range Pro
console, leaving it with two models. The Pro will sell for
$249.99 until supplies run out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft spokesman David Dennis said the price cut was in
the works for some time, and was not a response to Sony's move,
which was announced last week at the Gamescom video game trade
show in Cologne, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather, Dennis said the price reduction would attract new
buyers and help simplify its product mix for manufacturers and
retailers as well as customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It really makes the decision for consumers a lot easier,"
he said. "They're either price conscious and they gravitate
towards the Arcade or they the want the full Xbox 360
experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Game publishers such as Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) have
been clamoring for console price cuts, which help boost sales
of software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The industry remains mired in a slump brought on by a lack
of big-name releases and a recession that has pinched consumer
spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the slump, Hirokazu Hamamura, President of Japanese
game magazine publisher Enterbrain Inc, says that Nintendo may
resist a Wii price cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He suggests that the more powerful PlayStation 3 and Xbox
360 machines are not attractive to Wii shoppers, who enjoy a
range of family and fitness-based games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The price cuts by itself won't stop people from buying
Wiis. The users are too different," he said. "With Nintendo,
the issue is not about the price so much as saturation and
ability to grow in new markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares were down 8 cents to $24.47 in thin
premarket trading.

Microsoft match or beat its 2008 performance, when it increased
unit sales of Xboxes by more than 80 percent in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect them to be at least as good if not better," he
told Reuters by phone. "I do believe there will be a higher

8Gb/s Fibre Channel CIOv Expansion Card, delivering maximum flexibility and
scalability. These connectivity options make it an ideal blade solution for
VMware virtualized server environments, in which it is recommended to use
multiple connections for different traffic types. 

"BLADE`s convergence-ready switch, which is FCoE ready, automatically recognizes
Emulex`s Virtual Fabric Adapter and has the ability to connect massive
virtualization environments that span thousands of virtual switch ports, helping
simplify management and improve performance for today`s agile workloads," said
Dan Tuchler, vice president of Product Management and Strategy, BLADE Network
Technologies. "Working with Emulex and IBM to deliver this combined solution
confirms that BLADE switches are today`s best choice for next-generation data
center networks."

all major protocols: TCP/IP, TOE, iSCSI, and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE).
The OneConnect UCNA is optimized to support both IP and storage networking
demands, enabling data center managers to meet the performance and architecture
requirements of networking and storage applications with one integrated adapter
solution. The Emulex Virtual Fabric Adapter utilizes the OneCommand software
management framework for secure, virtualized, automated and centralized
enterprise management for deployment, dynamic provisioning, asset management,
virtual I/O services, connectivity management, security, and quality of service
for virtualized and converged networking environments.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Aug 27 (Reuters) - Indonesia's oil watchdog,
BPMIGAS, said on Thursday it may bring U.S. oil major Exxon
Mobil (XOM.N) to arbitration court if the firm fails to produce
15,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from the Cepu block
by the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The giant block in Central Java, which is being jointly
developed by Exxon Mobil and Indonesian state oil firm
Pertamina, began initial production last December with a volume
of around 800 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Exxon Mobil temporarily halted output at Cepu
because of pipeline problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is an agreement from Exxon Mobil to produce oil from
Cepu in August. If it fails, we may bring Exxon Mobil to
arbitration court," said Sulistya Hastuti, BPMIGAS spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Indonesia officials could not be reached for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, another BPMIGAS official said Exxon Mobil has
promised to produce 15,000 bpd to 20,000 bpd of crude from Cepu
in August, but several problems, including land clearing, have
caused production delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, as an operator of the project, Exxon Mobil must
solve the problems, and they should not delay the production,"
the official, who declined to be identified by name, told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "BPMIGAS may also change the operator in Cepu block to
Pertamina," the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cepu, which ranks among the U.S. major's top 10 projects
worldwide, is expected to produce 165,000 bpd when it reaches
peak output in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia hopes the project will help arrest a sharp slide
in its crude production as ageing fields struggle to maintain
output.

Here are highlights from Thursday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Thrifts Defy Troubles

Thrifts are required to have at least 65% of their loans as mortgages and other
consumer loans, which makes them particularly vulnerable to the housing
downturn. But banks have no such compulsion. However, the banking industry is
likely to face further special assessments as more institutions fail during the
recession. 

The OTS supervised 794 thrifts as well as 459 holding company enterprises at the
end of the quarter. The agency said that three thrifts had failed during the
second quarter. 

A total of 81 federally insured banks have failed so far this year. This
includes several large thrifts. The failure of Seattle-based Washington Mutual
Inc. last year was the biggest US bank failure ever. Washington Mutual, that
involved thrifts, was acquired by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM). 

Among the others, recently, Guaranty Bank failed and was sold to BBVA Compass,
the US arm of Spain`s second-largest bank Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (NYSE:
BBV). The banking operations of Colonial were sold to BB Corp. (NYSE: BBT). 

HP Gets American Airlines Deal

Good news continues for Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE: HPQ). After delivering modest
third quarter results, the company won a deal with American Airlines parent AMR
Corp. (NYSE: AMR). According to the agreement, Hewlett-Packard will be
developing a system for AMR, which will take care of pricing, reservations,
flight information and check-in. 

We believe this will improve the overall travel experience of American Airlines
customers. This will specifically help the company in efficient baggage
transfer, which will ultimately lead to lesser lost baggage, passengers getting
updated information about cancelled or rescheduled flights and user-friendly
check in process. The process may take around 4 to 5 years to set up. The
pricing of the deal was not declared. 

We believe that if Hewlett-Packard can execute this project efficiently, this
experience will take the company a long way in winning similar projects from
other major players in the airlines industry. Although the airlines industry is
going through the doldrums as a result of the global economic downturn, every
other carrier is looking to streamline their operations and we believe
Hewlett-Packard can cater to that need.

Here are highlights from Thursday`sAnalyst Blog: 

GE to Sell Security Business

General Electric (NYSE: GE) is arranging to sell its security business, which
makes alarms, surveillance systems and other safety products, and hopes to
attract bids in the range of $2 billion for the unit. This move represents GE`s
strategy of exiting from non-core businesses. 

GE has hired JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) to sell the portion of its
business that makes security products. The business has drawn interest from GE`s
rivals United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) and Tyco International (NYSE: TYC).


Security assets have traditionally attracted private equity buyers, but due to
the difficult economic environment and an expressed interest by GE in selling
these assets to a strategic buyer, bid amounts could be depressed for such a
product portfolio. It remains in question whether acquirers will be interested
in GE Security`s full portfolio of products, or only bits and pieces of the
business. 

Precision Castparts Strengthens

Yesterday, Precision Castparts Corp. (NYSE: PCP) announced its decision to
acquire Carlton Forge Works and related entities for $850 million. Carlton, with
one facility in Paramount, CA, is a leading manufacturer of seamless rolled
rings for critical aerospace applications. Carlton is a key supplier for Boeing
787 and Airbus XWB. 

Precision Castparts will also acquire Arcturus Manufacturing Corporation, a
hammer forging operation, as a part of this transaction. The acquisition, which
is expected to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, will further
strengthen PCP`s forging capabilities. The transaction is expected to be
immediately accretive to the company`s earnings. 

Precision Castparts derived 43.6% of its fiscal 2009 revenue from the Forged
Products segment. The company is one of the leading manufacturers of forged
components for the aerospace and power generation markets. The company has been
expanding its Forged Products business through regular acquisitions. The
previous acquisition was that of Hackney Ladish Holding Corp. a leading producer
of forged pipe fittings for critical energy infrastructure and related
applications, in fiscal 2009.

Here are highlights from Thursday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Setback for Alkermes` Pipeline

On Wednesday, Alkermes, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALKS) disclosed that it has received
notification from Johnson &amp; Johnson`s (NYSE: JNJ) Ortho-McNeil-Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Janssen Pharmaceutical International stating that
Janssen does not intend to continue with the development of the four-week
long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone. A phase I study with the
four-week formulation had been initiated in January 2009. 

Risperidone, which is marketed as Risperdal Consta, is Alkermes` lead product.
Risperdal Consta is the longer-lasting injectable version of Johnson &amp; Johnson's
schizophrenia drug Risperdal (risperidone). 

Risperdal Consta uses Alkermes' proprietary Medisorb technology to deliver and
maintain therapeutic medication levels in the body through just one injection
every two weeks. The product is approved in more than 85 countries worldwide and
is available in 60 countries. 

Risperdal Consta is superior to the first-generation Risperdal in terms of
efficacy, tolerability and frequency of dosage (one injection every two weeks).
Given its improved profile, Risperdal Consta is a major player in the
schizophrenia market. Worldwide sales of Risperdal Consta came in at $348
million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. 

Risperdal Consta is the current growth driver of Alkermes` top-line, and the
company was looking to drive growth further through the development and approval
of the once-monthly formulation. As such, J`s decision to discontinue
development of the once-monthly injection is a major disappointment for
Alkermes. 

Although the schizophrenia market is huge, it is also highly competitive, with
players like AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Pfizer (NYSE:
PFE) fighting for market share.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings assigns 'AAA' ratings with Stable Rating Outlooks to JP Morgan
Resecuritization Trust 2009-R10. The transaction consists of seven non-crossed
groups. Each group is a resecuritization of a residential mortgage backed
securities certificate. The Group 3 certificates are not rated by Fitch. 

Group 1 is a resecuritization of 25.35% interest in the LMT 2007-7, class 6-A-4.


Group 2 is a resecuritization of 100% interest in the CWALT 2006-23CB, class
1-A-1. 

Group 4 is a resecuritization of 25.65% interest in the WFALT 2007-PA1, class
A-4. 

Group 5 is a resecuritization of 54.91% interest in the INDX 2006-AR11, class
6-A-1. 

Group 6 is a resecuritization of 6.03% interest in the WAMU 2007-HY3, class
4-A1. 

Group 7 is a resecuritization of 20% and 67.16% interest in the FHAMS 2006-FA8,
classes 1-A-1 and 1-A-11, respectively. 

As resecuritizations, the certificates will receive their cash-flows from the
underlying classes of certificates. The underlying certificates represent
beneficial ownership interest in fixed-rate and adjustable-rate, conventional,
first lien residential mortgage loans, substantially all of which have original
terms to stated maturity of 30 years. 

This transaction contains certain classes designated as base certificates and
others as exchangeable certificates. The A-1 certificate of each group is a base
certificate and can be exchanged for certain combinations of A-3 through A-10
(as well as A-11 and A-12 in the cases of Groups 4, 6, and 7). 

The underlying collateral and cashflow structure were analyzed according to
Fitch's 'U.S. Residential Mortgage Re-REMIC,' 'ResiLogic: U.S. Residential
Mortgage Loss Model' and 'U.S. RMBS Cash Flow Analysis' criteria which are
available on the Fitch Ratings web site at www.fitchratings.com.

&lt;p&gt;MOBILE, Ala.--(Business Wire)--
Students in 12 Alabama high schools achieved an 81 percent increase in passing
scores on Advanced Placement math, science and English tests under a national
education program funded by ExxonMobil. The schools located in Jefferson County
and Montgomery are participating in the Advanced Placement Training and
Incentive Programs supported by the National Math and Science Initiative.
ExxonMobil is a founding sponsor of the initiative, committing $125 million in
support, the largest-ever corporate gift for U.S. math and science education. 

Paul Dieffenthaller, superintendent for ExxonMobil`s Mobile Bay operations,
said, "Alabama students can excel at math and science given the right
opportunity. ExxonMobil is very proud that our investment is helping prepare
more Alabama students for college." 

Advanced Placement (AP) offers high school students an opportunity for college
credit in more than 30 subjects, including high-level math and science, if they
achieve designated scores on a standardized end-of-course exam. The 81 percent
increase in passing scores at the 12 schools is 14 times the national average
and nearly four times the overall state average. 

Overall enrollment in AP courses at the 12 Alabama schools doubled last year.
Participation by minority students nearly tripled, increasing from 209 students
in 2008 to 826 students in 2009. The qualifying scores by the minority students
increased 67 percent. 

The schools participating in the AP training and incentive programs include
Clay-Chalkville High School, Gardendale High School, Hueytown High School,
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate High School, Minor High School,
Pinson Valley High School, Pleasant Grove High School and Shades Valley High
School. 

The non-profit National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI) was launched two
years ago to raise math and science achievement in the U.S. by expanding
education projects that have proved they produce results. In 2008, NMSI awarded
more than $79 million in grants to promote student participation in AP math,
science and English classes, working with state coalitions representing 67 high
schools across Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Kentucky, Massachusetts and
Virginia. The program is expanding in another 78 schools this year. 

Results released August 25 showed the NMSI program has increased the number of
passing AP math, science and English exams by 51 percent among students in the
six participating states, more than nine times the national average. The AP
support program includes special teacher training, on-going support from master
teachers, teacher incentives, more time on task for students and scholarships
for students. Students who take AP courses and exams increase their eligibility
for scholarships and college admission and are much more likely to earn a
college degree. 

"The results of the initiative show that the public and private sectors working
together can better prepare students to compete in today`s technology-driven
economy," Dieffenthaller said. "ExxonMobil remains committed to this initiative
and we look forward to being a part of its continued success in Alabama for many
years to come." 

About ExxonMobil

education, health and science in the communities where the company has
significant operations. ExxonMobil is the leading natural gas producer in Mobile
Bay, where it has invested more than $3 billion in the past 20 years to produce,
process and deliver gas to consumers.

&lt;p&gt;Award Recognizes Atlanta-Based "Partner" Firm for Diversity Practices


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company presented its "Living the Values" Award (LVA) to
Atlanta-based law firm King &amp; Spalding L.L.P. The award, now in its second year,
was established by the Company to annually acknowledge and honor the U.S.-based
law firm, with whom it does business, which best demonstrates a commitment to
diversity with creative and innovative solutions that align with The Coca-Cola
Company`s diversity values. Alex Cummings, executive vice president and chief
administrative officer of The Coca-Cola Company, presented the award to King &amp;
Spalding partner and diversity committee chair, Lovita T. Tandy at The World of
Coca-Cola during an awards dinner hosted by Geoff Kelly, general counsel and
senior vice president of The Coca-Cola Company. 

"Leveraging diversity is more than just a core value for our Company. It is a
business imperative for us. For this reason, it is appropriate that we recognize
the positive actions of others who are making progress in this critically
important area. We applaud King &amp; Spalding for their visible leadership,
best-in-class practices and commitment to elevating their diversity
performance," said Cummings. 

The LVA was first announced in 2006 by Geoff Kelly, with a promise to initiate
the first competition in 2007. The first LVA award was presented on April 8,
2008 to the law firm Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon L.L.P. (SHB), for demonstrating their
commitment to diversity through the deployment of creative and innovative
solutions. 

For the second LVA award, in December 2008, a questionnaire was distributed to
the Company`s 32 U.S. "partner" law firms requesting descriptions of their
practices and values that support and drive diversity and inclusion in the
following areas:

* Commitment of firm`s senior management to diversity with established systems
for measuring progress and accountability. 
* Representation of minorities and women in the firm generally and in the firm
leadership. 
* Success in hiring, development, promotion, and retention of minority and women
associates within the firm. 
* Creative partnering arrangements with minority and women-owned firms. 
* Rigor in firm-wide diversity programming such that diversity, as a goal,
enjoys firm-wide ownership and participation.

Firm responses were evaluated against best-in-class practices in each area. King
&amp; Spalding earned the highest aggregate score. 

"Diversity is and will continue to be a core element of The Coca-Cola Company`s
values and corporate culture," said Kelly. "I`m excited to work for a company
that is committed to empowering its people to think big and contribute to work
that matters. The legal division believes in working within the framework of the
Company`s diversity objectives to create an initiative to champion a continuous
cycle of strategy, stewardship and metrics around diversity for our function. We
all have an obligation to call out areas for improvement to continue change. As
part of the LVA initiative, we are pleased to recognize the contribution of King
&amp; Spalding for promoting diversity and creating long-term value for everyone
with whom they work." 

In an effort to steward change, King &amp; Spalding has made diversity an integral
part of the firm`s culture. King &amp; Spalding is committed to attracting,
retaining and promoting diversity throughout the firm-and strives to create a
collaborative environment that benefits from the sharing of experiences, ideas
and unique qualities that each of its lawyers brings to the firm. Because
diversity is one of the firm`s core values, it is supported by a standing
committee that leads the firm`s diversity and inclusion efforts. 

"The Coca-Cola Company is one of the world`s most diverse global companies and
King &amp; Spalding is honored to be the recipient of its Living the Values Award,"
said Tandy. "King &amp; Spalding is committed to maintaining a diverse, inclusive
environment, and while this journey is full of challenges, we are fully
committed to it as part of our long-term strategic plan." 

Coca-Cola is one of the first Fortune 100 Companies to publicly honor law firms
that excel in workplace diversity efforts.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp plans to slash the price of its high-end Xbox 360 video game console by $100, or 25 percent, stepping up the price war in the video game console market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective Friday, Microsoft will drop the price of the Xbox 360 Elite to $299.99 in the United States, just days after Sony Corp cut the rival PlayStation 3 to $299 from $399.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said the cuts will pressure Nintendo Co Ltd to lower the price of its best-selling Wii console, which retails for $249, but for now the company is standing firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have such a plan," Nintendo spokesman Yasuhiro Minagawa said when asked about a price cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among this generation of game consoles, the Xbox is No. 2 in the United States behind the Wii. But U.S. sales of the Xbox are up 17 percent this year, the only console to show growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price on the entry-level Xbox Arcade model will stay at $199.99, and Microsoft will phase out its mid-range Xbox Pro model, leaving it with two models. The Pro will sell for $249.99 until supplies run out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since PS3, Xbox and Wii are increasingly centerpieces of home entertainment, their sales can spur purchases of software, accessories and other media, and boost traffic at retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the unit that runs Xbox is a small part of Microsoft's overall sales -- at about 11 percent -- it is the company's biggest weapon in the battle to control entertainment in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman David Dennis said the price cut was in the works for some time and was not a response to Sony's cut. Rather, he said, the price reduction will attract new buyers and help simplify Microsoft's product mix for manufacturers and retailers as well as customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really makes the decision for consumers a lot easier," he said. "They're either price conscious and they gravitate toward the Arcade, or they want the full Xbox 360 experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the Elite price will shrink by 50 euros ($71) to 249.99 euros, or 199.99 pounds ($324) in Britain. Chris Lewis, head of Xbox Europe, said the cut would help Microsoft match or beat its 2008 performance, when it increased unit sales of Xboxes more than 80 percent in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond console sales, the cuts by Microsoft and Sony should provide a lift to a broader gaming industry has been stuck in a slump brought on by a lack of big-name releases and a recession that has pinched consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, game publishers like Activision Blizzard have clamored for price cuts, which often boost sales of software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Software makers should be quite happy about it," KBC Securities analyst Hiroshi Kamide said. "The industry should stage a bit of a recovery in the second half of this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 2 cents to $24.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7024 euro = 0.6170 pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Georgina Prodhan in London, and Kiyoshi Takenaka and Mayumi Negishi in Tokyo; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WIRRAL, United Kingdom--(Business Wire)--
LDRA&#174;, the leading provider of automated software verification, source code
analysis, and test tools, has integrated the LDRA tool suite with the IBM
Rational Rose RealTime model-driven development environment. This integration
introduces LDRA`s powerful code quality analysis and code coverage techniques
into the domain of model-driven development (MDD) using Unified Modeling
Language (UML). The LDRA tool suite supports the analysis, instrumentation, and
testing of both auto-generated and user-created source code both from within the
Rose RealTime user interface or the LDRA development environment. 

Rose RealTime has a proven track record of delivering high-quality embedded
applications by supporting MDD benefits such as abstraction, encapsulation and
distribution. LDRA`s integration of this environment with the LDRA tool suite
combines the strengths of both environments. The integration creates a complete
solution which allows models to be checked against coding standards such as
MISRA, to be analyzed for potential quality problems, and to be instrumented at
the source code level so that model-driven tests deliver coverage metrics
alongside test results. 

LDRA produces code review, quality review and coverage overview reports that
attach to the UML component, ensuring that analysis and testing can be carried
out from within the Rose RealTime development environment. Alternatively, the
generated source code can be automatically loaded into the LDRA tool suite,
allowing the full range of analysis techniques to be applied or unit testing to
be executed. 

"Although model-driven development is a powerful technique, every model includes
a certain amount of hand-crafted code, whether created directly within the model
or obtained from a third party," commented Ian Hennell, LDRA`s Operations
Director. "Because of this, the need for code-rule checking and quality analysis
remains, even if confidence in the auto-generated code limits this to only a
percentage of the complete code base." 

Analysis by the LDRA tool suite can highlight implementation issues during
design, allowing them to be fixed before they become a problem. When Rose
RealTime capsules and classes are ready to be tested, the LDRA tool suite can
instrument the associated source code, offering metrics on the effectiveness of
the tests and identifying untested branches and unreachable code. If necessary,
code can be transferred to the LDRA tool suite for unit testing to exercise
routes through the code which otherwise remain untriggered. 

LDRA`s integration of the LDRA tool suite with the IBM Rational Rose RealTime
development environment has been written and tested using IBM Rational Rose
RealTime v7.0. The integration leverages the makefile and source code structures
generated under a UML component so that, while these structures remain
unchanged, the integration is forward and backward compatible. For more
information about the integration, visit www.ldra.com/integrations.asp or e-mail
info@ldra.com for more details. 

About the LDRA tool suite

The LDRA tool suite has been derived from many ground-breaking testing
techniques developed by LDRA. The LDRA tool suite assists with the eight primary
tasks: traceability verification, design, code and quality review, unit testing,
target testing, test verification and test management. Focus on these key areas
is required to achieve a company`s software development and maintenance goals.
The LDRA tool suite can be used by an entire project team-developers, QA
managers, test engineers, project managers and maintenance/support engineers-to
automate the software development lifecycle. Through the deployment of the LDRA
tool suite, companies are able to deliver well-constructed, documented and
tested software, and benefit from significant time, cost and operational
savings. For more information on the LDRA tool suite, please visit:

&lt;p&gt;   * Cash position strong, no debt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says no plans to withdraw from any of its markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * H1 net fee income 50 mln stg vs 71.7 mln stg last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Maintains interim dividend at 1.40 p/shr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares rise 2 pct
 (Adds comment from CEO, details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Purwa Naveen Raman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, Aug 28 (Reuters) - British recruitment firm
Robert Walters Plc (RWA.L) posted a loss for the first half as
net fee income fell by 30 percent due to dwindling demand for
staffing, but maintained its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, whose British rivals include Michael Page
(MPI.L) and Hays (HAYS.L), said it ended the period with 22.5
million pounds of net cash and no debt, and had no plans to
withdraw from any of the markets in which it operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are not going to close any offices, we are not going to
reduce any (more) heads. We can sleep at night with the levels
we are on," Chief Executive Robert Walters told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company had reduced its headcount by about 20 percent
to 1,260 during the period to save costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think it's going to be uncertainty for another year... I
don't think things are necessarily going to be any worse,"
Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walters said he was seeing some hiring in banking sector
and one or two areas in information technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But an increase from a pretty low level. So not the right
time to start putting up flags and celebrating," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pretax loss for the first six months was 2.6 million
pounds, compared with profit of 9.8 million pounds in the
year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Switzerland's Adecco (ADEN.VX), the world's largest
staffing group, and Netherlands-based USG People (USGP.AS) as
well as America's Manpower (MAN.N) have also been hit as
companies across the world cut jobs and costs in response to
contracting economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONTRACTS HELP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the company's permanent business across the globe
took a beating, its contract business was resilient, accounting
for 41 percent of its recruitment net fee income, up from 32
percent in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net fee income for the period ended June 30 was 50 million
pounds. Revenue fell 17 percent to 141.7 million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company maintained its interim dividend at 1.40 pence
per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Walters gets 38 percent of its net fee income from
Asia Pacific, 33 percent from UK and 27 percent from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, CEO Walters said he wouldn't be surprised if Asia
Pacific's contribution to net fee income increased to 50
percent in the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Walters shares were up 2 percent at 147 pence at
0940 GMT on Friday on the London Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; (Refiles to give link to Chevron's TexacoEcuador YouTube 
site, paragraph 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Aug 31 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has
accused the judge in a $27 billion environmental damage case in
Ecuador of misconduct and being involved in a bribery scheme
that Chevron said appears to involve Ecuador's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. oil company said in a statement on Monday that it
would seek disqualification of Judge Juan Nunez after providing
Ecuadorean and U.S. authorities with secretly recorded video of
Nunez talking of ruling against Chevron later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the video, posted at its TexacoEcuador YouTube
channel at www.youtube.com/texacoecuador, shows a man at
another meeting identifying himself as a representative of
Ecuador's ruling party discussing a $3 million bribe for
 contracts, of which Nunez would get a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said two meetings with Nunez and two meetings with
purported party representative Patricio Garcia were recorded by
both Diego Borja, a local logistics contractor who has worked
for Chevron, and American Wayne Hansen, who has no relationship
with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No judge who has participated in meetings of the type
shown on these tapes could possibly deliver a legitimate
decision," Chevron Executive Vice President Charles James said
in the company's statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Ecuadorean government did not respond to requests for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the four meetings were recorded without its
knowledge, through small cameras in a watch owned by Borja and
a pen held by Hansen. Borja only brought the bribery scheme to
the company's attention in June, Chevron said in the
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said Borja and Hansen had been "pursuing business
opportunities" in Ecuador before the potential for remediation
work was brought to their attention and the meeting with Garcia
was arranged to discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said the two men had not
explained why they recorded the meetings, and he said the bribe
scheme had been "put on the table" prior to the meeting with
Garcia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The video of the two meetings with Nunez, who appears to be
the same Nunez who has appeared on television news coverage,
showed the judge discussing the long-running case, which had
been expected to conclude later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs have said Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001,
damaged their health by dumping billions of gallons of polluted
water in the jungle around where they live for more than two
decades before the company left Ecuador in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Karen Hinton, a Washington D.C.-based spokeswoman for the
Amazon Defense Coalition, which supports the plaintiffs, said 
the video showed Nunez had resisted the attempted bribe scheme
put to him by the former Chevron contractor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An appropriate investigation will determine whether the
allegations are true or if they are the product of a dirty
tricks campaign designed and financed by the company," Hinton
said in a statement released to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said Borja and Hansen first met with Nunez in May
after an initial meeting at Alianza Pais's Quito offices with
Garcia, who said he was a representative of the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garcia then arranged for Borja and Hansen to fly to Lago
Agrio, where the case is being heard, to see Nunez, and the two
men met Nunez again at a Quito hotel in June, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said neither man was paid, though the San Ramon,
California-based company said it had assisted Borja with
relocation expenses and other support because he and the
company feared for his safety and that of his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said it would not provide details about Borja's
relocation for security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has alerted authorities both in Ecuador and in the
United States, and both governments should investigate this
evidence in a serious and expeditious manner," the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which says it has faced a "trial lawyer"-led
campaign to force it to settle in the case, has long complained
of political interference in the Ecuador case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs, represented by U.S.-based lawyer Steven
Donziger, responded by pointing out that Texaco had pushed to
move the trial to Ecuador from the United States in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court said last
November that Chevron should pay $27 billion, including more
than $8 billion in unjust enrichment, which was far above the
previous damages estimate of up to $16 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has said it would fight what it expects to be an
adverse judgment, possibly in the United States, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While Chevron probably has no hope of a fair hearing in
the Ecuadorean legal system, it should have no trouble in an
impartial setting, and thus we see no plausible scenario under
which the plaintiffs would collect anything close to $27
billion," Raymond James analysts said in a note to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares closed 1 percent lower at $69.94 on Monday,
responding to a drop in crude oil prices.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co on Monday agreed to buy Marvel Entertainment Inc for $4 billion in the biggest media deal of the year, banking on Marvel's roster of superheroes to broaden its lineup of movie franchises that appeal to boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney adds Iron Man, Incredible Hulk and Thor to its roster of lovable characters like Mickey Mouse and Snow White, and will feature the comic book heroes in movies before rolling out associated theme park rides, TV shows and merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deal comes at a tough time in the entertainment business, with advertisers avoiding spending on new campaigns and consumers cutting back on everything from DVDs to travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is also expensive. The price tag values Marvel at 37 times its estimated 2009 earnings, and offers shareholders a 29 percent premium to Friday's closing price. Standard  Poor's reacted by placing Disney's credit rating on its negative watchlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the risk of overpaying did not deter Disney from seeking out a deal to address an area of concern among investors: How can it better reach more young males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This helps give Disney more important exposure to the young male demographic that they have sort of lost some ground with in recent years," said David Joyce, an analyst with Miller Tabak  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Disney has long been a blockbuster brand with girls thanks to characters such as "Hannah Montana," "Cinderella" and "Snow White," but has struggled to achieve the same kind of success with boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movies including "Iron Man 2," due to hit theaters next year, or 2011's "Spider-Man 4" and "Avengers" should help resolve that issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney will also be able to use its marketing and entertainment strength -- stretching from ABC to cable television to theme parks -- to promote and build characters such as Thor in ways Marvel never could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is Disney's largest since the $7.6 billion purchase of Pixar in 2006, and it immediately caused reverberations. Shares in DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc spiked 5 percent on speculation it may become a takeover target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And analysts raised questions about companies like Viacom Inc, Discovery Communications Inc, and Hasbro Inc that have existing business partnerships with Marvel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNDER-PROMISING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To acquire Marvel, Disney agreed to pay a total of $30 per share in cash plus about 0.745 Disney shares for each Marvel share owned. The deal was approved by the boards of both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares of Marvel, which was founded in 1939 and rolled out its first blockbuster character, Captain America, in 1941, shot up to a high of $49.29 before falling a bit to close at $48.37 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney approached Marvel a few months ago "to get to know them," Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs told Reuters. The overture began with a meeting between Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger and Marvel CEO Ike Perlmutter and evolved into merger discussions over a series of meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We at Disney had admired them because of their position and asset base," Staggs said. "With conversations over time we came to believe in the value of a combination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney, which will acquire ownership of more than 5,000 Marvel characters, fell 3 percent to $26.04. The deal is expected to close by year-end, but will not add to Disney earnings until fiscal 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition came as a surprise, even though Iger had mentioned recently the company would consider acquisitions that bolstered Disney brands across international markets and on new technology platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it could kick-start more deal making in the media sector -- where stocks have outperformed the broader Standard  Poor's 500 this year -- few analysts see another bidder making a play for Marvel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major reason is the presence of Marvel's Perlmutter, who owns 37 percent of the company and will oversee it within the Disney empire. Perlmutter will trade his stake in Marvel for a 1 percent stake in Disney, but will not receive a seat on its board of directors -- as did Pixar CEO Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney executives drew a number of parallels between the Pixar and Marvel deals, and suggested it would keep the Marvel brand intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal here is not to rebrand Marvel," Iger said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caris  Co analyst David Miller said Disney was "sandbagging a little" by estimating the deal would not add to its earnings for another two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said the same thing with the Pixar deal," said Miller, who has "above average" ratings on both Disney and Marvel. "I think they will make it accretive a lot sooner. They are underpromising, as they always do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paul Thomasch; additional reporting by Franklin Paul, Gina Keating and John Tilak; editing by Derek Caney, Andre Grenon and Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Stan Lee, who co-created many of Marvel Entertainment Inc's most famous characters, gave Disney's takeover bid a thumbs-up on Monday and waved off fears the entertainment conglomerate might undermine decades-old comics mythology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee, who helped dream up some of the most enduring icons in popular culture from Spider-Man to the Fantastic Four, dismissed notions the core young male audience -- notorious for attacking virtually every comic-book adaptation's faithfulness -- had anything to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To me, becoming 'Disneyfied' is not a bad thing. I mean look at (Disney) movies like 'Pirates of the Caribbean,'" Lee, who parted ways with Marvel years ago, but remains its Chairman Emeritus, said in a telephone interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney knows how to do movies. They know how to do colorful characters and I think the fans, if they think about it, they're going to love it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney agreed on Monday to buy Marvel for $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Marvel executive Shirrel Rhoades said on Monday that some Marvel readers were worried the "comic books will get watered down in a Disney-like way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Lee, that spells great things ahead for his creations, such as Thor, the Norse God of Thunder who will anchor a big-screen adaptation in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 86-year-old Lee is no longer involved in the day-to-day operations of the company he helped build into a comics titan from the unknown arm of a pulp-fiction publisher. These days he is the creative force behind his own media company, called POW! Entertainment, which itself has a business partnership with Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Marvel Entertainment plans to release the movie "Thor," based on a Stan Lee character borrowed from European mythology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was trying to think of something that would be totally different. What could be bigger and even more powerful than the Hulk? And I figured why not a legendary god," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give Thor more rhetorical punch in the comics, Lee said he gave him dialogue borrowed from the Bible and Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gareb Shamus, CEO of Wizard Entertainment and the organizer of several comic-book conventions, said Lee remains a legend in the comic book world and he described meeting Lee to coming face-to-face with a character from the pages of a comic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't matter where he goes, anywhere around the world, he's the man that created some of your best friends," Shamus added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; editing by Edwin Chan and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Toymaker Hasbro Inc may end up one of the biggest losers after Walt Disney Co agreed to buy Marvel Entertainment, as it loses out on a rich source of content for its new TV channel and faces much tougher licensing negotiations in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hasbro's agreement with Marvel to make toys and games based on the latter's characters extends through 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happens thereafter is a question mark, especially since Disney has a longer history with Hasbro's arch-rival Mattel Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts had hoped Hasbro, the power behind such franchises as Transformers and G.I. Joe, would be able to add some of Marvel's stable of 5,000-odd characters including Spider-Man and Iron Man to its newly launched TV venture with Discovery Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Disney would most likely bring Marvel into its own vast entertainment network, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the near term, we expect Disney to deploy Marvel's content onto its young male focused cable network, Disney XD," UBS analyst Michael Morris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As many of these deals conclude over time, we will have the flexibility to either bring them in-house or pursue third-party licensing agreements depending on how we feel we can create the most value," Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company is known to drive tough deals, so after it takes over Marvel's brands, Mattel and Hasbro likely face tricky licensing negotiations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The squeeze is there from the retail side and now the squeeze will be there from the Disney side," said Jed Ferdinand, a licensing and intellectual property attorney for Grimes  Battersby LLP. "They command very favorable and strict terms from their licensing manufacturers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG TV LOSS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the biggest lost opportunity may be on TV -- analysts had expected Marvel's relationship with Hasbro to extend onto screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Hasbro signed a deal with Discovery to develop a kids' TV network. Analysts say the Spidey-Mickey deal leaves the No. 2 U.S. toymaker in a spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view this as a lost opportunity for 3rd party content as we had thought it was probable that Marvel-related TV content over time would gravitate toward the Hasbro/Discovery joint venture given Hasbro's long-term licensing agreement with Marvel," Wells Fargo Securities analyst Tim Conder said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasbro has its own programs tied to brands like G.I. Joe, Transformers and My Little Pony lined up for the network, but had mulled beefing up its slate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Marvel was one of the many potential sources we were looking at for programing for the network and it's probably less likely now," Hasbro spokesman Wayne Charness said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGHER LICENSING DEALS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media giant Walt Disney on Monday announced a $4 billion deal to buy Marvel, whose lineup includes such titans of the comic-book world as Wolverine, Iron Man and Thor besides Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Hasbro and Mattel face a tougher negotiator in deep-pocketed Disney when they try to secure lucrative contracts to churn out everything from toys to backpacks and lunch boxes, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattel has deals with Disney for Cars, Toy Story, Disney Princess, Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh, to name a few. Mattel declined to comment on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For toy companies, licensed products help bolster sales, particularly during challenging economic times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, brand owners collected $5.7 billion in licensing royalty revenue, but that was down 5.6 percent from a year earlier as tight consumer spending took its toll, a Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association survey showed in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If toymakers are worrying what the Disney-Marvel deal means for the longer term, they may have company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viacom unit Paramount Pictures has worldwide distribution rights for Marvel's 'Iron Man 2,' 'Thor,' 'Captain America,' 'Avengers' and 'Iron Man 3' movies, which are not affected by the deal, a Paramount spokesman said, adding that it looks forward to working with Disney after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Disney may have other plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rationale for the deal is more consumer product license focused than film, as the next five films for Marvel remain with Paramount under their existing distribution agreement, though we expect films from Marvel following that to be distributed by Disney," Thomas Weisel analyst Benjamin Mogil said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal could also be a chance for Disney to accelerate to date limited theme park exploitation by Marvel," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Aarthi Sivaraman in Seattle; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Stan Lee created many of Marvel's biggest characters &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * He favors Disney's $4 billion acquisition of Marvel &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Alex Dobuzinskis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LOS ANGELES, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Stan Lee, who co-created many of Marvel Entertainment Inc's MVL.N most famous characters, gave Disney's takeover bid a thumbs-up on Monday and waved off fears the entertainment conglomerate might undermine decades-old comics mythology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Lee, who helped dream up some of the most enduring icons in popular culture from Spider-Man to the Fantastic Four, dismissed notions the core young male audience -- notorious for attacking virtually every comic-book adaption's faithfulness -- had anything to worry about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "To me, becoming 'Disneyfied' is not a bad thing. I mean look at (Disney) movies like 'Pirates of the Caribbean,'" Lee, who parted ways with Marvel years ago, but remains its Chairman Emeritus, said in a telephone interview with Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Disney knows how to do movies. They know how to do colorful characters and I think the fans, if they think about it, they're going to love it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney agreed on Monday to buy Marvel for $4 billion. [nN31433031] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Former Marvel executive Shirrel Rhoades said on Monday that some Marvel readers were worried the "comic books will get watered down in a Disney-like way." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But for Lee, that spells great things ahead for his creations, such as Thor, the Norse God of Thunder who will anchor a big-screen adaption in 2011. [nBNG188905]  The 86-year-old Lee is no longer involved in the day-to-day operations of the company he helped build into a comics titan from the unknown arm of a pulp-fiction publisher. These days he is the creative force behind his own media company, called POW! Entertainment, which itself has a business partnership with Disney. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In 2011, Marvel Entertainment plans to release the movie "Thor," based on a Stan Lee character borrowed from European mythology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I was trying to think of something that would be totally different. What could be bigger and even more powerful than the Hulk? And I figured why not a legendary god," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    To give Thor more rhetorical punch in the comics, Lee said he gave him dialogue borrowed from the Bible and Shakespeare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Gareb Shamus, CEO of Wizard Entertainment and the organizer of several comic-book conventions, said Lee remains a legend in the comic book world and he described meeting Lee to coming face-to-face with a character from the pages of a comic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It doesn't matter where he goes, anywhere around the world, he's the man that created some of your best friends," Shamus added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; editing by Edwin Chan and Andre Grenon) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((alex.dobuzinskis@thomsonreuters.com; 1 213-955-6781)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (please visit our entertainment blog via www.reuters.com or on blogs.reuters.com/fanfare/) Keywords: DISNEY/MARVEL LEE  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Aug 31 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has
accused the judge in a $27 billion environmental damage case in
Ecuador of misconduct and being involved in a bribery scheme
that Chevron said appears to involve Ecuador's government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. oil company said in a statement on Monday that it
would seek disqualification of Judge Juan Nunez after providing
Ecuadorean and U.S. authorities with secretly recorded video of
Nunez talking of ruling against Chevron later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the video, posted at its TexacoEcuador YouTube
channel here shows a
man at another meeting identifying himself as a representative
of Ecuador's ruling party discussing a $3 million bribe for
contracts, of which Nunez would get a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said two meetings with Nunez and two meetings with
purported party representative Patricio Garcia were recorded by
both Diego Borja, a local logistics contractor who has worked
for Chevron, and American Wayne Hansen, who has no relationship
with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No judge who has participated in meetings of the type
shown on these tapes could possibly deliver a legitimate
decision," Chevron Executive Vice President Charles James said
in the company's statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Ecuadorean government did not respond to requests for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the four meetings were recorded without its
knowledge, through small cameras in a watch owned by Borja and
a pen held by Hansen. Borja only brought the bribery scheme to
the company's attention in June, Chevron said in the
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said Borja and Hansen had been "pursuing business
opportunities" in Ecuador before the potential for remediation
work was brought to their attention and the meeting with Garcia
was arranged to discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said the two men had not
explained why they recorded the meetings, and he said the bribe
scheme had been "put on the table" prior to the meeting with
Garcia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The video of the two meetings with Nunez, who appears to be
the same Nunez who has appeared on television news coverage,
showed the judge discussing the long-running case, which had
been expected to conclude later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs have said Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001,
damaged their health by dumping billions of gallons of polluted
water in the jungle around where they live for more than two
decades before the company left Ecuador in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Karen Hinton, a Washington D.C.-based spokeswoman for the
Amazon Defense Coalition, which supports the plaintiffs, said 
the video showed Nunez had resisted the attempted bribe scheme
put to him by the former Chevron contractor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An appropriate investigation will determine whether the
allegations are true or if they are the product of a dirty
tricks campaign designed and financed by the company," Hinton
said in a statement released to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said Borja and Hansen first met with Nunez in May
after an initial meeting at Alianza Pais's Quito offices with
Garcia, who said he was a representative of the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garcia then arranged for Borja and Hansen to fly to Lago
Agrio, where the case is being heard, to see Nunez, and the two
men met Nunez again at a Quito hotel in June, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said neither man was paid, though the San Ramon,
California-based company said it had assisted Borja with
relocation expenses and other support because he and the
company feared for his safety and that of his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said it would not provide details about Borja's
relocation for security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has alerted authorities both in Ecuador and in the
United States, and both governments should investigate this
evidence in a serious and expeditious manner," the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which says it has faced a "trial lawyer"-led
campaign to force it to settle in the case, has long complained
of political interference in the Ecuador case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs, represented by U.S.-based lawyer Steven
Donziger, responded by pointing out that Texaco had pushed to
move the trial to Ecuador from the United States in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court said last
November that Chevron should pay $27 billion, including more
than $8 billion in unjust enrichment, which was far above the
previous damages estimate of up to $16 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has said it would fight what it expects to be an
adverse judgment, possibly in the United States, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While Chevron probably has no hope of a fair hearing in
the Ecuadorean legal system, it should have no trouble in an
impartial setting, and thus we see no plausible scenario under
which the plaintiffs would collect anything close to $27
billion," Raymond James analysts said in a note to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares closed 1 percent lower at $69.94 on Monday,
responding to a drop in crude oil prices.

Commences Class Action Lawsuit on Behalf of J.P. Jeanneret Associates Investors</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Lowey Dannenberg Cohen &amp; Hart, P.C. has filed a class action lawsuit in the
United States District Court, Southern District of New York, against defendants
J.P. Jeanneret Associates, Inc. ("Jeanneret Associates"), John P. Jeanneret and
Paul L. Perry (collectively, "Jeanneret"), Ivy Asset Management Corporation
("Ivy"), Ivy Asset Management LLC, Lawrence Simon, Howard Wohl, Adam L. Geiger,
Jeffrey R. Lindenbaum, John D. Rogers, Sean C. Simon, Kevin J. Bannon, Steven
Pisarkiewicz, Robert Meschi, Susan Rabinowitz, Michael Singer, Alan Chuang,
Gregory Van Inwegen, Sean Cumiskey, Stuart Davies, Peter Rose, Joseph Burns,
Mark Santero, Peter D. Noris, Farzine Hachemian, Scott E. Wennerholm, Jonathan
Little, Ronald P. O'Hanley, and Bank of New York Mellon Corporation
(collectively, the "Defendants"), on behalf of all persons, other than
Defendants, who, as a result of investment management/advisory services rendered
by Jeanneret Associates and/or Ivy, invested directly with Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities, LLC ("Madoff"), (the "Class") from January 1, 1996 to the
present (the "Class Period"), to recover damages caused by Defendants`
violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Employment Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), Investment Advisors Act of 1940, and common law
claims, including breach of fiduciary duties. 

The case is styled Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Local 267 et al., v. J.P. Jeanneret
Associates, Inc., et al. A copy of the complaint filed in this action is
available from the Court, or can be viewed on the Lowey Dannenberg Cohen &amp; Hart,
P.C. website at www.lowey.com.

The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, unbeknownst to Class
members, Defendants failed to perform the necessary due diligence that they were
being compensated to perform as investment advisors, managers and fiduciaries,
and proximately caused millions of dollars in losses by placing the Class`
investment assets in Madoff entities. Defendants either knew or were reckless in
not knowing that assets placed with Madoff were at risk because his enterprise
was a massive Ponzi scheme. Defendants ignored numerous red flags, including the
abnormally high and stable positive investment results reportedly achieved by
Madoff regardless of market conditions; inconsistencies between publicly
available financial information and the purported amounts that Madoff was
trading and managing for clients; and the fact that Madoff was audited by a
small, obscure accounting firm. 

Jeanneret issued statements in, among other documents, investment management
agreements, that were false and misleading because they stated that Jeanneret
and Ivy would conduct thorough due diligence with respect to assets under
Jeanneret`s management. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Ivy was Jeanneret`s
investment consultant and that Ivy shared in Jeanneret`s investment management
fees in violation of ERISA. Defendants Jeanneret and Ivy failed to perform the
represented due diligence and oversight, and abdicated their fiduciary duties to
the investors by entrusting the Class` assets with Madoff. 

If you invested in Madoff as a result of investment management/advisory services
rendered by Jeanneret Associates and/or Ivy during the Class Period, you may
request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff by October 30, 2009. 

A "lead plaintiff" is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class
members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead plaintiff,
the Court must determine that the class member`s claim is typical of the claims
of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the
class. Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve
as lead plaintiffs. Your ability to share in any recovery, however, is not
affected by your decision on whether or not to seek appointment as a lead
plaintiff. You may retain Lowey Dannenberg Cohen &amp; Hart, or other counsel of
your choice, to serve as your counsel in this action.

almost $4 billion to American Express Co (AXP.N) and $2.75
billion to Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) after the credit

Here are highlights from Friday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Bebe Beats Zacks Estimate

Women`s apparel and accessories retailer Bebe Stores Inc. (Nasdaq:BEBE) recently
reported fourth-quarter results and guided to a bleak first quarter amid a
turbulent environment and slumping sales. 

The company`s quarterly earnings excluding one-time items came in at 4 cents a
share. While it comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of one cent,
earnings fell drastically from 18 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. 

On a reported basis, Bebe delivered breakeven earnings, including employee
acquisition and termination costs, asset write-downs and write-offs. Management
expects earnings before write-offs to be between breakeven and a loss of 5 cents
a share in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. 

The slump in demand has prompted management to lower inventories, close stores
and reduce wages to mitigate costs. Bebe closed eight stores in fiscal year 2009
and plans to close up to 13 more in fiscal year 2010. 

CRM Opens Up Force.com

In an effort to expand the reach of Force.com, Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM)
recently announced the new Force.com value-added reseller (VAR) program. As per
this new program, the value-added resellers of Force.com will help their clients
to develop and run applications on Force.com. Force.com basically enables
companies to develop and run applications for public and private use, by taking
help from Salesforce`s cloud computing platform. 

We believe this is an additional sales channel that the company has created for
their Force.com sites. VARs are reputed software consultants, who will act as
channel partners and resell the application developed in Force.com to other
companies. We believe that the technical knowledge and customer winning ability
of the VARs will add value and generate additional business for Salesforce. 

This apart, the most important factor in this case is pricing and Salesforce
will charge VARs $7.50 per user per month. This gives the VARs enough scope to
make profit, as they can determine their own pricing after having a mark up on
cost. The company has determined this pricing strategy very smartly as it will
get a fixed rent from the value-added resellers, although the VARs have to lure
the customers by making the pricing attractive at the same time offering quality
services to them. 

This is an intelligent business decision by the company, which indicates that
the company is in the process of expanding its cloud computing business and
opening it to outside partners. This process will help the company increase its
customer base, at the same time helping it to deal with competition from big
players like International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), Microsoft Corp.
(Nasdaq:MSFT) and Google Inc. (Nasdaq:GOOG).

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Statement from Karen Hinton, spokeswoman from Amazon Defense Coalition:

"The legal and scientific case against Chevron in Ecuador stands on the merits.
The court-ordered damages assessment, ordered by a previous judge, found that
100% of Chevron`s former sites are contaminated with life-threatening toxins. On
that basis, we believe Chevron is now liable for significant damages. 

"We understand the seriousness of Chevron`s allegations. An appropriate
investigation will determine whether the allegations are true or if they are the
product of a dirty tricks campaign designed and financed by the company. It is
clear from Chevron`s information that a former Chevron contractor appears to
have been complicit in executing a bribery scheme involving an alleged official
of a political party. It also seems clear from a review of Chevron`s transcripts
- whose authenticity has yet to be verified - that the judge continually
resisted the attempted bribery scheme put to him by a former Chevron contractor.


"It is the experience of the plaintiffs that Chevron has a long history of
corrupt acts in Ecuador to evade accountability for its reckless environmental
practices. The video seems to fit squarely into Chevron`s historic pattern of
corruption in Ecuador. Ultimately, an investigation will determine the facts and
Chevron`s role in this episode. 

"If an investigation shows there is a problem, there are judicial mechanisms to
address procedural problems in Ecuador that will preserve the integrity of the
trial process. We have full confidence in the Ecuadorian judicial system, as
does Chevron, given the case is taking place in Ecuador at the company`s
request."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 31 (Reuters) - Standard  Poor's on Monday
said it may cut its debt rating on the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N),
citing concerns that its acquisition of Marvel Entertainment
MVL.N for $4 billion will leave it with higher debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney on Monday agreed to buy Marvel in its largest
acquisition since the $7.6 billion purchase of Pixar in 2006.
The purchase will be funded with a mixture of cash and stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In our view, Disney may to need to issue debt to
supplement its cash for this transaction," SP said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rating agency said it is concerned that Disney's
leverage will remain high for an extended period because of the
potential issuance to buy Marvel, the company's plan to buy
back the stock portion of the deal within one year, and the
potential for declines in earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP's long-term corporate credit rating on Disney is now A,
the sixth-highest investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's Ebitda has already been declining at most of its
businesses because of the recession's impact on ad revenue,
theme park attendance and retail sales, SP said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company has recently reduced its balance sheet debt
from a peak recorded at the end of calendar 2008, but we are
concerned that the Marvel acquisition will increase Disney's
debt without concomitant growth in Ebitda," SP said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Earlier on Monday, Moody's Investors Service affirmed
Disney's rating, saying that although the acquisition will
increase leverage, strong free cash flow will allow Disney to
reduce debt again within two years. Moody's rates Disney's
senior unsecured debt A2, its sixth-highest rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch affirmed Disney's A rating, citing strong free cash
flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dena Aubin)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed all ratings of The Walt Disney Company (Disney) and
subsidiaries following today's announcement that the company will acquire Marvel
Entertainment Inc. (Marvel) for $4 billion in cash and stock. The Rating Outlook
is Stable. 

While Disney had $3.1 billion of cash at June 30, 2009 ($2.7 billion excluding
Hong Kong and Euro Disney), Fitch would expect at least a portion of the cash
component to be debt-funded, resulting in slightly higher gross leverage metrics
with gross leverage potentially exceeding 2.0 times (x) by year-end. Net
leverage excluding non-recourse debt should remain below 1.5x pro forma for this
transaction. Similar to the Pixar acquisition in 2006, Fitch would expect Disney
to use free cash flow over the next year to repurchase its shares to offset the
equity component of the purchase price. The company will have excess free cash
flow that can be dedicated for this purpose without having a material impact on
leverage. 

The Marvel transaction gives Disney the rights to a catalog of over 5,000
characters including Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man,
and Wolverine, among others. Approximately 20% of Marvel's revenues have
historically come from comic book publishing with the remaining 80% from
licensing and film production. The company has made a push over the last two
years to move away from licensing its characters for film and directly into
in-house production. Disney has done a good job over the last several years of
leveraging its brands/characters across all aspects of the business: TV, movies,
music, consumer products and other licensing opportunities. Fitch would expect
similar opportunities to exist with the Marvel catalog, however execution risk
exists as some of the Marvel characters can be outside of the mold of
traditional Disney characters. 

While some of Marvel's more popular characters have already been licensed for
movies, the catalog is deep and might be able to produce additional popular
characters for the movie window. Current films in various stages of
development/production include Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America, and The
Avengers. Importantly, additional development also exists for the TV market.
Fitch believes Disney will use the library to build-out programming on its
Disney XD channel to specifically target the young male demographic age 8 to 14.
The Marvel catalog is very comprehensive, covering numerous character
personalities that should be able to be developed long-term for the XD channel.
Programming will compete with Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and the new joint
venture between Discovery Communications and Hasbro which owns the rights to
characters such as G.I Joe and Transformers, among others. 

Disney's ratings continue to reflect the company's leading market positions in
core businesses, unique brand franchises, substantial cable network carriage
revenues, and strong credit metrics. Credit concerns center on the cyclical
volatility of its theme parks and resorts, studio and broadcast networks
businesses, as well as the maturation of the DVD business. The Stable Outlook
takes into account the company's current liquidity as well as Fitch's
expectations related to the overall long-term secular profile of the company's
businesses. 

For additional information please see Fitch' press release on Disney dated July
31, 2009, available at www.fitchratings.com. 

The following ratings are affirmed with a Stable Outlook: 

The Walt Disney Company 

--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1'; 

--Commercial paper at 'F1'.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said it plans to buy Marvel Entertainment Inc for $4 billion in a deal that would add characters like Iron Man, Spider-Man, and the Fantastic Four to its entertainment empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARVIND BHATIA, ANALYST, STERNE, AGEE  LEACH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My initial reaction is that this is a positive. a win-win situation for both companies. On the surface, it looks like a great merger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're (Marvel shareholders) getting a good deal in my opinion. The CEO of the company, Isaac Perlmutter, is also the largest shareholder of the company. From that standpoint, we think the chances of this deal going through are pretty high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVID JOYCE, ANALYST, MILLER TABAK  CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Marvel brings 5,000 characters that they can monetize over multiple platforms. It's a strategy that they have done since their start. So I think that it's definitely in line with the Disney strategy. That's one positive aspect of the strategic rationale here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This helps give Disney more important exposure to the young male demographic that they have sort of lost some ground with in recent years. When you look at the kind of TV shows on their cable networks, and the Disney consumer products line for the princess and fairies -- the Hannah Montana kind of stuff -- it shows that they have a lot of strength addressing young female demographic. The broad popularity, as well as the nature of these Marvel comics, I think helps it to be additive to Disney's demographic exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The last big deal was Pixar. Disney is still generating a lot of free cash flow. That's why its $30 a share in cash. It does seem to be pretty full price for Marvel. But once it's integrated into Disney's production and distribution platform, I think the synergies will help make that price more palatable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On theme parks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be a long tail of unwinding of various types of partnerships that Marvel has with other Disney competitors. It's not unusual for competitors to share some risk and do some deals together...There is going to be a lot of industry cross-pollination deals that will unwind over time, but nothing immediate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JASON BAZINET, ANALYST, CITIGROUP, IN A RESEARCH NOTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think deal makes sense strategically...It will help Disney target the male demographic aged 18 and 35 years old, a group that it currently has limited appeal to. Disney will also be able to monetize Marvel's brands across its entire ecosystem (TV, parks, movies, consumer products, video games, etc.)"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our quick calculation suggests the deal will be about $0.07 to $0.10 accretive to Disney."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by John Tilak in Bangalore and Franklin Paul in New York, compiled by Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese banks are expected to seek investment opportunities in Taiwan, hoping to apply new government guidelines and tap the busy cross-strait commerce, J.P. Morgan's (JPM.N) Brian Gu told Reuters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opportunities exist in the other direction too, as China represents an excellent chance for Taiwan's financial industry to expand onshore, Gu, the Greater China MA head at JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), said at the China Investment Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at the recent Taiwanese regulations around mainland investment guidelines, financials are one of the encouraged sectors," Gu said. "It's conceivable that Chinese banks can look at that market as a way to expand the Greater China concept and tap into cross-strait commerce."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gu cautioned that China-Taiwan investing involves more political considerations than economic ones. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since 1949, when Mao Zedong's forces won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to the island. Beijing has vowed to bring Taiwan under its rule, by force if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing-Taiwan relations have recently thawed, leading some bankers to see potential deal opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is definitely strategic rationale for that, it just needs to be handled very carefully," Gu said at the summit, held at the Reuters office in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to natural resource deals in Australia, China is also eyeing investments in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gu said that China MA advisory is a business that has steadily grown in the last five years, unlike similar banking units in other parts of the world that ride market ups and downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at cross-border deal volume, I don't think it correlates significantly with the A-share market," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is driven by two factors, he said: One is that China acquisitions typically involve cash deals and not stock swaps. The other is that the financing market in China, backed largely by state banks, is more detached from stock market movements and corporate confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though not unscathed by the financial crisis that brought Wall Street to its knees, J.P. Morgan has emerged from the mess ahead of most of its peers. A combination of factors has allowed the bank to distance itself from rivals at a time when hopes are high that the global economy is recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Asia, excluding Japan, J.P. Morgan ranked second in the 2008 MA league table category for fees from completed deals. Thomson Reuters data estimates the bank pulled in $120.3 million in fees in the region last year, behind Morgan Stanley's $137.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that same category for China only, J.P. Morgan was also second behind Morgan Stanley, with an estimated $30.9 million in fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the deals Gu has participated in are China Unicom's (0762.HK) $56 billion stock merger with China Netcom and Sinosteel's $1.3 billion unsolicited cash offer for Midwest -- China's first hostile takeover of an Australian listed company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan's financial sector has long been thought to be ripe for dealmaking. The window may be opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As political and business ties across the strait get warmer, more Taiwanese people move to major cities in mainland China for jobs or investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are an estimated half million Taiwanese people living in Shanghai, and demand for cross-strait financial services is growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan's financial institutions are also interested in expanding into the mainland China market. In early August, Fubon Financial Holding (2881.TW), parent of Taiwan's No. 2 insurer, said it would participate in a fund-raising plan by China's Xiamen Commercial Bank by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Chinese banks to go on an acquisition spree, Gu says, it's always a question of whether the regulators and the companies can make a judgment call and say "the worst is over, it's time for us to make bold moves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other question centers on integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For any MA, they need the confidence that they aren't getting into anything that's messy," Gu said. They have to demonstrate strong integration and a capability to absorb those assets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by George Chen and Donald Durfee)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Features Enable Instant and Disruption-Free Migration to Windows 7
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Virtual Computer Inc. (VMworld Booth #1940), the company redefining PC
management through virtualization, today released a new version of NxTop that
supports Microsoft`s latest desktop and server platforms. Available immediately
through Virtual Computer`s NxTop Now! program, the new release enables
organizations to begin a seamless migration to Microsoft`s Windows 7 operating
system. In addition, Virtual Computer has integrated NxTop Center, its
centralized management console, with Windows Server 2008 and Hyper-V. The result
is unprecedented simplicity for deploying NxTop while providing Virtual Computer
with a platform to accelerate innovation of the NxTop product line. 

"With the success of Windows Server 2008 and Hyper-V evident in our customer
base and the launch of Windows 7 just around the corner, Virtual Computer has
aligned with Microsoft and its platforms to drive innovation into the desktop
virtualization market," said Virtual Computer president and CEO, Dan McCall.
"Unlike VDI solutions which are difficult to set up and expensive to deploy,
NxTop is a breeze to implement using existing infrastructure. And, with NxTop`s
ability to simultaneously run two operating systems on the user`s PC, we are
lowering the bar for IT departments to roll out Windows 7 across their user
base." 

Windows 7: Instant Upgrade

Organizations have a variety of concerns when deploying a new PC operating
system including determining how long the upgrade will take, the near-term
impact on productivity, and how to handle user training. By deploying Windows 7
with NxTop many of these traditional concerns are reduced or eliminated. 

Point-and-Click Deployment

A simple point-and-click operation in NxTop Center deploys Windows 7 to all or
any subset of users. This deployment is non-destructive to the user`s current
running instance of XP or Vista and includes features such as:

* Automatic injection of the user`s profile and preferences from their current
version of Windows. 
* "Behind the scenes" preparation of the Windows 7 image while the PC is in use.

* Notification of successful deployment through NxTop Center`s event logging
system.

No Down-Time, Self-Paced Migration

Because Windows 7 is deployed on the same hardware as the current operating
system, users experience no disruption to their computing environment. For
training purposes, users can run their old OS simultaneously with Windows 7
using a simple hot-key combination to switch between the two environments. Once
the user is comfortable with Windows 7, they can move permanently to the new
system. Administrators then have the option of removing the old operating system
or leaving it in place to handle any application issues that may occur during
the transition cycle for their organization. 

One Image, Thousands of Users

The upgrade to Windows 7 provides organizations with the perfect opportunity to
upgrade their image management capabilities. A core feature of NxTop allows the
desktop administrator to create a single master image of Windows 7 and deploy it
to all users. Any future updates and administrative changes are performed once
on the master image and automatically applied to all users using the same
"behind the scenes" model as the original deployment. All operations are
optimized for WAN environments, transferring the smallest amount of data
possible. 

NxTop Now! Thirty Minutes to a Better PC Management Platform

Using Windows Server 2008 and Hyper-V, Virtual Computer has cut the installation
time for NxTop Center in half. System administrators run a simple installation
wizard on their Windows Server 2008 system that automatically deploys and
configures Virtual Computer`s complete management framework. By pairing this
step with a simple CD or network-based installation of the NxTop Engine client
hypervisor, IT administrators will have an end-to-end desktop virtualization
platform up and running in thirty minutes or less. This is a sharp contrast to
server-centric virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) deployments, which can take
days or even weeks to set up and require large and expensive data-center
build-outs prior to deployment. 

Centralized Management/Distributed Execution: A Smarter Approach to Desktop
Virtualization

Beyond time and cost savings, NxTop`s model of centralized management and
distributed execution provides a number of key features that overcome VDI
weaknesses.

* Utilization of local computing hardware for resource intensive applications
and user-attached peripherals. This includes high performance graphics and no
discernable change to the user`s computing environment when running as a single
virtual machine. 
* Support for desktop and laptop computers all running the same master image of
the operating system. 
* Minimal data-center investment and the ability to run on current PC hardware
in the field. 
* Smooth scalability curve without significant spikes in data center expenses as

"The management and security benefits of desktop virtualization were out of our
reach before NxTop, since we have a highly mobile workforce, and building out an
extensive data center footprint that could only support a small subset of our
desktop users was not financially feasible," said John Cook, systems
administrator at Partnership for Strong Families of Gainesville, FL. "NxTop
gives us the ability to achieve better management and security for both
stationary and mobile users using a standard Windows Server 2008 back-end and
the exact same level of PC hardware investment we had budgeted for."

&lt;p&gt;Xirrus Solves Microsoft Events` Dilemma of Connecting Thousands of Simultaneous
Users in a Single Conference Room with High Performance, High Density Wi-Fi 
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Xirrus, the Wi-Fi "Power-Play" that delivers the most coverage, bandwidth, and
throughput in the industry, announces the purchase and deployment of their
high-performance Wi-Fi Array by Microsoft CMG Events &amp; Studios for use at their
various events, including Professional Developers Conferences, Worldwide Partner
Conferences, TechEd, etc. The Xirrus Wi-Fi solution was the only Wi-Fi
architecture found to deliver the necessary density and coverage for thousands
of attendees, and at roughly half the cost of previously tried architectures. 

Speaking about the Wi-Fi challenges, John O`Gara, Group Manager for Microsoft`s
CMG Events &amp; Studios, explained in a recent interview&#8230; 

"When we deploy wireless our big problems and challenges are that we are trying
to cover large amounts of space with high density - we`ve got the ultimate
wireless challenges in that we`ve got huge capacity in certain areas, but we
also need to cover the entire facility - that`s pretty much been the holy grail.
It`s not terribly difficult to cover a large space, but it`s been really
challenging to cover a large space with high density&#8230; and when I say high
density, I`m talking theatre-style seating with seven to 12 thousand people&#8230; and
at least half of them should be able to open up their laptops or turn on some
other mobile device and have a good wireless experience." 

"We had an opportunity to partner with Xirrus at our Professional Developers
Conference to solve something we hadn`t yet been able to solve, which is the
high capacity, high density four, five or six thousand people in one room
problem. We have tried for years, but hadn`t yet succeeded - Xirrus partnered up
with us&#8230; and delivered 100%. Never had any issues." 

"The other advantage to the [Xirrus] system&#8230; is we are able to decrease the
amount of access points that are deployed roughly by a factor of two-thirds&#8230; in
a lot of our facilities we have to pay for the wiring and the drops to
accommodate wireless deployments, so this is an immediate cost savings to the
company and to our events." 

"Where we`ve really won here is we`ve increased our capacity and solved a
problem that we`ve never been able to solve and we`ve been able to do all the
other wireless needs at the event at somewhere under half of the cost for the
facility side of things as we have in the past."

&lt;p&gt;El premio es un reconocimiento a la empresa "socia" con sede en Atlanta por sus
pr&#225;cticas relacionadas con la diversidad
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company entreg&#243; su premio "Living the Values" (LVA) al estudio
jur&#237;dico King &amp; Spalding L.L.P con sede en Atlanta. El premio, ya en su segundo
a&#241;o de trayectoria, fue creado por la empresa para reconocer y honrar cada a&#241;o
al estudio jur&#237;dico con base en los Estados Unidos que trabaja con la empresa y
que mejor demuestra un compromiso con la diversidad mediante soluciones
innovadoras y creativas que se ajustan a los valores de diversidad de The
Coca-Cola Company. Alex Cummings, vicepresidente ejecutivo y director
administrativo de The Coca-Cola Company, entreg&#243; el premio a la presidenta del
comit&#233; de diversidad de King &amp; Spalding, Lovita T. Tandy, en The World of
Coca-Cola durante la cena de premiaci&#243;n presentada por Geoff Kelly, asesor
general y vicepresidente senior de The Coca-Cola Company. 

"Aprovechar la diversidad es mucho m&#225;s que s&#243;lo uno de los valores fundamentales
de nuestra empresa. Es un imperativo comercial para nosotros. Por este motivo,
es necesario que reconozcamos las acciones positivas de aquellos que est&#225;n
progresando en esta &#225;rea de importancia esencial. Felicitamos a King &amp; Spalding
por su notable liderazgo, sus mejores pr&#225;cticas y su compromiso de elevar su
desempe&#241;o relacionado con la diversidad", afirm&#243; Cummings. 

El premio LVA fue anunciado por primera vez en 2006 por Geoff Kelly, con la
promesa de iniciar el primer certamen en 2007. El primer premio LVA fue
entregado el 8 de abril de 2008 a la empresa Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon L.L.P. (SHB),
por demostrar su compromiso con la diversidad a trav&#233;s del desarrollo de
soluciones innovadoras y creativas. 

Para el segundo premio LVA, en diciembre de 2008, se distribuy&#243; un cuestionario
entre los 32 estudios jur&#237;dicos de los Estados Unidos "socios" de la empresa,
donde se les solicit&#243; una descripci&#243;n de sus pr&#225;cticas y valores que apoyan e
impulsan la diversidad y la inclusi&#243;n en las siguientes &#225;reas:

* Compromiso de la gerencia superior de la empresa con la diversidad a trav&#233;s de
sistemas establecidos para medir el progreso y la responsabilidad. 
* Representaci&#243;n de minor&#237;as y mujeres en la empresa de manera general y en el
liderazgo de la empresa. 
* &#201;xito en la contrataci&#243;n, el desarrollo, el ascenso y la retenci&#243;n de
empleados de minor&#237;as y mujeres dentro de la empresa. 
* Acuerdos de asociaci&#243;n creativos con empresas pertenecientes a mujeres o
minor&#237;as. 
* Rigurosidad en la programaci&#243;n de la diversidad en toda la empresa, de manera
que la diversidad, como objetivo, goce de pertenencia y participaci&#243;n.

Las respuestas de las empresas fueron comparadas con las mejores pr&#225;cticas en
cada &#225;rea. King &amp; Spalding obtuvo la mejor puntuaci&#243;n general. 

"La diversidad es y seguir&#225; siendo un elemento fundamental de los valores y la
cultura empresarial de The Coca-Cola Company", expres&#243; Kelly. "Me siento
emocionado de trabajar para una empresa que se compromete a ofrecer a sus
empleados la posibilidad de tener grandes proyectos y contribuir con trabajos
importantes. El departamento legal conf&#237;a en el trabajo dentro del marco de los
objetivos de diversidad de la empresa, para crear una iniciativa que defienda un
ciclo continuo de estrategias, gesti&#243;n y mediciones en relaci&#243;n con la
diversidad para nuestra funci&#243;n. Todos tenemos la responsabilidad de identificar
las &#225;reas que deben mejorar para continuar con el cambio. Como parte de la
iniciativa de LVA, nos complace reconocer la contribuci&#243;n de King &amp; Spalding
para promover la diversidad y crear un valor a largo plazo para todos aquellos
con quienes trabajan." 

En un esfuerzo por impulsar el cambio, King &amp; Spalding ha hecho que la
diversidad sea una parte integral de la cultura de la empresa. King &amp; Spalding
se compromete a captar, retener y promover la diversidad en toda la empresa, y
se esfuerza por crear un entorno colaborativo que se beneficia de compartir las
experiencias, las ideas y las cualidades &#250;nicas que cada uno de sus abogados
aporta a la empresa. Debido a que la diversidad es uno de los valores
principales de la empresa, &#233;sta se encuentra respaldada por un comit&#233; estable
que gu&#237;a los esfuerzos de diversidad e inclusi&#243;n de la empresa. 

"The Coca-Cola Company es una de las empresas globales m&#225;s diversas del mundo y
King &amp; Spalding se complace en recibir su premio "Living the Values", afirm&#243;
Tandy. "King &amp; Spalding se compromete a mantener un entorno inclusivo y diverso,
y si bien este recorrido est&#225; lleno de desaf&#237;os, estamos totalmente
comprometidos con ello como parte de nuestro plan estrat&#233;gico a largo plazo."
